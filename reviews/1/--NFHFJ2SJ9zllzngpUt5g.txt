nope. the restaurant looked nice, but felt dirty.  we watched the hostess pick few pieces of food off of the table with her fingers (gross), but never wiped it off. the food was not so great. the guac was clearly not fresh...it was bland and tasted like pre-packaged goo. the margarita was ok, but relatively flavorless for 9$. salsa was definitely not housemade. you get the idea. cool atmosphere, but we won't be back.
