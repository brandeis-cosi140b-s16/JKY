We came here for the Nachos, which many people seem to order and my friends had seen it and couldn't stop thinking about them. Well I have to say, what a disappointment!! We ordered the 4 cheese Nacho platter (we have a vegetarian in the group) and asked them to add black beans, which they charge extra for! The nachos come out with very little pico de gallo, and literally a sprinkle of black beans. The good thing was the waiter came out with a bowl of more black beans b/c he realized how very little we were given (so yes A for service). 

The nachos were just not good. One of the 4 cheeses tasted like Velveeta. I think for this price the nachos need more substance such as jalapenos, onions, pico de gallo, salsa, beans... 

Oh and another think this place has pretty bad smell in certain parts of the restaurant (poor sewage perhaps?)
