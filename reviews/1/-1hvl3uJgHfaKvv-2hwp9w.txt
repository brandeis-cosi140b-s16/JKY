Recently just went here after a year of refusing to in hopes that the customer service as well as quality of food would be improved. Sadly I was disappointed. Upon arriving it took several minutes of giving our order multiple times for them to get it correct on the screen. Then pulling up to the window we again waited several minutes to be helped. Meanwhile, could see all four workers inside joking and eating, and when they saw us they made sure to move out of our view to continue talking for several more minutes. When one worker finally came to the window, we were asked if we even ordered. In which my husband had to then have our order taken again. After ordering for what seemed the tenth time we then waited another 15 minutes to recieve a deal d and bean burrito. All the while watching the workers make our food without gloves. We were horrified. To say the least if I could give this place any negative of a review I would. We will not be returning to this location!
