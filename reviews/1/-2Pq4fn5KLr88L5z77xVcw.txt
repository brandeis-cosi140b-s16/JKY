We went here based on all the positive reviews. I should have lowered my expectations. We ordered chips & guac and several 99 cent tacos (fish, beef & chicken). The tacos had a hard shell which I actually like and were topped with a TON of shredded lettuce and shredded cheddar cheese. I mistakenly thought this food would resemble authentic Mexican, it did not. Cheddar cheese does not belong in the kitchen of ANY Mexican restaurant.

The beef tacos were 80% lettuce, 10% cheddar cheese and 10% meat. Seriously, where's the beef??? They give you more meat on the chicken taco. I decided not to eat my remaining beef taco, instead I gave it to my husband who ditched the lettuce, cheese and shell and added the beef to his already skimpy taco. The food was along the same line as Taco Bell. I don't dislike Taco Bell, I just prefer real Mexican food.

The guac was not bad, it was also covered in cheddar cheese.
