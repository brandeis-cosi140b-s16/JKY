Salsa, chips and water were great and got to the table fast. 20 minutes later they took our order. 40 min later we inquired about our food (appetizers and one entree) and the waiter forgot to put it in. We left. Great potential though - patio was pleasant with a fire pit, guy singing Motown, grass nearby for the kids to play on. Guess we should wait for Omar to be working to attempt again.
