I took my 86 year old Mother there for a special Sunday treat.  There was a private party of over 100 in another room going and the place was busy. I expected to wait...However, a full hour later my mom's chimichanga was delivered with the promise that my dish will be right out.  30 minutes later my dish arrived 1.5 hours ater our arrival...two oil drenched soggy cheese enchiladas...gross!   I sent it back.
I never complain...My Mom is my testimonial but I HAD to speak to the manager...GUESS WHAT?  No Manager on duty...What restaurant in the valley would have a private party that size with the regular busy Sunday rush not have an MOD(MANAGER ON DUTY).  If it were my restaurant I would have personally been there to oversee and make sure EVERYONE was was happy. The chimi was not prepared as I remembered.  We did get it to go...I was going to give it to my dogs but after looking at it when we got home decided to throw it in the trash...SO GREASY...not fit for my dog.  I feel so bad that my elderly Mother tried to eat it.  I spent $30.00 on the most awful restaurant experience ever....one Chimi combo and a double tequilla on the rocks....Highway robbery.   No apologies.  No trying to make it positive...DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR HARD EARNED MONEY!!!! go to PEDRO"S .5 miles east on Glendale.  They are awesome...It is worth the wait..I am still feeling the grease in my mouth from La Basura...I mean La Perla.
