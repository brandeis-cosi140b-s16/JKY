What's going on? I've been coming here close to a year and the last month or so the service for take out/ friendly service has been horrible! Upon asking for your dish, it just sit there while the cast register guy takes forever and the food is cold! There is a line backing up and there is no sense of urgency! Hope this gets resolved fast! All the other chipotle restaurants service is fast friendly and your meal is hot.
