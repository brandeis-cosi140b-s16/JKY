The worst mexican food i ever tasted. The beef tacos where flavorless. I ordered some dish that was to be beef with onions and peppers and deep fried. It came out very greasy with no beef inside just soggy onions. This is the worst place ever. People please do not waste your money. This place sucks and the queso is horrible. The sevice sucks as well. The tacos at taco bell taste better than this place. What a disappointment to REAL mexican food.
