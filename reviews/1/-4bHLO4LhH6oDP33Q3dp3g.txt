Keep returning to this joint for the same problems repeatedly..poor customer service..unlike the Mexican employees @ Robertos.they must be very unhappy with their jobs. Very poor cust.serv.worst cold and Luke - warm food----ok went in @ 12:45 noon. Why in the heck would an establishment be totally empty at Lunch time????? counter girl acknowledged me but didn't speak english. asked her for the 3 taco dinner. she turned and asked 2 employess that were standing very close together chopping food or vegetables, she said in Spanish ":Do we have any ground beef ? 3x, finally one guy brings over a lil bowl of very old cold ground beef, the stingy heffer scoops up 1 lil teaspoon per taco shell. I get home "no fucking meat! wheres the beef??? this is why you don't have frigging customers at lunch time.... Close down and go out of business please....another waste of $12.00.......
