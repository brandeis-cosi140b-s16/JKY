ECK ECK ECK! This place is a shame to latin food. It's just a bigger version of a run down taco bell and honestly TB has these guys by the balls. I'm from a Latin family and taking my mother and grandmother here was EMBARRASSING! I give 1 star because i cant give 0 and I do admit I liked the outside dining option BUUUUT the food was disgusting and I believe any one who takes this food they serve as acceptable has never had true Latin food or even good food. They should be serving this mush out of a truck stop. No I would bot recommend this to my enemies.
