Be prepared to be overcharged. In addition to paying an arm and a leg for a breakfast burrito, I also had to deal with one of rudest staff members that works there! I would have kept paying their outrageous prices (I am a fan of supporting local businesses), but after being so rudely mistreated by their main staff member, I have not and will not visit again! I would also discourage others from going there, until Mangos rethinks their prices.. and hires new and friendlier (English-speaking) staff!
