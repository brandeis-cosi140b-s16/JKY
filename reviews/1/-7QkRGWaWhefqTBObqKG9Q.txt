These people who believe this place is reasonable in price is nuts. You get salty chicken and greasy fat for $20 definitely not worth a trip back?  
I remember El Pollo loco being tasty and healthy with lots of wonderful fresh salsa to choose from. Now the salsa is watered down and the guacamole taste like crsp.
Hope they lower the price and stop ripping people off.
