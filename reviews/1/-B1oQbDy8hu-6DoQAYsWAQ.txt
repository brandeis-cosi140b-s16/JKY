I am very embarrassed I ate here. So much so I didn't even photograph because anyone would think this was just a hate review. I will start with my iced Tea.

I went to the iced tea dispenser and got splashed in the belly with cold iced tea. The manager just laughed when she saw saw iced tea hit me in the stomach  but she did wipe it off the floor.... (yeah)

I thought the packaged salsa looked better than the salsa bar salsa because the salsa bar salsa looked like it was just frozen tomatoes just brought out.

The  chicken in my salad was so dry I don't think anybody body would come back for trying chicken here. (In the salad anyway)

And the tomatoes seemed like thawed  grainy frozen tomatoes and the dressing was just Mayo with a little green stuff in it.

It was very bad food....sorry
