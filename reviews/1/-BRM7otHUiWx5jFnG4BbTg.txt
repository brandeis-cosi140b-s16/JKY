I took my family here on 3 occasions I thought it might have been off days..in each experience our food was cold and so spicy  hot we could barley eat , the service was rude and we waited a very long time without acknowledgement to even be greeted.i have  a 3 chance rule to visit restaurants and we will not be going back.
