Stopped in for lunch today with my girlfriend on Valentine's day of all days. They had a sign at the entrance saying the restaurant is closed during remodel. The lounge was open for lunch which was a good thing. So we sat at a table and waited for the waitress. Just like every other restaurant she asked what we wanted to drink & etc. The waitress was very nice and helpful. On yelp it stated they offered a full menu at lunch but they didn't because the kitchen was being remodeled too. That was ok, but there wasn't anything to exciting on the menu, a few appetizers and 3 lunch items.  We started with a cheese crisp which was good. Nothing too hard about that. My girlfriend ordered a Mexican pizza with carne asada and I ordered a green chile burro with carne asada, rice and black beans. Food came out promptly. First thing we noticed was the meat on the Mexican pizza was ground beef not carne asada. So we sent it back and like I said before the waitress was great. They quickly remade it with the correct meat. Both dishes look good, until we started eating. This is where it gets bad! The pizza didn't have much flavor and my dish wasn't much better. The beans and green sauce I ordered tasted like it was out of a can. The rice tasted like it was the rice dishes you can get at the grocery store. "Riceoroni". Really disappointed with lunch today and we won't be going back.
