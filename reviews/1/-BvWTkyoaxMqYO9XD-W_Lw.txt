This place had closed at a different location and opened recently at this location. This location has had several different types of restaurants mostly Asian. As each new place opened no updates were done to the old dirty rundown walls, carpets, booths, etc. And Halopeno's unfortunately did not think cleaning, painting, repairing, and updating mattered either. The walls are dirty as are the carpet. The booth table tops are worn and chipped. The booth seats are worn and torn. It is the same old worn stuff the past several failed restaurants had in their place. If this is how they take care of and present what the public can see I hate to think how dirty the area are that we can't see, like where they cook our food. And let's talk about the food. Chips appeared out of a bag. Salsa was forgettable. The food, I had a Burrito and my wife had Chili Relleno. Neither of us wanted to finish our meal. With so many Mexican restaurants with environments that will enhance your dining experience instead of ruin your appetite and have you wonder if you might get food poisoning, why go here. And really, the food although not terrible, was just OK. Filberto's just across the street that is a drive through has much better food. There is absolutely no excuse for a restaurant to open in such a run down dirty condition.
