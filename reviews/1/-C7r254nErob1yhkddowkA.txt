I go to this location all the time, and have never had a problem. 

All I can say about my experience last night is 2 words "RAW CHICKEN" 

I saw the girl scoop a piece of raw chicken into my bowl and when I questioned her on it she says yea that is undercooked isn't it! 

How gross!!! 

I will not be going to this location for a long time!
