There were 3 people ahead of me in line. I waited 15 minutes to order my salad. When it was finally my turn the guy said "just one second". I waited at least ten seconds. He wasn't ready to take my order as he was making burritos for someone not in the building (a phone order perhaps). Since I gave him ten times the time he requested I left. No need to educate ignorant people with how to measure time. Good food, sad service.
