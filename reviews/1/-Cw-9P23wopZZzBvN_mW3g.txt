Didn't appreciate the poor customer service & the inability to properly fold a burrito @ this location. The rice was undercooked & felt like hard seeds in my mouth. The steak was very chewy & reminded me of jerky. The server was also chewing gum while preparing my food - gross & not OK. Oh, I almost forgot that I came @ a very inconvenient time for the staff because even though I was the only customer, I had the nerve to interrupt their gossip session. I will definitely be contacting corporate about my experience because I'm sure I can find a much better overpriced burrito elsewhere. I'm upset that I don't have the option to give 0 stars.
