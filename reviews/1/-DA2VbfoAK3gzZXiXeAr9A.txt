This place was so terrible I didn't even stay to eat.  After an early morning flight, I arrived in Vegas to catch my connection and was starving.  After entering the Tequileria I passed by two employees who didn't even acknowledge my existence...So I helped myself to a menu.  I eyed up the breakfast burrito and noticed they would stop serving breakfast at 10:30. Even though it was literally 10:30 on the dot, I figured they would still accommodate my request.  Instead I stood at the bar for 5 minutes without even being asked if I needed help.  Finally the bartender comes over at 10:35 and says I'll be with you in a minute, then walks away.   By the time he comes back its even later.  I asked him if I could please get the breakfast burrito and he says no of course, so I plead with him to no avail.  Then he goes to me "if you want to order food go around to the service window on the other side".  Thanks for telling me this 5 minutes ago pal.  At least they could have been friendly considering I couldn't get the only thing I wanted on the menu.   Had they been nice in the slightest I might have over looked the fact that it smelt like Bourbon street the day after Mardi Gras.  Or that the nasty waitress gave me a dirty look when I asked about the breakfast burrito.  Or that I saw chicken bones on the floor when I knelt down to pick up the menu I dropped.  Gross!  No thanks. I turned around and walked out.  Please consider my review and the other numerous bad reviews before dining at this disgusting excuse for a restaurant.
