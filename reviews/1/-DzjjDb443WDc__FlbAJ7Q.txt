As much as I wanted to like this or give this place one or even two more stars I just can't.

Where to start? I will say on a positive note that I loved their salsa (there is the 1 star), however, please don't serve me delicious salsa with stale chips. I know they're free but they should still be fresh.

The wait staff seemed quite confused the entire time. Everyone at my table essentially ordered the same exact meal and they couldn't for the life of them figure out who had what. Not a difficult tasks when two people order chicken and one orders steak.

I went there for lunch and considering I was downtown I figured they'd be a lunch menu or specials read to me and neither were true. There may have been lunch specials, but I was not told them. I think $12.49 is a little expensive when you're on a social lunch

The food in general was so meh. I've been to places with authentic Mexican food. I'm not a person who just eats Taco Bell and says, I love Mexican. I've been to places in Florida and California where you know you're having the real deal and in comparison to that it truly failed. The food was spicy hot, but that's it. I got no other flavor but hot. Give me some spices, not just spicy. I could have easily just added some Frank's red hot to it if I wanted my mouth to burn.  The portions were a good size, however, I didn't want to finish what I did so it size wasn't a factor.

As much as I love Mexican food I am so surprised how long it took me to get to Mexico city. As bad as my experience was I'd be even more surprised if I ever stepped foot in there again.
