I was disappointed with my experience here.  I made an order for carry-out early in the evening last week (8/21/2012).

I ordered two ground beef tacos with just meat and cheese.  I could have made way better tacos at home.  The cheese looked it was shredded and tasted like it was from a package at a grocery store.  The beef was bland and had didn't have much flavor.

The chips for the salsa were stale.  I also ordered a grilled chicken quesadilla with cheese and it was almost $12...way overpriced for the amount and the taste.

I would not recommend this place based on my personal experience here.
