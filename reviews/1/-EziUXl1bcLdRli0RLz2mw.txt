HOW THE FUK does this place of SHIT have over a thousand reviews with 4.5 stars ?!

Line organization to pick up and pay: absolutely disgusting and unnecessarily complicated.

Carne Asada Tacos: marble and cartilage served on a greasy ass tortilla 

Carne Asada Fries: A vomit of a sauce served on a bed of cheap, cold and uncooked frozen fries 

ONE star because i LOVE my Mexicans and because customer service was helpful with a smile.

IF you love fresh and seasoned tacos THIS IS NOT YOUR SPOT. 
IF you love lard on top of lard served with a side of lard then this is your SPOT :D

Honestly this place is a disgrace and a disrespect to my Mexican people. It HURTS me to write this review but as the Mexican of the family in my Peruvian family i feel that it is my duty. 

Sorry.
