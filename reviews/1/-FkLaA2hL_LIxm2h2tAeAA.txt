I wanted this place to be good. I think they're franchises and the quality and cleanliness depends on who owns it or something bc I've been to some great Filibertos. This was not a good one. 

It's right by my house. Closest Mexican food by far. But I got sick there twice.... Stopped eating there for a long time and tried it again... And got sick again. 

Also there was a weird incident once when I ordered chile rellenos and I asked if I could just get one a la carte and the cook leaned out of the window w the frozen rellenos in his (gloved) hand to show me that they were frozen together in twos. I... Dunno... It really grossed me out lol.
