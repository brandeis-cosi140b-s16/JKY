So disappointed with my experience here today... Or lack thereof. I wanted to grab a bite and a drink between shopping locales and went to stop in here around 12:45. The place had slowed from the lunch hour and yet nobody was available to greet me when I walked in. Stood there to be seated. Got tired and walked up to the bartender and asked if I could seat myself on the bar patio. I was told no, that I have to wait for a hostess to seat me. Wait some more. Hostess finally comes and seats me. And then I start waiting some more. Nobody bothered to come serve me so I left. 

Believe me. I do not normally do negative reviews. Most of my reviews are glowing. But I was so incredibly disheartened by the service I received that I cannot even come to give Blanco more than one star. If I check this place out in the future and the service improves, I am happy to improve the rating. But now, just so so disappointed.

I've been to the other Blanco locations before and loved the experience. I wish this experience was different...
