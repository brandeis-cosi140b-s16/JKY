Not very happy with the recent changes from the "new CEO". I was told last night that the red chili and green chili burros have been REMOVED from their menu effective 9/1. Really? Why? That's a staple in any mexican food restaurant! I will give credit to the staff for helping me find something close to a red chili burro, but it's just not the same. I took my order to go and when I got home I also noticed that we only received MAYBE a 1/4 bag of chips when we used to get a full one AND the plasticware was so flimsy I had to throw it out - I can find better product at a dollar store. Where is this guy from? New York City? I won't be going back. VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED...and I've been frequenting this restaurant for YEARS!
