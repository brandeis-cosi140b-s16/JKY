Came here for their grand opening last week and to put it nicely, I was disappointed. I arrived at 6:30 and even though the place was busy, I managed to find a table for me and my friends by the entrance. Half an hour later and the waitress STILL hasn't noticed me, so I start texting my friends (who hadn't arrived yet), telling them about the horrible service. It's not as if she's been neglecting the other customers either; twenty minutes after I got into the place, a group of four guys sat down and got served right away. Anyway, sometime later, my friend orders a beer and that too takes a while. We decide to bounce and ask for the check. Again, a long ass wait. My friend turns to me and says, "Now I see what you were bitching about before. The service sucks here." The place gets one star for the grand opening special of $2 draft beer, but other than that, I probably won't go back...
