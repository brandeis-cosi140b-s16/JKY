Just under $9.00 for a combo #2 Pork Burrito, rice & beans with a medium Melon drink.  The Burrito was dry, meat greasy, beans runny and only a few spoonfulls of pico de gallo in the condiment tray.  No Salsa verde or any red sauce at all.  Staff was surly and made me feel like I bothered them to eat there.

Why didn't I read the Yelp reviews before stopping in ...
