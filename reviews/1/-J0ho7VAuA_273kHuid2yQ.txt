Be aware of the following!!!!!!
If you try to use restaurant .com or groupon....the restaurant doesn't count alcohol in the total bill!!!
I spent $103 and they refused to allow restaurant .com

Second,....if you request a song from the band??? Cost you $20 bucks!!!
Even Happy Birthday.I tipped $5 and a band member said all requests are $20.

We will not return.
