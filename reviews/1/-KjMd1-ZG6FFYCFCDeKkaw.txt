I went here on mothers day and had to ask for some one to serve us as an apology we was given free soapapeas that was grose tasting....the bread did not seem to be fully cooked and looked like it was sitting around for an hr or two the put in the micowave and served with only a small bit of powdered suger on one part of it. I would not have given a tip so the only thing that save the servers tip was that I was rong about a wab site that I talked to the manager about. I also would have walked out but realy wanted a sangria. The food later made me run for the restroom later on that night.... Iv been here befor in the day time and the service was some what ok. The food was good but if u go at night be there befor 7pm cuz they close at 8pm and at night the service sucks. I realy will not take any of my kinfoke here if they came to vist..I would rather travel to phoenix to arriba mexican grill or makios or garcias or cheveys they are much better. For the people that thought it is not help-full I can bet you work for this awful place....the service sucks big wet green donkey dicks and I hope the owner really thinks about firing the whole staff except for the cooks. . . . Managers and wait stuff can F*#$...off.
