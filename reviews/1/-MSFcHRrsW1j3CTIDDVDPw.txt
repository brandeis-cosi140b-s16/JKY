I have tried to eat here twice. Both times I sat down and then was totally ignored, no water, no chips, not even a hello. The first time I was ignored for 15 minutes and the second for 10 minutes.  As a single women eating alone I understand the server probably thought the tip would be small so wanted to serve the larger tables first but jeez at least say "I'll be with you in a minute". I walked out both times.
