Our family loves Carlos obriens and has been many times over the years for occasions (at the old location). First time visiting the new location and the service was  absolutely terrible. 

As a party of 10 we were seated and waited 10+ minutes with zero acknowledgement. The busser came by to clean the table from the previous guests and we had to ask him to grab a server. Not that the server helped much. Terrible attitude and she seemed put out to be helping us. The server was rude all night and came over maybe a handful of times, we were celebrating after each visit from her. Drinks (waters) and chips sat empty for most the visit. Countless staff members walked by our table with no efforts to serve.

Hopefully this is a one time thing, and we will be back again, but extremely disappointed in the service.
