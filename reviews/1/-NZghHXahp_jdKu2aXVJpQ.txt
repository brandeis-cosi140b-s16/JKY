Well the horchata was ok.

I guess the first issue.. ordered street tacos a la carte that were supposed to be 1.95 but somehow they decided the bring out the plate w/ rice and beans because this was supposed to save money.. well it didn't.. I didn't ask them too.. but hey.. thanks i guess lol.

Stay away from the carne asada tacos. The meat is poor quality.. too much fat and it makes for a greasy taco..this in my opinion is a pretty bad asada taco. The mountain of cabbage doesn't help it's overall lacking in flavor either. Pile on the salsa, those are really good. Also it's reheated which is standard practice i guess but some of these pieces were pretty black.. living in a mexican household you know this happens when you reheat the meat a few times. I could not tell the difference between the street taco and the more expensive arrachera taco. Meat quality = same.

Burro was solid. Salsa's great.. no chip refills. All in all for 70 bucks.. not worth it. That's 12 tacos rice and beans, 1 burrito, and 5 drinks.. this at Los Taquitos would cost me $40ish. However those tacos are ridiculous good unlike here.  Don't get what the fuzz is all about.
