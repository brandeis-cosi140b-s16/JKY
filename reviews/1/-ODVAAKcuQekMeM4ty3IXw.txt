I hate to pile on, but this place just wasn't good.  I went there for lunch not having heard anything at all about La Paz before.  I thought it looked cute inside, and we were seated, ordered and served our drinks pretty quickly, but things went down from there.  

I ordered chicken tacos, and it took quite a long time for them to arrive even though very few people were in the restaurant.  When our food finally arrived, it was barely warm and clearly had been sitting around for awhile.  The cheese on the refried beans (inexplicably cheddar) had congealed on all our plates, the rice was overcooked and mealy, and the tacos barely registered any warmth.  Even worse, the waitress carried our plates to the table in large oven mitts to suggest that the food was piping hot, which is pretty laughable considering how cold the food actually was.  

The state of the food served to us was bad enough that I would have said something to the waitress, but after depositing the food, she disappeared for quite a long period, so rather than sit there staring out our food, we ate what we could.  The chicken was not good--most of it was dark (which I really didn't expect in a restaurant like this) and tasted canned.  The food was generally flavorless, so I salted it up just to get it down.  We ran out of salsa and it was never refilled either.  I will say that the guacamole was tolerable, but that was about it.  

This is a good example of reading yelp reviews before you go to a restaurant 'cause if I had, I would have never set foot in this place.  Lesson learned!
