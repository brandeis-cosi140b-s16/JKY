This is not even worth my time to review, but I just don't want anyone else to experience what I had to experience eating at this place. I ordered a beef tamale enchilada style and they nuke it in a microwave. The masa was super dry and no flavor. Even the service wasnt great. Overall don't waste your money and your palette.

Fyi- they don't even deserve a star but had to hit at least 1 star to post this. Que horrible!
