So.....Last night we were in the mood for margaritas and didn't want to travel too far from home.  Against our better judgement we decided to give Blanco another try.  Won't make this mistake again!!  The wait wasn't long, but the service was awful, the margarita bitter and the food....just not worth the price.  There was more shredded cabbage in our fish tacos than anything else!!  This place is just too much of a 'scene' for us too.  We might as well have been in LA.  Not a good experience.
