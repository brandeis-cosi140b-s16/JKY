So I ordered chips and queso. Menu shows a cup of queso with chips for 3.99 I got to the front to pay, they then charged me 4.99 for the cup of queso and then 3.49 for the chips! Very misleading and the girl working the register decided to clean the tables Instead of ringing in my order, that was annoying. Thank you!
