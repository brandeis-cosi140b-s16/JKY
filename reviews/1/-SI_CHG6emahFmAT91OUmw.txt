Four of us ate there about a year ago (2014) after reading a very nice review in the Wisconsin State Journal. Having spent a lot of time in Tucson each winter, for about 30 years, I can honestly say this was the worst Mexican food I had ever eaten. Service was poor, too. My friends picked up a take-out menu when we went in. They threw it in the waste basket on the way out. Perhaps it has improved, now, with all the competition but we won't take the chance again when there are so many good Mexican restaurants in the area.
