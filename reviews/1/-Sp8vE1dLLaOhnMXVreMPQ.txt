Just don't go here... This was the worst Carne Asada burrito I've had ever!!!

The place is a shite hole, their rolled tacos are over priced and not so good... They even messed up a veggie burrito.  Also, their guac was all dark like it was left out.

I spent 15 bucks here and me and my gal ended up making mac and chac at home.

I really can't explain how much of a fail this place is.   How can you be levels worse the Filli B's?  

Not to mention it's like $0.50-$1.00 more expensive than any other Taco shack in Tempe.  

I could see that it's family owned by a couple, and I feel sorry for raining on them, but how do you mess up Carne Asada????!!

Do yourself a favor if you're on Southern and have a burrito hankering.

Go to Rivas.
