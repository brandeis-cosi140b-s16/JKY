Went here last night - forgot to check in (shame on me). It was edible but possibly the worst Mexican food I have had since I can remember. Very gringo, pedestrian menu - nothing out of the typical enchilada, burrito, tamale category. I love a good authentic tamale as much as the next person - but you aren't finding it here. The service was prompt and they refilled our salsa a number of times so that was the only highlight. I had the tamale/chile relleno combo and hubby had the chimichanga and we switched half way through. He said his black beans were ice cold.  The chicken in the chimichanga was dry and it was soggy. Also ordered a pitcher of house margarita - $22, and it was pretty weak. It was suprisingly busy in there but mostly the older crowd.. I liked one of the salsas and the service was okay but other than that I was disappointed. Also, no happy hour! What mexican restaurant doesn't have happy hour?! So no way no how will I be frequeting this establishment.
