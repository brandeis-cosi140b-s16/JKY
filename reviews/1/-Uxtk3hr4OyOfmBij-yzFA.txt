Terrible!!!! Worst Mexican in all of charlotte and the worst mex I've ever had. Went with a large group and everyone sent there did back and half of them ended up sick. The guacamole was brown and the tacos were disgusting. I wouldn't rec this place to anyone. Please do yourself a favor and don't eat here!
