Let's get this out of the way first - the food was OK, but just OK.   At best, it gets 2 stars.  Mexican food for gringos.
What was really awful horrible heinous was the service.   The evening started out well enough.  The hostess said the wait for a table would be 15 minutes.  We went to the bar and ordered margaritas (the upgrade from the house one).   Before the bartender finished making the drinks, the hostess came to take us to our table and said she would have our server get the drinks.  We were quickly served chips and dips.
This is when things fell apart. 
It took at least 15 minutes to get the Margaritas.  However, they were really delicious!
The waiter did not come back to take our order for another 15 - 20 minutes.  It took at least another 30 minutes to bring the food (soup and an appetizer plate).  During this wait, a different waiter came to take our order and a kitchen person tried to give us the food that belonged to another table.  When we did get our order, it had errors - my husband was given a cup of soup although he ordered a bowl and the guacamole never arrived at all.
During all of these waits, the bus boys continuously asked if we needed anything but seemed powerless to do anything other than bring more chips.  We ordered a second round of drinks and these took even longer to get.  When we did get them, they were not what we ordered.  When the correction was made, they were so tart they were undrinkable.
Our server apologized profusely because he knew he provided poor service, but honestly, I don't think he was the problem.  He seemed to be stressed and running all the time.  There seems to be a serious lack of organization and training in general.
I see the reviews for Serranos are mixed.  We know we won't be going back anytime soon.
