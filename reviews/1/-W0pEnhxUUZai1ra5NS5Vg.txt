We decided to try this place because of the amount of good stars and reviews......BIG MISTAKE! When we arrived, it was 45 min until their closing time. There were only 2 other couples besides us in the place. Like someone else mentioned, the salsa was very bland. When we got our food, we had to constantly blow on it because it was piping HOT! It was almost as if they took the whole plate and put it in the oven to cook. My tongue had a burning sensation for a whole week. I had the chicken tacos and they were ok (nothing to brag about). I also didn't like that you had to use cash instead of paying with any method of payment you wanted. The staff was pretty nice, but I won't ever return to this place.
