I've been hearing a lot about this place lately and finally tried it tonight. Lets just say my stomach hasn't felt right since. I got the chipotle shrimp bowl and my boyfriend got a shrimp quesadilla. Both looked very unappetizing once delivered to our table. After a couple bites of my bowl, the cilantro was so overpowering that It was hard to finish it. Don't get me wrong, I love cilantro, this was just toooo much.

Another thing I found pretty gross were the bathrooms. Maybe its just me but I tend to judge the cleanliness of restaurants based on the restrooms. This one was smelly and in need of some scrubbin'.
