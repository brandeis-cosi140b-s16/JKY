Sucks that this place was how we started our vacation off. 
We had an early flight, so by the time we made it to our layover, we were pretty hungry. We didn't have much time so we thought some tacos and burritos would hit the spot.
Wrong.

Not only was this place was pricey, you barely get any food. A tiny scoop of rice and beans, and 3 small tacos that looked miserable. I ate 1 taco before the corn tortilla fell apart. I dumped the other 2 and just ate the rice and beans. 

It was also super packed and crowded, with barely a place to stand. Don't get your hopes up of finding a chair to sit in.

Luckily we were heading to Texas, where they have the best tacos around, so we could easily forget our experience here.
