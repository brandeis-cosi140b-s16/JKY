The food here is good, but the best food in the world wouldn't outweigh the horrendous service I experienced here. I've never EVER been spoken to the way I was here, and over simply not knowing that a burrito came with guacamole. I spoke with a woman who I believe was the manager, and she was the rudest, most condescending person I have ever met. I just moved to town and Fausto's is walking distance from my house, so I was excited to be able to walk to get Mexican food all the time. They've lost out on a lot of business from me, because I would have been coming on a very regular basis. Will not return. Especially with Roberto's only a few minutes away.
