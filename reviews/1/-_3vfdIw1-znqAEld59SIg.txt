We stopped by for breakfast and ordered chicken enchilada plate and my brother a chicken quesadilla. Chicken was super hard(old most likely) and dark, couldn't eat it. We left after taking a couple bites. The person at the counter was nice and had a smile, but food was terrible and its typical "Mexican food". I usually stay away from places advertised as " Authentic", but we were hungry, oh well you live and you learn.
