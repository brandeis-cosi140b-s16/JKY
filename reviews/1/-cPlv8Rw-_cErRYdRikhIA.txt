Terrible thought by coming in here with such a diverse atmosphere that I would be welcomed but instead was embarrassed and humiliated and not allowed to have a drink and was cut off but the rest of my party was yes u guessed allowed to party when it came time to pay the lady had no problem taking my money since I was the one hosting and paying but would not serve me! Never again and I don't recommend it to anyone!
