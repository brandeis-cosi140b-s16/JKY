The service and quality of food at this location was so poor that I will never come here again. I have never been to a cafe rio that was empty at lunch time and this one was. That should be the first sign that something is wrong. I ordered the fire roasted chicken salad and the chicken was dry and burned. The girl behind the counter never asked if I wanted rice or beans. She just put the chicken on a cold and stale tortilla. When I asked for them she was rude and said she asked. With no one in front of us in line, it still took 5 minutes to get the food and checkout. I would have asked to see the manager, but no one was receptive enough to even bother trying to ask. And honestly, if his/her restaurant is empty at lunch, my guess is they don't care either. Maybe a call to corporate would help them out.
