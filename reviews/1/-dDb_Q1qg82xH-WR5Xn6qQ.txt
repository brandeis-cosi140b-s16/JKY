I have to say once they brought us the chips and salsa we should have just gotten up to leave.. Store bought chips and salsa was obviously from a can. My corn had so much mayonnaise and cheese I had to scrape it off with a knife to eat it. The fruit on the menu was not fresh cut fruit as expected but some sort of gelatin with a can of fruit cocktail mixed in.. I would definitely reconsider the menu at this place. However my husband loved his torta.. I actually felt really sorry for the owners as you just know this place is never going to make it.
