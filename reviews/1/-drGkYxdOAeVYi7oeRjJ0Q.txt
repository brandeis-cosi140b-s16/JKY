By far the worst Taco Bell experience I've ever had. I was informed in the drive thru that they had run out of beef and that they were offering steak and beef at no extra charge. In the end we were charged for the substitutions anyway. The wait was horrendous by the time we got to the window we were informed that they had run out of steak and that one of our items was going to be chicken. We did not receive that chicken item even though we paid for it. My crunchwrap supreme was burnt not toasted. A quesadilla was made with sauce only and no cheese. My cheesy gordita crunches were cold and had very little cheese between layers. Customer service was ok at best the guy seemed like he was a little over it and needed to pull up his pants. Really disappointed.
