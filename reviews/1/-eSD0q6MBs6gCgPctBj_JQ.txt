We dropped in for lunch on a Saturday and they said they ran out of a lot of stuff that were listed on the menu - guacamole, red salsa, quinoa soup to name a few! I ordered a Chile relleno and it was cold at the center as though it was frozen and reheated. Very disappointed with the food and the service.
