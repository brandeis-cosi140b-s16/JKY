Do yourself a favor and don't go here.  It is one of the worst meals I have had in a long time.  The food is low quality and poor tasting.  I love Mexican food, love it and I could take only a few bites.  My husband felt the same way about his meal.  Unlike other reviews, we found the staff friendly and once it was apparent we weren't eating the manager came to see if there was anything she could do, offered another meal from the menu.  She tried but we just wanted to get out of there.  Plenty of restaurants on Carson Street, don't pick this one.
