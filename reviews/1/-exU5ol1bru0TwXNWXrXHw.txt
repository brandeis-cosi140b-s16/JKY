We had one of the worst meals ever at this location. The chip's were stale and greasy. The shredded beef burrito was smaller than a taco and the meat was day's old and very dry. The lettuce bean's and rice also very old and stale. We will not be going back to this location ever again. Bad food, Bad service. Over priced.
