Bug in food, followed by terrible handling of the situation. I used to come here on a regular basis however on my most recent visit my friend saw a bug crawling across my plate and pointed it out. I called the waiter over and showed him the bug, he made a sound effect acknowledging that he saw the bug and took the plate away. He then came back a few minutes later with the check and acted as if everything was ok, saying nothing. I was so taken back I paid and got the H out of there ASAP. They made no attempt to fix or even mention the wingless bug we all saw making its way across my plate! Not going back EVER and its a shame because I've been coming here for years! You can't treat customers like that if you expect to run a business successfully. I would have considered coming back but the fact that they made no effort shows that the staff doesn't care at all. That's not okay.
