Went in to use the restroom and felt like I should buy something from them since I went in and used their facilities. The guy who served me did not care to acknowledge me right away and when he finally did it was after almost walking away.  He clearly has poor customer service.  When he returned he still ignored me until he finally asked for my order. After I paid for my order he then did not have change for me and was gonna make me wait for him to go find some so I just walked out with my drink. Having experience in restaurants and customer service, I feel this could of been handled much better. I will not be visiting again.
