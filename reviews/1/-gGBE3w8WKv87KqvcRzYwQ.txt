I paid almost $10 for a steak and guacamole bowl and the meat was lukewarm. I came in at 3:45 pm on Super Bowl Sunday. They offered to remake it (with the same batch, I'm sure) and had to ask for a refund. They did not seem apologetic and kept serving the steak to other customers. Poor form. By far the worst chipotle I've been to, and the reviews reflect it. Look in to new management.
