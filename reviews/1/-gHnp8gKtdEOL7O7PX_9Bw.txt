I ordered delivery from GrubHub and really regret it.  The food showed up without the drink I ordered, which normally wouldn't be a big deal, but these guys chare $9 for delivery!!!! PLUS, he got his 15% tip!  For that kind of cash he should have gone to the corner store to get it.  His 'I'm sorry' cost me alot of $$$$.

And, to top it off, threw out the food.  They put an enchilada into styro without a foil lining, so the enchilada melted the container, rendering the food inedible.  Awful customer service.
