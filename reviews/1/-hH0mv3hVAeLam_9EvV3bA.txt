Went in after reading some reviews on here, here on vacation and felt like some good Mexican good.   Customer service was bad and the food was not good , I got the carnitas burrito and rolled tacos.  Food was cold and carnitas didn't taste good.  The lady at the register was rude.  Never coming here again even for free food
