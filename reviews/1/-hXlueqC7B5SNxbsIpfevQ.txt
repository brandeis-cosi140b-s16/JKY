Went in for take out.  Huge line due to fundraiser.   $30 worth of food for 4 people.  Paid with my credit card and our food was all bagged up.  We left and drove home.  My son's order was missing the main item (quesadilla).   I called and after waiting several minutes to speak to the manager, she said she knew about the missing item and said I could drive back to the store for a $4.00 refund.   I asked that they credit my card back over the phone.  Manager got snippy and insisted there was no way to do that except in the store.  I ask for Division Manager name.  Again several minutes later I finally get the info.   Left him a voice mail.   No return call yet several hours later.   Make sure you check your order because their service is terrible.   Inconvenienced twice in one visit.   I will be recommending our school no longer brings fund raisers to this location.  Update:  5 days later and no call back from the Division Manager.   Guess they don't need the business.  Please avoid this restaurant - they have proven they don't care about their own mistakes or how badly they treat their customers.
