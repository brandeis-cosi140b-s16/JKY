Two words: Chile relleno. 

Three more words: With the seeds?! 

The order is small (which I don't mind) and so is the price... I figured that matched up and it was, overall, a tasty dish. But they don't clean the chiles? I have had this before when I noticed that, I figured it was an honest mistake. As I am only here about 4-6 times a year, I figured the last time had to be an anomaly. 

It has the potential to be a 3 or 4 star place for what they portray themselves to be: quick mexican food (as opposed to fast food a la Taco Bell or Del Taco), decent flavors, and good prices. I have always had efficient, friendly service and they've never balked at my customization requests.

However, when I can't enjoy but half of my chile relleno because it wasn't properly cleaned out? Not just a little bit near the top/end/etc... but half the chile had ribs and seeds. It made the dish bitter and inedible where it was present. 

Add to this that my friend's nachos were wet and missing the cheese (really?) and they forgot her side of beans.

History was already "meh," and now #lunchfail. Potential just doesn't cut it.
