I had only eaten at La Fonda's Mexican food restaurant three times. The first two experiences there were great. The staff during the day is the family that actually owns the business. The service was fast, food was hot and fresh, and waiter was friendly. However, the third time I ate there was for dinner with a friend of mine. We got there and had to wait around 20 minutes for a table. The reason being is it was a Saturday night and   the place had only two servers for the whole restaurant! What a nightmare! We decided to stay and have dinner since it was already 7 pm. We both ordered there standard margarita there which tasted like salt water....no flavor! Our chips and salsa were good like the other two previous visits prior. The chicken burritos we ordered were a disappointment. The meat inside was luke warm which made me a bit nervous. How long was the meat sitting? We were so disappointed we just up and walked out, never been back since. give this place a second thought before trying them out. it seems like a hit or miss kinda restaurant.
