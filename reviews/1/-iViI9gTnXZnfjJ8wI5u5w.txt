My husband and I went in Sunday at 3 for a late lunch. We're always excited about a new Mexican restaurant and we love downtown Summerlin. The party in front of us left after speaking to the hostess, we were then told the wait was at least 1 1/2 hours. I could understand this with a newly opened restaurant but there were many open tables in the dining area and only 1 small party waiting in lobby area. If they are short staffing so soon after opening shame on them. Two other  parties left after being told the same thing. Not a good first impression, we will not waste our time again!
