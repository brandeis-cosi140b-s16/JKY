I had been going to this place on 59th. This past weekend I went to the Thomas location. Let me start by saying this great food. KEEP YOUR RECEIPTS I just checked my bank statements and somehow the tip I left for my pick up order had been changed. What kind of business goes that route, I've disputed with my bank since. Sad I loved this place but you'll will not be getting any from me again. If anyone has had the same problem please let me know
