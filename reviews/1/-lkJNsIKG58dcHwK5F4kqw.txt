I was excited to try this new location after hearing good reviews of the chain overall but unfortunately the staff's demeanor distracts from any positives the food may offer. The 2 ladies behind the counter seemed irritated and miserable with life in general. Not only were they practically mute and unhelpful when we said it was our first time there and we were trying to decide what we should get, neither smiled once or said thank you and barely even looked up from whatever they were doing. First and last time here I guess, better off sticking to Chipotle where they appreciate their customers.
