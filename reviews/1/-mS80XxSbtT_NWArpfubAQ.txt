Really!! Uughhh!! Never again!! So we paid $13 for a taxi to take us to this place because according to yelp reviews these tacos are suppose to be the bomb!! Guess what!! They are crap!! My husband and I had carne asada and Al pastor tacos!! The asada has the fake grilled taste and the Al pastor did not taste like Al pastor it just had the Al Pastor color but no taste!! The tortillas are hand made but the meat that goes on top of the tortillas suck so no point in having hand made tortillas!!  Best thing there is the fountain drink!! I think all the people that say these tacos are good must go when they are drunk!! Because Everyone knows that any tacos taste delicious when your drunk!! So if your sober don't waste your time or your taxi fare!!
