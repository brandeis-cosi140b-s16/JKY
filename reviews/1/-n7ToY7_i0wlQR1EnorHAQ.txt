I truly wish these kind of places didn't exist. They give a bad name to mexican food. For reference I just ordered the standard array of rice, beans, salsas, etc.

As others have said, go to Chipotle or Qudoba if you want the american/mexican style burritos. This place is simply not worth spending your time, money, daily allotment of calories, etc..
