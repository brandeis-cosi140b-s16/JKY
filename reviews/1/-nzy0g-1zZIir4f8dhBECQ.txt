so ive been here a lot. it used to be my go to place but lately the service has been HORRIBLE! No one even said thank you the past 2 times. the food has been garbage the past 2 times too. I ordered a bean burrito and the beans looked like they have ground beef in them. It was not good at all. 1 star doesnt do it justice.
