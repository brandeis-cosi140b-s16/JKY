I've never experienced so many fast food issues in one place, in such a short period of time. About 2 months ago, my wife and I went through the drive through and placed an order. When we got home, we realized that what we received was substantially different than what we had ordered. No big deal, I drove back. It happens sometimes. Well, a couple of weeks later, it happened again, but this time, I'm certain that it was because the manager decided he'd rather BS with the employees than work, as they were chatting all around the counter. So, I called the 1-800 number and left a detailed message. The franchise OWNER called me directly and apologized and even gave us an unlimited and free meal to apologize. Of course, we spent about $15. We aren't jerks. Well, come this week, we go through the drive through again and guess who's palling around at the counter, talking and laughing again? The manager. Guess who got there order wrong again? Us. We are not going back to that location, ever.
