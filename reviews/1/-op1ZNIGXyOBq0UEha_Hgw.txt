My mom got horrible food poisoning from their shrimp a couple days ago! She ordered the shrimp bowl and had to wait forever to get her food! Then they tried masking it by adding so much spice she said the shrimp was unusually spicy. Anyway, she hadn't ate nothing all day & threw up several times along with going to the restroom. I feel so bad for her. Why couldn't their lazy asses throw away old shrimp? I wish she would of gotten a stool sample and turned them in because this could of gotten someone who's even older deathly ill. DONT risk eating their shrimp!! This place needs to be turned in to the health department!!
