I truly hope that the employees of this location and the owners of Los Favoritos read this review, but more importantly, take appropriate action. I really want to like this place. It's convenient to my house and the few dishes I've tried are pretty good for a chain mexican restaurant. I will say this is the only location I've been to but honestly, I'm afraid to visit others after the service we've received here on every single visit without fail. 

That being said, the customer service is without a doubt the worst my wife and I have ever experienced in a restaurant. We have both worked in the food service industry and know the importance of good customer service. Not only that, it's EVERY visit! And it wasn't just to us. As I sat once waiting for my order to come out, I witnessed the guy at the cashier  give every customer the same terrible service, time after time. It's more than just lack of service - it's a general lack of manners and common decency. Either he's just rude or he's too cool for school...a little of both I think. 

The front of the house staff are like zombies. Usually when you greet someone with a 'hello' or 'how are ya?' you get a response and a smile. Not here. The same goes for phone orders, there is a complete lack of professionalism and courteousness. I once walked in and said 'Hi. Do you guys have machaca burritos?" After not greeting me back, the young man hit a key on the register without breaking his eye contact with me. 'What else do you want?" he then said. ??!! I guess that's was a yes, and I guess I just ordered it! I could go on with the stories of unprofessionalism and all around rude, anti-social behavior but I won't. Most of these negative experiences have been with a young man and a young woman and on the weekends.

Owners - do something about this. Your average food alone cannot keep you in business for long with customer service like this.
