Lousy excuse for a restaurant!  Don't waste your time or money on this place.  My fajita's were cold, my margarita tasted like kool-aid, my salad came after the meal, I would have complained if there was anyone in sight, the server was an idiot who actually said I don't know and then stared at me after I asked a question about a dish.  DISGUSTING!
