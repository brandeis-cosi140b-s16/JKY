We decided to go here because I read an article where the executive chef of Halcyon (a restaurant we really like) said he takes his family here. We were thoroughly disappointed. We were not expecting anything fancy, but were hoping for a good, cheap mexican place. To start off, our unhelpful waiter told me that no, they could not make me a margarita without sour mix in it. Okay, fine. We ordered the tableside guacamole, which is almost impossible to mess up unless the avocados aren't ripe, which they were not. The accompanying chips were stale. Next I asked for black beans with my veggie fajitas and was told they didn't have any. The fajitas themselves were greasy and flavorless. My husband ordered enchiladas suiza, and it came topped with a bizarre milky sauce. My son refused to eat his chicken quesadilla because he said the chicken tasted funny. Also, someone else mentioned that they make their own tortillas here. They do not.
