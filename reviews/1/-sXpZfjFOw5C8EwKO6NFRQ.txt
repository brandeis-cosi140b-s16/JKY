Absolute worst  service ever!!!! Had to get our own napkins after waiting 20 minutes while on outside Patio, only one other table with customers outside. Rice was burnt and food was horrible. 
Even our children noticed the difference. 
Been going to the cave creek location for over 20 years. I'll never come back here again.
