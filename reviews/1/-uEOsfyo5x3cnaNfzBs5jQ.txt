This is the worst Del Taco location.  I have visited this location on multiple occasions and the food is always terrible here.  The service is awful too!  On one occasion, I went through the drive thru, waited for the car in front of me to get their food (which took forever) and when I pulled up to the speaker, no one greeted me or took my order because there was no one working the drive thru!  It was the middle of the day... Epic fail!
