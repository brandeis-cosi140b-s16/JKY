the front counter girl rolled her eyes  when I  asked her  what came with the combo.  that set the mood  for the rest of the" experience".  food  was mediocre  at best.  ordered the red jade  chicken,  nor sure what we ended up with. pork  rice  was horrible, machaca  was decent.  all in all,  the  place  was not worth  the $ 22.00  spent on 2  meals.
