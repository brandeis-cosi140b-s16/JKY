The service was awful for lunch. They tended to their regulars but not to less frequent diners. My husband and I came for lunch. The food was good but not worth the 1 hour lack of service. The waitress brought our drinks and food to us quickly but not once did she come back to ask us how our food was or to refill our drinks. We sat there for at least 40 mins without seeing a sign of our waitress or our check. I had an enchilada to put in a to go box... by the time I got the box, (from another waitress) my enchilada was cold, hard, and molded to my plate! Anyways, finally another waitress came over after noting we were looking around, asking if we had paid (to be honest we could have walked out without paying but I'm not that type of person). We told her we hadn't received our check & had been waiting for a very long time. After a while she brought our check and it appeared our original waitress had closed our tab and forgot about us! And the original waitress didn't even come out to our table to apologize! After waiting so long I would at least hope for that. We paid, left no tip (I've only left no tip at a restaurant one time before and we eat out a lot), and left never to go back again. My family has eaten at this restaurant for years (I remember coming with my nana when I was 3-4 years old, so that's over 20 years ago) and I will not be continuing the tradition. At least act like you care about your customers and apologize for your crap service that delayed their day by an hour (and offering a discount or free dessert doesn't hurt). I understand getting slow service sometimes happens, but not the blatant disregard for customer service and lack of providing an amends for your mistake or inconvenience. Due to the hit or miss customer service, I don't recommend coming here. There are comparable Mexican restaurants in the area with much better service and courteous employees.
