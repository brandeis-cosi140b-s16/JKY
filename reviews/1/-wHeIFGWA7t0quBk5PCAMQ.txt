Let me just say that the host and manager are super rude at this location.  They work as hard as possible to ignore everyone, act super over-worked and do their best to condescend as much as humanly possible.  Service is robotic.  It's a shame this place has the history and so-called reputation that it does.  I feel like I should move away from Phoenix, if this is the place we're supposed to be proud of.  As for the food?  Well more uninteresting typical Mexican fare.  If you haven't figured this out, I'll sum it up in two words: STAY AWAY
