Who likes this place??

This is my second try here, I wanted to give it another chance, but it was just as bad as the first time.

I got the burrito bowl and its just a bunch of low quality ingredients thrown in a pile. Taco Bell is way better, so thats saying something. Also, Taco Bell is cheaper. I paid 6.59 for my burrito bowl and I still felt hungry afterwards.

If you want a real quality burrito bowl for the same price, go to Chipotle, hands down. Plus Chipotle includes guacamole for free with veggie bowls, this place its extra.

The only cool thing about this place is that they are freaking everywhere, and they are new and clean on the inside. I don't know how they sustain themselves though, who comes here?
