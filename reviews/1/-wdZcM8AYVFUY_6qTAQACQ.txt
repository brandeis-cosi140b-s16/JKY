Cafe Rio, WTF happened to you??? You were one of my favorite places to eat. Now, I must resort to someplace else. 

On our last visit, I decided to just get a chicken tostada because my usual chicken salad would have been too much food. Plus I wanted the crunchy tostada shell. So here's where it gets bad. I order the shredded chicken on the side because I didn't want the juices making my tostada shell soggy. As the girl proceeded to put the chicken in a separate cup, she made a comment about how she hates when people get the meat on the side. The guy next to her then made a comment about how he agreed. Um, I'M STANDING RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU IDIOTS,  I CAN HEAR YOU!!! Then as the guy puts the lettuce on my food, he doesn't let the water drip from the lettuce. So all this water ends up making my tortilla shell soggy. Just what I didn't want. Then to top it off, as I'm eating my food, the chicken is way overcooked and super mushy. And there's a puddle of water at the bottom of my plate. See picture. 

I've noticed over my last few visits to this location that the employees don't seem to give a crap about the food they serve. They're just there for a paycheck. No care or quality. I love their food, especially the tortillas. But now, I might have to drive to a further location if I want my fix.
