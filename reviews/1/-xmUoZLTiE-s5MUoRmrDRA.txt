My roommates and I started going here because they have an awesome salsa bar and the food was fresh. The last few times I've gone, there was this skinny kid working that obviously had a problem with us. I'm super polite to people that are going to handle my food, so I don't know what was up with him. When I picked up my food, he started going off on me about how I think I'm so cool and stuff about hipsters, which nobody would ever take me for one. I sent a message to FiliB's website, because I felt bad for this kid, he seems like he's on the path towards shooting the place up, definitely shouldn't have him helping customers :-/

So I hadn't been in for a few months, decided to try tonight. Crazy kid wasn't working but the staff all acted irritated to help anyone, not only us. This place used to be busy and it was dead. I heard my food get called and when I went up there, there wasn't a soul at the counter, just my bag. The food was nasty and I feel gross, it tastes like everyone took a turn throwing salt in the food. I'm definitely never going back there again, nor anyone I know, I'll make sure of it. 

I'll never understand why restaurants are rude to people if they want to stay open...
