It takes very little in a burrito to satisfy me. Mainly, it's fresh ingredients. In a pinch, I can even enjoy Taco Bell.  

I threw my veggie burrito away uneaten. It was just bad. Stale, tasteless, and soggy. Finally decided on CPK for my second dinner, but Burger King would have still been way better than Blue Burrito Grill.
