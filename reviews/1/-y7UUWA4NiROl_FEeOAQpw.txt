Dont know what the rave is at this place, ordered the lengua burrito that came with beans and rice. Beans and rice tasted bland like From a can. Chips and salsa tasted like they came from a bag and bottle from The store. The burrito itself was okay nothing great. Service was horrible, the server was not friendly or attentive. Only saw him once and it took a while to get the check. We actually had to get up and poke our head in the kitchen.
