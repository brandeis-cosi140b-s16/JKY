By far the worst experience I have ever had at a cafe rio! We walk in and aren't greeted by anyone and the place is a complete mess! The employees are just hanging around talking. We realize that there isn't very much of anything left, being that it was 8pm we figured they would be bringing out more, but NOPE. We asked the employee and she said they aren't making anymore food and suggest we go somewhere else. She then looked at my boyfriend and said "she's too pretty to eat here just take her somewhere else" the girls behind the counter were extremely rude and unprofessional.
