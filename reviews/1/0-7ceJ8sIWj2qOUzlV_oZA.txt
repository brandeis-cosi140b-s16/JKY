We have always gotten good food and great service at Rubio's. This time when we visited, we were not greeted when we came into the restaurant and there wasn't anyone else there. We ordered the shrimp tacos and a balsamic vinaigrette chicken salad.  We asked about ingredients in the Churro due to a dairy food allergy and the girl said, "It's like a donut, no dairy". Well, luckily I only had a few bites of it. Later that night, I looked it up on the website as I started having doubts she was very confident about the ingredients and I was having an allergic reaction. It looks like there IS milk in the Churro. For $18 for a meal, I can think of numerous other restaurants I would rather visit. The food quality and the service was not what I have experienced in the past. Nor was it worth $18 for a lunch.
