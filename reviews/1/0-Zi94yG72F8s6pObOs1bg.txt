This chipotle is located right next to my house so I'm always in. They never have enough employees working on the line and certain employees lack a sense of urgency. I've seen an employee eating while there's a long line of customers waiting in the middle of the day. And don't even think about coming here at night between 9-10. There too busy trying to close then help you.
