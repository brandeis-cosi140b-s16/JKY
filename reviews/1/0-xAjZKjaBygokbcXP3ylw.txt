Overpriced bland mexican food. Atmosphere doesn't fit the place and feels awkward. I was really surprised to find that even during happy hour my girlfriend and I had a $49 tab for 2 meals and 3 drinks. I would avoid this place at all costs. I mean you are on the westside of the valley where you are not more than a stones throw in most any direction for really good mexican food. It's akin to going to somewhere like Kansas and having mexican food where the average patron has no idea what traditional mexican food tastes like. No bueno.
