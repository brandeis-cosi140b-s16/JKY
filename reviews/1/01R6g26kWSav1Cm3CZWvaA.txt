BAD SERVICE EVER!!! When in for a late family dinner... chips and salsa were good. But, after placing a order we waited for a long time. The food wasn't what I expected we order a tortilla soup that look and taste like tomato soup. We also order a bean and rice burrito w/o cheese and got a rice burrito with a side of rice??? After speaking to the server Dominique seem to have a attitude which I don't think any customer shouldn't experience or tolerate...I then stepped out to use the restroom on the way out I over heard a conversation about the problem to others.

Already furious I then asked to speak to the manager which didn't seem to care about the situation...Bottom line I will never return to PINK TACO SO UNPROFESSIONAL!!!! SERVICE WAS TERRIBLE FOR THE PRICE YOU PAY
