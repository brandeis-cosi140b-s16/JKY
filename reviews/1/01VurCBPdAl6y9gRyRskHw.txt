I went here because i had a coupon and to avoid Stephanie street.
The girls in the line are rude! mean and have no idea how to give a good costumer service! they don't listen or put attention to anything you are trying to say.
They act like if they were doing you a favor.
I won't comeback to this location! i don't care driving to the Stephanie location, where they always welcome you with a smile and staff is friendly and food is great! :)
