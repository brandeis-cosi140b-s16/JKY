The hostess sat us in a cruddy seat by the kitchen when the place was nearly empty, so I leaned over and said something about it to my companion, but the girl must've parked herself right by the kitchen and overheard. They put something so foul in my drink that I went to the bathroom and got soap and a napkin (discreetly) and cleaned the table thinking it was an unwashed table. As we left she and the bartender I guess yelled "How was it?" directly at me even though others were leaving. A few hours later I was sick. I never was rude to her. I never spoke directly to her except to say thanks as she sat us and she, if I'm lucky, wrung out a dirty dish rag into my drink. 
Edit: Health department says there was a similar complaint in September.
