This place needs help.

Our table and the light next to our table were covered in something sticky.

Our server was BAD. He rolled his eyes and laughed when I asked if they have a gluten allergy menu. He was never around to give refills. He didn't even pretend to try to be friendly. When he set the food down he basically threw it on the table. Then he took my plate away while I was still holding my fork and eating rice! He only had us and another table but we had to wait 15 minutes for him to bring us the check after he took our plates. He didn't pick up the check 10 minutes after dropping it off, so I had another server take it to him.

The food wasn't anything special. My friend's fajitas which were supposed to come with avacado had about 1/8th of an avacado on the plate. There were also supposed to be cooked tomatoes in the fajitas, but we couldn't find any. My gluten free tacos were barely enough to fill me up.

Overall I was not impressed, there are plenty of better Mexican restaurants in Arizona. Don't waste your time if you're looking for good food and good service.
