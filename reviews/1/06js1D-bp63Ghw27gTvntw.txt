This location IS busy but employees are frantic and do not listen. The first time they went so fast they put three different things on my bowl I didn't Ask for and had to remake the bowl. 

The second time they charged me for the wrong meat when I got two different times and then just said it was only a few cents different, the point is they were going too fast and weren't apologetic about it at all. (In fact it was 60 cents difference and while it's not a lot the customer service is the point here

Lastly BOTH times I've gotten double meat here, I got barely any more than when I got one meat. 

Left feeling stressed 3/3 times eating here
