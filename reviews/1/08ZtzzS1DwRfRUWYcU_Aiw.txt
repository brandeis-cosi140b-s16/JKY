That place sucks bad!! The rice tasted like it was out of an Uncle Ben microwaveable bag, the tacos were dry and the bean tasted like they were out of a can!! To top it off one of the managers was yelling and cursing at the cooks in Spanish calling them worthless!! I can't believe my girlfriend and I payed $60 bucks for dinner!! I would say Taco bell is a better option!! Worst so called "Mexican" food I've ever had!!
