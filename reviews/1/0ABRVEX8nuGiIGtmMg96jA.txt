Awful!!!! Will not be going back!!  

I'm a pretty relaxed, forgiving person until you do something thats industry unforgivable.  Like making a table wait for an hour... at a fast food place for their food. BAM!! DONE! NEVER GOING TO GO BACK! You do have the option of sitting down, but even the people getting their orders to go were waiting 30+ minutes.

And with all of the other AWESOME mexican places around.... what the heck??  An hour... a true 60 minute hour. AND the worst part... we were not the only ones who waited a LONG time for the mediocre food. In fact, the entire place... EVERY SINGLE TABLE(~10) were full. It took 10-15 minutes just to get our drinks which were diet cokes... you have a soda fountain, just take the order, fill the drinks and let the people sit with their drinks.  And when they did serve food, it was one plate at a time... took a good 5 minutes in between when I and my boyfriend received our food. 

I place every other mexican food restaurant, including taco bell, in the phoenix metro area, ABOVE this place. It cost $19.20 for a two taco combo(2 tacos- street style with rice & beans) and a taco and tamale combo(taco, tamle + rice & beans). ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME? And the beans... AS RUNNY AS WATER!!! So gross!!!  I tried to mix my rice/beans together but that didn't help anything.

We went here on the recommendation two friends of ours... both are older... probably don't like as much spice and flavor as we do but the burnt meat in the El pastor tacos- unacceptable. BLACK ON THE BOTTOM OF THE MEAT. The tamale tasted like it had cinnamon or allspice in it too.... totally not mexican and very gross! My reccomendation, go to Los Favoritos.
