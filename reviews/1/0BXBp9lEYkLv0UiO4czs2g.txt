Watery salsa. Guacamole seems to be mostly sour cream or some other thin sauce. They were going to get three stars for that, but then the waitress/cashier was a total yatch. She was about to total my ticket when I told her I had a gift certificate. Suddenly my 8.25 total was 11.50. She told me my tea was 2.50. Menu price: 1.50. She said the guacamole was 3.55 - it was actually 3.25. On general principle I had to argue. Finally she added 1.50 for her tip, which was probably a good idea after that debacle (although I would definitely have tipped much more if things had not gone south like they did).
