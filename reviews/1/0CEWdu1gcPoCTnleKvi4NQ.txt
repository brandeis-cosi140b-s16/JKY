This was absolutely the biggest rip off ever.  Came in from a long flight and was waiting to catch another flight so decided to have a "lemon drop" martini.  There were no prices listed on the drink menu but expected to pay under $10.  My sister got a class of the house wine.  I had 2 martini's and she had one class of wine.  When I got my bill I was surprised to see that I had been charged almost $15 per martini and $14 for a glass of wine.  I would have complained but didn't want to cause a scene as there were so many people.  I would NOT recommend this place at all.
