Literally had to wait 17 minutes to have a draft sam Adams poured.by the time it got to me I had to chug it so I wouldn't miss my flight. Server apologized after the fact saying they had to change the keg. I would have like to have had the option at first to switch my choice so that I could have enjoyed my beverage.
