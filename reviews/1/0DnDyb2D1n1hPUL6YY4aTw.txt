Working on the Westside of town, I was excited about the addition of another lunch  venue, besides the burgers and old school Italian. Imagine my disappointment when I walked into this joint that looked like a copycat of Chipolte and wished that my chicken burrito was Chipolte. Everything about my meal was bland and flavorless. Ironically, Picante has no spice. I guess it's back to burgers and Italian.
