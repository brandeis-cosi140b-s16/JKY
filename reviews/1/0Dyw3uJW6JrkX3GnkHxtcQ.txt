Hey Yelpers... Im a die hard Mexican Food critic and mainly pesimistic on new spots. Many times, even before our almighty Yelp, i have been victim to restaurants that claim grandeour when there is none. So I seek out The authentic... The revolutionary, the spot that sets the bar. So... I have to admit before my affinity was shattered... El chino had me sold. I raved to my masses of there quality and taste. I was of the first to walk in to this hole in the wall. Then, was El Chino, in the back killing it... Like magic churning out delight, savory stews, grilled heavenly morsels... And I its cheerleader as I licked my fingers clean. But loyalty draws me to my fan fare regularly... And on this dismal day my accolades shattered and I witnessed as others a very different El Chino. The fault, I believe was the absence of their namesake. El chino was nolonger there. And I in horror saw Microwaved left overs from fridge to nuke... coagulated disgust shoveled to my wifes tortilla... How as her man, allow it to transpire... No not me so i called them out... And struck them down. Read my others and 1 is a  response to a message sent denying what we witnessed.
