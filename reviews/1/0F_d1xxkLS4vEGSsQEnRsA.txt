Happy hour? Not so much. A whole lotta No's:
- At 4:30: No hostess. We waited at the hostess stand for five minutes. No one showed up to help us. She was MIA. You're on your own.
- To the bartender: "Can we sit outside the bar?" "No, not for happy hour." Um, ok. (It was deserted, btw).
- No happy hour menus, got the audible version from bartender.
- No taco cart, as advertised. 
- No napkins-silverware. Waitress dropped off the food and walked away. Get the utensils yourself.
- Happy hour margarita? Blended. Couldn't detect the alcohol. Go for on the rocks instead.
- Out of the 3 tacos-types, all had the pork so gristly, I was pulling unchewable chunks out of mouth. That's up there with finding hair in my food. Gak. Only the duck quesadilla was outstanding, but not so much so as to redeem this place and make me want to put up with this whole ridulous experience ever again. 

They must have just opened yeasterday. Oh wait, no they didn't.

Seriously? Jeeze, guys.
