This business makes me mad every time. I've called 4 different times placed orders 3 times and the 4 was told they had plenty of ALL their tamales. Drove all they way their on my way home from Scottsdale to laveen. And they are ALWAYS closed early even though I had called an hour earlier and placed an order. And the time I made it in before they randomly close shop after being told they had plenty of ALL their tamales every item I asked for they were out of.
