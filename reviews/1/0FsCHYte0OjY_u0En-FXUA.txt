First mexican food I tried in Arizona it was bland and tasteless! Really, I was extremely disappointed and this place was recommended!!  It was pricey for dinner and so not worth the money, I have to say I may try it again maybe I ordered the wrong thing!!  Lovely atmosphere, friendly staff but husband and I both were disappointed, we both had something different.  I see the commercials and wonder where they were when I was there.  How can you mess up tacos?????
