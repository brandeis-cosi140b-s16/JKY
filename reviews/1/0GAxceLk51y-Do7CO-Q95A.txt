Let me do you a favor by saying, "DO NOT EAT HERE!" This has been, by far, my worst food experience ever. Granted, it is Mexican fast food but in all honesty, this makes Taco Bell look like Michelin rated restaurant. 

Let me tell you all the things that went terribly wrong...

- All of the food servers seemed like they wanted be somewhere else. I get it. Working in the food service industry, let alone fast food, is not everyone's ideal job. Again, I get it. I was there too. But to take it out on someone's order is not the way to go. Our server took every ingredient and practically threw them onto our plates. By the end it was a big sloppy mess. Which brings me to my next point. 

-I got the burrito bowl and it was practically a soup. Since our server was throwing our plates together, she didn't drain out the extra liquid from the veggies/pico de gallo. I had about an inch of liquid at the bottom of my bowl. That's a big no no.

- The ice machine was broken. Ok, not a huge deal but this was not the only thing broken.

- Apparently their grill was "broken" so we couldn't order the quesadillas. But lo and behold, minutes later, it starts working again for other customers. I get that sometimes things are out of the employees control but seeing as this was not the only thing wrong with this place, I was not happy. 

- The food was just not good. Maybe it was because the ingredients didn't seem fresh or because it wasn't prepared properly but, as I stated before, I would rather go to Taco Bell a thousand times over this place just based on their food. 

Overall, this place was a big NO. How they manage to stay here based on the feedback customers have gave is beyond me. I've never been to a Moe's before this and because of the horrible experience I've had here, I doubt I will ever go to another Moe's again.
