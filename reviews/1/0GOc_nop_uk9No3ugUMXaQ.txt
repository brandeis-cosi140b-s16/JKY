Terrible experience there today. I got our food to go, and it was packaged improperly. Refried beans got all over everything-- everything in the same bag and my vehicle. The lettuce on the tacos de carne asada was cooked, and the chorizo cheese dip was atrocious. The container was quite literally half filled with orange grease. It was disgusting. It's sitting, uneaten, on my counter right now, and I paid $4 for said dip.  Finally, most of the food was too salty to eat.  I was never head-over-hills for this place, but now I will never go again.
