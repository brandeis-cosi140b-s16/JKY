ewe awful awful place to eat.  Went otday for lunch and disapointed as soon as we walked in the door.  The decorations are native american with ugly southwest curtains - not mexican.  The "temp" menu says "home made chips" they were NOT and they were stale.

I tried to order a combo#1 with the red sauce on the side and I was told no so I said what if I don't like your sausce and then my food is covered in it and i can't eat.  Still no.  ok fine so I ordered a $3.50 taco.  

Then the waitress had the nerve to ask me if I tried to red sauce.  UM Hello?? from where was I supposted to try it from?  She din't bring me any!!  Maybe from the side that i wasn't allowed to order??  Disapointing. Doesn't live up to the hype.  Don't go there.
