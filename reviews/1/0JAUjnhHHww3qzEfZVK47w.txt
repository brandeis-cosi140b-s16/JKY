Went for dinner passing thru town in January. Had the salmon. Was quite good. Went again in June. The salmon was WAY, I mean WAY overcooked. It was so overcooked it was tuff. I told the waitress the person who prepared it was a complete novice. She offered to have it redone. I said OK, and to tell them to actually put some "blackened" spices on it! Although on the second round it was cooked properly, the food prep person just added (obvious) salt to the salmon, instead of actually putting a reasonable portion of "blackened" spices on it. Although it is a pleasant, interesting restaurant in terms of ambience, the owner is apparently too cheap to hire (or train) competent food prep staff.
