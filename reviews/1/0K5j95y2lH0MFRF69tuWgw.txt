We love love love chipotle but, this is the absolute worst location we've ever been to. The cashier carried a dripping garbage bag through the kitchen which was pretty gross. When we got to the counter to order they were basically out of three different kinds of meat. As we got to the second part of our ordering process the woman told us that they were out of cheese and it would be about a 15 minute wait. A 15 minute wait for cheese? Bring up what you're shredding as you shred it. No apology and you bet they were quick to slap that $1.95 guacamole charge on us when we added it to make up for not having cheese. Never ever going back to this location. Never!
