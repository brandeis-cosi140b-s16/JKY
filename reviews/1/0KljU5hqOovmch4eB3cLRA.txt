A Poem.

I was feeling really lousy and 
thought it was because I hadn't 
eaten in over 24 hours
since my stomach had yet
to recover from yesterday's 
disaster of a lunch.
So I ate a light salad
now I feel even worse.
It's possible the disgusting meal I 
forced down at Arriba yesterday 
which left my dining companion
and me with 
what we thought 
was severe indigestion 
has actually spurred a mild 
case of food poisoning
