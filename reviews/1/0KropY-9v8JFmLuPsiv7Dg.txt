Dirty!! Smelly!!

Walked in and the first thing that hit me was the smell..omg!!! Cigarette and toilet piss.. no joke i felt like I walked into a freaking smokers house . All the tables were filthy dirty. wth!! Dissatisfaction to the fullest.. I just hope the owner wakes the fuck up and turns this place around... food was good tho. 


Ps: no fumen en el restaurante pendejos.!!!
