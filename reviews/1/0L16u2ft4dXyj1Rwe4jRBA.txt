I was instantly confused by the decor at La Paz. The sprawling blue bar looks completely out of place compared to the rest of the dining area. I ordered the Mexican flag trio of enchiladas, and none of the three varieties were good. The flavors of tamarind chicken citrus filet was extremely overpowering and sweet. And the margaritas were not great either. I won't be back to La Paz.
