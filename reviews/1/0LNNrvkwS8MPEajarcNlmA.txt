I am an avid Chiptole fan, but never have I had as terrible service as I did today at this location. 

I used the online ordering method to order my food for my lunch. My email confirmation said that my food would be ready at 2:45. We arrived at 2:45 on the dot, ready to pick up our food. Upon telling the cashier that we ordered online, she argued with me saying there was no online order in her system. I then told her I had an email confirmation. She then "went to the back" and appeared with none other than my order sheet that had not been fulfilled. She then handed it to the person at the beginning of the assembly line to start making it and asked me if I was ready to pay, after I had already told her I had paid for it online. 

The person making our order made the first thing wrong and we asked him to correct it, that was actually the least of my concerns, that happens, I get that. So then we just asked him if it would be easier for us to just tell him what we ordered. They then went through the line to make our order but for some reason were moving at the slowest pace I have ever seen at any Chiptole location, there was no sense of urgency and I had placed my order over a half hour before arriving, mind you, there was no line, which is rare for any Chiptole, so it really made no sense that our service was this poor. 

We asked the girl at the cashier what we could do differently so that this wouldn't happen again and her response was that sometimes their system doesn't link up to whatever system is in the back and that was why our order wasn't ready. We left at 3:07. 

So an order I placed at 2:20, was supposed to be ready at 2:45, and we left at 3:07. That is 22 minutes for an order that was placed online. 

I will not be going to that Chiptole ever again. And will defintely think twice before ordering online with you guys, very disappointing. :(
