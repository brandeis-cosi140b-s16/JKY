The new location on Chandler Blvd is not very good. We've only eaten there once in April and will wait another 2-3 months (if it's still in business) and give it one more chance. The others I ate at on Central Ave, and Washington St were always very good.

The new reataurant had crummy service, and mediocre food. The tables were dirty when we sat down and the salsa was old, dried out, and we had to ask for fresh salsa. It was also hard to get a glass of water

The food was very BLAND and not worth even discussing. No taste, or anything mentionalble. Is it that hard to mess up tostadas and tamales? Apparently so.. It took 30 minutes to get the check after pleading numerous times.. The place was well staffed so that can't be used as an excuse..

Go across the street to Secreto for good south western food.. This location will fold if it remains this bad
