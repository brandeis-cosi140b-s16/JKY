Friday July 24th I invited my coworkers seven of them for Happy Hour arrived 2:35pm we were greeted rudely after sitting for several minutes place was empty just about, so no reason what we experienced the rest of the afternoon dishes were piling up we couldn't get service like drinks or salsa awful experience food and drinks excellent won't be back. Hopefully management see's this post and checks out camera's these three female employees were even laughing at my coworkers! No name tags that i could see. Last experience was nothing like this it was on Sunday before this day with my son and granddaughter the waitress was AWESOME KIM WAY TO GO if I come back I'll make sure she is working! Management needs address these employees!
