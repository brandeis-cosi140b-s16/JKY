Quick To-go service is not so "Pronto."  

Tequileria is located right in the center of all concourses at Charlotte Airport while you are crossing over gates to catch your next flight, you will not miss it in the corner.

Had the Jicama Salad that sounded SOOoooOOOoo very good in the description, I had to have it to-go on my flight home.

Firstly, the salad took forever...Almost twenty minutes in the "Quick To-Go" area dubbed as "Pronto" service.  

The only thing that I asked for extra is for them to add grilled chicken to the salad.  

Once I got to the gate, I was expecting this crisp and refreshing Jicama and nice luscious lettuce blend with some tomatoes and cheese.  But instead, I found myself some shredded iceberg lettuce that looks like its used to top their tacos and several strips of Jicama and some diced tomatoes and shredded cheese.  That is it!  So very bland and the chicken was paper thin to say the very least.  BleAahhHHh...  On top of that, I got to my gate and realized there wasn't even dressing in the bag...so I sucked it up and just ate it because I already bought it and was hungry and there was no turning back to get dressing (which in the description, it was tossed in).  

Uhhh...Never again...BLeaHhHhh...
