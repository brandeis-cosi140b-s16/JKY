Went to Moe's tonight for the $5 Moesday promotion. Went with several friends, we got there at 8:50 only to discover that the door was locked. The store hours posted on the door said 9PM closing. What lousy customer relations. We went to Chipolte and had a great experience. Moe's you lost 4 customers tonight.
