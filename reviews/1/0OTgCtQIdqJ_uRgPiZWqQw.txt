Well went out with my wife to try some new Mexican restaurant and this was a bad choice.  We walked in and expected something nicer from the outside.  We sat there about ten minutes with no contact from anyone until the busser brought us a bowl of chips and salsa.  Can I just say that the salsa did not taste fresh nor unique.  Well had to wait another ten minutes while we watched the busser clean two table before even asking us for a drink order.

Now we wait for at least 15 more minutes, to the point we almost got up and left but we were hungry.  The older gentleman, that was our waiter, sneaked up and just asked "what can i get you"?  Didn't even introduce him self nor recommended anything.  The food was well BLAH.  My taco was soggy on the bottom and all the filling fell out.  The enchilada was hard to eat due to the over cooked shredded beef.

Well here is where they really messed up.  We sat there with our napkins on our plates for at least 15 min before being presented with the check, from the hostess.  Now we got up to go pay for the meal and the waiter had the audacity to stop my wife and ask her if he can help her with anything insinuating that we were trying to walk out on the bill.  Dude I had the check in my hand.  Even worse he began talking Spanish to the hostess saying "I thought they were trying to leave", once again Dude I speak fluent Spanish.

I can defiantly say we will never be back to this run down, want-to-be Mexican restaurant.  Lo siento pero nunca voy a regresar.
