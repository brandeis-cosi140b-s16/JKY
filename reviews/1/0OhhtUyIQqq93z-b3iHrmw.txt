If you want good Del Taco - do NOT go to this unit! Their 1/2 pound burritos are the size of the $.69 cent burritos - they consistantly range from 5 to 6 ounces instead of 8. Which means for every two burritos you buy, they save the cost of one! They skimp on cheese, red/green sauce, sour cream, tomatos, beans and meat. The hard tacos are always broken in half so its impossible to eat, and they are all lettuce with a dab of meat and a few strands of cheese. Since the Hollywoood Video/GameCrazy next door closed they are really cutting corners including using the .69 cent tortillas on the .99 cent burritos. CiCi Pizza is opening where the GC/HWV was...it does not bode well for this unit. If you want GOOD Del Taco...stay away from this unit...go to Bruce & E. Charleston - THEY make Del Taco the way it SHOULD be!
