My wife and I come to Sandbar all the time,  but it's not for the food or the bar (which are both disgusting) . Sat at the bar to have breakfast and watch part of the game Sunday. Bar tender gal handed us plates the had some type of brown juice floating in them. I showed her, and she said gross and apologized. I asked for a box to take the rest of my cold potatoes and burrito home in and the same juice was in that container too. What are the chance? Flies everywhere on the sticky bar. Sure I have a lot of check ins here, buts it's for the $4 margaritas and people watching, during happy hour then we race home to shower. Waitresses are always good. We've never had a problem with any of them. I only recommended this place for a drink and some chips and salsa and people watching. If you want any type of decent food go somewhere elsewhere.
