First off, if you're coming here expecting a nice restaurant, don't bother, it's just another POS generic strip mall joint. Beyond that, I can't speak to the quality of the food because I wasn't ever able to try it. It doesn't matter how many hand scrawled signs you put on your front door advertising new hours, if your website and all your adverts say you're open till 9:00 people are going to expect you to be open till 9:00. If you want to close at the ridiculous hour of 6:00 PM then fine, but Maybe change your website first.
