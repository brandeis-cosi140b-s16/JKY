This is the worst Toxic Hell I have ever been to so that is saying something.

I ordered a Diet Pepsi and a Mexican Pizza. The soda tasted like the line or nozzle hadn't been clean in, well, EVER. And the pizza was thrown into the box with contents hanging out and getting on the bag and napkin. I was hungry so I started eating it anyway. It tasted like plastic. Seriously. I couldn't eat it.

I went from starving to no appetite in the matter of a few seconds.

It was that bad.

If this location shared their secrets to corporate, they'd make millions off of the Taco Bell Diet: "Try our food and lose your stomach! Literally!â„¢"
