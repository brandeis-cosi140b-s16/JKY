This place is the absolute worst. If your looking for good Mexican food I would not suggest it. To begin with the two girls working at the front are extremely rude. Their treatment to me and my guests was very disturbing. When we finally sat down after a 1 hour wait (we were 4 people) no one had shown up to take our orders for a long while. The inside decor is also very ugly & not pleasing. Then when we finally ordered the food took ages to get here. I got a huge meat burrito and when I started digging in the food was cold & not seasoned well. We ended up paying way too much for food that was not worth the price and service that was inconvenient. Also, to top it all off, on our way out a stranger in front of us was also leaving, stood to the side by a tree, and threw up. It was disgusting. I am never coming back here again.
