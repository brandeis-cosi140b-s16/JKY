The tacos are really good but customer service is sometimes bad. You seat yourself and they always have little kids running around in the lobby. Today it was a lady at the counter showing pics on her phone to 2 of the workers and completely ignoring my presence until i walked to the counter to order my food. They employes are nice there customer service is just horrible. They would get a negative star if there tacos were not so good
