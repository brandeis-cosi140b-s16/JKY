The good food is ABSOLUTELY destroyed by then CONSTANT WAIT!!  I've never been through the drive-thru where I haven't had to turn off my car and wait for up to 20 minutes to get to the window.  The sweet stuff is always kind and helpful, but you can tell they do not want to pay the money to stuff it appropriately. Which makes me choose not to go there when I need fast service, unfortunately.
