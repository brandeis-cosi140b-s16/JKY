Definitely not on my list of favorites. The cashier was not at all friendly, they didn't have any menudo on a Sunday and I didn't care for the flavor of the food. 

First off, I went in wanting menudo. The sign stated that they had menudo on Saturdays and Sundays. Well, we went in on a Saturday night/ Sunday morning and they didn't have any menudo. Didn't help that the cashier was not at all friendly. This place just rubbed me the wrong way from the moment we walked in. Probably because the cashier looked pissed from the moment we walked in. We had just gotten off of work and wanted an easy meal and that was the reception we received.

The food in itself wasn't spectacular. The taco meat was very bland. They got my order wrong for the enchiladas. I ordered beef enchiladas and received pork enchiladas which were also bland in flavor. 

I won't be going back to this place. Too many options in the area to stick with a bad one.
