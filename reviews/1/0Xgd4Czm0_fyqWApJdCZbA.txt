Over priced Mexican food that's just OK.  The only Mexican restaurant where you pay for chips and salsa.  Service was poor and slow. Our waiter spent most of his time flirting with the women at the next table.  He totally forgot that we existed. When our food finally arrive it was Luke warm and we had to ask the waiter to provide silverware.  Will not be returning to this restaurant.
