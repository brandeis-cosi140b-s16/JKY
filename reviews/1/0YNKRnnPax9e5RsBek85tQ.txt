Came here on my lunch break for a simple $5 meal. I waited in the drive thru for no less than 20 minutes. The last five minutes of waiting took place AFTER I had finally paid. TOO SLOW!!! You would think in all that time I would get my meal the way I asked, without lettuce. But they actually went and put extra lettuce. So rediculous. Never had problems at this Fili B's before until today. Not going back.
