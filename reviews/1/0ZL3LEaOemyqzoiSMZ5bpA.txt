I was not even going to give this place a star.  The service was horrible, it took over 10 minutes for someone to approach us to take our beverage order, then it took another 10 minutes to get the drinks, which should have been our cue to leave.

We then ordered chips and salsa to start, which again took forever to get to us, then why we continued to order more was beyond me, but we did, which included the queso poblano dip, nothing exciting to write about, in addition to two very small tacos, which were ok, and then some potstickers, which my son said were horrible, and I took a bit and he was right.  Anyway, I will spare you the rest, just don't recommend going here, and we live in Vegas, and could recommend several other places that do a better job.   Very disappointed!
