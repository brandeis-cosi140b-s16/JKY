satan himself could not have dreamed of a more dreadful dead end shit hole as this. Nor would satan have made a worse taco. how is it possible to screw up a taco? its a tortilla with meat, onions, cilantro, and sauce of some sort. however, dos gringos managed to screw up at its most basic level. i couldn't eat those poor excuses of tacos. anyone claiming that they're ok should be in an institution or better yet, fed to an animal.

as far as people that lurk around this place, those poor bastards look like rejects from the worst of the worst from the college gene pools. the most unattractive group i've seen in ages.

by all means, stay away from this place unless you love eating terrible food and like hanging out with less than stellar people.
