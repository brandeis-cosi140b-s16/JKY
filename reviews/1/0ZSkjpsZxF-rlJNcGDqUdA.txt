This was the singularly worst meal and dining experience I have had in a very long time.

The menu promises there will be a great meal here. The actual experience is extremely different. We ordered our meals and waited an hour for them to arrive. Our waiter was absent during this time. When our meals arrived via a different waiter the food was all lukewarm. My chile relleno was so small and unrecognizable I thought they forgot it. It consisted of small flat piece of pepper covered with a tasteless sauce and some sort of cheese. The tamale was cold, filled with unseasoned ground beef and quite tasteless itself.  We never received our check until we stood up to leave. Then our waiter magically materialized, for the first time since taking our order over an hour earlier. 

Try any other Mexican restaurant, even Taco Bell, before going here.
