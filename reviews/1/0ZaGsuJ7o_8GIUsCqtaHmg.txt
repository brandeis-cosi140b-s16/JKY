TERRIBLE. First off the food is mediocre at best, very bland just not much flavor to it. I've had a chicken burrito, steak burrito, and taquitos and none of them impressed me. The service has gone down the drain the past few months, employees are rude. Today I got a vitamin water and asked for a water cup and the cashier says "you can only use that for water" if I wanted a soda I would have gotten a soda cup, not a vitamin water and a water cup. Next, I like a little sour cream however most places put a lot, so I asked for it on the side so my burrito wouldn't get drenched in sour cream, I Got charged for having it on the side. This place sucks, stick to chipotle, food is so much better!
