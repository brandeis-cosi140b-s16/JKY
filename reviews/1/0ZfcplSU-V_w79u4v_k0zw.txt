I rarely give one star reviews, but Filiberto's was horrible! I mean, really, how can you mess up Mexican food? 

The hubby and I decided to stop in here after seeing that the sandwich shop next door is no more (very disappointing, by the way).  First off, there was nobody at the counter and the place seemed to be deserted.  When we finally got somebody to come out and help us, both employees were extremely rude.  No smiles, not even a "may I help you".  She just looked at us as if we were an annoyance.  My first thought was that considering that two other restaurants in the strip mall had gone out of business recently, you'd think they would be trying to keep some business...anyway...on to the food.

I decided to go with the carnitas torts since I had been hoping for a sandwich.  The carnitas were horrible...very fatty and not flavorful at all.  I couldn't even eat it.  The hubby ordered the two carne asada burrito plate so I decided to take one of his burritos.  Another big mistake. The carne asada was just as bad as the carnitas.

Needless to say, we won't be returning...
