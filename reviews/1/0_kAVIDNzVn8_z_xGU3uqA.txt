Years ago I ate here at least once a week and it was great.  So, I decided to stop by and pick-up a to go order.  I got the 3 taco dinner and was really disappointed.  The tacos were so-so at best and there was maybe a tablespoon of rice with the meal.  The dinner was $14 and not worth $4.  The most disappointing thing was the pico de gallo which was obviously very old and smelled like vinegar.  I hate it when an old favorite goes bad and no one seems to care.  I truly doubt if I will ever go there again.


And so endeth the lesson.
