Drinking water cause they got the pepsi.  Food came out uncooked,  slow service. Server tried to tell me thats how it is.  really you serve mexican food with cheese that isn't melted?  No visit from a manager or anything. this is a place in need of a visit from restaurant impossible.  I won't be going back.
