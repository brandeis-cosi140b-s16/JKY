i am not sure if any of you try the deivery . It's a damn joke. The person that takes your order has very poor communication skills and it takes forever to get the food. The driver was pleasant but the food was cold and the order was wrong. This is the 3rd time I have tried to order fro here. EVERY time it has been like trying to order from a monkey.
