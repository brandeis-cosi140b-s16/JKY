Horrible greeting, horrible wait staff.  Arrived for dinner, informed 15 minutes wait.  Was told if space was available in the bar, we could take it.  After 20 minutes a bar table opened, we were promptly informed that the table was about to be used for someone else and they DEMANDED that we leave the table.  As we were leaving the table, the hostess shouted to my husband you should make a reservation next time.  With her bad attitude we took our business down the street to Blue.  The food at BLUE was amazing and I would recommend Mitchell as your server.
