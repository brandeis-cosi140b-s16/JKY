I have been to Vida a handful of times since I've lived in Charlotte, over the course of two years.  When Vida had a 60 minute wait, my boyfriend and I went to Vida Vida, right next door.  While at the restaurant service was great and food was delicious, I had the fajita and ground beef taco.  That night and the entire next day I was experienced the worst case of food poising, violently getting sick (coming out of both ends).  Unfortunately I will never return to either restaurant, after being scared with this experience. FYI.  Be cautious the food you get there.
