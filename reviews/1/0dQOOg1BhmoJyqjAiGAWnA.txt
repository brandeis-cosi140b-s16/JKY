This one star is because if how I was treated there. After walking in the heat with a group of friends we stopped in for food. No air conditioning!! Just hot air blowing, and in Vegas this isn't a good thing. 

I started to feel very lightheaded waiting for a log time in the huge crowd to order. There was no drinking fountain in site and I had to ask three people for a cup of water, because I could feel that I was going to pass out. They said they were out and I asked if they had ANYTHING to put water in, a lid, a chip tray, and they said no, and refused me anything even though I told them I was going to pass out and saw a stack of cups behind the counter. 

I found a chip tray and drank from the fountain drinks water tap. By then it was kind of too late. I had to find a seat and try to chill out because I was on the verge of blacking out, my vision was blurry. So, never going back.
