Dear Server at the Sandbar,

"Yes" is the correct answer to the question"does your guacamole have cilantro in it?"  Your answer "no it totally doesn't", along with the lighting that rendered me unable to see said guacamole, led to me waking up the next day with eyes swelled shut!  Thanks for that.  Also, and this is just a bonus tip, if a customer outright tells you they are allergic to cilantro, you might want to ask the kitchen not to sprinkle it over EVERYTHING ON THE PLATE! You see I, the customer, am blissfully unaware of what the kitchen uses to garnish plates.  You, the server, should not be!  So maybe you could hook a sister up and ask them to leave it off.  I did, after all, tell you I was allergic to it less than 2 minutes ago.  This might help with your tips.

With warmest regards, and no bitterness whatsoever,
Steph
