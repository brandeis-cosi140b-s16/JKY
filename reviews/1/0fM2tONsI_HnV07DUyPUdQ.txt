There are 3 things I don't like in life...people who tell me II am not experiencing what I have just experienced....roaches...and roaches in my food.  Unfortunately, I experienced all three tonight.   My husband, my son and I sat outside and ordered fajita's, shrimp diablo, and taco's with pork carnita's.  My son's toppings and refried beans came with the usual lettuce, guacamole and pico.  In addition, there was a still somewhat alive cockroach in his beans.  He fished it out and its legs and antennae were still moving around a little.  When I told the manager he did not believe us and said it must have "flown" in.  We don't think so.  It wasn't a flying type.   

Other than that,  the service was indifferent, the soupy beans had hot dogs in them and the shrimp sauce was a watery mess.  Beware.
