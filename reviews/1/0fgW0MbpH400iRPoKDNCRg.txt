Hey its Cinco de Mayo thought I Would try a Chipolte .... never been....this location was disgusting....tables weren't wiped clean, floors dirty to where your shoes stuck to them,  There was a huge container of sour cream obviously dropped floor spill 5 feet long and not cleaned up had to step around....

I should have paid attention to the low rating on inspection....the work space where food was was filthy...workers spent more time telling each other what to do than helping customers......

Fresh I dont think so.....I will never go back to this location.....where the heck is the manager to allow this to go on.................

Chipotle as a franchise should inspect this store as they are representing their brand......What a horrible experience in uncleanliness.....yikes.....don't bother going here....find another !!!
