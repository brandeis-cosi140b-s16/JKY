I was drawn to this Yelp page by a highlighted review that said "medium priced" so I went to their yuppie-shmuppie, faux-mexican, overpriced menu.  I remembered the slogan of the now defunct Karem's from my childhood in San Antonio:  "Mexican food don't cost nuthin".

Read these reviews and if faus gras empanadas and watermelon basil mojitos appeal to you, go for it.  I am going to La Canasta or Los Dos Molinos.
