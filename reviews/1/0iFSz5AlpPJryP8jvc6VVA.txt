EVERYTIME I go here I say to myself, LAST TIME. I have given this place too many chances to redeem themselves. Service is horrible. The staff there speak better english than they put off. When they "try to" fix their mistakes, never do they offer to be of further assistance and they try to pretend they dont speak good english. I suppose they dont know a smile is the same in all languages and can speak a thousand words. They are not helpful in providing food either. Too much small print for food that costs them nearly nothing. ie. chips are only served if its after ten am, you spend more than six dollars, you get your food for dine in (even though you wait FAR too long for your food), drink orders etc. The prices are outragous for mexican food, you would at least expect to be served kindly. Four dollars for a regular sized burrito that I can make in my kitchen for probobly .50 cents and a priceless amount of kindness is no charge! Dont dare ask for anything special like "light ice" or extra salsa (even though they are served in one ounce looking containers). You will get the evil eye with the side of excuses in another language I dont even believe is spanish.  THE only reason they are still in business is their location. HOWEVER, jack in the box is a four star next to them.
