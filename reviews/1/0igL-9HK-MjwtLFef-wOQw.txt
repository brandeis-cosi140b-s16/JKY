I only give one star if they hurt me. This was the worst experience I've paid for since my last airplane flight, and my worst time at a restaurant in recent memory.

The prices are average for this sort of place. The food is not bad. It tends to the watery side of things. We tried a beef dish and juevos rancheros. The eggs were runny in limpid gravy, and the beef wasn't bad but had some gristle. Their homemade hot sauce is very good. The source of pain was not the food but the atmosphere. The young daughter of the guy behind the counter shrieked almost constantly the entire time we were there--a little over ten minutes waiting to get our food, and then the ten minutes it took us to wolf it down so we could escape. An acquaintance of the guy had a young boy, who also shrieked. Five people sat around a table without food and talked about upselling.

I left with a headache from the shrieking and a bellyache from eating too quickly. Maybe I'll try takeout sometime--but I'll give the other Mexican places around here a shot first.

To be fair, this place would be awesome if you have horrible children.
