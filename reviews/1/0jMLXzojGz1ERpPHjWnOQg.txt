I went here on my way home from a graveyard shift. I arrive at about 6:15 am. As I pull up, the cashier was pretty nice, she told me they had just opened up and the food would take a little longer to make and I said it was fine since I was in no rush, just tired. I get my bean and cheese burrito and take a few bites when I get home and it was cold. It was then I realized that their food isn't actually fresh, but just heated up and served. You'd think they'd take the time to completely reheat their food before serving. The cheese wasn't even melted so you know it wasn't lying. I call the place and the cashier told me I could come back for a refund or just get another burrito. I wasn't rude at all and she was rather nice so I wasn't mad. I just threw away the burrito and fell asleep. I woke up sick to my stomach and wasn't in the mood for any food. I then go back to Vaqueros and let them know I had prior arrangements to come in get a refund. It was a different cashier this time she was a little snappy (meanwhile she was rocking some fake Chanel earrings and the LV logo tattooed all over her arm like she can afford it). I wasn't rude at all. Generally I handle situations like these positively because I know how it is to work in customer service. She was rather rude and said they don't do refunds and I told her I didn't want food because I was sick from their cold food already but I just let her know I would come back another day. I come back the next day and try to get food but this time, it was different cashier who was also snappy and she said "you already came and got your food." When I didn't.. I let her know I didn't and eventually they have me a new burrito. I was just so displeased with my service from there that I threw away my burrito. I vow never to go back to this business and I hope my experience influence a few other Yelper's!
