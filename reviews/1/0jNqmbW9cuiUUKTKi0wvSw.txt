We recently debated if you'd come back to a place for good food but bad service or bad food and great service. Answer found here - service doesn't win out over bad food. Too salty. Ckn tacos were limp greasy tortillas filled with mashed bland chicken - looked like baby food. Rice dreadful. Chimichanga the size of a small enchilada. Do people really wait in line in so phx for this?  Too many good alternatives to come here twice.  And we're usually pretty forgiving...
