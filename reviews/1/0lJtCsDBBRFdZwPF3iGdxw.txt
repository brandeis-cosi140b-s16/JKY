Customer service is terrible! 
I went in and placed an order to go. I ordered two Menudos (sin pata/no feet). Got home to find that both cups of "menudo" were filled with bones and PATA, and hardly any actual menudo in the soup. I called right away and told them that they got my order wrong, they told me to go back that same day and they would refund my cash. So I went back later in the evening only to be told that they will not refund me my money. I didn't even eat the Menudo because I had to save it all day to show them the "proof".
