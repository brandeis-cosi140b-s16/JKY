Terrible food with lousy sevice.

 It all started with cold chips and salsa that tasted like they had dumped a salt shaker in it so didn't have chips and salsa a staple in any mexican tex/mex restaurant.

Then I ordered port street tacos ....they were awful as were the beans and rice.
The avocado slice was slightly brown and the slice of lime looked like someone
had taken a bite out of it.

There was NO flavor in anything and I mentioned that my napkin tasted better than the food .... the waitress ( or at least that was her title) must have heard me and told management because a guy comes to the table and asks how everything was so I 
told him !! He just replied OH...I also told him we would NEVER be back and he replied OH again.

Had I not been in the middle of moving and starving I would have left and gone to Panda Express right next door !!!

Trust me ....Taco Bell would have been much better !!!!
