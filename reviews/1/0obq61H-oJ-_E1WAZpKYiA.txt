Garbage. Pre cooked meat in a non working steam table. Confusing choices. Grocery store tortillas. My tacos were ice cold. So if you are in the mood for some tasteless cold tacos this is the place for you. And to top it off their fancy Coca Cola dispensing robot only dispenses water and tea. So if you would like to wash down your cold tacos with a nice refreshing draft soda..... Forget it.
