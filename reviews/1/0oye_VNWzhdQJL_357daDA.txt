This was the worst dining experience I have ever had in Las Vegas. The food was not that good and the portions were small. It's like they're trying to be so upscale, but not pulling it off.  I know some of the reviews are good, so maybe it was just a bad night, or we ordered the wrong thing. This was the opinion of 3 out of 4 of us. Wish I had given my $$'s to feed the homeless!
