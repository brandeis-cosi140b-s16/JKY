Used to love this place, a family favorite. Until my last experience, I ordered a breakfast burrito. The waiter brought a bean and rice burrito. I advised her that I ordered a breakfast burrito and she took the burrito back to the kitchen and brought me back a jalapeño burrito. I thought it was a sick joke from the cook. A burrito with at least 20 jalapeños in it!!! I told the waiter I'm not eating this and I'm not paying for it and left...haven't been back since.
