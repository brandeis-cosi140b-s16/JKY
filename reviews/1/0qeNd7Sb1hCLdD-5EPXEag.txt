Went to Filiberto's because I wanted fish tacos. Was very disappointed because the fish tasted as if it was sitting out for hours maybe even days, and recooked. I took one bite and that was it. When I approached the workers not only did they deny that the fish was bad, but they refused to give me an order of something else at no cost. Very disappointed and never going back!
