There is no way I can eat a smothered carne asada burrito with green sauce.  I could barely eat any of it, it was too spicy.  I like to enjoy my food, not have heartburn for DAYS.  Please re-think your sauce selection, and it would be nice if you let your customers know that the green sauce will blow you out of the water!
