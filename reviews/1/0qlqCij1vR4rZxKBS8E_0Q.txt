This place really sucks!!!!! I also was so looking forward to a good taco joint in this side of town, but this place a total disappointment! I ordered two tacos and the lady at the front suggested we order the super tacos. I expected big tacos, but instead I got a really small portion. The meat had no flavor and the tortilla was hard. They also had no napkins. For being a new place, we expected them to be at the top of their game. Serving fresh quality food. If I could give this place zero stars I would! We are not coming back!
