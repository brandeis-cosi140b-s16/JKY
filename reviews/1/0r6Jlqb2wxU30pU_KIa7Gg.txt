After tonight, f--- del taco! First of all, the workers were acting sketchy right off the bat.. After buying my meal, i get half way through when i bite into a nice big piece of hair! So i call the location about 3-4 times, no voicemail available or anything, probably shaving someone's head for the next person who orders some food.. I will never go to this place again
