Was working nearby got 2 Carne Assad burritos, first visit food was good no complaints.  But last Thursday 4-2-15 got the same thing but one burrito no onions.  I had onions on my burrito and used the green sauce my co-worker had the same burrito but didn't have onions or use green sauce.  I GOT FOOD POISONING 3 hours later and was puking my guts out.  I will never eat here again and may in fact be contacting the AZ department of health to investigate their food handling practices.
