My fianc√© and I were SO excited to try this restaurant. When we moved down here during the summer it was closed for construction, so the anticipation of this restaurant built up. 

1. We we got there we were seated very quickly. We were greeted at our table very quickly with chips and salsa (very nice display). The salsa was terrible. It's sad when you go to a Mexican restaurant and look forward to the chips and salsa and they can't even get that right. 

2. After we were greeted with our waters, chips and salsa, the waiter came fairly quickly to greet us again. By this time we have mentioned two times that this was our first time there. The waiter told us he would give us a couple minutes to look over the menu and he would be back to help if needed. We sat there and decided what we wanted and then we sat there, and sat there, and sat there.... 20 minutes went by since the last time our server came to greet us. We watched him bus a table right behind us. We watched him talk to multiple tables. We watched him greet guests at the front, seat them, and give them menus. We finally decided to get up and leave and even then he STILL didn't notice us. 

We let the hostess know and then we left. Very, very disappointing.
