Don't, just don't.

Warmed over (barely) and stale Mexican fare at astonishingly high prices, with a side of horrible service.

I've walked past this restaurant on trips between concourses C and D in the Charlotte Douglas Airport and thought, "next time." Now I've stopped there and will now think, "never again."

Expectations for airport restaurants are pretty low; Tequileria lowers the bar another notch.
