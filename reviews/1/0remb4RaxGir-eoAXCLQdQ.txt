My family has been dining here for years and been able to tolerate the pathetic service since the food is unique.....however, we have noticed a steady decline in what little service and respect you may or may not receive! Don't waste your time with this restaurant unless you like being treated with absolute disrespect!! And if you have any questions about the service or food.. Don't bother asking. You will only be ignored and lied to. The food is good, but not worth the hassle of wasting your time and money to be treated like garbage. The staff is rude, and the mangers are not professional or courteous enough to address any concerns you may have!! All you will be paying for is a horrible experience and a headache to go!!! Stay away!!!!
