The food was delicious both times I ate at this restaurant but unfortunately I also got food poisoning both times. I ate there for dinner last night. I was up all night throwing up and rushing to the restroom. I had to leave work this morning. Disappointed to say I don't trust this place anymore.
Ramiro's on 107th and indianschool right next to brothers pizza is my go to spot. Never made me sick and the mini tacos are delicious.
