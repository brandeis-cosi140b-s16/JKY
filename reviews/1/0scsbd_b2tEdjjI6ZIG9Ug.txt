This is no Mexican restaurant. First, the chips are like paper, flavorless, cold, stale.  The salsa is partially made from canned tomatoes and taste like it.  No flavor going on at all with the salsa other than canned tomatoes, Even the grenn chli sauces was awful. Trader Joe's sales out of a bottle is better. Next the beans too are lack flavor other than a lot of salt.  They were dry as well. I have the Fajita's, beef. They were oily.  Vegi's were fine, the meat was tough. My son had a bean burrito and they didn't get the order right. Do they apologize for getting wrong? Nope.  All they could say was it wasn't on the order despite the fact the manager took our order because the server failed to helps us out after 10 minutes of waiting. Finally, the food didn't settle well at all.  Overall, I wouldn't suggest that my worse enemy go to this restaurant...that's ain't no Mexican restaurant!  Whoever makes those recipes out to be fired.
