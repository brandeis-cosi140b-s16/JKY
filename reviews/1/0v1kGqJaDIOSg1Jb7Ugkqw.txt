We've lived in AJ for 12 years and was wondering why we hadn't  eaten at Elvira's since we first moved out here.  Now we remember....the food is terrible, chimi  (straight from a grocery store frozen food section) with no cheese, had to ask for the Guacamole and than wished we hadn't.  It was runny and made from a powder I'm sure.  The soft taco was just a uncooked, oil soaked corn tortilla that they charge you $.75 extra for.  My husband took one bite and that was all he could handle.  The food is bland and tasteless and over priced for what you get.  It may not  have been over priced if it was good or even average. Now lets get to the service...there wasn''t any.  We had to beg for silverware after we got our food.  It took forever to get waited on, forever to get our food, even forever to pay the bill.  There were 4 waitresses (the place only has 13 tables.) and it didn't think a one of them knew what they were doing except the girl with the pink hair.  I've been waiting for AJ to get a good restaurant for years..... and it seems my wait is not over.
