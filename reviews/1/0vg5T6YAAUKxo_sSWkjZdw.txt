The Halloween night promotion was dissapointing last night. The lettuce had more flavor than everything else in my bowl. The steak was very bland. No flavor whatsoever. I get it, they had the line out the door. There is no excuse for serving food with no salt in it. Chipotle, for the first time, you got it all wrong.
