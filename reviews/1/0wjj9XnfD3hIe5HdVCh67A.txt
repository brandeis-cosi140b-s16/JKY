Wow..there has been a  reason why we've not been to Macayo's since we moved  here.
The food: Bad. Yes, it's a chain and not authentic . We both ordered the cheese enchiladas. Mine with black beans on the side I found the  the tortillas were hard and stale. Yuck. I thought it was just mine but my husband made the comment so I knew it wasn't me..
The rice was a salty so I used some sour cream to take the edge off. That by the way is a side item, extra cost. It helped. The waitress asked how it was. I spilled the beans and waited for the manager or a remake. Didn't happen. 
The drinks: We sat in the bar to wait for our table to be ready. She was overwhelmed and there was a wait..our table was ready before the drinks. Waited and got them to the table. Pricey for a drink in a soda glass not a Margarita glass. No, we didn't have the ones in the mariachi guy's head..lol.
So, I caught the manager. Told him about the food and the waitress and how there was no remake , etc. He apologized and took the bill. We got a small discount.
Will we be back? The husband has spoken...No. He didn't feel it was worth it even just for drinks. I agree.
