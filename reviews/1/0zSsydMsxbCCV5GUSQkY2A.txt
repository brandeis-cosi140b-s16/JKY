Assad fries are now $9.79.
Now, there wouldn't be a problem coming here and paying that if the quality matched the price. Last time I was here it cost less and the quality was still great. Today how ever was another story. The meat had extra fat and easily identify it as lower quality cuts. If the price didn't go up of they quality change I would mind paying the 8.75 they were charging a few weeks ago. 
I would not be coming here again. A little longer drive for quality food in which you get what you pay for.
Time to look for a new spot
