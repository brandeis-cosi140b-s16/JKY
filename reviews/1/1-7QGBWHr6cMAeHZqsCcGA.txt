One of the worst customer service experiences of my life. Bought a localdines.com certificate for this place and they refused to honor it. They claimed a printed certificate was needed, but that was not stated anywhere on it. They refused to scan the code from my phone, call the number referenced, or simply write the certificate number down. 

Should also note that the service was terrible anyway and the table next to us also complained about going 15 minutes without anyone stopping by their table!
