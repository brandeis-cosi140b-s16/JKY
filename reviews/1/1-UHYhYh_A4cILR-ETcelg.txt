I will NEVER eat here again. With a group of 4, we went for lunch. We are sat right away, that's where the good service ended. They only refilled our beverages once, at the very end of the meal and after we all tried making eye contact with every employee to get water. When we placed the order, the server said we could pay separately at the counter. When we got to the counter, the EXTREMELY RUDE cashier was short with us and said he didn't have time and he was too busy to split our checks. I told him we were told we were able to and he didn't care. One of us ended up paying for everyone and will work out the costs later. I have never dealt with such a rude and ill-mannered cashier. Glad to know I can remove an option from my list when I look for places to spend my lunch.
