Should have listened to the reviews but I was so hungry. 1st of all the address to this Taco Bell lead me elsewhere so knocked off a star. 2nd the girl who was taking my order was not paying attention and I kept repeating my order while  I heard laughing in the background. 3rd I pull up she is speaking with a guest over her headset and rolling her eyes and asking the person behind me to repeat their order so I'm sure she was rolling her eyes and throwing her hands in the air when she took my order. 4th is my order and food is just garbage! My quesadilla was so burnt and bean and cheese burrito just taste like the beans are too well done just overheated! Simply the reviews before said it all the packaging is just thrown in the bag I believe my sister who is 10 can do a better job than this crew did tonight. I won't be back
