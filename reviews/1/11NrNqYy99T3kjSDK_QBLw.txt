i do not understand this place. came with a couple girlfriends because we were STARVING after partying at marquee dayclub and this is the closest place haha

i thought all food tasted good when you were hungry but china poblano proved me wrong...

we ordered a lot of food and everything tasted really bland. the portions were really small and all the dishes were totally overpriced. 

so many other places to eat in the cosmopolitan. SKIP this place
