I will never go back!! TACO BELL has better food then this place and the employees really don't care what you think about there food,
The seating was designed by a 5th grader and they have no booths, the floor is dirty, bathrooms are dirty and the employees don't wash there hands after doing clean up and then touch your food (NASTY). This place is not guest friendly like a bar should be.. They need to call BAR RESCUE and learn how to run a real bar.. Also someone needs to tell then the beer is suppose to be cold and not served at room temp.. Save your money and go to one FIREBIRDS on the other side of the Mall you will be way better off.
