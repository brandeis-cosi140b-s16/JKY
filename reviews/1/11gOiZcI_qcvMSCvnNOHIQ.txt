This is really hard for me. Really, really hard. 

I have been eating here since the place opened, have loved it. Recently, things have been changing. Ingredients, prices, items on the menu. Food has gotten bland, expensive, and on this last trip has made me sick for going on five days now. I do not believe that the kitchen staff is handling meats the correct way, thus giving me food poisoning. 

Jims, if you are reading this, STOP! You guys were AWESOME. Go back to quality ingredients not crap we can buy in the frozen section at Frys. Stop changing the menu. Stop increasing your prices while decreasing your costs by using cheap ingredients. Have some pride in your work again. Bacon is supposed to be crispy and fried, not limp and tasting like it came from a microwave. I will not even comment on the burrito that made me sick because it will just put me back in the bathroom. When something is good, don't change it. I cannot tell you I will be back here again, food poisoning is not something I an inclined to risk again. I would sure hate to see the place close down, but you make your other regulars sick, they likely won't be coming back either.
