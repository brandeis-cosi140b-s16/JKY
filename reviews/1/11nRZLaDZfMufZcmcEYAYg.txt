I used to come here a lot back in my college days but the place seems to really have gone down hill both with the quality of service and the food. The food we had just had no flavor to it hardly, it's kind of expensive to comparable other Mexican restaurants in the area too. The one thing that bothered me when we were there was that there were ants on our table that we had to keep killing so not sure where they were coming from, but it just left a bad experience because it makes you wonder how sanitary the kitchen is behind the scenes. What used to be my favorite Mexican restaurant has now become my least. Definitely won't be back anytime soon.
