Avoid this shop at all costs!  The food was fine, but they were totally dishonest.   We paid for our meal with a Visa, and when we checked our account, we were overcharged.  I had signed the receipt and added a tip, however the worker must have gone back and added more of a tip!  When I called to let the manager know what happened, I got nothing but attitude from her.  She told me that they don't keep any records of sales, and couldn't do anything.  Pay with CASH!
