We had the nachos which were good, they were suppose to have chicken but I think we got one piece of chicken.  The beans were bad, they tasted as though they had just opened the can and poured them on the nachos.  I asked the waitress for some flour tortillas because I believe that flour tortillas tell you a lot about a Mexican restaurant especially those who claim they are authentic, homemade.  Their flour tortillas were AWFUL!!! She gave me like 3 or 4, they were all stuck to each other and these flour tortillas were not homemade.  I have bought some from the store that were way better. Don't bother with this place.
