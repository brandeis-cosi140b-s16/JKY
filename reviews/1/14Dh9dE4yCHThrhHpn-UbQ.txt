Such bland food! The nachos were soggy because they were dripping with refried beans and cheese sauce. Speaking of cheese sauce, why would you have cheese sauce and then melt cheese on top like normal nachos? We added chicken to the nachos, what we received was about a 1/3 of a chicken breast that had no flavor.
In addition, the waiter could not understand that we were only there to have a snack and just wanted to share appetizers - so annoying.
