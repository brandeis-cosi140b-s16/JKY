Cripes, do I even have to give one star? Pedro's is about as Mexican as I am. Bland food and flavorless sauces abound. I feel you could order anything on the menu and wind up tasting the same food. Everything was just bland and limp. This is the worst kind of faux-Mexican food the world has to offer. 

TL;DR: Bleh.
