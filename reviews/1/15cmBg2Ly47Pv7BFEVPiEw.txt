Where to begin... this is a defective Chipotle. The last 3 times I have been here the burritoistas FAIL at making a simple burrito. They do not seem to understand the proper portions in order to get everything rolled into a nice, appetizing  package-- instead I end up waiting forever while they take turns trying to roll ripped tortillas with bean water and sour cream leaking out of all its orifices. After some guy is literally manhandling the damn thing 20 different times re-wrapping in different tortillas and asking for assistance from every staff member there... I have a look of utter disgust seeing the insides ooze everywhere like vomit. It looks so unappetizing after they struggle and flail there arms trying to wrap this garbage (I've literally never seen so much over-exaggerated  shoulder gyrations since Richard Simmons Sweatin' to the Oldies)-- I'd rather have my money back. 

Finally, some very sweet competent employee asks if I would like it remade..sorry I know there are starving people in the world, but yes please... I would love you to remake it so my burrito's insides do not resemble entrails. Thank you.

And to the rude cashier....get over yourself. I get that your job sucks, but the customer deserves a decent burrito when it costs $9.00. And oh yeah... I'm gonna take 2 bags whether you like it or not.
