It should be called "Cafe Wrong". The girl at the checkout counter was taking two phone orders while trying to ring me up. I placed a BOGO coupon on the counter in front of her. After standing there for a few minute she still made no effort to ring the sale. I loudly cleared my throat and she looked up and said "what kinda meat are they?"  I let her know and she said nothing until she finally rang it up. She said $23.00. I picked the coupon that was about 3 inches from her and showed it to her. She said "oh". Then belched out the new amount. 15.09. I gave her a 20 and she said they were out of 1's and needed to get the manager who was on break. Oh, it was dinner time. As the line backed up, they finally got the manager to the register. Then she promptly gets on a call and now I'm looking at them both in calls and my food is getting cold. I offered to give here 3 5's and a one dollar bill and she said "no, I already put it in". After 5 minutes of literally doing nothing she took apart the coin machine and gave me 16 quarters. Brainless employees working for a brainless manager.
