This place is not only the worst, as they always run out of food. They have their employees working over 100hrs without paying them and they only report up to 40 hrs to EDD so they wont pay overtime. The food is extremely over priced and the cashiers have no customer service skills!!!! Think twice before stoping in to eat here!!!!
