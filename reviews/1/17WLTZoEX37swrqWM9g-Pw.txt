My friends and I wanted to have a great night out for her bachelorette weekend.  The service and food effectively put a damper on the entire night. Don't bother with this restaurant --go elsewhere. 

The food had the potential to be spectacular --but there was no real 'fusion' of the different flavors. I've been to Jose Garces restaurants in Philly and expected Chef Andres' restaurants to have innovative flavors and fusing of cultures.  I was wrong.
there was a 'mexican' side and a 'chinese' side of the menu.  Both of which were adequate at best.  The Posole was the only thing we liked.  The salad was ok too. 

The moles and pipian had no resemblance to the rich and flavors we find in Mexico, or good Mexican food in Oaxacan restaurants.  All the tacos were extremely oversauced so you couldn't taste the meat.  the noodle dish we ordered tasted like they dumped the entire bottle of rice vinegar in it.  When we told the waitress, she scolded me and said 'that's how it's supposed to taste' to which I replied "actually no it's not --if you'd listened to us as we ordered you would realize you have a table who are familiar with the cuisine. " She agreed to take it back and off the bill. However when the bill came, she still charged us and I had to argue with her to take it off.  Oh and the 2 of us who ate that dish got sick later. 

It was hard not to notice that the wait staff was more attentive to all the white men around us. As a group of women of color --it was disappointing that we had to spend so much time finding our servers to make requests whether it was for more water or to make a complaint.   At $60 per person --we expect better service and to be treated with respect.
