My wife and I visited for the first time after a recommendation, best raspados we've ever had, on the other hand owner was rude, literally told me I couldn't sit down they were closing in 30 min, I asked about their flavors and refused to answer and ignored me, I have to hand it to him he makes a heck of a raspado! Unfortunately I won't ever be visiting again!
