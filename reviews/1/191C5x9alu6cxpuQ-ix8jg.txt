The women at the drive thru took my order and when I got up to the window I waited about two min. She told me the total in Spanish.  So, I handed her my debit card. She said we only take cash. I said I don't have enough cash. She said ok, sorry. Make no since why she wouldn't tell me cash only when I ordered my food.
