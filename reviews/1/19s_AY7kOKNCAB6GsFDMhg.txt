Yuck, this place has really gone down hill.  I hadn't eaten here in quite a while, probably over 2 years but I remembered liking their chips and their vegetable fajitas.  So when friday came and it was my turn to pick where to eat, I picked Chevy's.  Ew.  I should have known something was wrong when it was 7 pm on a friday and there were maybe 5 tables of people seated.

The chips had NO SALT and the salsa tasted like ketchup.  My vegetable fajita consisted of what looked like whatever odd vegetable combo they could find at the bottom of the fridge: baby carrots, green beans, broccoli, bell peppers and onions.  (NEVER seen baby carrots OR green beans in a fajita, weird)  It almost seemed like frozen stir-fry vegetable mix.  A new addition to this dish since the last time I ordered it was the chili relleno on top of the veggies.  That thing was a nightmare, it was stuffed with what tasted like gouda cheese and topped with horrid-looking tasteless tomato sauce.  

My husband could not finish his fish taco, which looked deceptively edible but which he said tasted nasty.  His side of one tamale was a pile of mush on top of a pile of chicken mush.  It looked like baby food and did NOT hold together at all.

The only thing that seems to have stayed the same is the sweet corn tomalito, still as corny and sweet as ever.  Our server was attentive, I can't fault him.  But the food was beyond repulsive.
