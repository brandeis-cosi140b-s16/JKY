I eat in Chipotle regularly but this location is a real joke. The quantity served here is way less than what I have been getting in other locations. Felt like I got half of what I normally get. They will put more veggies just so that your bowl will look full lol. People working here are rude too. Next time I will spend more money but never eat here.
P.S: Had to give 1 start because it wont allow me to write the review.
