"You crazy kids turn that music down!" While I am not even close to the age of my Grandmother, I certainly felt like one Saturday night. The music was very loud and I could not hear anything that anyone at my table said. Also, I waited 20 minutes between each drink order. I do not mind waiting for food, which took almost an hour to arrive. Cause, guess what, I wasn't really there for the food. I do, however, take issue with having to wait for drinks. It is a Saturday night and I am ready to party. Not sit at a table saying, "What did you say?" and growing more and more impatient. I will not be returning.
