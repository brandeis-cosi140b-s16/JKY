Second time here with disappointment.  I've decided to write about it this time.  The counter clerks are gabbing and joking while food is ready from the kitchen, but it just sits there.  

The sliders were as gross as they can get.  The texture was akin to boiled meat.  Maybe grill the meat or finish on an open flame? Duh. 

If you've got a lot of time and not jumping on a flight, I would only then give it a try because you'll likely return your food.
