Absolutely a joke. The chicken they serve seem to be half servings. Mac n cheese is always cold along with the mashed potatoes. If they happen to serve hot it's over heated n over cooked. The service is terrible. When u ask for something additional they sigh and act like you're such an inconvenience. Wish there was a better one close to my work.
