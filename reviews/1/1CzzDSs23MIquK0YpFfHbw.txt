Horrifying!  Friday night after a long work week we were looking forward to trying the new restaurant in our neighborhood in north Scottsdale,  We were seated immediately and our waitress introduced herself moments later.  We ordered drinks and an appetizer of guacamole and chips.  The house chardonnay was exceptional but the beer was warm.  The guacamole was so spicy it left blisters in our mouths.  We waited nearly a half an hour for our waitress to return to take our order before we gave up and left.  Our bill for uneaten guacamole, a warm unfinished beer and a most enjoyable glass of wine was more than $20.00.  Lastly, although I don't think that north Scottsdale Los Sombreros will be in business 10 months from now, the staff should be advised that fragrances are a "no no".   Chanel's signature fragrance should be saved for "date night" since diners would rather smell their food if they could get an order in.  North Scottsdale has many excellent Mexican restaurants.  Los Sombreros is not one of them.  Skip this one.
