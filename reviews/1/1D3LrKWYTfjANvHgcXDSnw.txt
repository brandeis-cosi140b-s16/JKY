I love Chipotle especially with the app to allow you to order ahead of time. This is the first time I didn't have a good customer experience. I came in 15 min after the stated time and they still didn't have it ready. That wasn't the issue but it was that they rushed my order and had it completely wrong. I've never had to treat chipotle like McDonald's where I have to double check my order but will do moving forward. Cashier was really nice though. The execution of my order along with timing of completion is what gives this establishment 1 star.
