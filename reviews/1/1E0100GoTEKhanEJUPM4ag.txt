Service was not very good and the food was just okay. 

Our cokes were incredibly flat, and when we asked about it we just got a blank stare. And he said he didn't drink coke. And walked away. Eventually he came back with new ones from the bar instead of the kitchen, but we were really confused about what was going on. 

My order came out wrong and everyone kept blaming each other without every really correcting the problem. The waiter said it was the kitchen, then the owner came over and said it was the waiter's fault, then the waiter came back and offered a 12% discount because it wasn't really "their" fault, it was the kitchen's fault. Ummm....shouldn't a restaurant all be one unit? I just wanted to eat. I ordered Pechugo la Mexicana, which on the menu says grilled chicken with peppers and onions covered with cheese sauce. I got a soupy mixture of chicken with minced peppers and onions in a spicy red sauce. They kept debating the interpretation of the menu. I won't be back.

Also, to be fair they are newly Mexican. Apparently it used to be a Korean BBQ spot and they just transitioned to Mexican fare. Still some kinks to work out for sure.
