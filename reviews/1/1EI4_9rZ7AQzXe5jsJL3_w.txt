I hate to be a Negative Nancy, but I just want to persuade people to run from this place. For one, food is way overpriced (my street taco platter and soda was over $10!), second, the food was sub par and relatively flavorless, and third, the environment of the restaurant was appalling (it seemed like people were living in the back). Other things to note: the salsa was watered down and flavorless, there are no napkins except the two they give you, and the food took forever to come out.
