Bad attitude. Keep your lessons for ordering espresso at home please. And educate cashiers that if they want to give a lesson to be more courteous about it. There's a reason why tourists prefer to pay top dollar for the same coffee. I'd rather pay $5 and have a good time, rather than $2 for a headache!
