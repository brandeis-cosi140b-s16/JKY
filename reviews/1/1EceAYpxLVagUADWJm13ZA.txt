China Poblano was a complete disappointment. Everything I ate, I've had better. The noodle salad was a disappointment as I've had a much better one at Takashi in SLC. The service wasn't anything great. Even the churro's, I have had better. All around a disappointment except for the ambience. The food pricing wasn't over the top but it definitely wasn't work how much I paid and on top of paying I was charged an extra $20. Apparently they had been having problems with the system and it takes that much out but puts it back in your account in 3-5 days. Honestly I wouldn't recommend this to anyone unless your taste buds are equivalent to enjoying bland food.
