If I could give NO stars that would be perfect. Seriously, the "good" reviews are from people who do not know what REAL Mexican food tastes like. This place sucks. The "ground" beef in my taco was undercooked and probably canned meat. Who the hell puts meat paste in a chile relleno?! Never coming back.
