Really??? Read the reviews and just moving to this area we tried it!  Wow!!!! How disappointed we were.  The food, salsa, guacamole, chips were edible and just that!  No flavor, all the same sauce was used for the different dishes.  Can't believe people like this place?  Guess people will eat anything! Had to rate with 1 star.
