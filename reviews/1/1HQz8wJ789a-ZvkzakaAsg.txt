The food was horrible.  Went with my family and this was our first time there.  I ordered the steak tacos.  The meat had a significant amount of fat,  it was cold and no flavor what so ever.  It was not authentic by no means.  My sister ordered a steak meal and she was fighting with it more than eating it!  I complained to the owner and my sister then ordered two tamales meal.  The tamales were extremely dry and asked the owner to come back.  Told her we've never had horrible food like this before.  How could her establishment last if the quality of food is equivalent to government food?  Never again will we ever step foot in that restaurant again!  Don't go there unless you have no taste buds and love to fight with your food!
