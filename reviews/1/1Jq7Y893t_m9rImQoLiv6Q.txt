Que paso Homey?! I come for vacation frm Chicago and thought 'mannn the Mexican food is gona be gooood  being so close to the MothaLand!' But noOoO!  Wow- this was my first impression of Mexican food here- and it was HORRIBLE! I had asada tacos and one chicken taco- they had a literal dab of guacamole and they used cheddar cheese!! Who does that?? What happened to queso Ranceherito or queso fresco?! I will give Phoenix one more chance at Mexican food and then I'm RUNNINNNG back to La Villita where Lil Mexico does it legit!
