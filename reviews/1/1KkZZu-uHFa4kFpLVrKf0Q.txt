Went there with my wife before shopping. Server was nice, but took forever between visits. Ordered fajitas and some enchiladas. Enchiladas were good, but very spicy. Fajitas were very tough. Couldn't even bite off a piece. Sent it back. Manager came over, but could hardly understand his mumbling. Reordered tacos. They were ok. Normally the returned item would be comped as would the replacement meal, as it was their fault. We had to pay for the replacement tacos. Overall a poor experience.
