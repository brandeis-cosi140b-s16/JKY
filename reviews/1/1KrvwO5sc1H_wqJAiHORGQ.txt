Me and my friend decided to eat here since it was so convenient for us. I can't even think of a time where I have ever had horrible Mexican food. Its pretty hard to screw up. Same ingredients different presentation. This restaurant however is the only place that can mess it up. The only item that I did enjoy was the $3 margaritas that seemed a fair amount for a decent size glass.  If what you are craving is Mexican do not head here.
