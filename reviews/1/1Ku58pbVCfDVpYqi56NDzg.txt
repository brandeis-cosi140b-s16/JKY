I saw the last mexican restaurent go under at this location because they were selling illegal drugs in addition to the lousy food. Im really contemplating the same with these owners. My little Italian grandmother often said: soap and water is cheap. So why do so many taco shops have so much difficulty with cleanliness?  Its simply because they dont care. So being a rational 50 year old man, if the bathroom is dirty is the the kitchen clean? You fill in the blanks. 

Food is way over priced for what you get. I have been around in the food industry and mexican is the least expensive. Taste is so so. The staff is not so friendly. The list goes on. If I want to visit a dirty over priced taco shop with mediocre food with crappy service ,I can go to Tijuana and it least get it cheaper. Sorry owners, go to a corporate restaurant business and copy there business model and you will have more people than you can serve.

Adios Senior Taco...........
