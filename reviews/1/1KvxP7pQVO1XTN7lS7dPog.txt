I took my son here for dinner yesterday before going to a show, I had a groupon and looked forward to trying this place out. I showed the waiter the groupon and he gave item #'s to choose from, my son ordered Chilaquiles & steak con huevo con arroz y frijoles. When food arrived there was no steak in the chilaquiles? Puzzled we asked and the waiter said, it would cost more so he did not place that order. Hmmm I've never been to a place where they make the decision of not placing my full order because of cost. Will not go back, there are so many delicious MX restaurants in town that serve you what You Order! Geeeesh I was stunned and that put a damper on dinner. The show we went to was awesome though LOL
