So I'm new in the area and trying out the local spots so I decided to stop into chipotle. Bad idea. I got a steak and chicken bowl, same item I order at every chipotle and nothing was good about it. The brown rice was over cooked, the fajitas seemed to have been sitting for who knows how long, the chicken was over cooked, and the steak was well done (it's suppose to be medium rare). To top it off the customer service was horrendous and they had no personality. I can't say I won't be back, because I love Chipotle so much, but if I do have another bad experience, it's safe to say that I rather make the commute to another store instead of this one.
