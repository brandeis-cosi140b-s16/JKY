The most bland and tasteless Mexican food I've ever had in Vegas, let alone anywhere else. Go to Cafe Rio or Roberto's instead, save money and not end up regretting the steep amount you would've spent at Chinita.
Wife had the pork chimi, if the dogs could sit at the table they'd probably cock their heads to the side and think "alpo?" It was disgusting looking and tasting.
I had the hambergesa, all I tasted was a hamburger with corn salsa on it and no chorizo. The mushy fries were the highlight of my plate.

Food = worst mexican I've probably ever had
Service = excellent, staff was very nice and attentive, and for that, you get one star. Sorry I drew such a look of shock and "oh shit how do I react" look from the staff when they asked for everything was, I've never been so compelled to give my opinion because they were very nice.

As a friendly neighbor gesture, I plead for Robert Irvine to visit this place quick so it does not fail.
