So disappointing. After fantasizing about a Friday night dinner out ALL DAY, we decided to try this local dive. We had previously been to Rosita's place down the street and wondered how two Mexican restaurants could compete so close to each other. 

Well, I'm still wondring. Rosita's Place was excellent. La Barquita was so mediocre that I spent the entire next day fantasizing about where to go out on Saturday to quell my unsated desire to have a good meal at a restaurant.

We got there at 8 on Friday. Hours are listed as open until 9. We were the ONLY people in the place other than the lone waitress, one cook, and two old dudes playing guitar. They approached us at one point and asked us if we wanted a song (man, I HATE that--but no big deal, it's a dive.), and we politely declined.  

No one greeted us when we walked in, I had to go back to the kitchen to see if they were really open.

The waitress was very friendly and service was prompt, once we were noticed. 

We ordered the posole, queso fundido with chorizo, 3 sopes with steak, and a chicken burro with red sauce. 

It was all *okay*, nothing to write home about. 

The queso was literally a dish of broiled cheese with crumbled chorizo, which, as soon as it came out of the oven, started to congeal and we actually had to cut it with a knife.

I had to ask for more salsa because the shot-glass portion that came with our chips was gone in uno minuto. It was tasty salsa, though.

About halfway through our meal, the waitress started mopping the floor of the restaurant with very potent disinfectant. I could practically taste it, and she was actually mopping around our feet! Nothing says "hurry up and get out" like the scent of bleach in your food...

She followed us to the door after we paid and, as I predicted, locked that sucker the second we stepped out. 8:30pm. 

Well, now I don't have to wonder about this place and I can keep going to Rosita's...
