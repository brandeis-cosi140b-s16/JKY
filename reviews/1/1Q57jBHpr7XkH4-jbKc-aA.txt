The food was amazing and nicely proportioned, but the service was horrible. Right when we walked in, no greetings and we were ignored. I had to approach the host and tell him how many were in our party. Then my family and I got an attitude from a few employees. They were very rude  and had horrible attitudes. It was so bad that my 7yr old asked whats wrong with them. I  understand if someone has a bad day. But customers should NEVER FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE!!!
