One star because, the only thing I liked about the food was the chunky salsa. The place was clean, but it was also empty. I wanted to like this place, but it was some of the worst Mexican food I've eaten. As soon as you walk in the door, you have to grab a menu, which I had to hunt for and the employees seemed to have no clue as to what's what. I asked for salsa and the boy behind the counter let me know salsa comes with the meal. It doesn't, it's hot sauce. Big difference. So, I had to ask again. This time I asked for chunky salsa, which you have to pay for. Not an issue, just know the difference. I mean, we live in Arizona, for crying out loud! I won't go back.
