Worst cafe rio I have been to. Rude employees and they are always out of everything. If you don't like your job don't work here. 

Cafe rio  come and train theses  tards. I will drive the extra 5 min to the other cafe rio from now on. Go to the one on eastern or Stephanie for better food and service
