Ok, Biltmore what is going on with your dwindling dining and shopping options lately? Decided (mistakenly) to try this place but should have stuck to original plans of going to True Food. Anyways, the food and service really fell through here. No water was offered, no salt pepper, no flavor, nothing. Chipotle makes this place look authentic and 5 star worthy. The nachos had no toppings and the tacos, no flavor just veggies on a tortilla. After the food was thrown at us not even a chance to complain because we weren't even asked how it was. The server dropped the check and didn't even offer to box what we didn't eat because obviously he knew what we were eating didn't satisfy yet didn't try to correct the situation. I'll be spending my happy hours and lunches at True Food, Stingray or Hillstone while at the Biltmore from now on. Fail.
