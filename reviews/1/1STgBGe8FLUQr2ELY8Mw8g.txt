To say Panchos sucks is a huge understatement.

It is gag reflex bad buffet food. I went back to the buffet a couple times just hoping there was something edible.  I must have thrown three full plates away.

Stay away! Go anywhere else.  I had to go out of my way to tell people not to even bother with this place!
