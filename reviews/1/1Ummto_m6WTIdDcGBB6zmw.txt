Came here in a good mood with high hopes. Got the food and was excited. My kids cheese enchiladas were ice cold. My husbands burrito was way to greasy and had nothing going for him. The nachos were a joke. Chips with melted cheese. That's it. No tomatoes no nothing. The only thing that was decent was the big cheese crisp that was still dry yet pretty good and if you were to get it then i recommend guacamole because it was very dry. Very disappointed.
