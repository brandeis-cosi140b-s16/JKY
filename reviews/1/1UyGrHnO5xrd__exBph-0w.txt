Wow...I mean...wow.

4 of us sat down at a booth, as the guy brings the chips and salsa I requested an extra salsa so we didn't need to reach. He responds by saying only one is complimentary....Are kidding me? 

We all order our meals and then we noticed the lunch special which tossed in a margarita and some fideo soup and were bummed we didn't see it sooner. The server comes out with our soup and margaritas and says she ran em through as the special to take care of..kudos to young lady.

The soup was a the typical cheapo tomato juiced wannabe soup. Wasn't horrible, just not special. I think it is sold in 50 gallon barrels as I swear I have experienced that before several times.

The margarita, was a limeade slushy. Absolutely 0 tequila.

When the food came out we had everything from shredded chicken tacos, to Diablo seafood, to chile relleno.

The Relleno was like a soggy egg pancake, the chicken was as bland as could be. I mean, even if you cook chicken plain it has more flavor than that. The scallops of the seafood diablo were chewy and fishy so I am guessing frozen, then thawed too early, then served.

This food was redic. Do not go here. 

On a positive note, the server was awesome and was still tipped very well.
