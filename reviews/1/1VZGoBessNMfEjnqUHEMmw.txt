THIS IS FOR THE BREAKFAST MENU ONLY!  THIS REVIEW DOES NOT REFLECT THE LUNCH/DINNER MENU!

I had heard that Taco Bell started serving breakfast and decided to give it a try on Saturday at this location.  BLEH!  OMG!  You have got to be kidding me!  It was crap in a wrap! 

I got the b-fast tortilla with only eggs and cheese (I don't eat meat) with a hash brown and OJ.  The breakfast sandwich was full of sodium with no taste whatsoever.  The hash browns?  THE WORST EV-AH!  It was flat, overcooked, and maybe, mayyyyybe a few potato flakes were added before going into the deep fryer.  I am not kidding, it was grey.  I'm getting sick just typing this.  The OJ was a bit odd in only that the pic on the menu board made it appear that it would be in a cup like a fountain drink, but instead they gave me a bottle of Tropicana.  Uhm, okay...I guess.

Skip the new b-fast menu.  Stick with lunch and dinner.  They are good at that.
