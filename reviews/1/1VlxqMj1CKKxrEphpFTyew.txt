I had a bad experience here.

I found hair in my food.  Went I went to bring it to the attention of management a 20 something year old "mgr" was at the front register.  All I got from his was a bad attitude and him saying "did you ever stop to consider that the hair is yours?"  That would be hard seeing that the hair I found was black.  I do not have black hair.  The numerous cooks and people that they have working behind the counter have black hair.  

Needless to say I will never patronize this establishment ever again.  The "mgr" completely ruined any chance of recovery and his attitude was absolutely horrible.
