Just left without eating. I ordered the "ensalada hawiian chicken salad". It was beautiful. It had no flavor.
I tried to get the attention of anyone working there. That took about 5 minutes.
When I asked for dressing the waiter looked and acted confused. The choices were ranch, italian or honey mustard. Hummm what would go well with a hawaiian salad that has pineapple and guacamole..... Really none of the mentioned. I ordered ranch. 
The waiter brought it to the table with a clunk. You would think with such a beautiful salad there would be a specialized dressing say with pineapple?
The ranch did not work. The salsa did not work (no flavor or heat) I am from southern California and have made / eaten lots.
Needless to say I will not be going back.
