Garcia's is neither Mexican, nor Food.  Anyone wanting authentic Mexican needs to stay away from this and other "chain" restaurants.  Here in AZ, you can pretty much throw a rock in any direction and hit a good, family owned and operated Mexican place that's TO DIE FOR.  Stay away from the chains.  A hint?  If it's got orange cheese all over the place, IT AIN'T REAL MEXICAN.
