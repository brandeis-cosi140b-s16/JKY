Bad service seriously makes everything else so much worse. 

We had pretty bad service when we went in. My mom got a coffee but when she got it it was cold. We asked to get another and she seemed bothered about it but she brought it. I tried and it was a tad warmer but not hot. My mom was complacent so I didn't mention again. 

When I asked what was good she shrugged and said she wasn't really sure. OK maybe not true but you could at least make a suggestion about what people order alot? When my bf asked what a dish came with she didn't know that either. Now that did bother me. But my bf didn't want me to say anything so we didnt. 

Overall service sucked. The food took foreverrrr to get out and my bf had to raise his glass to get a refill of coke. How mortifying.   He had to do the same for check. When it came time to clear table,  me and my mom started picking up with napkin and piling plates together. We typically do this, but the waiter/waitress always jump in to help. This lady literally just stood there and waited for us to finished her job and pile it all up and go. How easy. 

Food was not good my chicken in chicken enchilada plate was dry. I only picked at it. My bfs fajitas were sizzling for about 5 min after plate came out. No joke.  

Never coming here again. Waste of time/money
