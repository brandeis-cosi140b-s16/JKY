Food was good, how ever the service was the worst we ever had, the waiter forgot about us for more than 20 minutes, he then sent over another person to take our order, never brought the drink we ordered, had to have the manager get it. when my fajitas came i asked for a plate and next thing i know, our waiter is standing around talking and forgot the plate. another person in our party's order was wrong. the 2 tables that came in after us were more important and got their food before we even ordered. when we told the manager, he was less than concerned and explained that there was a large party on the patio, like that is okay for them to ignore everyone else. would not recommend this place at all. after we said something to the manager both him and the waiter avoided our table, very unprofessional and uncaring towards their patrons.
