We unfortunately will not be back to Diablos. We hadn't been there since the last review and tried it again. We ordered the Nachos. They took forever to come out. When the finally did, the first few bites were solid. Then guess what? Just like my last experience . I was chewing on another artery! Disgusting!!! This is truly heartbreaking as we used to really love this place and it was one of our staples in Vegas. Good luck in the future...
