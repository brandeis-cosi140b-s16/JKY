It's rare that I give a one-star review, but I'm over this location. I'll start by saying that generally, I like Taco Bell. I'm not knocking them for being anything that they're not. However, I don't think I've ever left here with my order correct. 

The biggest issue is that on several occasions I have ordered vegetarian and gotten meat in my meal. I usually order a Crunch Wrap, so it's not super easy to check my order in the car before I drive away. I always look at the screen when I'm ordering, but it doesn't matter if the person taking the order punched it in correctly - the kitchen staff seems to just put in whatever they feel like. Or, for that matter, leave out whatever they want. I seem to get one of two variations on my order of "Crunch Wrap sub beans for beef": 
1) The wrap includes beef, or, this past time, a ton of chicken; or,
2) Beans but no nacho cheese.

Gross as it is, the nacho cheese is half the reason I crave T. Bell. I know I live in the greatest state for cheese, but there's something about that glowing orange sauce that I love. 

The drive thru line is also impossibly slow. 

I don't order a lot of food, so it's not worth the time and effort to go back and get the right thing/a refund. I'm guessing a lot of people feel the same, and that may be part of why they're so terrible.
