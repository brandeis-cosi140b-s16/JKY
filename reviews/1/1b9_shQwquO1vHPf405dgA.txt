Since I moved to Las Vegas a few years ago Yelp has rarely been wrong when it comes to restaurants. But in the case of Casa Don Juan the 3 1/2 stars they have at the time this review is being written is 2 1/2 stars too much. 

I ended up giving Casa Don Juan a try for lunch. And to be honest while it's been less than 2 weeks since I was there I remember these things..which are not good. 

Flat iced tea. Very slow service. A very long wait for my check and my debit card to be returned. I do remember trying to enjoy a beef taco but it was too greasy to finish. I remember flavorless chips and...well they call it salsa but I thought perhaps someone confused the salsa bucket in the back with a water jug and they decided to fill it with tap water before realizing their mistake. It was red...it had cilantro and other stuff in it, but it was not anything I'd want to eat again. 

I'm really struggling to find something positive to say about this place...and I just can't. I wave my white flag of surrender...I ended up not eating the cheese enchilada! I've never left a cheese enchilada on my plate before. How in the heck can someone mess up a cheese enchilada and leave it flavorless is beyond me but they found a way to do it. To call this stuff authentic...please, stop drinking the tequila because it's not all that. 

1 Star - And that's only because I'm forced to give at least one to post.
