You'd think all El Pollo Locos are pretty much the same right? Well, it looks the same, but it's definitely not the same. At all. 

My family eats EPL often because we are always in a hurry or we all come home late from work/school, so we just order things that are nearby our home. This is one of the first times that I have eaten at this location, and it is not good. 

I ordered at night through the drive through 2 hours before it closed. The service was fast. The chicken was warm. We asked for sauces, but they didn't give us any. We brought it home. The chicken at this location did not have the signature taste that EPL usually has. It was actually quite flavorless and not that appetizing. 

Most fast food restaurants usually already start at average ratings, but sadly, this one starts below.
