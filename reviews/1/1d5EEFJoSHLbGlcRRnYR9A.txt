Probably the worst "Mexican food" since Taco Bell.

If I was not on my lunch and crunched for time, I would have taken the food back for a refund after the first bite of beans, rice, and chimi.

New to the Phoenix area, but grew up in Nogales, so yes, I do know and love Mexican food.....but will not return here.
