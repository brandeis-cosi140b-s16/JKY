Horrible!  Dirty, run down, the employees didn't know their butt from.....well you know.  The taco meat had NO flavor. I told the kid behind the counter and he just looked at us with his mouth hanging open and shrugged his shoulders.  There were flies everywhere. The floors were dirty.  Both restrooms were filthy ( and for my husband to say a men's bathroom is bad, it has to be bad). Never, ever have I had such an icky taco bell experience.  Will go back to stoping at Carl's jr or jack in the box on the way thru town.  Icky. Just icky.
