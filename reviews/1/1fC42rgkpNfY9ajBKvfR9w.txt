WORST SERVICE EVER!!!!!! Doesn't even deserve one star...went in there with my family because it was recommended...never again will i go there when i visit again from northern California...asked for my food and told them NO Onion , came back with onions... Asked for a new one, the OWNER (our server) said it was gonna take 20 minutes...so i canceled my ordered instead of waiting...she still wanted to charge me for food that NEVER got to our table...sat there trying to convince the owner that she was not supposed to charge for something that i never ate..she said she HAD to charge because i ordered the food and didnt cancel before they started making it...NEVER again will i go there....NEVER!!!! REALLY BAD SERVICE!!!
