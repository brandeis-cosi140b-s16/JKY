Been a patron at Rubio's for a long time; this one included. This evening had my worst experience ever. They were short-staffed which created a) an inordinate wait (25 minutes for two tacos), b) rude/hurried staff, c) cold food, which ended up making me sick (though it could have just been the unsanitary way it appeared to be made), d) virtually empty salsa bar, e) very dirty dining area/tables, f) wet tray my food was set on (to his credit, the shift manager had to keep running back and forth between the counter and the back, throwing on the plastic gloves and making the food, then running out to the counter, taking the gloves off and delivering the food), and g) angry, impatient customers.  It was enough to seriously think about never going there again, given the number of local establishments that serve just as good/better food.  And now that Rubio's prices are so high, I can't think of a really good reason to go back.
