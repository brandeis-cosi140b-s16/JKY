Stopped by this place on our way out of Vegas & wish we never did! 

Our waitress could hardly understand us, which wasn't a big deal because she got our order correct. 

When I received my nachos, I tasted them  & the sour cream tasted out dated. I kindly informed the man that came to our table (maybe the owner), he tasted it & said it was fine. I told him I didn't want it, so he took them to the back. When we went up to pay, he still charged us for the nachos. I was so annoyed by this point, that I paid & left. Not worth the hassle. Would never eat here again.
