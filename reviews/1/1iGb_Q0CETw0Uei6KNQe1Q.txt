First thing I noticed was how disgusting the area is. Walking in you pass their disgusting dumpster leaking black sludge. It smells awful to the point of puking. Walking in it was overly crowded to the point a fire inspector would shut the place down. People were so packed they were practically sitting over your food. They are all talking and you see sprays of saliva going over your food. All in all the food is not worth this nightmare.
