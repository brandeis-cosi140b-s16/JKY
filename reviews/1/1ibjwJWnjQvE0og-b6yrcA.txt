Faustos, what happened? I used to love this place. I mean, to me this was the best Mexican food in the city. Fausto came from Mexico, by way of Southern California and brought great taste with him. Sadly, the quality has gone a little too far south and I no longer recognize this place. The beans are still good but their Chimichanga was soggy and sloppy. I hope this was more an issue of the cook rather than the franchise however I have eaten at the Stephanie Location and College Dr location and was not impressed. Everything was very greasy and it upset my stomach.... as I was eating it.
