DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. I've  loved Chipotle for years so I'm really bummed out about this one because its closest to me ....this is the WORST chipotle I've ever been to. EVERY SINGLE piece of chicken in my bowl is ALWAYS either a disgustingly chewy piece of fat or a charred piece of something that tastes like its been scraped off the grill at the end of the night...so upsetting. The empolyees clearly do not care what you eat and the quality of the food, its really just too bad. Please for your own sake do not go here....there is a great  Mexican place right across the street in the frys parking lot.
