Chicken quesadilla was decent (this visit), pollo asado burrito was dry (first visit).

However the service..sucks. I was there for one of the blues jam nights. Came in and sat down along a wall, since I didn't want to take a table (by myself). The server who had that section (female, tall, red hair in a ponytail) never even looked at me. Never came to me. Never offered a menu. People who came in after me and sat at a table in the center received menus and chips and...service.

After literally 20 minutes (I timed it), I finally went up to the cashier/bar area and spoke to a server (female, short dark hair, tan) who took my order, brought it over to me, came by to offer me refills several times.  The other server HAD to see this happening.

I gave the brunette server a 50% tip ($5) because she was nice and served me. I hope she didn't have to pool that money with other servers.

If it weren't for the blues jam, I see no reason to ever return to eat there, the experience was so bad.
