Not impressed. I came here when I was starving after a late-night flight for some late-night chow. #FAIL 

I discarded my shrimp burrito mid-way b/c it had a glass-cleaner/freezer-burnt taste and was generally repulsive. I knew that if I finished it, I'd feel like crap for the entire next day. After a few bites I felt like I'd just chowed down a harvest of grain. My poor stomach.
