DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE AT NIGHT!!! My wife and I came here because their sign outside said open till 10pm and we happened to be out for a late dinner, so we decided to stop here. We ordered our food at 9:15pm and got the food ten minutes later, and when we got it, it was packaged like a to-go order. I didn't make a big deal out of it so I took it to our table and started to open the styrofoam trays. When the cashier seen us about to eat, she says to us "You can't eat here, were about to close". So i informed her that their sign said closed at 10pm. She pretty much argued with me saying no, it says 9:30(even after I literally went outside and pointed to it)
I have never been forced to leave a restaurant like that! Usually a restaurant will just lock the doors preventing further customers to come in. The employees were rude about it, and when my wife called the next day to talk to the owner, he showed no concern. Great way to lose business!!
It pretty much ruined our dinner which was cold and soggy by the time we got home. Just beware...
