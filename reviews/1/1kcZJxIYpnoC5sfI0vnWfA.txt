I have had a love-hate relationship with this place (specifically this location) for a long time. I love this locations horchata. It's different than other ones. I've gone there JUST for that. After last night's meal though, if I ever do go back and am disappointed, it will be my own fault for going.

I have spent about $100 over the past couple months here on three separate meals. You'd probably think that I got a lot of food and drink for this money, but no, I really didn't. For example... last night I ordered five rolled tacos (beef taquitos with cheese on top), a Texas burrito, two large horchata drinks and two churros (which were not sweet at all and had NO cinnamon or sugar on them). For this, I paid $24 and change. Pretty sad if you ask me. I could have (and should have) gone to a nice sit-down Mexican restaurant. It would have cost about the same and I would have been much happier with the food. Seriously, where does Filiberto's get off charging $1 per "rolled taco"? These things are tiny and worth $0.50 at most. You can see how cheap they are too in their coupons. For example, if you check-in on Yelp, you can get $0.50 off! Ooooh!!! Wow!!! How generous of them!!!

The food quality here is questionable, they charge way too much for it, probably pay their employees minimum wage (customer service here is TERRIBLE) and all the while, the owners must be making BANK. I will not support these people anymore, and I recommend that you don't either. I'll figure out how to make horchata myself.
