This place has the worst service ever.  The servers have the worst attitudes. Throwing the food o the table. I get having a bad day but our server should be fired.  I always tip - always.  Not this time.  Go anywhere else at McCarren airport. Anywhere else.  I don't even want to give a star. They suck and are completely disorganized.  Poor poor management.
