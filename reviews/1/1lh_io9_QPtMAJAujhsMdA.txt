shame on you Arrowhead ..worse possible mexican food in our area. Went today because I wanted to give it one last shot..Swing and a Miss..!! asked one of the guys behind the counter for chips..He wanted me to go back to the end of the line when the chip baskets were 8 steps away..and that GIANT burro they advertise only weighs that much because its 6 tortillas dosed in enchilada sauce..you need a search warrant to find any meat..SERVICE is bad..food is worse...
