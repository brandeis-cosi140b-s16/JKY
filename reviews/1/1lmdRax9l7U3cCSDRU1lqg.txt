Unless you speak Spanish do not bother all the people who work at this company are rude.  I went to the Roberto's on Losee and had a really rude server when I complained I received a phone call from a person at this location who asked me to bring in my receipt and she would replace my order as they have had problems with this girl before.  I went and was told nobody new anything about this and basically I was looking for free food.  I will never go there again and I suggest you don't bother
