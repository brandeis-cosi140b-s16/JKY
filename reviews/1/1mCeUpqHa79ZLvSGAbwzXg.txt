Twice was enough to BARF!!!

I went through the drive-thru and asked for a breakfast burrito with eggs, potatoes, grilled onions, and green chili.  When I got to the office the burrito was eggs, potatoes, grilled onions and meat.  I figured maybe I'll give them a second chance.  I went a second time though the drive-thru and asked for a breakfast burrito with eggs, cheese, potatoes, grilled onions.  This time I ate bit into the burrito and it was raw onions, raw potatoes, and runny eggs.  I barfed from the rawness.  Made me sick all day. No third chance.
