Bad customer service. I ordered a bacon breakfast burrito, I sat down and saw that no one was cooking at the stove behind the desk so thought maybe the rest of the kitchen is in the back..wrong!.. I waited about 10 min and there was one person in front of me waiting and then 2 more customers came in after me. After the 4th person the lady at the register dicided to call the cook up to start cooking!! So I decides to just forget it and went up to her and said that if hes just starting that I need to leave and ill just do a return and she insisted that it would be quick and told the cook to make mine first... worst breakfast burrito ive had from filibertos.l!! The burrito was so skinny( no worth the $6 i paid)the potatoes in the burrito weren't fully cooked. I Dont recommend this location. Register girl couldve gave warning of time I would have to wait if It was going to be more then 10-15 min and she definitely couldve been a little happier.
My visit was on sunday around 9am.
