I visited Macayo's with my family on a visit in early December.  Since I don't live in town anymore, I cannot chalk up my visit to just a bad night, but I can share my experience.  

We were hoping to get in for happy hour, but it was packed. Bummer, but not a strike against the restaurant. 

We still wanted to stay for some drinks and dinner. We requested a table for 7. Mind you, our party was standing in front of the host stand.  Most of us are about 6' or more with the crowning jewel of height is my step father, clocking in at 7'1".  They stuck us at two tiny, pushed together tables, 7 of us, in the main walk way from the kitchen. Even if we all were at a more comfortable table, or we were smaller people, you don't put people in the walkways from the kitchen.
 
My sister and I were constantly getting shoved in the back, but chose to sit there so our parents weren't the ones assaulted.  I had to sit with my purse on my lap since I couldn't hang on the chair with the traffic going by and there was no floor space to spare with our tangle of legs. 

I grabbed the margarita menu hoping that ordering a couple would help save the quickly falling mood.  DAMN DRINKS WERE $10+. At a bloody restaurant, during happy hour.  Oh but happy hour doesn't apply to the dining side.  A few of us ordered a drink, still.  My mom's came with just a piece of lime rind, my upgraded margarita looked like a regular and came in a smaller glass and I just got excuses from the waiter that they are the same ounces. (Bullshit and we pointed it out with the empties after the fact but he didn't care.)  I was still charged the $12.50 for the shorted drink. The food was ok but not much of a selection.  I shared a meal with my sister to off set the cost of our drinks. 

It was very disappointing and my mom was crushed that the only evening we had to visit a Mexican restaurant, during my visit to Arizona, was such crap.
