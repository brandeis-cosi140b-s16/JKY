Absolutely ridiculous!! My waitress lost my credit card while trying to charge me for my meal. She took it away with my bill and didn't return it. I understand that things happen but what's most frustrating is that no one cares there. I have left the owner numerous messages with no return call. The girl I spoke to on the phone said "I just work here" and that the owner was in strawberry until Monday and won't call me back. 
This is ridiculous!! You lost my card!! You should care that you lost my card!!!
