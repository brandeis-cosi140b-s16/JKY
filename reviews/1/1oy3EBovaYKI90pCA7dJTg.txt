This is one of a very few places in Phoneix with awesome shrimp ceviche. Aside from the ceviche the rest of the food I've tried at Mariscos Mi Lindo Mazatlan has been quite disappointing. For instance, shrimp cocktail was served with shrimp that hadn't been cleaned (vein still in). 

The waitresses are snobby and the dinning area smells like burnt cooking oil. The plastic table covers are dirty and beer prices are that of a 5 star hotel.
