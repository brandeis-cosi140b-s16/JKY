Would not recommend, bad advertisement. Posted signs in Treasure Island and on board walk stating Reggie 3 diff DJ starts at 10:30 pm Friday 7/10/15. We made sure we got there early to get a good seat ordered drinks . 10:30 came no Reggie just electric disco, so we waited thinking maybe it started later, by 11:30 we left, asking about the music add, no one could explain. Well never set foot in Senor Frogs in Las Vegas again, hated the music they played, and forget the staff...... Singed very disappointed...
