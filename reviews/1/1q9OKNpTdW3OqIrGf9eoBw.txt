Have you ever wanted to have airplane food served to you IN the terminal? Then you've found the right place. Seriously though, this was the worst meal at an airport I've experienced. The service was painfully slow, the food was borderline uneatable, and it was pricey. Wish I'd read the Yelp reviews before entering the shiny exterior!
