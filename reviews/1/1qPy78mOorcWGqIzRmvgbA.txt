This has been a hard year for many business' and it especially shows here. I haven't gone as much as I used to since it seemed like each time they were out of something. This is an issue considering the menu is already limited. My most recent and last visit, there was almost no meat on my torta. We ordered some chips and guacomole with our food and it was just enough to feel satisfied, but over priced since it lacked meat.
