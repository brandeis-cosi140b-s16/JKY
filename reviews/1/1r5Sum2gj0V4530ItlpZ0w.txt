So, my husband and I travel all over and have also lived in Mexico.  I had tried this place once when it first came to Mesa,and was not impressed, but decided to give it another chance tonight.  Yes, I have read all the reviews, both good and bad, and never go by what others think of restaurants.  Truthfully, most people do not know what good food is.  La Parilla is very clean and the staff is truly friendly and attentive (there were no problems with the wait staff not speaking English as others have thoughtlessly posted.  It wouldn't have been a problem anyway as my husband speaks Spanish quite well).  Our drinks arrived within minutes as well as the chips and salsa trio...That is where things went downhill.  The red salsa tasted exactly like Heize tomato sauce out of the can with onion added, the pico de gallo was ok, but without the red onion and lime that could make it truly stellar, and the avacado crema (it could not be called a guacamole) was watery and had the overripe banana flavor that we associate with avacados going bad.  We ordered the cheese crisp, which is one of our main judging points of all Mexican restaurants.  It also arrived quickly and had plenty of melted monterey jack cheese, but the tortilla underneath was cooked nearly to death, almost to the point of being burned.  It did not have the crisp, almost cinnamon flavor of fresh baked, homemade tortillas, but the flour and paste flavor that shows the ratio is off and that they were made with poor quality AP flour.
     We both know Mexico City food, as well as Sonoran, and this was not good quality Mexican food all the way around.  Needless to say, we declined to order an entree and instead left without finishing the appetizer.  Disappointing, and we will not return, although we wished we would have been wrong...There are so few really good places to eat in Mesa.
