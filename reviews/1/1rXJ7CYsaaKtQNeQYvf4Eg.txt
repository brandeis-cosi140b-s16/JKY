I have over 100 check-ins at this place, and have been "Duke" for years. But lately I see new management, and new people cooking, and it's sad to see them going downhill...

Food:
I've been coming to this Rubio's nearly every week for years. Although I've been getting the same thing for months, two visits ago, they really messed up my to-go order. Instead of black beans on the side, they put them IN my shrimp and bacon burrito! Not recommended, in case you were wondering.

So a few days ago, I pointed out the issue, and ordered the same thing again, to-go as usual. This time, the burrito had slices of RAW jalapeño inside, when it was supposed to be cooked. Also, the shrimp were tiny, not the usual plump shrimp. But what topped it off - when I was nearly finished eating the burrito, I hit something that definitely tasted moldy. Needless to say, I called them, and the apologized and said next visit I would get a free meal.

Well, I tried another to-go order again today. The manager agreed the jalapeños should not be raw, and was careful to accurately capture my order. When I got home, the good news is, the burrito was fine, and the shrimp were once again decent sized. But imagine my disappointment when I once again hit something definitely moldy in the black beans!!! I called the manager, who took it all in. He chose to react to the "good" burrito, ignoring the mold issue with the black beans, and said "...well I'm glad this time it worked out ok".   Really? Really??

Cost:
The cost is reasonable: $9-10 for a premium burrito, enchilada style.

Service: 
They always seem to have enough staff to keep things moving right along.

Atmosphere:
Well, it's a fast food chain in a shopping center. 'Nuff said!

Overall:
Three times in a row I've had issues, so I won't be back for a while.
