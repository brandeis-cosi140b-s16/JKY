Horrible. Our company orders from here at least once a month if not more. Today was the worse experience. The Guacamole was brownish/turning black.  They forgot the kids fruit, the chips were stale and nasty. The actual burrito bowls were poorly made and the salad's meet was pretty red in the middle. Everyone ate about 3 bites and decided this will be the last time we order from this location possibly chipotle all together. Subway is a better option
