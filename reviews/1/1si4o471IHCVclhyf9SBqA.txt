I was so excited they opened this location because it is much closer to my home. I love the Raul & Theresa's off the MC85 and thought for sure this would be the same.  Finally went today and I am so very disappointed! Worst Mexican Food I have ever had to be quite honest.  I got the Chorizo and Eggs and a beef taco.  The taco was bland and the Chorizo & eggs were burnt and just tasted horrible.  The service wasn't that great and it was very hot. Im sad to say I will never go back.
