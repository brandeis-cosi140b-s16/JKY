I can't comment on the food but I placed an order through Eat24, which is only supposed to offer restaurants that deliver to your location. They charged me for it, sent me a confirmation, then waited nearly an hour (how long the delivery was supposed to take) to notify me that I was out of their delivery area and they had cancelled my order. If that's how they do business I think I'll take mine somewhere else.
