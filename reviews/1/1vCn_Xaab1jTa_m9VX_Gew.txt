I have had my fair share of Mariscos and this was by far the worst place I had been to.  Not only was the food horrible and tasteless but it took 50 minutes to get our food served. I understand that this was a busy weekend but the Resteraunt should have been better prepared with more than just two servers. 

I DO NOT recommend this place.
