I was visiting a friend and craving Del Taco as I haven't had it in forever. We pulled up to the drive thru and no one said anything. We thought they were closed because the parking lot was rather empty. I told my friend just to say hello and see if anyone answered. She did, in no way rude  at all. Just a simple hello. Girl came on and responded with major attitude "yeah can you give me a minute?!" Friend replied "sorry but if you had said something so I knew you were even there I would have def given you a minute". Girl then said "ok then now you can give me three minutes". Wow! Talk about shitty service. I decided to take my business elsewhere. I live on the East Coast and love Del Taco so much but that girl made it so not worth it to me. I mean, I'm from Jersey and I have never experienced such ignorance. Really, just disgusting.
