Went there today because its .99 cent beef and chicken Taco Tuesday all day. When I looked at their daily specials they also listed $4.99 two beef tacos and a drink! That doesn't even make sense. Why even bother having a special like that?! I dunno maybe they use the overcooked scraps on the .99 cent orders because thats what it tasted like. After finishing my meal my stomach starting turning a little.
