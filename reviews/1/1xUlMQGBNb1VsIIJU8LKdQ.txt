The decor is contempory Mexican and it was packed when my wife and I got there just before the end of Happy Hour.  Ordered 2 Chile Rellinos on a dinner serving, a Chicken enchilladsa, and a green chile burro.  After a LONG wait, one a la carte chile rellino arrived with some chicken tostados andno burro.  The server disappeared and after 5 minutes came back and noticed we weren't eating our meal...and we told him they had delivered  the wrong things.  He check his order and took them away.  About 10 minutes later the correct things arrived.  While the portions are generous...the food is VERY BLAND.  Probably the worst Mexican food I've ever had.  Oh...the salsa and chips before the meal were good and the small older busboy was very hard working and pleasant.  There are many places better than this place.  Very disappointing.
