I couldn't be more disappointed, i drove all the way from north east vegas to have some of the great food I've been hearing about,it said they open at 9am got there 5 after 10am and the lady tells me that they don't open until 10 then looks at her watch and says  oh it's after 10 then tells me the food isn't ready yet which me being a chef it's understanding opening a few minutes late,but i stood in the line by myself for 30 minutes until i asked when the food will be ready and they asked what i wanted and i said some delicious roasted chicken,they said that would be another hour so i said how long for hotwings they said an hour as well..grrrr i want to try the food so bad.:-(
