Haven't been here in a while, but the food is not what it used to be and the service was very slow. Seriously how many times does the waiter have to walk by and notice that everyone at the table is gone but me. Waiting for the check do nearly 15 minutes. If it were buy it would be one thing but this is a bit ridiculous. Sorry, but have to recommend not coming here. Hate to say that because this place used to be a really great place to come and have lunch or dinner and have a few drinks. Sad to see it go down hill. :(
