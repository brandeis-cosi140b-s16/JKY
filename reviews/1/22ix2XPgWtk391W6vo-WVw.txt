Avoid the food. Besides the service never coming around to the table the food is bland and not really hot when delivered. 

I had a grande burrito and it had what looked like canned cubes of chicken in it--the kind you find in a plastic package in the grocery store. The chips and salsa, besides costing $2.50, were so over salted they were un-eatable. 

I saw my waiter three times the entire time. Once after five minutes of waiting at the table after being seated. Once to deliver a drink and then again to deliver the food.  That's it.
