Fucking worst!!! No wonder robertos is shutting down cuz they fucking suck at service. I came here after a long day shift and ordered food thru drive thru and guess what I didn't get one of my orders. Like wtf I live 15 min away and they expected me just to drive back and get it like, really??  I work in the food industry and know how hard it is for cooks, so I even tipped them another $5 and it's like a slap in the face for them to not even get my order right and this shouldn't have happened. Get it right the first time.
