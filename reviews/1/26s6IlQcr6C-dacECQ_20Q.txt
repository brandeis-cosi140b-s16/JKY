Food was not good. Wife said the chicken tacos tasted horrible. Cheese enchilada tasted like dirt. The bean burrito was ok but I had them add sour cream and guacamole.  The prices were way too high for this low quality of food. I should have known better than to eat here when i saw they don't accept credit cards.  When an owner is too cheap to pay visa/MasterCard 2% of a transaction, you know they are going to be cheap with the food quality too.
