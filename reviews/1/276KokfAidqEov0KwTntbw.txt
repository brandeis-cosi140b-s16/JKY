Ever since the change of owners, the quality of the food has declined. Chips are oily because they refry them using oil that is not sufficiently hot. Salsa that came with chips used to be fresh but now it's more on the brown side than tomato red. 

Chicken Enchiladas was just so so. - restaurant looked dirty. Acapulco lunch meal was drenched in oil - service was quick and efficient though.
