The service was very helpful here, want to make it clear. However, it is very difficult to please your guests when the kitchen behind you puts out disgusting food.

Har Gau - best average for dim sum. EXTREMELY pricey for the quality and portion size.

Chicken lettuce wraps - The chicken wasn't bad but the lettuce cup they were served in were extremely fibrous and tough to eat.

Tuna Tartar - The amaranth seeds ruined this dish to the point where we had to take this back.

Vegetable fried rice - Recommended by the server because it was on "Best things I ever ate". probably one of the worst things I ever ate. This was absolutely disgusting and this is coming from someone who loves vegetables. The veggies (turnips, radishes, greens, etc.) were near-raw  and the ratio of vegetable to rice was about 2:1. 

Biggest waste of $120 in my life.
