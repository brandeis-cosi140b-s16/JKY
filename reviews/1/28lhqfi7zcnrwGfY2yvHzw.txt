I came to this restaurant tonight with my boyfriend. I ended up only ordering a sangria so my comment is not gonna be on the food but on the service only. 

It took us at least 5 minutes to get our water. Then we waited another couple more minutes to get Cindy - the waitress/ owner - to order our food. 

I happened to check my phone after placing our order, and it was 9:06pm. We got our food at 9:21pm. During this 15 minutes wait, no one ever checked on us or anything. 

Before coming we purchased a $10 for $20 coupon on LocalFlavor. But when we showed this coupon to Cindy before getting our check, she told us that SHE WAS TOLD that this coupon is only applied for some "two-person dining". And when we asked her what exactly two person dining was she said something like we need to order two entree or something. I can't remember what exactly she said but her point was we couldn't use our coupon. The price wasn't ridiculous so we were fine paying with cards. 

But then I went back to the website where we purchased the coupon and there was not a single word about this "2 person dining". So I decided to talk to the owner about this. Not to get our money back but to find out what exactly is happening. We asked Cindy who the owner was and guess what? SHE IS THE OWNER HERSELF. So what was the "I was told that this coupon can only apply to two person dining". Told by whom?! 

My boyfriend was nice enough not to complain to the owner but instead telling her to put that "two person dining only" thing on the coupon website so that what happened to us won't happen to the next customer. But I feel like I need to share my terrible experience with other potential customers so for whom care about quality of services can avoid this place. 

And if the restaurant can see my comment hopefully they want to improve what has upset their customers.  

Happy holidays to whoever is reading my review.
