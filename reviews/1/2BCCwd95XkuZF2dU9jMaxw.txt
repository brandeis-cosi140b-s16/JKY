This place USED to be good. We went there yesterday afternoon and everything was cold and tasted stale. To make our experience even better my husband had to get his own refill since our waiter never bothered to check if we needed any and when we asked for more salsa when our food came our waiter said he'd get it for us, a little while later still no salsa so my husband got up to look for our waiter to ask him for it and he said "in a minute I'm really busy"....WOW!!! I wouldn't be so irked if it were a packed restaurant but there was seriously only 1 other table there and I counted at least 4 if not 5 people working there...1 of them could've bothered to check to make sure if we had drinks and/or chips and salsa but obviously that was expecting way too much. Like I said they used to be good but the past few times I've been there their quality has been going down and this last experience was the last straw. Of course they are also very pricey...10.50 for 2 tacos beans and rice and the tacos are SMALL. I never thought Don Pedros which is 10 minutes away was that great but unfortunately Don Pedros is now better than this place :(
