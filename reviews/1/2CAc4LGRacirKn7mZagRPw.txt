Unfortunately, or fortunately perhaps, I did not get to eat here. I purchase a deal here and the day before it expired I found it. My mom had an accident and couldn't make it .. Called the next day and explained the situation. They didn't care!! They wouldn't even honor the $10 I spent for $20 of food.  Real family run place I guess. Very disappointed!!! Buyer beware!
