Sign of decline

Ok has been one of my favorite places to eat 

Due a work location shift had not been there for about six months.

So I go to get my favorite since I had been craving it. The lady at the counter is abrupt informs me that she will fill out the sheet.

 So I place my order and wait. And wait. Place is not busy. And wait.

Get the food, have to ask again for my drinks. Abrupt again.

I got it to go. Open it and find my Jen red pork quesadilla has a grand total of 5 pieces of pork. Yes  small pieces totaling 5. One section no meat just sauce. Burrito half full as normal. Ordered double jerk rice instead of beans got one portion of rice. Rice had balls of cold white rice with no flavoring.


Severely disappointed. My brother goes this last week. Almost same exact experience.

Sad to me to see the decline of such a great quirky place
