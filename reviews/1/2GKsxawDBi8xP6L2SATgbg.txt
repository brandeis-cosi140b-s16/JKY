Ordered empanadas to go. Three orders and $28 later...I cut them open and 75 to 80% of them were EMPTY!  (They werent great either) I called the manager and she indicated this is a known issue as they are made fresh onsite. Ok benefit of the doubt. She indicated she would send some coupons my way for throwing my cash down the drain... Has not happened.  I guess I'll be calling AMEX.
