Recently listed as one of the Top 10 new restaurants in the Valley.  Well, I made this Yelp account just to warn people from eating at this place.  Went on a Wednesday night.  Thirty tables in the place and 4 were filled.  Took 20 minutes until we even saw water; another 10 for the first sighting of our waiter.   Ordered drinks and our food.  When I asked about the size of the dishes, I was explained it was a tapas-style place.  Thought that was funny when each tapas dish was between $9-15.  Does leave you wanting to order many different dishes at that price.  

When my $11 taco plate arrived I bust out laughing.  There were 3 of them, none larger than the diameter of my hand, and I have small hands.  I asked if these were sample tacos or the actual place.  Then ordered a side of beans which, for $6 was smaller than your average side of ketchup.  It was almost funny.  I felt like I was in the Shire, eating with Bilbo and Frodo.  

Asked the bus boy for our server several times.  Finally we had to order from the bus boy another round of drinks.  The table behind us got up and left, telling the bus boy (the only person actually working) that they weren't paying for their drinks because they were done waiting.  

When we finally saw our waiter again, no drinks in hand, he apologized, saying they got busy.  I guess 4 our of 30 tables filled is busy.  

Hey, if you're not really hungry and just want to say you went to a Top 10 restaurant in Scottsdale, by all means, go.  Or if you just want horrible service and are on a portion control diet, go, you'll love this place.

I give them 6 more months before the doors close.  Someone time it.
