I stopped in here for dinner recently to see how the place looked after their recent "remodel" and I was surprised to see that even though there were improvements made to the exterior (fresh paint, expanded parking lot, and nicer patio) the inside looked exactly the same except they had replaced the rundown, ugly, uncomfortable tables and chairs with others that were only slightly less ugly and uncomfortable. Everything else was exactly the same, including the layer of grime over all the fixtures, walls, and flooring. I was willing to overlook that since we usually only do takeout anyway but once we ate our food my husband and I both agreed that we would not come here again. The quality of food has been going down the last couple of months but this was a new low. I have never liked the place itself but at least I thought the food was decent but nothing we ordered this last visit was even edible.  Dry, crumbly tamales, burnt tortilla chips, and carne asada that tasted like the meat had spoiled. The worst part was the crispy taco that was disgustingly soggy and filled with a substance that looked like dog food and tasted like what I would imagine that canned dog food tastes like. I mean, it was worse than Taco Bell. Seriously.

There still seemed to be a steady stream of people coming in the door, again mostly take-out orders, so I guess their customers are very loyal or else not everyone thinks it's gotten as bad as I do. I think most of their loyal fans keep coming back since it is so cheap, but there are lots of better options for cheap Mexican food in Chandler.
