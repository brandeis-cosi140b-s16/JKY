I really liked this place the first time I ate here but the second time eating here will be my last.  The prices jumped up overnight it seemed.  The portion sizes were cut back so it didn't feel like I got my money's worth.  The staff seemed, poorly trained, we had a waiter try to take our drink orders after someone already took our drink orders, then when the drinks came out only two showed up and the other two people who ordered drinks waited tell their food came out to get the drinks. The staff just seemed like no one knew where to go or what to do. I was embarrassed after talking this place up to my out of towners . I hope this place doesn't last long and something better moves in soon.  They would be doing downtown a favor if they did.
