When ordering a shrimp burrito be aware the cheese comes with it and is not supposed to be charged as extra.  I know this because the Nellis and Stewart location goes by the book on their ingredients.  After a very frustrating conversation with a person who speaks perfect English about wanting my burrito spicy, which it comes that way, I instantly hated the place.  The table area smelled like the bathrooms. The sides and sauce area was filthy along with the floors, tables and chairs.  When we brought our food home my kids couldn't eat the shrimp burrito because they made it so spicy it was inedible.  My boyfriend loves heat and it was too much for him.   This was done out of spite. The other food was bland and gross. We've had better at other locations.  But then again service at any of the eateries in that area is the same as a prison chow hall.
