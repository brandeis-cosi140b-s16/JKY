I'd like to give this place zero stars, but that is not an option. I used to go here and like it, until about a month ago when I went in on a weekend day for lunch and got a nasty surprise. 

I ordered my usual - shredded beef tacos.  I took one of the two home as I can never finish all my food.  Later I went to eat the other one for dinner and when biting down, bit into a rock hard "something" that cracked my tooth.  I spit it out, put it in a bag and went back to the restaurant to complain.  My server and an Asst Mgr looked at it and determined it was a piece of bone that came from a mistake a cook made while shaving meat off the bone.

I was promised the owner would contact me to discuss the situation and my injury.  Days passed and nothing. I went back in person again - was again promised a phone call.  Days passed and nothing.  I called a few days later and was told the same thing over the phone.  Days passed and well you get it by now - nothing!  I went in person one last time to tell the person at the hostess stand that I was disgusted by how I was being treated.  

She told me the owner was out of town now for several weeks.  I told her that almost everyone has a cell phone and if he cared even a little for how a patron of his restaurant was impacted by the food I was served, he'd find a way to get off his ass and call me.  She just looked at me. 

This place should be SHUT DOWN immediately. Food safety and customer safety is obviously of no concern here.  Eating here is at your own risk.  

Mr. wonderful owner will be hearing from me soon - when I sue him in small claims court.  Had he been a decent human being, we could have resolved this so much easier.
