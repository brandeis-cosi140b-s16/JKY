I ordered the chicken quesadilla because the picture on the menu looks delicious. What I got was a tortilla filled with green chiles and lettuce and a couple little bitty pieces of chicken. I thought they had made a mistake, so I brought it up to the manager, and told him about the problem. Even with this picture of a chicken quesadilla overflowing with chicken, he told me that my quesadilla was normal and he did not offer to remake the meal. That's just bad customer service so I asked for a refund. I live and work down the street from there but I'll never go back.
