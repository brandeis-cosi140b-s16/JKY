DON'T ORDER THEIR DRINKS!!!!

A basic house margarita at this place costs $15.18 and there are no prices on the menu.  We were shocked when we received the bill and were told that this was indeed the standard price and not a mistake.  After complaining to the supervisor about their unethical practices she was ambivalent and basically told me she was powerless to make it right and to talk to call the corporate office to complain.  

I feel sorry for the nice waitress or anyone else working here as they are forbidden "by restaurant policy" to warn customers who don't ask about the price of a standard drink.
