This food is straight up taste less, idk what style of seafood this is but it is not very appetizing..food here is boring, i find the plates more amusing to see while eating, and maybe choking since the service here is so slow, it does get busy on the weekends which is understandable but having to be a small restaurant I'am sure they can check up on every cust real quick. the time to cook is ridiculous seeing others arriving later than you and receiving their food a lot sooner is really frustrating to see. Now maybe this attracts the type that grew up to this boring style of seafood, but never again will i ever waste time and money for sea...actually LAKE FOOD

note: oysters here are farm raised not from the ocean...they will admit to that ;)
