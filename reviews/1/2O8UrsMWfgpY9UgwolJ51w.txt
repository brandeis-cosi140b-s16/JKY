My family and I had a reservation for dinner before our show. Our party of 6 was sat down at 6pm. The restaurant was only about half full. It took a full 10 minutes before anyone even acknowledged our presence. The bus server who finally came by with chips and took our drink order didn't even get the drink order correct. She had to go back for my ice tea. It took another 15 minutes for the waitress to show up. Mind you, we flagged the manager down during this time and he said he would find our waitress and send her over. He didn't. He went back to his stand, completely ignoring our request. After another 15 minutes we did finally get our food...I had the flautas. All I can figure is my order was done first and just sat waiting for everyone elses. It was luke warm and soggy, same thing happened to two other diners in our party as well on completely different dishes. We talked with the Manager again on our way out and he truly didn't care. If you love crappy food and seriously lousy service, go ahead and go there. My family and I sure won't.
