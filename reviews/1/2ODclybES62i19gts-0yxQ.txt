First Caveat, this review was written the second day the place was open so I am hopeful it will improve.  The place is big and airy with a nice bar and patio. Be warned-the beer selection is pretty pathetic and would be better if they added some locally made craft beers instead of crap like Blue Moon and Dos Equis.  That said the service was horrible.  The waitress was completely out of her element.  We waited for about 5 minutes or so before we were asked if we wanted anything to drink. Over 10 minutes went by before our coffee and water showed up (Water spots on the glassware). Then we had to ask for menus.  Finally our order was taken.  The food came out in a semi reasonable time but the waffle was cold and the $2.99 side of jalapeno coleslaw was incredibly small for the price. We actually should have received two waffles because the waffle that came was with the meal and I had ordered the coffee and waffle special as well. There was a second waitress who seemed to have her act together, in fact another table next to us that came in 15-20 minutes after us got served by her and had their food before we did and paid before we did. Oh and that waitress took the time to refill my coffee, something our waitress didnt do once. Oh-the bill was messed up also and they had problems with their credit card machine being out of paper.  The bathroom was also dirty and wasn't cleaned from the night before as we were there right when the place opened. We were there just over an hour which is twice as long as it should have taken.  Was a calamity of errors but errors that proper training of the staff or a good restaurant manager could fix.
