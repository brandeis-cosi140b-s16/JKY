I've been to the other location a couple of times and thought the food was decent and affordable. So I decided to check this one out. I wanted a wet chimichanga with rice and beans and it came to almost $16. I thought that price was ridiculous! I can go to the BEST Mexican food restaurants and pay less and get complimentary chips and salsa, which this place wants extra for. I cancelled my order and called Macayos for take out. I got all that I wanted and saved a few bucks. Not going to go back.
