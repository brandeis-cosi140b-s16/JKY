Dead spices, limp chips, unimaginative salsa. Tacos are tasteless, enchiladas are small. This restaurant caters to snow birds who think this is Mexican tradition. Taco meat? It's not real Mexican flavored, it tastes as though they are trying to stretch spices for cost savings. Drinks are unoriginal. Margaritas are......NOT. 
Ask for a swirl, margarita blended with sangria and prepare for a dumbfounded look. Cleanliness lacks! Prepare for menus doused in stale salsa. Tables crusty with dried......whatever from the last patrons. Both restaurants are the same. 
After giving this group almost two years of patronage, nothing changes. One day I hope  it's food will match its decor. 
Tourists trap.
