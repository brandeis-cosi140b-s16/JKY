We were looking for a place to grab a few appetizers and drinks after a morning/afternoon of gambling in Vegas and from the outside La Salsa Cantina appeared to offer just that.  We were very wrong.  Six of us walked into the empty restaurant and we were quickly greeted by our server and we ordered 6 Tecates as soon as we sat down.  We then ordered an order of guacamole, queso and the steak nachos.  All of them were fairly tasteless and average at best (I would give the food 2 stars).  So our food comes out and we start eating, but our Tecates are nowhere to be found.  About 45 minutes later we are done with our meal and we ask for our check.  As he brings out our check and notices the Tecates on there he tells us he will be right back with our beers.  I politely told him that it's a little late for that and we just needed to leave to which he replied "Oh, so you don't want the beers you ordered anymore?".  The whole exchange was a little mind boggling and I wish I could have the 45 minutes of my life that I spent at La Salsa Cantina back.  

As we left and were walking to our next destination I noticed a Chiptole.  I have not eaten at this Chipotle, but I am postive that going to that Chiptole and spending 15 minutes eating a burrito and then the other 30 minutes as a handbiller passing out escort service cards to tourists while wearing an orange shirt that says "Girls Girls Girls" would have been more enjoyable than our 45 minutes at La Salsa Cantina.
