If you are going to La Salsa to get a half yard or whatever of a margarita, go to 7-Eleven and get a slushie. The $26 48oz strawberry margarita I got tasted good, but after downing the entire thing, I didn't feel anything. To put things in prospective, the day prior I got a 48oz margarita from Fat Tuesday for $17 and I was good....really good for the entire night.

Go to Fat Tuesday if you want a good margarita to get drunk. 

Go to 7-Eleven if you want a good tasting slushie and save yourself $25
