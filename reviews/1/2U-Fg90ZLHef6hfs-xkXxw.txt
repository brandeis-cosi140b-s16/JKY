I love Rubio's but this location is terrible! The service is very slow even when they are not very busy. I've been there a few times and they have messed up my order every time. Once they made the completely wrong burrito. Another time I got chicken instead of steak. Tonight I ordered a Steak Burrito Especial to go, got home to eat it and there was not one piece of steak in the burrito. They also tried to give me a tiny one ounce container of guacamole with my order of chips and guacamole. I go to the location on Green Valley and Pebble all the time and they have always given me the 4 oz cup of guacamole with the chips and guacamole and they always get my order correct at that location. Avoid this location and go to the Green Valley and Pebble location instead.
