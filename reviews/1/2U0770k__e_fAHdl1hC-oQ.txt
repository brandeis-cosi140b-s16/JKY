We love dining at Javier's when in vegas. We are from Orange County and love the Newport Beach location as well. Unfortunately, we won't be going back to the Las Vegas location. Last night we sat down and ordered drinks and I was carded, which is a compliment seeing as I'm a 34 year old mom of two. I didn't have my id as I haven't been carded in probably 5 years. My husband showed him his id (he's 35) and he still wouldn't allow me to order a drink. We asked to speak to a manager twice and no one would talk to us. I get it. I should have had my id. But it would have been nice of the manager to come over and see for himself that I clearly don't look like I'm 20. Instead he was schmoozing a table across the restaurant with shots of tequila. My issue isn't that they wouldn't serve me. Like I said, I should have had my id and I would never want to jeopardize the waiters job. My issue is that the manager was asked twice to come to our table and didn't have the decency to speak to us. Pretty crappy customer service if you ask me and the food wasn't that great last night either.
