Horrible service. I felt like i was treated like the ugly adopted child here. First they got my order wrong and didn't do anything about it. The horchata had a nasty burnt after taste. Pupusas were mehh... Then they took foreverrrrr to bring our desert. Seriously forever, my testicles were beginning to collect dust. And to top it off one of the flan deserts was burnt. Its not over ladies and gentlemen... Then our check was wrong too. I won't ever be coming back here for sure.
