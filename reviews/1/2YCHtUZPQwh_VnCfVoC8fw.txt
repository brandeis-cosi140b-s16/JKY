Very disappointed in the quality of this business. We used to recommend to everyone new coming to visit us in Queen Creek, but have to say we won't any more. From the service to the quality of the food preparation, everything that could've went wrong, DID! In order to come up with a resolution, we tried talking to the manager and she was unaccommodating which should definitely get no star at all.
