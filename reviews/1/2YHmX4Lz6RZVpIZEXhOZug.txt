We came in for happy hour for my friends birthday and walked into the bar and asked the waitress if it just the bar top or the side tables too. She said sit where ever you want. Okay. So we sat. And sat. She walked by and got two orders before making eye contact with us. Walked by three more times and still got ignored. Another server asked if we ordered the spin dip and we said we hadn't even been greeted yet and she walked away. Still sitting and waiting.. we see another table sit down and she starts taking their order right in front of us. They were on wait when we could see open tables everywhere. Then we sat and Googled another happy hour spot for a few minutes. We left and no one said a single word. We both serve too and this was the worst thing we've ever seen. Hahaha worst service here!! The manager watched us leave too and didn't even budge. Pathetic.
