The cashier over charged me for my food and when I brought the attention to her manager she was just as rude !!!! It's great she's there for her workers but she needs to learn how to listen to customer complaints without getting offended. I told her I wouldn't come back to this location and she laughed and said okay! Would not recommend this place at all!!!
