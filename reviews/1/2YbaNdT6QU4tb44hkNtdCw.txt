So we read a lot of reviews saying that their portions are huge and 'two people can share' or 'there is no way you will leave hungry', but now I know that is totally not true. I am a small girl (~115lbs) and even I could have eaten 2 burrito bowls. We were hungry from walking around and really disappointed about how small their portions are. They served us a burrito bowl in a container made for small side salads. We would have ordered their burritos instead of the burrito bowls but tortillas are also made using lard (gross) instead of other healthier options. If you have been walking a lot and are actually hungry, your $12 would be better spent somewhere else.
