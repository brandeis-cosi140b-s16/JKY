I work out of my car all day and work in sales, so I always need to have a large cup of water with me. I asked for a large cup of water at the restaurant and was given a small water cup. This cup of water will last me about 2 minutes as I have a medical condition and need to stay very hydrated, and as I was not dining in, and was getting a to go order, I figured that a 5 cent large cup would not be an issue. Instead, the cashier said I would have to pay for the large cup. For water. I tried speaking to the manager about it and she was unsympathetic and even rolled her eyes at me. She was uncompromising and quite rude. I have never had this issue at any other Chipotles in getting a large cup for water (especially since I was getting my order to go). I even offered to let them see that I was getting just water, or for them to fill it up for me, and they would not do a thing to compromise with me. 

I am a frequent customer at Chipotles around the Pittsburgh area because I have to have a gluten free diet, but after this experience I will stick with Panera or Qdoba. I went to the Wendy's down the road and asked for a large cup (without buying a thing) and they gave it to me, no questions asked. I am very disappointed with their customer service.
