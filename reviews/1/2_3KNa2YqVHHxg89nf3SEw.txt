First impressions are everything...and ours was not favorable. Menu board in the entrance was odd and confusing.  Person who finally helped  us figure it out was a welcome sight.  Food arrived relatively quickly, but was barely warm.  Best item was the black beans.  Floors were sticky, and two out of the three women's bathroom stalls were out of order (not good at 5 pm on a Friday evening).  We are not likely to return anytime soon.
