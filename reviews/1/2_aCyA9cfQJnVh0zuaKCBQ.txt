Great customer service but lacking good food. Tortilla wasn't fully heated so the folks here don't know how to properly heat a tortilla and wanted to add black beans to my burrito. I was like ugh and was quick to tell him no. Any place that thinks black beans is best for a burrito definitely doesn't know it's stuff. Asked for the hottest salsa and they said it was the green one and I was skeptical but in a hurry. Boy it was not even hot and was the typical salsa verde with sweetness. Giving one star just because they were nice and good at customer service but bad at food service.
