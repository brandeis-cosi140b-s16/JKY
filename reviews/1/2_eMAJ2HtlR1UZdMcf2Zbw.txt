I really want to like this place but ... I'm just not impressed. The pork belly entree sounded phenomenal but was the antithesis of anything I imagined. The cube of pork belly was a brick of dried, over cooked belly of something - Not good.
My husband's enchiladas tasted reheated with Chef Boyardee on top. The dogs will love the leftovers ... Maybe.
