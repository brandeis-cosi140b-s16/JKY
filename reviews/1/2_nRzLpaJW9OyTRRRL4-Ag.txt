So we went to grab a bite to eat at the salted lime on Taco Tuesday. The Hostess an older woman was super nice and made us feel welcome. Our waitress however No customer service skills at all. The food took over an hour to arrive and the manager comped our meal. It was tacos thought so it shouldn't have taken that long. Anyway not happy with the service and the food was mediocre  not impressed
