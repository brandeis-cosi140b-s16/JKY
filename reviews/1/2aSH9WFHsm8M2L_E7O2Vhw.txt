I really wanted to like this place. I went for basic Mexican food, guacamole and carne asada tacos. Both were largely under portioned and extremely over priced. To be honest, I don't care too much about price as long as I'm getting quality food. Roberto's taco shops serves better carne asada tacos and I only go there when I'm drunk/hungover! The server was friendly, location is good, and the decor was okay. I do like the rooftop patio but until they get better quality food and lower their prices I won't be back. It's matter of time before this place shuts down. Hopefully next year the new restaurant will have good food!
