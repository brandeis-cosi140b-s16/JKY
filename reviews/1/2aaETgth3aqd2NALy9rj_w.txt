If I could have gave it 0 Stars I would have, I will never eat here or order food from here again.  They Nickel and Dime you to the max!  I was charged extra for Tomatos, cilantro, and a small dab of sour cream.  The girl working the register was rude and impatient and she got almost the entire order wrong! 

When we called to speak to the manager we were rudely told it was our fault and that they filled the order correctly!!!  On top of all that the food was poorly prepared and carelessly thrown together!  Fausto's is much better I wish I had drove the extra 1/2 mile and enjoyed my Meal!  DO NOT EAT HERE!!!
