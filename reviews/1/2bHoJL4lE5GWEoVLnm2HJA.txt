I would leave a 1/2 or zero if it were at all possible. When we showed up we were told that our wait would be 20-25 minutes, typical wait time for a chain restaurant. We unfortunately ended up waiting for 50 minutes and then to add insult to injury our group of 5 was sardined into a table for 4 and we were pretty much left to fend for ourselves. 6 different groups that checked in after us were sat before us and the service was terrible to boot. This is the last time I will step foot in this establishment, the mediocre food, absolutely terrible service and mildew smell coming from the kitchen are not near worth the stress of trying to get a meal.
