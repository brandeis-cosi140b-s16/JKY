worst Mexican food place ever. first of all, EVERYTHING is cooked with onions so if you don't like onions I suggest you choose another restaurant entirely. secondly, the servers are rude and quick to leave the table. they never make eye contact, no polite tones, and bad with refills. and last but definitely not least, THEY HAVE ROACHES. I was simply trying to enjoy a meal with family & low & behold I see a big roach crawling down the wall from the ceiling to the table. never coming here again. salsa also has too much cilantro.
