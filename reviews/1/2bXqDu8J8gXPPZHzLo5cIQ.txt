Oh My God.  Was this disgusting.  Been eating at various Filibertos for years but this place was totally gross.  2 beef tacos and some rolled tacos with guac.  The guac was grey.  The meat in the rolled tacos was still frozen.  The beef tacos were dripping grease and way under cooked.  I understand how this location had 2 stars. 

Stay away from this location.
