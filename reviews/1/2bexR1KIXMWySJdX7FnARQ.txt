Uhg. For an airport this is the worst airport food I've had... Probably ever.  Horrible service and incredibly overpriced.

I paid 30$ for a poorly made margarita with chips and salsa. 30 dollars for a watered down "mango margarita" and stale chips with flavorless salsa.  And my waiter came to get my order and drop off the check. That's it. 

I know it's Vegas and you have a lot of people to attend to but come on!
