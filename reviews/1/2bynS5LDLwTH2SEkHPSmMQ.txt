Been going to Penascos since it opened. Food and service have been in a continual decline. Last visit was the last time I will go there. Their specialty "Las Conchas" arrived on a searing hot plate with cold food. Potatoes appeared to have come directly out of the refrigerator. When I complained, the owner became very rude, throwing the bill at me and saying there was no charge and she did not want my business. Fine with me.
