I am so frustrated with Eva's! Tonight we came with 4 adults and 4 children and had Fernando as our server. Three extremely well behaved older children who didn't make a peep the whole meal and 1 toddler who didn't spill a drop of food or drink on the floor. Let me start by saying we love Eva's food. The food was great- even though it took over 45 minutes to get our food and our server didn't come back to the table in the meantime to refill the chips. After we were done my toddler started to get fussy since we had now been there about two hours and we couldn't find our guy to get boxes or our check. Finally we got some help from a hostess and were more than ready to go home. They still hadn't brought our desert so we got it to go. All this was fine. We were annoyed with the lack of attention and service but this wasn't the bad part. We paid the bill without looking at it. It was 110. We tipped our server Fernando a generous 15$ for the worst service we've received in a long time. When we got home we realized the bill was too high. We drove back to the restaurant and found out that our server charged us an 18% tip!!!!! He deserved like 5%!! And he was fine with adding the extra tip and getting a tip over 30$!!!! Are you kidding me? In conclusion check your receipts or an extremely presumptuous server might give you awful service and take home a nice chunk of change for it.
