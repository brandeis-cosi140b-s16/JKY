I haven't been to this location in a while and I probably won't be back. I remember it being more customer friendly. I understand that its busy but there's no reason to rush your customers into an order then make them wait a few minutes while your trying to figure out the orders of the people already being helped. Before I knew it the employees decided what I wanted in my burritos and they were all wrapped up going through the oven cause I wanted them enchilada style. That's when I was told that they only put the "toppings" on the side now. Every other time I've been here I've been able to choose what goes into my order. I just wanted some lettuce and tortilla strips in my burrito. Feeling confused I just went along with it cause I had a two for one coupon and was just looking for a quicker deal for dinner. Saving a little bit of money it still came out to more than twenty bucks. With the food not being prepared how I wanted it and feeling unvalued as a customer is leaving me pretty disappointed in my choice of place for dinner
