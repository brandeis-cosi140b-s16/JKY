All I'll say is...wow.  This place was SO bad! Maybe we came at a bad time, on the weekend when the area is dead but everything we ordered, tacos, burrito, quesadilla, chips...were all terrible. I don't give out that opinion lightly but the food was all cold with NO flavor at all. We even ordered everything spicy and it was so bland. Very disappointed will not be returning.
