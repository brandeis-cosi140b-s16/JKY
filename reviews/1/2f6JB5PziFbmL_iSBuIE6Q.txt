This location was the worst customer service I have ever had!!  They overcharged me for my food.  When I went back to get refund they acted like it was my fault.  I had to give them a print out of my bank statement and they had to look at a camera on the register to realize the cashier messed up.  I will never go to that Chipotle again!
