The restaurant was empty when we arrived for an early dinner (my husband had to be somewhere, so we only had an hour).  The chips, salsa, and guac were good.  Unfortunately the service was horrible.  Three tables were sat after us and they all had their entrees before us.  Meanwhile our server just kept hovering and ignoring the fact that we were getting agitated.  

We decided to share the fajitas.  By the time our food arrived (forty minutes after sitting down) we had to ask for a box because we had to leave.  The fajitas were awful. No flavor at all.  Our server never acknowledged the wait or asked how the food was.  We asked to speak to a manager and she gave us a card for $10 off our next visit......but there won't be a next visit.  There are too many awesome places to go in Charlotte - don't waste your time or money on this one.
