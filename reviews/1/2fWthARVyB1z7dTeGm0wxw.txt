Went with a group of 30 for our office's holiday party. The manager demanded that we have one ticket for the group, When I pointed out that we had reservations and that they had made no effort to seat us together, some were not even in the same room she agreed to allow us to have separate tickets per table but that the tip was going to be added to the bill. The tables were dirty and sticky. 

The food arrived before our drinks did. I had to ask for ice in my iced tea, and was told they were low on ice. The food was mediocre. The salsa was plain it tasted like tomatoes without any salt, garlic, onion or cilantro. I am used to a thick flavorful, spicy enchilada sauce, theirs is like red gravy. The green chile was watery with very little meat inside. A co-worker complained about the tostada being stale, and was told that it couldn't be stale. The server then told my co-worker she just wasn't used to good mexican food. There was no offer to correct the order.

When we left, we made sure that the entire bill was paid including an 18% tip. After I left, I got a call from some staff who were stuck because the manager said someone didn't pay. I returned to pay the bill  and when I got there, they found the money in one of the servers pockets. She says she "forgot" that she had put it there. When I asked for an apology and what she was going to do about the problems we had encountered she stared at me coldly and told me "Nothing".

The only reason I can think that she still has a job is that she is either family or sleeping with the owner.

I wrote the owners 3 letters, called at least 10 times and no one has gotten back to me. Sadly, this place used to be the best of the best, and now it is the absolute worst!
