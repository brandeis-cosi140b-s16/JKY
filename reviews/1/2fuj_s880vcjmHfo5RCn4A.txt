If I could, I give this location 0 stars. I've now been disappointed twice. I gave them a second chance because they were a new location. Same employees working when I came back, same problems. Their Barbacoa looks disgusting and NOTHING like it should and that you've seen at any other location. Lettuce is gross. Always out of chipotle tobasco. Horrible service and attitude from the staff.
