We are on the hunt for Carne Asada, so we decided to go there purely because they had it on their menu. We will never be back. I doubt the original owners cooked the way the family is now. Someone is a huge money pincher and you can tell with the taste of the food. 

First they bring you a TINY bowl of chips and tell you if you want more you have to pay for them. I even overheard one waitress ask if another table needed more chips other than the small bowl. When they said yes she didn't even bother to tell them there was an extra charge. 

Second the chimichanga that costs $7 doesn't even come with sides you have to pay $2.50 extra, and the size of the chimi is not the reason for it's price. It's tiny. Smaller then some TacoBell burritos. Then the meat inside tasted and smelled like canned chicken. It was not fresh at all and it had nothing but chicken in it. 

Third they are not at all kid friendly. Their kid's menu is minimal and doesn't even have the usual things kids want. Also the salsa is too spicy for kids to eat. Last they have no coloring page or any kind of kid entertainment. 

Fourth and the worst thing was the Carne Asada. The price was unreasonable for the product you receive. It was $15 for a fat filled stake with, greasy tortillas, flavorless beans and suspicious rice. 



Fifth is the rice. It was cooked to the right consistency,  but it was disgusting. I tasted like they cooked it in ramen noodle packets. Even the salsa couldn't help it. 

A few other issues were the cleanliness and the greasy filled kids plate. Overall I was disgusted. I would never recommend it to anyone. Someone in that restaurant is cutting corners and nickel and diming the customers.
