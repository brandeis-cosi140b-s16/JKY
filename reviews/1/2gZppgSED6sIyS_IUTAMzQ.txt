If I could give zero stars I would. This place was not good at all. The food was over priced, over cooked, and oily. They claimed to not have chips on the weekend. But they did have them available for Nachos which were bad.  The service was slow despite having a small dining room and 3 servers working. Maybe I should have been drunk or hungover.  Because the folks around us had menudo. In any case their Special was anything but. And $6 for a kids meal with 4 nuggets. Even I wanted the toy. Bottom line is a learned its way better across the street or next door. If you are in the area go anywhere else.
