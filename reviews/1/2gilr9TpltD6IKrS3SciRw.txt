So RUDE! I got there almost 11 p.m. and they close on Sunday at 11 p.m. I pulled up to the window and the lady looked at me and turned away and then just walked away from the window. I understand if you're closed and not surving food anymore but you could be nice enough to tell me and not ignore me...
