I love Chipotle, like seriously love it.  But I came here and the food did not taste good at all.  The chicken was disgusting, it looked like grilled pieces of fat.  Then my girlfriends and I got food poisoning and spent the next 2 days super sick. Definitely won't be going to this Chipotle ever again.
