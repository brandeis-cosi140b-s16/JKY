We came in hoping for good Mexican, we didn't know at first it was in the casino. I ordered the combo: one pork tamale, one cheese enchilada, and carne asada tacos. My spouse had the flaming fajitas. I had a Cadillac margarita, she had a Kahn margarita. The drinks and chips were good. The service and entrees were awful. The steak on the fajitas was dry and chewy, the vegetables didn't get saut√©ed long enough and had little to know flavor. The tamale was soggy. The enchiladas could have been made at home and tasted better and the carne asada taco was one taco and not carne asada. The server didn't ask if we wanted the rest of our food and threw it out. The comp wasn't taken off and the cashier came and waited in front of us til we signed, awkward. We had to have our bill fixed, and then they comped the wrong meal and we waited twenty minutes to have everything fixed, the replacement meal never came. There was no accountability from the server. The manager did try to fix it, but I won't be eating here again.
