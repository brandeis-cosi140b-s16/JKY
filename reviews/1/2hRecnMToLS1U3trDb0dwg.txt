First time I have ever given a 1 star ever as a review. 
It is rather saddening. I go to El Pollo Loco every so often, however, a different location. Came to this location as it is closer to Chinatown area.
The 1 star is due to its El Pollo Loco taste. The chicken has a good seasoning and spice in addition to its charbroiled taste.
The wait was horrible. Do not expect a fast 'fast food' place. If you are ordering their chicken, you should expect at least a 20-30 minutes wait time. While waiting, I even saw my food laid out in the open (box opened) getting cool before they actually called my name. My chicken ended up only warm. 
The saddest part is they ran out of forks. How do you run out of forks?!!? Especially during lunch time. We were eating there at the location and asked for plates and utensils when the worker told us, "Sorry we are out of forks, we only have spoons and knifes." 
It really is a shame that I have to give a one star, other El Pollo Loco locations are more efficient. Just this one tends to be a lot slower. Definitely something to beware of.
