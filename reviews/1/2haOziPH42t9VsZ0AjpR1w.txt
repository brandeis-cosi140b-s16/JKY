I have lived next to Gallo Blanco for over 2 years. I call in pick up orders often.  The only reason I go back is the food is good and it's the closet place I can walk to.  Other than that everything else is poor.  The waiter and bartenders all have poor attitudes.  I won't order drinks at the bar because in the 2 years of coming it seems like all of them have an attitude.  I have witnessed bickering and arguments behind the bar between staff. This past Thursday I order a burro around 945pm.  When I got home it was cold, some of the meat wasn't fully cooked, and you can tell the prepping was rush the way things were cut.  This is the first time I experienced bad food here.  So I called and left a message on the voice mail for management stating my recipient number and issue.  I am yet to get a call back.  I have been in her many times and witnessed other complain about their experience and it doesn't seem like management cares.  This place would have more local traffic but everyone on my building has had a bad experience.  I would love to talk to a Manger again.  I did speak to one months ago about the bad experience but obviously things haven't changed.
