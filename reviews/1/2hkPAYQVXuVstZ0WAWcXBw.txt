Servers should never act as bartenders...yet that is what happens here! All servers are making their own drinks. Okay, so we came on Cinco De Mayo, so we new it would be chaos. Well there was only a 30 minute wait (to our surprise!) then a 30 minute wait to order (after getting up twice to ask for service) and 25 minutes for food (so the time is getting better!) the food, not good. I had a half of chicken and it was so dry! My husband had carne asada and it was dry and tasted like dishwater. The food used to be good, so I'm not sure what happened, but we will not be back. Oh, and back to the servers that should not be bartenders, well I didn't finish that margarita, it tasted like a sweet tart.
