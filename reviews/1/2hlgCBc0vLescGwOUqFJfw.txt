I am constantly on the search for great Mexican in the Madison area and I was needless to say based off my 1 star, a little let down. 
Nothing special that I could put my finger on with this hole in the wall.

I ordered my usual, hoping for a great steak taco topped with some true Mexican cheese, and I was given something nothing close to what I wanted. 
El Pastor, you are claiming to be authentic Mexican right? Why are you not using authentic Mexican cheese and spices? Unacceptable.
Not to mention, the steak sucked. Not flavored at all. Straight up tasted like it had been cooked hours before serving. What are you trying to pull here? There were like 3 other people seated and it was 2pm on a Saturday. Take the time and grill me up some fresh steak. Not cool. 

I don't even know if I should start with the mess of beans and horrible rice thrown on my plate. Seriously, take some time and make it look nice. But I guess if it ends up tasting like it did (horrible), it might as well look the part too.

Overpriced "want to be Mexican food" is what I call this. 

I was told by a work friend that this place was pure Mexican food heaven, and now I have to look this person in the face and say, "Your taste in Mexican food sucks". 
Thanks El Pastor, you have made a soon to be awkward moment for me!
