Manuels was very disappointing.  I ordered taquitos, and it tasted like they were the frozen and just warmed in the oven.  I could bought the same ones at the local grocery store.  Same can be said with the salsa.  It tasted like jar salsa.  It should have been obvious from the lack of cars in the parking lot, on a Friday evening.  The 80's music also did not  fit the atmosphere of a Mexican restaurant.
