I've been to this location multiple times because it is near my house and it's always been okay. Tonight completely left a sour taste in my mouth that wasn't from my mediocre burrito.
When my friend and I (who also works with me) arrived, the staff looked extremely unhappy and exhausted. My friend tried to make small talk with the girl who warms the tortillas and she was so exhausted and mentioned it had been busier than normal when my friend asked which is understandable. the girl who was working the line seemed upset as well. it was then I noticed the cashier, Jalon (whose name was on the receipt, which is really convenient when the employees don't wear name tags) was berating the girl working the line for a mistake she had made and for not being further on the pre closing checklist. my friend said to cut her some slack and I interjected that as a manager in my job, I've never treated my employees with such disrespect. she immediately responded that that was her friend and continued to berate the girl. Jalon rang me up incorrectly and when I corrected the order she yelled at the girl working the line and said loudly to me "and see you were trying to defend her!". it was such an uncomfortable situation and I noticed she continued to be rude and abrasive.

this is pretty unacceptable for a place of business and I will be contacting this store directly to inform them of how their employees are being treated. 

no wonder everyone working looked like they'd rather get hit by a bus than be working the line with such a rude person.
