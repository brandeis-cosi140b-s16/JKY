This place was so disappointing with their food, the service and even their decor. I had eaten here a few times so I was looking forward to eating here again and boy was it a let down. We ordered our drinks, I order a Tempranillo wine. I take a sip of it and it tastes just like vinegar! ugh. The waiter happens to walk by and hears me... He asked "you don't like it?" I replied "No, this tastes like it's been opened for a few days and it tastes like vinegar now." He replies with "Do you know what vinegar tastes like?" I looked and him and said "Yes, just like your wine." Needless to say he brought a new bottle to the table and had me try it before pouring a glass... what a difference! It was yummy!

Now onto the flavorless food! Two of us ordered the tortilla soup. It was cool how they poured the broth into a bowl that had all the ingredients. However maybe this is why it lacked in flavor... it didn't have time to marinade. We added all kinds of items, salt, pepper, salsa to make it taste better! The ceviche was so bland too... no taste of seasonings or marinades not even lemon which is what you mostly marinade the fish/prawns in. The mole con pollo should have been written "Pollo con mole" cus it was all chicken and a small trace of mole. My friend ordered a side of mole and poured it in... added salsa, salt and pepper and then it was ok tasting.  

The service... lets just say our waiter was non existent. We were going to order a round of shots but he never came back to see if everything was ok or if we wanted drink refills. When he finally showed up we just asked for the bill. Never again.
