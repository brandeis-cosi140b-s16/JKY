Terrible service! Ordered the enchiladas combo plate and specifically ordered chicken tonight. When my meal came, the counter person who took my order proceeded to argue with me that I ordered cheese enchiladas. I have never eaten a cheese enchilada in my life. So, I basically did not get to eat dinner tonight because it went in the trash.
