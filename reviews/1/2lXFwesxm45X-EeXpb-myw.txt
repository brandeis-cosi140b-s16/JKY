I don't often write reviews...but the service and food here warrants one.  I was really hoping to like this place, but sadly I was VERY disappointed.  The staff was rude and seemed disinterested.  The food was, in a word, horrible.

I had the cheese enchilada plate, a steak taco, and a chicken taco.  I don't know what they put on the enchilada, but it definitely wasn't enchilada sauce.  The "steak" was just charred pieces of (I guess) beef.  The chicken was bland.

I may give it another shot in the future, but first impression was terrible.  I guess I will give Gordo's a chance tonight...hoping for something better.
