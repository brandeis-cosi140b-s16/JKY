Bleh, I hate chains... and On The Border Ballantyne gave me yet another reason not to venture to the nether regions of Charlotte. Service was incredibly slow, the food was pretty decent, but it took so long to get my bill that any joy felt for my meal was long gone before I left the door. 

The only reason I darkened the door of On The Border was a sorority function, the staff had advanced notice that there would be ~20 people in our party and they seemed ill prepared/short staffed to handle us.
