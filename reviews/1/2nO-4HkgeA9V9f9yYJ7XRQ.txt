One of the workers always charge me for queso and does NOT charge the people in front or behind me for queso when I CLEARLY heard them ask for it in their burrito. He gives me minimal chips (less than a handful) and gives me a look when I order. Seems like he loves working there to satisfy customers. I hope he continues to work there and only charge me extra while everyone else gets free queso.
