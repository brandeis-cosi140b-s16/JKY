it's two years later and tried Rositas again for lunch.  I asked if they still had the "Rosita's Special" and they said yes.  I was brought what looked like a Rositas Special, but it was far from it.  (btw a Rositas Special is a cheese crisp with green chili burro filling and folded over.  tasty).  On one end of the Special was melted Colby cheese (as original) but the other half was nacho cheese...aka Velveeta)...it was aweful.  The cook must have run out of shredded Jack cheese and used the nacho sauce in its place.  I complained, but nobody seemed to care.  To top off the meal, the brought us someone else's ticket...around $30.  Ours was half that.  Still the dive it was two years ago.  Cant understand why there were so many customers there.
