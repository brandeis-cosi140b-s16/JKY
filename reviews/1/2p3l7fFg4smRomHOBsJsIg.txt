HORRID!!! As we were walking into the restaurant, we saw the hostess coming to help open the door. We thought she was doing this to greet us but she was really doing this to scream to her friends coming in after us. She didn't even say hello to us or acknowledge us. Okay fine. Then she's so busy still chatting up her friends that we were standing and waiting for her to ask us how many were in our party. Finally, after almost 15 minutes of waiting for her to finish, she begrudgingly took us to our table. No apologies for waiting or anything. We sit at a table and wait and wait and wait. We are very, very patient. Finally, a server comes to take our drink order and we ask for the menu. Then wait and wait some more. He brings the drinks over but doesn't take our food order. He also has an attitude meaning no pleasantries or even a smile! A new server comes along and takes our food order with no attitude. He checked on us and he was pleasant. But after all the waiting and the bad attitudes, we will never go back again. The food is only mediocre so it's not worth paying to have bitchy employees ruin your evening.
