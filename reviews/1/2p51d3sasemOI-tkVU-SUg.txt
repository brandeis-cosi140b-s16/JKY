This place was horrible.  I wish I could tell u how the food was but after over a 10 minute wait without seeing a waitress we left. It wasn't even half full. Awful service to say the least. There were 3 women standing at the hostess station drinking soda and talking and the only waiter we saw was too busy talking to the table near us the whole time we were there to be bothered. Don't bother with this place and hit up the the pub chip shop across the street. Also the bathrooms were disgusting
