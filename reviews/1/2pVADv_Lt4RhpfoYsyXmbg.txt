I used to be a Q'Doba fan.  But it will probably be a long time before we return, at least to THIS location. 

A visit to the men's room before the meal tipped me off to a decline in the quality of this location. Toilet paper was stuck between the stall door and the stall wall to fill in a "I see you" gap.  The wall board was also buckled.  Finally, the paper towel dispenser produced little paper.

Food wasn't good either. Had the Poblano Pesto Naked Burrito. Mrs. had the Mango Salad.  The chicken in both was hardened and a turn-off. 

Sorry Q, you won't be seeing us for a long time.
