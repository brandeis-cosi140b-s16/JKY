I wish I could give less than one star. Went on UFC fight night and fell for the scam of upstairs fight viewing. They basically want you to stand for 4 to 6 hours fighting to buy food and drinks with a crappy view of the fight. $25 bucks a head! They also want to try to up sell you a $500 or $1000 dollar table or couch. Try to get refund immediately but douche promoter refused. Worst Las Vegas experience ever. :-(
