Not as great as people made it out to be. Maybe I'm a taco elitist, but this place wasn't great. I got the carne asada tacos and supreme nachos. The meat is bland, and wasn't cooked authentically, at least with the way it tasted to me.  Sorry guys, but I'm gonna go to Tacos Mexico, or Tacos El Gordo.
