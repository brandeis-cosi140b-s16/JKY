Service was cool. Beer was icy. Sadly, the food left much to be desired. Ordered a carne asada burrito. The meat was horrible and chewy. I returned it and simply asked for one beef and one chicken taco. Beef taco was "ok". The chicken tasted like it was boiled, shredded and thrown i.  Zero flavor.   Service was good though. I gave up on the food, had one more cold beer and left.
