I just bought a brand new home in Queen Creek, right down the street from this dive..... I must have driven by it 20-25 times over the last few months while watching my house be built. Big bright signage on the front windows, nice area, I kept telling myself I needed to try it. BIG MISTAKE!!!  I should have turned around and walked out at the same time I walked in. The 2 mexican ladies that work there were sitting at one of the booths texting. The floor was dirty. They should have been mopping, not texting. The tables are dingy and one of the had been painted over graffiti. No lights in the hallway to the restrooms. Which were stinky and dirty. When I asked the kid behind the counter what kind of fish they used in their fish tacos and he says "I think it's cod", that was clue number two to turn & go. But it was 2 pm and I hadn't had lunch yet. So I ordered the 2 fish taco combo...... The fish in the tacos was breaded and about the diameter of a lead pencil, over fried and tasted terrible. This is one mexican place I'll never walk into again! I can't understand why they have been open since 2009.
