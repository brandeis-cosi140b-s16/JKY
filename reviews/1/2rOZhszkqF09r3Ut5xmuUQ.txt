Absolutely terrible. The staff was unfriendly, the whole experience was awkward and the food WAS TERRIBLE. Both mine and my friend's....There was one girl there at lunch time.All the food was cold and was NOT FRESH at all. Plus it was WAY too expensive for what you got. Can't say terrible enough! I feel nausea coming on just thinking about it. Sorry Pachuca...I know business is tough and bad reviews suck but you need to step it up big time. The place is pretty inside and COULD be awesome.
