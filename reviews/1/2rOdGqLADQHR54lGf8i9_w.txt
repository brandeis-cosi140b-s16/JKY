Let me start by saying we have ordered from here many times prior to tonight and never had any issues.  Until tonight.  I always order the Burrito De Fajitas with chicken.   This time, it had 4 pieces of chicken and was filled.....I mean filled with onion.  Not even fresh onion.  It tasted like it sat out for two days before it was cooked.  I couldnt eat past the first couple of bites.  This is ridiculous!  I will not be returning after this experience.   You've lost two customers due to this.  

I have pictures to add if yelp let's me...
