Gross!  Was so excited to try the Mexican hot dog and it was extremely disappointing.  I thought the bacon would add a lot of delicious flavor to the hot dog but it didn't.  The dog was tasteless as was the bacon.  Not sure how that happened.  the sweet bread bun was also very odd tasting with the hot dog.  Ive never had a mexican dog before so Im not sure if thats normal for the bun to be sweet but it really didn't work for me.  The whole thing left a horrible, awful taste in my mouth.
