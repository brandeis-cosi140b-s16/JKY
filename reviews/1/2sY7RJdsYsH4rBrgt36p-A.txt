I did not feel welcomed here at all.  Our server seemed impatient and annoyed with us.  He asked us immediately after sitting down what we wanted to order.  I had no idea and asked him to come back after we had time to look over the menu.  He looked horrified but went away anyway.  He came back a couple of seconds later and asked what we wanted.  I felt rushed so I ordered something I have ordered in the past.  I really wanted to try something different and read the menu  But they don't give you time for that.  

The food came out in a matter of seconds.  I thought that was a mistake so I told the person balancing the plates that was not our order.  He went and got someone who could speak English to to tell us that they were what we ordered and placed them in front of us.  I had burritos deluxe and my friend had a steak salad,  The salad came without dressing so she asked the serve for some dressing.  While not pleased he did go get her some dressing.  My burritos were boring and tasteless.

They moved their business into a doomed location.  Nothing seems to stay there for long.  This is one place that really needs to go away!  It was awful!!
