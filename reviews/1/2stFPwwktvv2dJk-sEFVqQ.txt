Wife and I decided to stop by and check it out.  Nice decor and cool ambiance with a nice outdoor patio.  But that was about it, really.  Service was slow and they were confused on who's table we were (from a server standpoint).  Once we got a server (she was nice), drinks took a while to get (water and a soda).  We ordered tacos.  She got the steak and I the chicken.  Food was dry and very bland.  I didn't get it.  If you want to be a hip and cool Mexican fusion joint, then get your tacos straight, seriously.  I do them better at home!  Couldn't wait to get out of there.  Avoid.
