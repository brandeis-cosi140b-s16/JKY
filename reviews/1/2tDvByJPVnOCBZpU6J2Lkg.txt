Came here for the first time because of the radio.first time was great chicken  was made really good and moisty.and the steak was amazing between med to well.
I came today again to eat here and toke my friend with me-total disaster!!!!
Chicken was dry like hell I had to spit it out of my mouth 2 times for each taco(I order 3 of them) .the steak was very chewy !! 
That's all I done with this place !
