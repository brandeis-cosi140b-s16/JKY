Let me preface this review with the fact that I have never written a restaurant review in my life and I am not a picky eater....     Last night we were staying at a hotel and were just too tired to go out for dinner.  So we ordered from Ocho Locos last night through Eat24hours.com (a food delivery service).  First of all, there were no forks, knives, or napkins included with the delivery.  Second, there was no honey included with the sopapillas and the sopapillas were overcooked to the point that I had to remove the bottom before eating them.  The refried beans were so spicy that the bean burrito and extra side of beans never got eaten.  And finally the pieces of cake (which were $5.95 for a small/regular size piece of cake...much too expensive) were sloppy soggy messes by the time we got it.  The cake never got eaten either.  Only one thing was better than a 1 star... the taquitos, which I would give 3 stars.  Side note: everything was cold when it arrived; but I don't know if that's the restaurant's fault or the delivery service's fault..so that was not factored into the rating.  I spent $65.00 on 2 small taquitos, 1 burrito, 1 cheese crisp, 2 pieces of cake, 1 order of sopapillas, and a small side order of refried beans.  If the food had been good, I would have thought, okay, a little expensive, but at lease it was good.  But it wasn't even close to good.  (FYI, only about $6.00 of the $65.00 was attributed to the delivery service fee).
