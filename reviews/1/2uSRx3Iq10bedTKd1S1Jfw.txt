Decided to try this place out after a friend recommended it. Out of four of us, none of us were impressed. The waitress was the only positive experience. The tacos were mediocre. The cheese enchiladas were tiny. The Chile relleno was extremely spicy when they are typically mild. They use cheddar mix blend of cheese rather than authentic Mexican cheese. Overall was just not impressed.
