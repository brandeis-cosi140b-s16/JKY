Went here with my husband expecting a delicious meal based on past reviews. First problem was the service. The wait staff was very slow to greet/seat us and just plain rude. Drink glasses were filthy and one was leaking with a crack. We got a visible eye roll when we politely asked for a new glass. The food was decent but Pulgaracito just a few blocks down has WAY better food and staff. Sorry Morazan- we won't ever be back!
