I don't understand how this place got the reviews it did, maybe friends and family. It's just another below average mexican restaurant. Same old beans covered with jack cheese, converted rice cooked with tomato paste and canned salsa. The tamales had little filling and the masa wasn't cooked. Look I'm not gonna criticize everything. If your idea of mexican food is cheap canned product covered with cheese and "red or green" sauce this is the ideal place.
