Terrible.  States it closes at 2300.  Went through drive thru at 2147 and they were out of chicken.  Seriously?!!!!!   It's called pollo loco!!!  Read other reviews and same thing has happened before.   Management should read these reviews and do something.  Never has McDonald's or Burger King tell me they didn't have burgers!!!!   Figure it out or close the damn restaurant
