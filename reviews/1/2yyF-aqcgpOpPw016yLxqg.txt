I waited over a year to re-try this place. The theory was: If they stayed in business this long maybe they've fixed things. The menu is better with more selections. Service is slow which doesn't mix well with airport crowds. There are too many tables per sq foot and people consistently walk into table. 

Good place to go if the world runs out of restaurants.

Food was 2 star
Service 1 star
Ambiance 1 star, (because zero isn't permitted)
