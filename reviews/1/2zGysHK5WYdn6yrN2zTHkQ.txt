Gross!  Although the food was decent, the service was average, but the manager and the server obviously needed a little help on health codes.  They have an open kitchen and the manager was standing in the window getting food ready to go out to customers.  It was rather slow as it was mid-afternoon, but he filled his free time by enjoying some fries sitting on a sandwich plate in the window.  He alternated between garnishing customers plates and eating fries.  He finally took the sandwich and went and sat down at the bar to eat, but of course more food came into the window and he decided to go back to the window to handle more 
customers food... WITHOUT washing his hands.  

When I spoke to the manager about the fact that I don't really appreciate the "little extra" grease he was adding to my tacos with his paws all he could say was "You're right." Just that.  Nothing else. 

The server so graciously cleared our plates when we had finished and as the plates were still in his one hand he picked up and delivered another customer's food.  Nothing like getting your fresh beautiful plate of food while he's holding a plate full of sauces, left over pico and some dirty napkins.
