I was really disappointed by my experience here. We made a reservation at 5:45 pm on a Saturday night, thinking we probably wouldn't even need one.  When we arrived, we were told that there were no available tables inside---no apologies on behalf of the staff. We were asked to sit outside until one became available. When our waitress came by, she let us know that several of the items of the menu were no longer available. Then she said there wouldn't be enough time to order actual meals if we wanted to be out by 7:00 pm (we were catching a show at 7:30 pm). SO, we left without ever having a chance to try the food. While the waitress was apologetic, nobody offered us anything that would push us to give Revival a second chance. They clearly just don't have their act together yet.
