This place was awful! We have been to the one in Phoenix and that experience was great. On our way back home to California we saw this one and wanted to have a lil treat before we left, plus we had friends with us who have never eating here and wanted them to enjoy it like we did from the one Phoenix. They seated us quickly that was a plus. But it was the food and the service that was really bad. Our food was not tasty at all. The tortillas for the burritos were cold. We were asked if everything was okay but as she asked she kept walking and didn't notice we needed drinks. Our waitress would stand in the corner and twirl her hair. A big no-no in my book. It left a bad first impression on our friends they will never come back and now I am questioning wether we'll be coming back again.
