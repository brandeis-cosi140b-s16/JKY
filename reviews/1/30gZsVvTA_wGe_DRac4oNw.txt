While my mouth said this wasn't bad my stomach greatly disagreed. I tried this on a whim from a coworker that I do lunch with every Saturday and it came highly recommended. Considering we had done the same place for about 6 weeks straight for our weekly Saturday lunch I caved and gave it a try... BIG MISTAKE!

As mentioned above the taste of the food was good, however, there was something off with it as I have had digestive distress(nice way of saying what it's really doing to me) since 11am yesterday and have to question either the conditions of the kitchen or whether the food was handled or stored in a sanitary manner. Either way, this'll be the first and last time I eat here.
