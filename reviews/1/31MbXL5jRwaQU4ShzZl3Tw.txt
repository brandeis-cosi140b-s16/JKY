My husband and I were really excited to check this place and unfortunately, it was a big disappointment. My order came out wrong and the server never even stopped by to apologize or even acknowledge it. He let the food runner apologize. I ordered a club soda and had to ask the hostess to get it bc our server never came to the table so I couldn't even remind him he forgot. My husband would have ordered more drinks but yet again...no server around to ask. The food was nothing special either. Pretty disappointing experience. I think we would give it another shot of the service hadn't been so bad...but I think we'll try somewhere new next time.
