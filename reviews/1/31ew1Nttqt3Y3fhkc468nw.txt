I went to this Roberto's today very disappointed I started ordering one of the things I wanted to get for a family of four after I said the first thing the guy told me okay I got your order pull up I wasn't even done after finishing my order I went up to the window and I paid with my credit card and it took him a while to even give it back he just took it and close the window after a while waiting we got the food but no receipt!...I had to ask him to give me my receipt!  it should be automatic that they give you a receipt not that you have to ask for one ridiculous if you want better service go somewhere else! never going here again!!
