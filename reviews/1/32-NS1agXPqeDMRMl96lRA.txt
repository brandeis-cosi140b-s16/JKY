This had to have been the worst portion serving of chicken I have ever seen at a #chipotle.  It was consistently poor with other people they were serving too.  I estimate at about half the normal serving I usually get.  I just happened to go to this chipotle today since I had an appt in the area.  I'm never coming back to this one for lunch again.  I suggest going to one of the other many chipotles to get a better serving.
