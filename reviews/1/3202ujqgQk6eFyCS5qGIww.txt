I had the worse service at this Filbertos.  When I pulled up to the drive thru,  I was asked what I would like to eat, I said: give me a minute please .  The drive thru person must have got upset because she refused to take my order.  I called after leaving upset to ask for a manager and they said they didn't have time to listen to my issues and hung up the phone on me!
