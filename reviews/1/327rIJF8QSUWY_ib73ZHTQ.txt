The food was good not outstanding for the price.  What got us was the service and the check.  5 of us came in for dinner splitting the check 2 on one and 3 on the other.  We were moved after being seated because they forgot they had another party coming in.  Ok honest mistake pick up all your things ant move to the very back.  Then we had to flag down someone to take our drink order and she was irritated and had to "deal" with us.  

Finally got our appetizers and drink refills and soon after the food came out.  There were several people walking around but NO ONE would come over and check when we needed refills on drinks, chips or salsa.  By the end of the meal I was ready to just go home and flagged down someone to bring us the bill.  The 2 bills come and they already have a 20% gratuity on them.  What? It was 5 people I have NEVER seen that for a party of 5.  I guess they figured that is the ONLY way they will get a tip since their service is horrendous.  

I will not go back which is sad being a family business and locally owned is what drives us here and yet anther one we will avoid.  I think what is even worse is the owners don't even acknowledge the issues when you bring them up. 

Good Luck to anyone else brave enough to wait!
