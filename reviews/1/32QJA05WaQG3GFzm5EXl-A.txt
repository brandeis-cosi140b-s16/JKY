My father is dying of cancer.  I've brought him through the the drive-thru before without a problem.  Unfortunately my father is bed ridden with pancreatic cancer. 

I told the fellow taking my order that I needed a senior discount.  Jonathon took it upon himself to DENY the senior discount because My Dad want in the car.  Then he had the audacity to say that he remembered me, but still denied the discount.

Guess what, I'm a repeat customer with obvious needs.  (Crying) I've never been treated this way before and cannot empathize the hatred that was felt when pulling into the window.

I cannot succumb to the level that Jonathon has brought me to.  To deny a Vietnam war veteran a food discount.   That's right, my father what was in Vietnam and is dying of cancer was DENIED a senior discount from this establishment.  Enough said.

How dare you treat a repeat customer this way.  Shame on you Jonathon for not adhering to the policies that are I place.  

Words cannot explain how upset I am.  May god have mercy on your soul.
