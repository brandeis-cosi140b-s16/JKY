This place was not our first choice, but we could not find the other Mexican spot. We found the food bland, the salsa was probably canned, the beans appeared to be also. My husband found the tiny, flimsy plastic forks hard to use. The horchata was too sweet for my taste. Seemed pricey for the setting, the plastic. Can not recommend.
