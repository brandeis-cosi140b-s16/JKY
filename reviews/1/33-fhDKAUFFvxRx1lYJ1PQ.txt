Ordered the taco plate with rice and beans. The rice and beans were old and the rice was undercooked and crunchy and also cold. No limes were provided with the tacos. The red and green salsa is bland and lacking flavor. I also ordered queso fundido with chips the queso was cold and the chips were so stale. I love trying new Taco shops and I'm disappointed that there is no effort put into this establishment.  How do you screw up a street taco? This place has only been open for a week and it's already burned out. Go to el supreme down the street way better Mexican food.  $26 down the toilet for street tacos.
