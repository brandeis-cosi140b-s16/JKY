Del Taco messed with the wrong pregnant lady tonight. Never in my life have I been so upset with an order I received in the drive thru that I actually got in my car to go back after sitting down to eat, until tonight. I just wanted chicken soft tacos, but instead I got tortillas stuffed full of lettuce and cheese with 3-4 little bits of chicken with an average size of my pinkie nail, the largest no bigger than my thumb nail. Soft tacos aren't that big, I can't believe it was too much to expect that I could at least get a little chicken with every bite.
