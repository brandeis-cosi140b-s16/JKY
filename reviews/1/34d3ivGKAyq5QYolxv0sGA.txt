Visit A:

Lid in the salsa at the salsa bar, waited close to 10mins for them to bring out new salsa, and when kid was just about to pour the salsa in:

Customer: "You're not going to pour that in there are you?"
Kid: "Why not?"
Customer: "Bc there's a lid in there, it contaminated now"
Kid: "OMG, really?"

Dear Kid,

I think your Food Handler card needs to be renewed!

Visit B: 

Order was wrong, three times. They told us that they'd bring out whatever they hadn't given us and by the end of our visit, we never rec'd the last bit of our food. 

The management and staff at this place has NO CLUE as to what they're doing. Either they're too young or need add'l training. Staff speaks to customers without 'Thank You's", "You're Welcome's", or a damn smile, it's really not that hard to smile!

The food is good but the service and staff are keeping us from coming back here. I think I'm ok to drive all the way to rainbow to avoid the headache of dealing with the craziness here. 

Thanks.
