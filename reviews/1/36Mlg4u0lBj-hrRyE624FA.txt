Went in because we had some time to kill - happy hour service in the bar was pretty slow - also ordered the "queso" which was basically melted cheese with spinach in it - absolutely terrible - there were only 2 of us and we each took one small bite. The waitress never asked if we liked it or why we didn't touch it ... Pretty poor service to not even acknowledge that. Probably won't return. Salsa was decent.
