Why the fuck do you ask me if I want everything and when I tell you no salsa roja so why the fuck u still give me my tacos with salsa roja order 3 ckn 3 asada n 1 carnitas taco.. you supposedly fix my oder but now I got 3 ckn 2 asada n 1 carnitas tacos. We're the fuck is my other taco. You make me wait so you can fix mi order just to fuck it up again. I'm surprised they didn't forget my Chiles toreados like they always do.. They use to be a good place to eat but they just fucking up now
