Was here during a hot summer day and the place had a great view at the outside bar and seemed to be very vibrant. Once we walked in to the restaurant it was a different story. I soon found out why. I ordered the charcoal tacos. I think that was the name. Then again, who cares! It was disgusting. My GF had the sopes and man they were bad. The thing was as hard as a rock. Back to my tacos. If you can't even properly warm up a tortilla you shouldn't even bother working at a restaurant. The worst place I ever dined out was a place here in Chicago that I really thought was unbeatable. Until I met Cabo Wabo. Food is just brutal. I was waiting on Gordon Ramsey to walk out the kitchen. Doesn't even deserve any compliments of any kind with that kind of food.
