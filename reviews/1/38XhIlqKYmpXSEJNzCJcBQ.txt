The one star is based on how the manager on duty tried to BS me into believing the dish I was served was the dish in the menu. I know what a stuffed chili is - that isn't what I was served. To the Manager's credit, after he determined that I was not buying his BS, he immediately asked what I wanted instead, and comp'd my portion of the bill. Overall I agree with others - the food was bland, boring, and not worth the time. I'll never go back.
