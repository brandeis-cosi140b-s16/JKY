I don't know if you have to be a complete douchbag/douche-dudette  to work here but, THE SERVICE SUCKS!!!!!

I wanted chicken wings and I had heard they have pretty good wings. Called to make a take-out order and girl sounded chipper when I called but, once I asked for take-out, her mood changed quick and she said, "ohh, what do you want?"

Ordered my wings and asked if it came with carrots/celery sticks; and she said, "I guess.." 
Really? I guess...if you work in a restaurant, you should know the food you have. And if you don't, you ask someone that does! Simple.

When I went to pick up my order 20 minutes later, they said my order wasn't even placed. I had to wait ANOTHER 15 minutes!

Needless to say, I lost my appetite. For the food. And especially the service.
