So I love burritos and will try one at just about any Mexican fast food place. I know what to expect when I eat at those places and know what to expect from Filibertos but this Filibertos should be closed down.It was horrible and nearly inedible. I really love food and usually can deal with some bad stuff but this was just disgusting. The tortilla was overcooked as well as everything else inside. The meat was horrible and very low quality. Be sure to avoid this location at all costs. Could not finish my food and it gave me a sour stomach throughout the night into the morning.
