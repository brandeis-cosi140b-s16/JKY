I don't understand the hype behind Fausto's. 

I've tried the Chicken Quesadilla, the Steak Burrito and I've had the chips and salsa and nothing has been particularly impressive to me.

I know the place is just quick and greasy, but I don't even find it as enjoyable as Roberto's, Don Tortaco or Tacos Mexico...which are questionable themselves.
