As a family we have been coming here for years. I can see the quality of service and food have drastically changed. I will never go back. We went for lunch today.... The chips were stale, my tostada shell was stale, I opened my napkin to find my fork was dirty, the salsa was very bland. We were there at noon and it was dead!
