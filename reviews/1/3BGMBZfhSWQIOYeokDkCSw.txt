Absolutely horrible customer service.  I placed an order for 2 dozen tamales on 12/12 to be picked up on 12/19 at 12 pm.  I then called back on 12/17 to add another 4 dozen tamales and move the pickup time to 2 pm on 12/19.  When I arrived at 2 pm, the woman at the counter told me that they sold my tamales at 12:30 pm because I didn't arrive by 12 pm.  When I gave her the name of the individual I spoke with on 12/17, who confirmed that my order pick up time had changed to 2 pm and that I added 4 dozen tamales to my order, she only provided me with my original order of 2 dozen tamales.  When I asked for the additional 4 dozen tamales, a guy behind the counter told me they were all sold out and weren't accepting any additional orders. I will never order tamales from here again.
