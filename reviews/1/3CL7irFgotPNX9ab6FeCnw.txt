Some of the best places I have eaten have needed some major makeovers, so the look of the restaurant didn't bother me. The food however was really dry, and not at all authentic. I am still surprised to find  ground beef inside the burritos and tacos, the meat was overcooked and dry. I have traveled most of Mexico and the West coast. I have never had anything like this, and there have been bad ones. Maybe it's an east coast thing. We were referred by many people claiming this place was great. I'm convinced those people have no taste buds, and have never had authentic Mexican food. Very disappointed!!! Our search will continue, I have hope that somewhere in Charlotte I will find good Mexican food.
