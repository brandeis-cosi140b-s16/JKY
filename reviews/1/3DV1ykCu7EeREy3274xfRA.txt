As a Mexican myself this food was not good what so ever it was very disappointing I love guacamole and the guacamole was disgusting I've been here twice and both times I was very disappointed the only thing that wasn't good was our margaritas and that was it I don't recommend this place AT ALL unless they've improved on it in the last 4 months and for a Mexican to say IT IS NOT GOOD that says a lot! !
