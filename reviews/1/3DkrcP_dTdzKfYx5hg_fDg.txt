Our first time will definitely be our last, my girlfriend and I went in there and there was nobody there.  Monday I get it, but the employee with greenish hair gave my girlfriend the dirtiest look ever, and rushed us through the process.  My girlfriend didn't hear her because she was mumbling, and then she literally yelled back "do you want veggies or queso". I think she could tell that we noticed her obvious annoyance that we were there and started calling us sir and mam. She even apologized for the "long" wait, when there wasn't any one else there, and if she would've been a better employee, it would've been a better experience. We will never spend another dime in this establishment.  I manage a very busy and popular restaurant in tempe, and am always about supporting fellow restaurants, but won't feel uncomfortable getting my dinner.
