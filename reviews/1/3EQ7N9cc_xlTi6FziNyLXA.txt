Update: So it's noon, and we order breakfast burritos, only to be told they no longer sell breakfast past 10 am. Let me be clear, this is not transitioning from French toast and pancakes to burgers and pasta, where I can understand not serving breakfast all day. This is Mexican food. And for a place that is called "New Mexican Grill" they should know that breakfast from "breakfast burrito" is a relative term and they are served ALL day in New Mexico (we're from there - we would know). People eat burritos for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  They just lost a large client base. We've been going there for years and we won't be back. It's just a bad way to do business, and as a result I assume he will sacrifice a large client base.
