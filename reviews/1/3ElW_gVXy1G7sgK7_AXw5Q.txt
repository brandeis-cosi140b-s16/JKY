This place was extremely disappointing! 

After having some amazing fish tacos in SD, I wanted to find something here that would hold me over until my next trip. 
After reading the reviews for this place, I was sure this was going to be my spot. Oh how wrong I was! 

I got the shark and mahi mahi taco special with horchata. My friends got the white fish taco plate with that nasty ass red drink. 

Everything tasted so awful. I didn't even finish one of my tacos because I was so disgusted by it. My friends finished theirs but that's just because they were hungry. Afterwards, we all got sick from the food. 

Yuck, even thinking about it makes me want to vomit.
