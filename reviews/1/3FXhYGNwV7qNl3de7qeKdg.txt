So totally over this place, seriously. I NEVER know how much I'm going to pay for my meal (which is the EXACT same meal I order every time). But tonight was the last straw when the cashier (short, thin Hispanic lady) totally copped an attitude with me about my vegetarian nacho order. She was like "you only get beans or rice, not both". Where in the world did that one come from considering the fact that beans and rice in lieu of a protein is listed as an option on the GINORMOUS MENU PLACCARD POSTED ON THE WALL?!? When I mentioned to her that she was incorrect because I always order the same thing, she totally copped an attitude with me which I thought was completely uncalled for and inappropriate. I hope corporate can take notice and rectify this situation soon because I really enjoyed their food. Until then, won't be coming back.
