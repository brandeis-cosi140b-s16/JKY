We went in based on great yelp reviews. We tried two chicken tacos and the California Burrito with steak. Chicken was cold and dry. Way too much DRY not fresh cilantro was put on the tacos. The burrito was bland and had little flavor. 
We were overcharged for the burrito also. 
Coffee was instant coffee with granules on the bottom of the cup.
