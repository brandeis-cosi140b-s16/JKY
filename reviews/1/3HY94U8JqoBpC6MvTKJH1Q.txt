Gross Gross Gross

This is probably the worst Mexican food I have ever eaten.  My fiancee and I ordered the nachos and they were a greasy mess with hardly any cheese on them.  It looked like there was zero effort when it came to making these.

I ordered the chicken chimichanga dinner and it was GROSS.  The chicken tasted like it was a week old.  I spit it out.  The chimichanga was drenched in grease as well.  I understand it is a fried item but your plate should not be swimming in oil.  BARF.  I would never eat here or recommend this place to anyone.
