I have only been here once and it was during phoenix restaurant week. I figured since they looked to have a decent menu and were new I would give them a try. Big mistake. My husband and I had the worst meal ever.  Not a single dish we tried was good. Also their margaritas were horrible. I ordered the house margarita and upgraded the tequila.
