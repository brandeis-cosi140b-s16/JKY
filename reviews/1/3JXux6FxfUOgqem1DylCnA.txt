Went here today and got the charbroiled chicken burrito. On the menu it says there is pico and avocado/guacamole. All that was in there was chicken and that's it. Vey bland. I make better burritos than this!

It was busy as it was lunch time, but the girl behind the counter had a "I have no idea what you're talking about" look on her face when I placed my order. I don't know if it was too loud or if she just wasn't listening. 

3 hours later my stomach starts to hurt...you do the math. 

I'm not going back there. Not worth it.
