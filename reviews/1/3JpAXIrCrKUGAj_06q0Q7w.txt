This restaurant is horrid.  We went when they were within the first couple of weeks of opening.  They had lunch specials that included a drink, and there were flyers all over advertising it, but when I ordered it they said the drink was no longer included.  What?  The chips are the cheapo corn chips you get for $1 a bag at the grocery store.  The only thing that was good was the salsa bar; otherwise they are not worth going to.  The people behind the counter have no idea what is going on.
