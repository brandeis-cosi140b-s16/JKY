Mexican Food?,Yea mmmkay! Family sharing style?,yeah friggin right!

Took the lovely wife for dinner. The place is EXTREMELY LOUD!, We get seated, bus boy shows up with water, pours the water into my wife's glass and the idiot keeps on pouring, spilling water on my wife, The SOB doesn't even apologize, not a friggin word from him, I wave our waiter down and asked if the bus boy spoke English, the waiter assured me he did, but I wasnt convinced. 

Anyhow we order some drinks browse the menu and decide to have the mixto ceviche, the waiter asked us if we were sure thats all we wanted, the lovely wife and I agreed thats all we wanted, So he asked one more time and we were like WTF is up, he says "I know our concept is sharing style" but the portions are only 7 ounces so I recommend you add something else to your order" we were like are you effing serious how the eff do you share 7 ounces? (If you ever had a ceviche tostada you folks know that its more than 7 ounces and you know you are not about to share that tastey ceviche tostada) so we add the camaron ceviche and the espada tacos, the waiter was still sure it wasnt gonna be enough food for the lovely wife and I, we adviced him we would be okay with our order.

The food arrives, the tacos were cold, the ceviche was lacking acid and proper salt and heat. the chef should be ashamed of himslef for callig this garbage "ceviche". if you cant get a ceviche right chances are everything else on that menu will be total disappoinments.
