Worst Chipotle ever!  Manager is mean and rude.  Catering set up for 50 people for graduation party and when I went to pick it up and it wasn't ready.  Then their machine swiping mechanism would not work and they have a policy to not enter the credit card information.  Made me go to a bank (which I had to go to two banks due to $400 limit).  Returned to cold food for 50 people and a manager who said it was my fault. This manager is the worst ever!  If their customer service is this bad imagine the food.  I'm glad I left empty-handed.  Don't cater from this store and it will save you from having to have a back-up plan.
