I love Del Taco, just not this one!!! Once I went to this one and it was BLAZING hot inside probably 86 degrees. I asked them multiple times to turn on the AC and nothing. Finally I told what I think was the owner or manager and he said he would do it. I guess they think the 3rd time is a charm. Another time I went there and had a coupon on my phone. They would not accept it unless it was printed out. Get with the times, everyone has a phone. I then left angrily! They have no play place either. Big draw back. I end up making the drive to one of the ones on Val Vista.
