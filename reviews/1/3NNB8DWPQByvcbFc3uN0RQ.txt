My cheese enchiladas had non-melted cheese in them. That's a basic prerequisite for enchiladas - melted cheese. Not impressed at all. This place is sophomoric at best. There are far more tastier places in the valley to spend your money on. If I could leave a half star I would. I will never eat here again.
