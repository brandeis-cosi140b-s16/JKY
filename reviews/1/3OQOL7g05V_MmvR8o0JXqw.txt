So sad...such great food and this location is a mess. Took 20 minutes to order and get my food with ONE person in front of me. Lady working was unhappy to say the least, and I stood at the counter after my food was done for 3 minutes before somebody else came over to ring me up (she was busy talking to friend that came to see her). She short charged me...didn't ring up enchilada style nor the queso dip. Normally I would correct her but I wasn't about to waste my energy helping such a pathetic group of employees. There were TWO guys eating and the place was trashed. Dirty tables, napkins strewn all over the floor...

I will never go back to this location. Stephanie St. location is 100x better in every way possible. 

But hey, thanks for the free queso!
