I've been here more than a few times and it has been great. Hot, fresh and fast Mexican food. 

However, because of tonight's service I will not be back. When order my chips with cheese and guacamole (on the side which I expressed twice while ordering) I was upset to find only guacamole on the side. 

When I asked about it, the server shook his head and said no cheese on the side. I informed him I had ordered the same item more than fifteen times before with no issue. He just continued to shake his head and stated I never informed him to put the cheese on the side. When I stated I did twice while ordering he shook his head repeatedly and said "No. No ". With this service I'll take my money elsewhere where people do not call me a liar.
