Avoid this Taco Bell at all cost. Do NOT give this place any business whatsoever. They have some of the worst customer service I've ever dealt with. There is one worker in particular his name is Sean. He is rude and doesn't care about making the customer happy. Very unprofessional! I was going to spend a decent amount of money there by buying all my co workers food mind you I have 15 co workers. And thanks to Mr. Sean I didn't spend one penny nor do I plan to ever again. I've been going to Taco Bell for many years now and I never have I got treated the way I did at this one. I guess home is where the heart is because at my local Taco Bell on 30th St and Thomas I always get the best service. It's a shame that the employees at this Bell location have no idea what they are doing. Even as I spoke to the manager he wasn't of any help. He didn't care to take care of the situation and ignored me. Its okay though I rather go give my business to Filibertos who serve actual Mexican food!
