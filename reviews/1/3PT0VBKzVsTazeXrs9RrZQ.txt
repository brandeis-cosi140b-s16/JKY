I was going on a first date, and my date told me to meet her at Boca park for some drinks. I wanted to go to Kona but she said she wanted to try this New Mexican place. It's about as tacky as a Spencer's gift shop, the food was highly over priced Taco Bell (I actually think Taco Bell is better, and I hate Taco Bell), the Drinks were a joke. I paid 10 bucks a margarita for what was pretty much ice and lime juice. The staff seemed like they wanted to jump off a building. But I guess if I worked at a worse chipotle I would too.
