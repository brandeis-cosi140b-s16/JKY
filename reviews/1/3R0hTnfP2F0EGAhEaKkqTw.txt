Got salt? If you do please bring some to Juan, he is out. 
I've been there once before and the food was good,  enough for me to go back.  But tonight was a different story. The staff was horrendously unattentive. We just about finished our chips and salsa before we were able to flag down our server and tell him we were ready to order.  I could understand if the place was packed and everyone was running around but it wasn't. In fact I saw our server sit down for a few seconds before he jumped up to serve the table by us. The rest of the night unfortunately didn't speed up.  We had to ask for the check after we were obviously done.  
The food lacked any flavor.  We had the fajitas. Wow, the worst fajitas I've ever had.  I can make amazing fajitas at home - salt, pepper, a little cumin and spice. Apparently the chef has never heard of spices because he sure did not use any.  

Just an overall disappointing experience. I don't go out to eat too often and when I do I expect it to be on par or even better than what I can cook at home.  I doubt I will ever be back.
