like the "bro" scene? you'll love it here. i was hoping for more than the typical scottsdale meat market, but was sorely disappointed. drink service was slow, bartender poured weak cocktails, and the whole experience was below average. to top it off, it seemed as though every man in the place considered a woman's presence there a free pass to to touch her back, hip or butt as they walked past. if i don't know you, please don't touch me. the bathroom was ridiculously small and dirty. overall the sandbar was disgusting, overrated and so far, the worst meat market of them all.
