Worst Mexican food ever.  It started with the salsa.  I thought it had a strange flavor, but didn't want to say anything, thinking I needed to give the place a chance.  Then it went downhill.  The chicken in my enchilada tasted like it came from a can.  The cheese tasted like imitation.  The chili relleno coating was just plain weird, like doughy or something.  I was shocked.  Too bad, such a beautiful location, I was so disappointed.  We asked for sour cream and didn't realize we had asked a busboy.  All he had to do was go tell our waiter that we wanted something, but instead he ignored us, since he didn't understand English.  
The entrance was hard to find.  There was a sign that said to use the front entrance.  When we couldn't find it, we went in the way that seemed logical and we were ignored.  
I honestly can't believe some of the reviewers are saying the food was good.  This is the only reason I signed on to write this review.  This place seriously does not know Mexican food.
