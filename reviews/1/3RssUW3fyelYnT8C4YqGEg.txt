We have driven by the place on many occasions and decided to try it with a Groupon special.   I can't remember the last time I've had a really bad meal..but this is it.  It's pretty hard to screw up street tacos, but they somehow did, the meat was tasteless and cold.  I had the Carne Adovada which sounded pretty good...It was very spicy and very dry.  There might be other things on the menu that are good, but the two things we ordered came recommended by the waiter.  On a positive note, I had the house margarita that was extremely strong and large for only $4.  But, we didn't go for drinks we went for food....
