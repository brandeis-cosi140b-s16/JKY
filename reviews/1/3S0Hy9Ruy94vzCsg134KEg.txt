Worst service I've had at a chipotle. They are slow and stand around confused and dazed. The cashiers are always rude and have no personality. My last visit the line wasn't moving and instead of helping the manager thought it was appropriate to start wiping down tables that were already clean and unoccupied because everyone was still in line. I've lived in surprise for 4 years and they still haven't got it down
