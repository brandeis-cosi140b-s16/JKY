The waitress was either high or asleep, brought our food but all wrong. Not attentive whats so ever, food was bland. I would not even waste my time coming here, they dont even acknowledge their customers. When we arrive we were standing around until we saw an actual employee to help us. This place needs some management , nothing special about this place. Why is this place still open?
