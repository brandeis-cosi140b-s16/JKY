Chipotle is definitely one of my favorite places to eat. It is usually fast, filling, and all made by friendly employees. Usually. My experience here however, was different and kind of mirrors other reviews. It started with a very impersonal Hispanic lady just repeating what I had said. And if she didn't hear me, repeated the question louder. On down the line I got a sort of friendly Caucasian lady that sort of redeemed the first one. THEN we got to the end. Holy crap. It felt like I was rushed through the entire thing. I turned around to answer a friendly old lady to my left who had a question, then turned around to see two employees with disgusted hurry up fool faces. All of this for a time when there weren't many people? Seriously. It wasn't busy. The location near my home is packed constantly, yet the staff remains extremely friendly. Maybe that is why this location isn't very busy. Please ... get rid of your current staff and replace them with more friendly versions and maybe traffic to your store will improve. Yes, I'm really suggesting you fire them all. They are the front line of your business and are ruining it.
