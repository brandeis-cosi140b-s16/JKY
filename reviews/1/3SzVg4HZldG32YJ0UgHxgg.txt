Their is a reason why there are no cars parked in this parking lot .Went in on a Saturday afternoon to see for myself if the food was decent. Only two other people in the place...I was concerned. Chips and salsa were given and the chips were definetly from a bag... a small minus but I remained hopeful. Ordered queso dip and pork chili relleno. sadly the queso was white velveeta...so plain I had to order side of cilantro and extra cheddar cheese. waiter informs me there is no cheddar cheese in the house...only white cheese. the entrée arrived so burnt I ask them to redo...26 minutes later it came back!!!The portion was less and had so much grease on the plate that a felt I was being punished. When I tried to speak to the manager everyone of the staff including the waiter seemed to disappear. 1 bowl of cheese dip,1 entrée, and 1 margy came to $39.37. Left the entrée sitting there untouched, put the money on the table and walked to the door...meanwhile manager is still no where to be found. Place could use a face lift as well. Waste of time and money!!!
