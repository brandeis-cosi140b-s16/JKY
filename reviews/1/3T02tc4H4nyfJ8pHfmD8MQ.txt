Dear Chipotle, when I order a burrito and chips I expect a burrito and chips - that's it. Nothing more nothing less. I don't want a burrito and chips WITH HAIR!!! 

Full Story: I placed my order online because  the line can get long at this location during lunch. I picked if up at the scheduled time and went back to work to eat it. Little did I know of the surprises that lay ahead... I'll leave it up to you, the reader, to reconstruct what happened. Protip: read the first paragraph.

I'm never going to eat here again. I start to gag just thinking about it.
