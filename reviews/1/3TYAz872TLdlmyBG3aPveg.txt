Yo so this place kind of sucks because I asked twice for bean  burritos cause I realize the screen read wrong. It read breakfast burritos... So I pulled to the window and i asked  "those are bean burritos correct?" Lady at the window said yes.. I drive away and take a bite into a fucking breakfast burrito. I don't feel like it's worth my time to go back and fix this.. I'm just not going to go back.
