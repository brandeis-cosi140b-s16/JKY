i grew up in madison but  went to school in ny and now live in chicago.  most summers, however, i lived on the uw campus.  now i frequently visit as my friends/family still live in the area.

one summer when i lived on langdon my friend got a job here.  she needed a job badly, and had worked in food service at various madison area restaurants for years.  she quit after a mere 4 hours.  she said the management was extremely rude and made some remarks.  the only adjectives she would use were "gross and sexist."

also, she said they take expensive tequilla bottles and pour in GENERIC BRAND CHEAP SHIT.  talk about a scam.

avoid at all costs.
