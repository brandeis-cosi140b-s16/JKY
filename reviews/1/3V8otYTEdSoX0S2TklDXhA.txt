Could not believe the way I was treated at this location on the evening of 4/7/15. I stopped by the drive through at exactly 10:31pm which is 29 minutes before the drive through closes. I pulled up to the speaker and no one said anything after a few minutes I pulled ahead to the window. 
I saw the employees cleaning up early and I flagged one down, he told me they were closed. I simply stated that there sign said they were open till 11:00pm which by now was still 15 minutes to go. He said oh well everything is shut off and sent me on my way. 
I couldn't believe it!! Plus there were 4 other cars behind me in the drive through, I'm sure the owner would be glad to know his staff is just throwing money away.
