I was so excited to make it to Reyna, their selection is great. However when I brought home and opened one of the spices it had flies in it, another jar of pepper paste was one year expired and a bag of chilli sauce was expired since 2013. Completely unacceptable and disgusting to sell such expired food to your customers. Check the expiration dates on all purchase from here!!!
