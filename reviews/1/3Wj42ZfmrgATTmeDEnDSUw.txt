They can't fool a real Mexican! I've never written a review, but after visiting this place, I just had to! First if all, they don't season their meat! I saw them with my own eyes pulling the steaks out of the packaging straight from the butcher onto the grill. No salt or  seasoning what so ever! If they think everyone is too drunk to tell, or too ignorant, boy are they mistaken! 
The tacos de adobada, not close to the real deal, they seemed pasted with pink coloring. If you're hungry and don't give a f??? About the taste, go for it. 
And the set up they have is stupid. You form a separate line for each kind of tacos you want!? Wtf!!!
