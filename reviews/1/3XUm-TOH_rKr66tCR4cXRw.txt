We had a party of 7 and in the beginning, advised we needed separate checks. Our drinks took a good 15 minutes to come out. When our food finally came out, two entrees were missing and the orders were wrong. It was about 10-15 minutes before the other 2 in our party received their entrees. The food was lukewarm and bland. 

We wanted to stick around for drinks, however, our waitress didn't come back and check on us. Some of our party had to go up to the bar for drinks. When we decided to leave our checks were not separated and when they were, it was wrong. It took about 25 minutes for us to actually pay out ( it was not busy).

The waitress was very nice and friendly, but that doesn't compensate for the time wasted and less that mediocre food.
