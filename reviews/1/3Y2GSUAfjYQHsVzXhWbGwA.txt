Even though there are not many good Mexican restaurants in Matthews or Charlotte, they still need to have expectations. Even though the food was decent, the service was TERRIBLE. We couldn't understand a word the waiters where saying, mostly because they were hardly whispering to us. Their thick accents mixed with the whispering was very difficult to understand. On top of that, we had about a 15 minute wait for just drinks, and about a 40 minute wait to get our food. We had seven people with us, and three of them didn't fully enjoy the food, and one of them hardly ate any of it. The most enjoyable part of the restaurant was there nice bathrooms. 

Over all we were disappointed and probably will not return to this restaurant.
