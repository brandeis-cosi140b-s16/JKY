Terrible. The Guacamole tasted like formaldehyde, this happens when you put foil over it from a chemical reaction. The shrimp burrito had NO season and was really undercooked. I ordered a beef taco to leave semi-full and WATER poured out... The meat was gray and no flavor. I will never be back here! Ate two bites and paid $21. Bad
