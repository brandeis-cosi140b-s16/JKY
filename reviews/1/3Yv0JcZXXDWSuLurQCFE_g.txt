Ashley H is drunk or owns stock in this chain. No offense Ashley, but you said: " The thing which they use to differentiate themselves is that they make their tortillas from dough when you order and also "bob" it...which apparently means mixing the filling of the burrito when you order."

They do neither, at least not with me. They threw a tortilla on the warming plate, then just filled it with the same boring bland choices I get at Qdoba and Chipotle. The end result, the same awful, bland, boring shit.

Now there are three places, exactly the same and turning out the same poor quality of food.
