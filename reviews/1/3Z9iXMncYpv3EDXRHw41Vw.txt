I really like the food here, but I'm going to have to rate this place with 1 star due to their kids menu. Their kids taco and cheese enchilada plate are way to spicy for kids. My son is just under 2 and he screamed when he ate the kids cheese enchilada. I tasted the sauce and it was spicy. I asked the waitress for milk. She then had the audacity to tell me that I should order it next time without the sauce. Hey why not a heads up before my kid ate it! So disappointed in this place and the service. Why would you put spicy food on a children's menu?!?  

And for the record I love spicy food and can't believe that the sauce on my sons enchilada plate was as spicy as it was.
