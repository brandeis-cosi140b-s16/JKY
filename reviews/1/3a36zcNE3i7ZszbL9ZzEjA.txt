I'm not even going to talk about the costs.  I know I go to Vegas to spend money (or someone else's money).  If I didn't want to I should stay home.  Moving on.
Even though there were some vegetarian options on the menu, it was mostly cheese based.  We ordered several dishes.  It really didnt look like anything was made at the restaurant.  Some of the items tasted like they were from a heat and eat box.  Their deserts definitely didn't taste fresh.  Sure other people may like the food, I personally do not prefer it.  There's a cantina up the strip I find a lot better than this place.
