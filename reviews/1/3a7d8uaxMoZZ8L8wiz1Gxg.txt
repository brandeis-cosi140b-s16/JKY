I am the friend that was with Evonne L. and Stephanie W.  And I'm having a hard time understanding how I got beef tacos and my friend wasn't able to.  And, as pointed out by Evonne L., having MEAT in a salad that was SUPPOSED TO BE VEGETARIAN is UN-FUCKING-ACCEPTABLE. Oh, and the tacos swimming in grease were a nice touch, along with my Sierra Mist that actually turned out to be seltzer water.  Yeah, won't be coming back to this shithole again.
