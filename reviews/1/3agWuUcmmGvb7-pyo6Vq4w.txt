If you gave this place anything other than one star you must have been so incredibly drunk and high while you were eating here. This was SIGNIFICANTLY worse than any Filiberto's I have ever been too and that says a lot considering that Filiberto's is only good when you are incredibly drunk and high.

I have a feeling my toilet and I are going to have a great bonding session after eating lunch here. STAY AWAY!
