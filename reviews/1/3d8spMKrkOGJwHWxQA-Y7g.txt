I love Los, but I can't bring myself to come to this location anymore. Their soda machine has been broken/half working for well over a month now. It just sprays out syrup or comes out like a water fountain completely flat. When I tell them about the issue someone goes and "fixes it" only to find nothing has changed. How they charge me for a drink when their machine is clearly broken... I do not know.
