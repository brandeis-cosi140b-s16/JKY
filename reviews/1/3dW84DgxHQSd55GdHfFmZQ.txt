We found this place on restaurant.com. First of all, we could not find it because it was located in a marketplace and the name was not listed on the front of the building, so had to call after several times around the block. The "restaurant" consists of 3 chairs at a counter, with no seating in the common area like you find at a mall food court. My taste buds were ready for some good Oriental food [Southwestern flair would have been okay too], but it was a terrible experience. There is a very limited menu, with 3-4 Bao [sandwiches] and only 4 entrees. the food was tasteless and overpriced for what you got--chicken entrée consisted of dry slices of about 1/8 of a grilled chicken breast and a spoonful of limp veggies on the side, with no sauce. I had to ask for dressing for the meager kale salad; also requested salt, pepper, Sriracha and soy sauce [had to get 3 little containers as there was less than a teaspoon each] to be able to eat the rest of the dish and plain rice. We spent over $20 on one entrée [one free + $1], a water and a soda, all served on disposable tray with plastic silverware--and I was still hungry after we ate.

Sounds like maybe we should have tried Happy Hour and the pork or chicken Bao according to other reviews, but I don't eat white flour, and there is no pork entree. Unfortunately, the good sauces previously described were missing from our entrees. Now, thinking about the price, maybe there was an up-charge for brown rice?? The receipt was not detailed.
