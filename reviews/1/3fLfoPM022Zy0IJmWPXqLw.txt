My mom wanted taco bell the other night, so we stopped in for a quick bite and I don't think I will be back. The location seemed dirty. I ordered the cheese nachos and was very disgusted when the order came out. They were on the typical fast food tray, but unfortunately there was no tray liner. I have seen how "clean" those trays are so needless to say I didn't eat the chips that rolled out on the tray. Lucky for me...when you order the nachos you don't get enough cheese for all the chips anyways, so I was still able to finish the cheese.
