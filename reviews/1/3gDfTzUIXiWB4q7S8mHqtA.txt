Horrible drive thru service . Im about to throw a rock at the window. They just keep starring but they don't take our order. Im typing this as we wait. 

Well now that we have started to place our order, we weren't  even done when the lady closed the window on us !!!!!! 

It may just be the pregnancy hormones !!! But ugh!!!! Never again!!!! I don't  even want to give it one star. It doesn't  deserve it. The food will probably be good since we've ate here before but the service today has been horrible.
