I came here over a month ago their lunch special was terrible it had no flavor. Later on when i went to my bank to deposit I notice that the cashier gave me my change wrong, I was $10 dollars short. I called the restaurant and spoke with a manager named Noe and he stated he would return my call after counting their money drawer and checking the cameras.
This man has yet failed to call me up to this date, to at least notify me of the outcome. Over all consumer service and food is terrible, it's a Joke to even call it "Mexican food."
