Went here around 10ish and the drive thru lady was so RUDE!!! First she kept asking if I was ready yet with my order even though I told her give me a minute I'm looking.. Once I got to the window and got my food from her attitude having ass, I asked her for salsa and she looks at my and says "ugh, oh my god" rolls her eyes.. Turns around and walks away.. She is so lucky I was feeling sick that day or I woulda jumped through the window and beat the brakes off that bitch.. Horrible customer service and they were out of chicken!!! How the hell are you out of chicken at a chicken restaurant !!!
