Just about the only thing I enjoyed about this place was the drinks. I had a sip of just about everyone's drink, and they were all pretty tasty.

I dined with Emily E. (below, in the party of 12), and I agree with everything she said.

While the food wasn't bad, it was not worth the price -- $65 for my husband and me. I have no problem paying for quality, but Havana Grill simply wasn't worth it.

The waiter was downright rude at times. I felt he didn't put much effort into service because he knew he was getting 18 percent gratuity (not what I would have left by any means had I the choice).

I am sad there aren't many Cuban restaurants in town, as I long for the authentic fare I ate in Miami two years ago. Looks like we locals just won't get the chance to experience something better.
