Hit or miss.  Great margaritas, but the food tonight was inedible.  Literally.  Picked up an order to go and they left out some items (second time that has happened). Chicken enchiladas, pork tacos, and tamales.  All three dishes the meat was dry and overcooked but the outside was cold. The flan had the taste and consistency of Greek yogurt not creamy custard. I had two bites of each dish to see if there was something, anything edible. Nope, just threw away $26 worth of food.
