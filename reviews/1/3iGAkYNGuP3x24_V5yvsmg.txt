The last time I came here and got a breakfast, it almost killed me.
 
I shit you not, I got food poisoning so bad I had to go the doctor and  
spend a couple grand before the ordeal was through.
 
I know you roll the dice anytime you eat fast food, but save your  
broke ass a couple grand and go to the burger king next door.
