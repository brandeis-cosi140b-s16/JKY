We went one day and it was delicious we got the carne asada tacos and they were good and the carne asada burrito with red chile. All was good!!! 

We went that weekend and I got the menudo and bf got the steak breakfast. ALLL was good especially the bread until... Right on the wall that we were facing a little Roach crawled across it! We told the lDy and she was like whatever and offered us to move. I told her everything was good but the roach crawling on the wall right at our table was just disgusting. Thanks roach for ruining Mama LUPITAS fora me!
