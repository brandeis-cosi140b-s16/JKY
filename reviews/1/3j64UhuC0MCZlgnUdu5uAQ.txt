Rolled tacos were miserable, undercooked and soft in the middle. The avocado and cheese overwhelmed the poor things and they were not able to withstand the pressure - collapsing under their own weight. The horchata was even worse as this version tasted flowery and they decided not to add ice to the drink either. Every salsa in the place was burning butthole variety, so gringo's aren't welcome. The crowd was clearly skewed towards the spanish speaking hombres. Also, get a drive through installed, so I don't have to go inside and deal with all the drunken patrons. Oh, don't bother now, I won't be back anytime soon.
