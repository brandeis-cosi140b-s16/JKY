Inconsistent at best, and totally unsafe for me.   I originally came because of the gluten-free menu and their commitment to sustainable food, two things that are rarities in the fast food world.  If you're going to do gluten-free, you've got to do it right - you've got to train your staff, and then they've got to give a damn, which is probably why most fast food places don't bother.  

The last time I was there (read: the last time I will EVER go there), the guy put the wrong item in the computer.  Mistakes happen, but there was no apology, no acknowledgement that we had a whole conversation about the fact that the chicken salad is NOT safe, and yet that's what he put in the computer.  The kitchen staff just made me a new salad without argument (yay!).  I ended up getting sick anyway, though.  (BOO!)   It didn't appear that they just threw new stuff on top of the old salad, so they either threw something with gluten in out of spite, they have crazy cross-contamination going on in the back, or they just don't know what they hell they're doing.  

In any case, I won't be back - not worth risking getting sick for me.  If you don't have gluten sensitivity, you might be happy with their food, and don't forget a run by the yummy salsa bar.

You'll find me over at Chipotle instead for a fresher, healthier, safer munch on the run.
