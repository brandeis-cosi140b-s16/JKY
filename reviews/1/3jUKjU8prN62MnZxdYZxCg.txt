Total bummer. Saw a picture in a magazine in the hotel and went. Menu was basic Mexican. Flavor was mediocre, prices were high for what we got. Service, well, that alone was enough to make us never come back, none of the staff seemed to want to be there. I really wanted to like this place but  just couldn't muster up even 2 stars.
