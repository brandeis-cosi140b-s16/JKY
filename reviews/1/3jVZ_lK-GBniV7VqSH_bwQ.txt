I had high hopes for this hole in the wall restaurant...well, here it goes. I walked in and the counter attendant immediately started talking to me in Spanish. Likewise for the waitress. Just cuz I'm brown doesn't mean I hablo Espa√±ol!  :/  If you can't tell that's a pet peeve of mine.

Anyways, I decided to get my order to-go. I ordered two pupusas. When it was ready, I whipped out my debit card. I was given a dirty look. She asked (less than politely) "you don't have $3.80 cash?". Uh no- that's why I have a card in my hand. "Our card machine is broken" she says. Mind you,  there wasn't anything posted alerting customers to this problem. I asked if there was an ATM nearby. I didn't understand her reply. So we just stared at each other awkardly until I apologized and left.  

I didn't get a chance to try the food,  but the rude employees and unannounced broken card/debit machine will keep me from coming back. I say again, epic failure!
