I came across my receipt for this place and realized the one good thing about it - $35 to feed 6 people.  

Otherwise - every single person in my party did not like their food.  I had the torta with shredded beef, it was passable.  The kids got taquitos - which are just corn soft tortillas with unseasoned steak bites.  Yuck.  

Most others got tacos and were just unimpressed with the seasoning of the meat, or how little fixings they came with.  Just meat and a taco shell.  That's not what I think of when I think of street tacos (not like I know them, but I *imagine* cilantro, onions, and a bit of pico).  Well that's what a guero imagines what it would be like.  To be fair, some of that stuff is at the condiment bar, but we just couldn't piece together a good meal out of it.  

Anyways.  I really wanted to like this place.  Oh and their diablo sauce = super false advertising.  Not spicy at all.  Even for a gringo.
