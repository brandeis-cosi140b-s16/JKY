Order took over an hour to arrive and the food was cold and inedible. Ordered three tacos dorados and got their version - which is basically rolled tortillas with some meat inside. For this they bill you over 8 dollars. I could have made it so much better myself at home. Contacted the place to let them know and all I got was: "Our reviews are perfect" and other comments that contradicted my experience. They didn't listen and hardly allowed me to explain. They have no concept of proper Customer Service. I will never order from this place again and strongly advise anybody else from doing so. You will be VERY disappointed. Trust me on this.
