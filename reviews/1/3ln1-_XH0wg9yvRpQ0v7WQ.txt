C'mon, Vegas,  "eight years in a row," are you kidding me? "The best restaurant in Vegas." The only good thing about this place is the majestic views. Other than that the food is lame, the service is terrible, and the price is exorbitant. 
Well,  the real estate justified the prices. So in a way we agreed on to pay top dollar for what ever we ate there.
The chips and salsa were good. My order was all screwed up.  I ordered a shrimp cocktail that my server forgot about it. My fried fish wasn't cooked with the right sauce.  So my server apologized and decided to send it back to the kitchen.
In retrospect I. Wish he would have been allowed me to participate in suchlike decision.  But not.  He just took the fish back.
The kitchen slapped the fish with the aforementioned sauce and refried the same fish one more time. The ensuing outcome was logical: my fish was with crust harder than a rock.
Now you could say: everyone can make a two mistakes in one order. But the table right behind send their order back because meat wasn't properly cooked.
One more gripe.  The server  and busboy insisted on calling me Amigo.  Amigo is a term of endearment.  So I wanted to lecture them on the proper etiquette. I just left the cafeteria bland taste food with fantastic views behind with a Texas-size disappointment.
