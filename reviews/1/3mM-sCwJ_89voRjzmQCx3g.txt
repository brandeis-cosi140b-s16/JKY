My brother loves this place. 
Apparently on account of the lunch specials. 

The Service was okay. Our poor waitress was about 10 months pregnant, and I hated asking her for anything. They bring your food out on carts which is different, but made me feel better for our waitress. (did I mention she was practically crowning!) 

The chips were stale, when we asked for a fresher batch she said "they're all from yesterday so they are the same" - Kudos for your honestly, I suppose. 

The food was... bland, and boring. Even with the 7 dollar price tag, including drink and desert, it was not worth it. 

It's now an ongoing joke any time we go out to eat with my brother, "Anything but Si Senors"
