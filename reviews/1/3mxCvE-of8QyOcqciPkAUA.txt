Service was okay, ordered a posole on Sunday night and they told me they ran out so I opted for the taquitos which were really bad the tortilla was dry and old and the meat was dry and not flavorful at all! Would not go again! Food is very bland the only good thing is the salsa and chips they give other than that it's bad!
