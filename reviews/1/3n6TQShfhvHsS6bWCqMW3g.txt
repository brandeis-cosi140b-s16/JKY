A friend of mine recently insisted on going to Macayo's for dinner.  She's in love with the Baja burrito.  I'll give her that the Baja sauce is pretty good, but everything else wasn't.  I tried both the beef burrito and the chicken burrito and they were both awful.  Plus, they didn't sit well in my stomach later either.  The others in our group said their meals were okay, but there was nothing to write home about.

The service was terrible.  Our waitress was a nice woman, but everything took so long.  We waited a long time to be helped, long for the food, and then a few things were forgotten, and then we waited almost an hour to get the bill and then pay it.  It was excruiciatingly painful.

I'd say my last visit to Macayo's was one of the worst restaurant experiences I have ever had, and it will be the last.
