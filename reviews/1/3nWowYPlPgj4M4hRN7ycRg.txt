I came here for lunch. I ordered two beef tacos with beans and rice and a shrimp tostada. Everything tasted awful. The shrimp was not deveined and the tostada was overloaded with onions. The tostada also had no flavor. The rice had a horrible aftertaste. I ended up just throwing everything away. I lost my appetite. What a waste of $13.
