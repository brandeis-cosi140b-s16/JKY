I was very disappointed with there service food staff and owner  !! Mostly owner !!! He was very rude treated his workers  terrible with no respect at all  on a level if he had a lot of  prejudice  in him. As well  he had no respect for  individuals that sacrifice and service are country for are freedom .. That is one area that really upsets me . He would not be a owner of that business if it wasn't forhusbands or wives or  are sons and daughters serving are country that is like spitting  in a persons face ... I will never step a foot in his business again and would not recommend anyone to waiste there time and there money on low budget wanna be Mexican food !!
