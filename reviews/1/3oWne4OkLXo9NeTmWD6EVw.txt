I've been here before and was disappointed, rice and beans had no flavor...I decided give it one more try so I ordered the California burrito,  once again I left disappointed the meat had so much pepper and that's about the only flavor, had maybe 4 fries in it....really makes me wonder if they don't know how to season food, I'm giving up on this place I will go back to Don Tortaco
