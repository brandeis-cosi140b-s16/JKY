I visited today with my son to enjoy the day. The waitress didn't ask how we were doing can she help us pick something out. She wasn't helpful at all never asked how our food was. It was so nasty my stomach hurt so bad afterwards. I didn't want a to go box & she didn't even ask was everything ok. I go out to eat a lot & Mexican is one of my favorites but I will never go back there.
