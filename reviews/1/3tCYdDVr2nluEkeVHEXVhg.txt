This location needs to improve their service and quality of food. I've been here three times and each time the staff seems so unhappy. Tonight the rice was undercooked, and the lettuce wasn't drained properly. I also passed on the guacamole because it looked brown, like it had been sitting out too long to serve. It's a shame because I usually like the food here. We probably won't be coming back to this location even though it's the closest one to home.
