I keep hearing great comments about this place and since I love TORTAS  decided to give it a try. Walk in place thinking will be a fast way to take dinner home but oh boy I was wrong!!!!. I waited there for like 20 minutes by cashier to place my order and a waiter came and went but never even asked me if I needed help. So I decided to leave. The most disappointment part was that place wasn't even full. In fact only one table with a couple was occupied. I'd never went back and do not intent to do so. I'm giving it one star because I didn't try food and it doesn't let me post review without it. :/
