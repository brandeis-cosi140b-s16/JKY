Went here once for dinner last year and never will again. The food and drink that I did eventually have were excellent. However, our server was THE WORST that I have ever encountered. We were seated and ignored for approximately 30 mins before our server came over and jokingly said he was sorry for the wait even though the place was "pretty dead". I am convinced he was either high or drunk because he could not tell us what the specials were and would stare off or wander away from our table in mid sentence. I would have left sooner if my date had not convinced me to say and we weren't so hungry. Just got drinks an hour into being there. When he was finally able to take our order, the food came out quickly and we ate it quickly since we had by now been there about an hour and a half. I was so upset after this that I wrote an email detailing the experience to the owner. He didn't seem too surprised or apologetic. I was offered a free round of drinks next time I came in which is insulting and ridiculous. What part of "I am never coming back here again" didn't you get????
