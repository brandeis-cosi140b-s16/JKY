We decided to try this place for lunch on a Sunday. It was slow and we sat at the bar.
The bartender really didn't want to be there, it was quite obvious. We asked what the specials were and he rattled off some drinks. I ordered a bloody mary and my friend ordered a margarita. He asked me what I wanted in my bloody mary.... I said I wanted it spicy. What I got tasted like tomato juice with some vodka in it. He brought a bottle of tabasco and a pepper shaker... I asked for olives and he brought me a glass of them. Obviously he had little experience with bloody marys. My friends margarita was terrible and she gave it back and ordered a beer instead. I asked 3 times for a glass of ice water before I got it.
They specialize in tacos and they don't do that well either. My carne asada tacos were ok, but nothing special. The tortilla soup was blah. My friends chicken tacos were pretty bland.

It's doubtful that I will go back to this place again.
Poor service, mediocre food.
