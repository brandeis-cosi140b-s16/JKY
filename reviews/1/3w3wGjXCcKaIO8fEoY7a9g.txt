I came here with a group of friends on Saturday evening around 7 p.m.  The place was empty, however the service was very slow.  It took awhile for all of us to get drinks.  Our server had a bit of an attitude at first, but warmed up.  She did not know what the house tequila was.  Whatever it was, it was not present in my margarita, which was extremely watered down and tasted terrible.  But I drank it, considering I wasn't sure when our server would be back.  When she did return, I ordered a different drink, this one tasted great but also did not have much alcohol in it, if any.  I left the restaurant more sober than I was when I arrived.  On to the food: The chips and salsa were very good, and we ate a ton of them because it took awhile for our server to take and deliver our food order.  The guacamole was ok, a little bland.  The quesadillas were fine, it's hard to mess those up.  The beans that came with them, however, were straight out of a can.  For dinner I ordered the shrimp tacos, they were pretty tasty and came with some good spicy salsa.  Now, this is what takes the cake, literally.  It was my friend's birthday and we were going to order a dessert to split, but we were told, "Sorry, we are all out of desserts."  Huh?  Our server said they had catered a party earlier that day and ran out of everything.  She also blamed the slow service on being short-staffed, but like I said, the restaurant was dead.  She somewhat redeemed herself later on in the evening when we came back in to sit at the bar for drinks by giving us our first round for $5.  It was a nice gesture, but once again, my drink was watered down.  I'd rather pay full price for a real drink.  There are too many other great places to eat and drink in Old Town.  Will not be back.
