The other location was better I had never had a problem but last time I was there all of our food was cold and tasted awful manager didn't accept responsibility said they can't guarantee our food be warm when we get home and that maybe it was my fault food took over an hour until it was ready our bill was 70 dollars with tip I understand mistakes but the both managers I contacted one of which who's name is Corey were not helpful and seemed not to care I will not go back ajo als is closer so I will be going there from now on
