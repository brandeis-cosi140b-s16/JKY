Ew ew ew! Why did I try this place again?! I had a friend rave over their chicken tacos so we went on Wednesday when they are a dollar. They weren't even worth that! Horrible. No taste at all and the tortilla was inedible. It wasn't soft but wasn't crispy. Every time I think I'm going to like Robertos, I am proven wrong. I won't be eating there again.
