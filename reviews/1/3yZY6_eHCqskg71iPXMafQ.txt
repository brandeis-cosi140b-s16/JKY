This place is a real shit hole.  I have never had worse service or worse tasting Mexican food.  Everything tasted like it came from a can or a jar.  The waiter we saw two times and it was to take our order then to check and see if our food was ok.  We told him it was cause it was apparent this place and the people have their head stuck so far up their ass they could smell their breath and that translated to attitude and the way they cooked their food.  As a Hispanic I am very embarrassed by this place and what they call cooking.  The margarita was so watered down it tasted like ice and salt.  I do not think anyone could save this place.  PLEASE!  Stop going there Maricopans!!  This place SUCKS!
