When I first was in this restaurant, I asked the employees what region of Mexico is the food served in the restaurant from. One of the waiters told me, "Mexico". I said I see your food is Mexican. It says that on the door but what region is it from? Oaxaca, Senora, Baja? One of the employees then said it is New Mexican. I asked so is it Americanized Mexican Food? I was then told there is a pepper that only grows in New Mexico that all the food is flavored with. I asked what are the vegetarian entrees. The employee told me she could not remember and left me to read through the menu until I found one. They also had some cookies called bruschettitos. I said to the employee, "I know bruschetta are twice baked cookies. What kind of cookies are these? Mexican wedding cookies?" She said she did not know but she said they are really good with milk or coffee. I ordered a vegetarian burrito which came with a side of beans and rice. I ordered this to go. The burrito is the worst burrito I have ever had. I ate one bite and could not eat any more. I could eat two bites of the rice. Only the pinto beans were good. The employees do not seem to know anything about the food they are serving. Apparently one employee thinks Mexico is a region of Mexico.
