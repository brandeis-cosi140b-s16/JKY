We ordered the "California Vegetarian Burrito w/ enchilada sauce." Took two bites and asked for our money back. Seemed like the strategy was to hide the taste of old food with onions.  The enchilada sauce was dark brown and had mystery chunks in it, and tasted burnt. 

Three times the price of Taco Bell and half as good.
