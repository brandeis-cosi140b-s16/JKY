Are there negative numbers available??    Can I give them LESS than one star??

I went there with my dad a week ago, and we were seated in about 10 minutes.   In another ten minutes, we had drinks at our table, and had placed our order.   

Fast forward 45 minutes.  After flagging down our nearly non-existent waitress twice and finally asking for the manager, we finally got our meals.   

We had been in the restaurant nearly an hour, and watched others seated after us get their dinner.  The waitress wasn't much help, and wanted to tell us ours would be right up without bothering to check on it.   

The manager finally cruised by just after our food arrived, and kind of did the casual  "Is everything ok with your meal?"  We told him we were very unhappy with the extensive delay in a half-empty restaurant.   

He didn't seem much interested in doing anything about it.    The food seemed bland and tasteless, and I left regretting not going anywhere else for dinner that night.  

This is the second time I've been there.  The first time was a much better experience.
