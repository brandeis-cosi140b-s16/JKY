Went here for lunch yesterday with a groupon, 40 dollars.  We ordered chips and salsa for 6 dollars, no that is not a typo.  It arrived in....get this, a paper bag. Salsa was bland.  They would not honor the TR price, but that is understandable with the groupon, just want you all to know that.  I ordered the chicken mole enchiladas.....horrible!!  The chicken was disgusting, I had to eat around it, which was not easy.  My husband got the pulled pork sandwich.  He said it tasted ok.  The prices are beyond stupid expensive, save your money and get better Mexican food at El Pollo Loco.
