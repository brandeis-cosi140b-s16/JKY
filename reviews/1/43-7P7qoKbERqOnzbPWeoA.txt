I wish I could give NEGATIVE stars because that's what they deserve.  Management (short, little hispanic guy with glasses and an attitude problem) is deplorable.  He threw my receipt at me, when I asked if he could help me (run my card) because we were running late.  There was ONE server for the entire dining room; he was not smiling, but exhausted and apologizing for messing things up from (no silverware, no order taking for the first 20 mins we were there, and the ticket issue across all of the tables was a HUGE issue for him).  He got no assistance from the 3 people (including the short Manager with glasses) who were yapping behind the bar.  Overall, food was okay - but would never go back to an establishment where the Manager throws your receipt at you and offers no apology for the chaos.  DISGUSTINGLY HORRIBLE MANAGEMENT.....  He should work at the DMV.
