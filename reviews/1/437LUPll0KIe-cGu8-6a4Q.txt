Too bad that the food here is delicious, because they didn't honor my Open Table reservation, nor did they cancel it. I received an email confirmation from Open Table but when I got there was told by the hostess that she 'didn't take the reservation' - whatever that means, since I have an email that says she did. Unfortunately, the manager didn't apologize either.  I'll go somewhere else next time.
