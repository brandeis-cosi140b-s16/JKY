Everytime I stop here to eat there is some type of fiasco. No different tonight. Waited at drive thru for 10 minutes in a line of cars. I get up to the speaker and place my order. Its repeated, then verified and then repeated again. Doesn't help that their employees barely speak English. After telling me the total the employee then informs me they ran out of food. No chicken... at Pollo Loco. 

Gave this dump 3 tries and I can finally say I will not be back ever. Management here does not know how to run a business.

Pollo Loco running out of chicken at 7pm. Like GM running out of cars.
