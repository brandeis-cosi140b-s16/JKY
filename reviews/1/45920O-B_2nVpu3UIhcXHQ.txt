Decided to go here for Cinco De Mayo and we were seated right away the hostess was nice. The bus boy came around got our drink order and our chips and salsa. But with my drinks I also ordered a drink that was made from the bar. I didn't get that for about 15 minutes because I had to ask again. We didn't see our waitress for about 10 minutes after we were seated. Her name was Bethany, her attitude for my daughter and I was like we were a burden. We weren't loud, we weren't obnoxious, for some reason as soon as she got to our table her whole attitude changed. She was chipper and friendly with all of her other tables and visited them frequently.

 My food was DISGUSTING (I ordered fish tacos, they were soggy, rice was hard and beans were crusty) but Bethany never came around to ask us how our food was or to ask if we needed anything. My daughter wasted her food because we couldn't get Bethany to bring us some ketchup because she made it a point to keep her distance from our table. We didn't get refills until AFTER we decided we were done with our food and SURPRISE it was the bus boy who asked because he could see the look of frustration on my face. 

When we finally got the check Bethany noticed I had only had two bites of ONE of the TWO fish tacos but she said nothing. She STILL didn't ask how the food was. This place just sucked. It's one thing if the food is good with bad service but when it's both, I'm sorry but I WILL NOT be returning here, FOR ANY REASON. Only good thing I have to say is nice view.
