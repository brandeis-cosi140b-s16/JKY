Run the other way. Seriously. My boyfriend and I ate here almost a year ago and it still sticks in our mind as the worst place we've ate since moving to Charlotte. It's actually a comparison for other crappy restaurants ("Yeah, it was bad. But at least it wasn't On the Border bad.")

And the sad thing is, it's not that the place was disgusting or the service was terrible, it's that the food tasted that crappy.

The first thing we got was, of course, chips and salsa. I've never had chips and salsa I didn't like, until coming here. Seriously, how can you screw up chips and salsa?
Then we got some guacamole, hoping it could alleviate the situation. I like guacamole, and my boyfriend's addicted to the stuff. The guacamole didn't even taste like avocados, frankly, it didn't have much of a taste at all. 
I ordered the Dos XX fish tacos as my meal. I like fish tacos, I like Dos XX, this should be good right? NOPE!  After half a taco, I couldn't do it. The super fishy taste blended with way too much cabbage and some crappy sauce. The boyfriend got a steak burrito-his staple at any Mexican restaurant. A few bites later he looked at me and said, "It's just not good." After staring awkwardly at each other and the food, we finally asked for the check. The server asked if we wanted to a to-go box. For probably the first time in my life, I declined. Because who was I kidding, this crap was unfit to consume.

The most surprising part: Beer didn't make it better. And beer makes everything better.
