Would give this place less than a star if it was possible. Me and my girlfriend are here last night, she had the street tacos( steak and chicken) and I had the fajitas. About and hour and a half to two hours later she was bent over the toilet violently throwing up and this lasted until the morning. She had nothing to eat for hours prior to eating there and was just fine all day. So I went back in to inform the manager that my girlfriend got food poisoning and all they could say was that they couldn't do anything about it and that they would need a hospital report stating that it was the steak that gave her the food poisoning. Well since it is now 12 hours later and she has violently vomited everything up that's going to be a little hard. They had poor service and clearly a dirty kitchen.  I would recommend that you stay far and clear away from this place.
