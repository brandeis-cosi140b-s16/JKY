This place was so disgusting, I had to walk out after ordering a water. It was around 7:30pm on a Sunday night with two waiters and two bartenders who were not friendly or helpful. The place was thinning out, but I couldn't fine one clean table. 10-15 tables with dirty dishes, dirty glasses, empty chip baskets. No manager in sight and no waiters in an hurry to clear a table. I found one corner to sit down squeezed next to another couple. I finally decided if it's this dirty in the restaurant, no telling what the kitchen looks like. Not going to stick around to find out. I don't like giving bad reviews, but this place was ridiculous!
