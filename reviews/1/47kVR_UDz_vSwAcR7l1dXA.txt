I've had waaaay better Mexican. I grew up across the way from the barrios in Santa Ana so I know me some good Mexican.

Pros:

-Cute outdoor decor. That was it.
-the cheese crisp was ok.
-they had flour tortilla chips that were pretty tasty and a nice change from corn.

Cons:

-Food was not good. I can make better Mexican, and I'm Asian.
-ceviche tasted like frozen shrimp mixed with salsa. 
-drinks were watered down. I ordered a margarita and it came with a side tumbler so I was excited until I tasted it...watery. 

Verdict:

Would not go again although it was fun following the chilies on the path back to my hotel.
