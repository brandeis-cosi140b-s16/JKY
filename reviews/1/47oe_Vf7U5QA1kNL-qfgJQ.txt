after seeing such good reviews i decided to stop by for a late lunch with my family. the prices were pretty good and the inside looked neat. after ordering meal for 2ppl i expected a nice portion of food. the gave us each 3tortillas a teaspoon of guac and sour cream and a tablespoon of rice. also a tablespoon amount of each meat which looked only for one person. when we asked for more the charged us extra. also we paid almost 5 more dollars to recieve 3 pieces of shrimp which the mixed with potatos to fake it that you got a decent portion. over all taste was good but the extra charges and the amount of food you get for the price is not worth it. worst experience ever!!
