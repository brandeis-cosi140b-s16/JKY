Ive been going for months the raspados are good. Arroz con leche/ 3 berries.  Until today i dont know why i never saw how rude the owners were but until i had a horrible experience today. All i can say is they dont not know what customer service is. Its something that should be taken care of as business owners. It doesnt look like there will be a next time im not going to support there bad attitude!
