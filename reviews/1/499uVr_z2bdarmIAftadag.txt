Holy expensive tacos Batman I will not be back.  I ordered a total of 4 tacos and a beer grand total $25.00 dollars.  

My hubby had two chorizo and papas tacos and I had a two tacos that had a shrimp and cheese filling the name escapes me.  The menu boasts of house made chorizo but we could barely taste any chorizo in the tacos. There seemed to be only one shrimp cut up into 3 pieces in each of my tacos. 

I watched the cook walk back and forth between the kitchen and the dining room 8 times touching everything in the dining room and sitting down with a waitress to eat chips and salsa.  Granted the NBA Dunk Contest was on the bigscreen so it's possible that he didn't want to miss out on the action.  I would expect more professionalism from a place that charged $8 for two tacos.
