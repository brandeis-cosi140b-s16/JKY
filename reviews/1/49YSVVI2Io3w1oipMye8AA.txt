Stopped in here for Cinco de Mayo. First mistake going to a subpar mexican restaurant on Cinco de Mayo. Waited over an hour. This place is a three ringed circus. They push the food cart through the lobby of waiting patrons. Thats just nasty and the people sitting on the bench near the hostess station, well you get a work out because you gotta lift your feet and bring your knees to your chest so the waitstaff can plough through with the food cart.

Once seated we were greeted drinks were ordered, water, coors, and a double shot of Jack.  The coors showed up, then after ten minutes the water showed up.  "Wheres my Jack?" She rushed away and brought it back after a few. 

By the time she came back we were ready to order. Con caso for an appetizer and a few platters that dont matter.  Just the two of us. We watched as a tavle of 6 sat, drank, ordered then got their food and began eating. 45 minutes later no caso, no waitress.

Sink your teeth into my white ass Rauls. We got the fuck up and raised hell at the bar. Paid for my drinks and jammed out to 5 guys next door.  If I ever find myself in a situation where I would have to go back to this over glorified TacoHell..I'll break a bottle and ram it into my throat and bleed out before going back. 

I am growing tired of the service industry in Phoenix, nobody gives a flying fuck....why? Because there are millions of Phoenix mouths that are willing to forgo service for a quick cheap meal.
