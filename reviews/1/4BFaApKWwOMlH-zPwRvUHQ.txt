I am extremely disappointed in this chipotle. Over the course of a couple months, yes couple of months( my husband loves to eat here) we have had bad experiences everything from fountain machine not working, running out of meat, soggy chips and now pure brown guacamole. The worst part about this is the manager told me it's not avocado season and that's why it's brown..funny cause I can buy avocados for my restaurant and they aren't brown!
Oh and not to
Mention we waited in line for 15minutes..and no the line wasn't long they only had 2 people working the front kitchen line. Bravo chipotle!
