Worst "Mexican" food I've ever had.. the service.. so lacking that it was non existence. Took forever to get drinks and chips. And there was un-bussed tables that had dirty plates and drinks on it for the whole time we where there. There was only 1 other table and a few people at the bar. Meal and drinks got comp'd but still. Over all, anywhere else is better than there. When they checked into the table, 3 out of 4 orders where wrong and it took awhile to fix that (even tho they were written down ) 


Will not be going back.
