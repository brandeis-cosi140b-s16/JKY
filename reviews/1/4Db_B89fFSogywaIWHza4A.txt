First off I love robertos I always come here drunk, sober etc lol. But this location is disgusting and dirty! When I got home and looked at my chicken tacos that I always get on Wednesday I was not pleased. It tasted like straight chemicals, I barely took two bites. My cat which eats anything and everything and usually loves robertos chicken would not eat it!!!! That says a lot. I will never come back to this location I'll continue to go to the fort Apache one. At least at that location they aren't rude either!
