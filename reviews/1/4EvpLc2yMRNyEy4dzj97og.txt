Friends insisted on going to Ajo Al's last night.  I begged NO.  How is this place still open in this day and age of great culinary restaurants and food trucks in Scottsdale?  

They serve cheese - processed cheese.  Every plate that comes out of the kitchen comes with a warning - careful the plates are extra hot . .  burning hot filled with huge portions of tasteless beans and rice.  Next to that - regardless of what you ordered . . is covered inside and out with processed, thick, gooey cheese . . .  YUCK!  

This was the "Mexican" I had in the '70s in Minnesota.  No flavor - terrible, watery salsa (served in a plastic bottle).  Same menu items from 1996.

If you have no desire to actually taste the food and want to put on 5 or more pounds in one sitting - this is your place!
