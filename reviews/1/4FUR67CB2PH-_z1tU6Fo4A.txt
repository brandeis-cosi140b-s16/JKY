From the outside and the ads I would have thought this place would have been great...service was good...food and beverages were lacking. My glass of sangria was a fail...the smallest glass of sangria I ever had. It was almost like a small glass of red wine with a piece of fruit thrown in as an after thought. My chili rellano was a fail. The pablano pepper wasn't even cooked all the way and the cheese wasn't melted. We will not return again.
