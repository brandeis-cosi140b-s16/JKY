This has gone thru some changes last time I've been here. Now you get metal silver ware and real plates but some how the food got worse. I got the # 7 green chili burro with rice and beans and a child's cheese crisp and my food was kinda gross!! The flour tortilla was not warm nor hot and the green chili looks like dog food.  The food is NOT good. Taco Bell is better than this place.
