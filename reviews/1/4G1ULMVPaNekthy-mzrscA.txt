I agree with I don't like paying for extra chips and asked for more bean dip and same thing have to pay. Our first cup of bean dip wasn't a 1/4 of a cup full. Now for the real problem. I ordered a margarita which my last sip had a fingernail clipping in it. I thought it was a piece of plastic at first. When I pulled it out of my mouth I discovered it was someone's fingernail. Been grossed out since last night. Will I go back? Not a chance. Serrenos gets my business.
