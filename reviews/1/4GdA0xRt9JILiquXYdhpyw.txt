Drive a couple extra minutes and go to Stephanie or Eastern.

We went there on Friday 10/17 around 8 PM. From the time we walked in, all the employees were scrambling around doing their side work to close up shop even though they closed two hours later. The young woman behind the counter making our food could not hear us multiple times, which is fine, but at least have a little common courtesy. The word "what?" came out of her mouth about 16 times throughout the time we ordered. She was unfamiliar with the menu and how to prepare the food. She turned my daughter's quesadilla into what looked like pile of regurgitated cheese, chicken, and flour tortilla. 

They said they had no steak for my burrito and I was not told they were making more or more was on its way. I doubt they ran out that early on a Friday night and I'm sure they were just simply too lazy to cook more. When we checked out, the girl at the register tried to charge us for two extra sides of chicken which were never ordered.

Inside and outside, the place looked a like a tornado tore through. Three of the tables still had trays with trash from previous guests that were there before. Both trash cans outside were overfilled with trash with some trash on the ground.

It wasn't a good experience for my family at all and I don't think it will change anytime soon. I'm going to Stephanie next time and recommend you go to another location also.
