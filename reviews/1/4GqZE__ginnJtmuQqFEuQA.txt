I just picked up a green chile burrito to eat and the office.  Opened up the container and I received a red chile burrito.  Not a big deal, I figured I would be fine until I bit into the first piece of meat which turned out to be fat.  After cutting a little further it was a big chunk of rock hard meat.  I don't ever throw food away but after two bites in the trash it went!
