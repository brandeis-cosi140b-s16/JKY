Solid breakfast burritos. Full of flavor, they don't skimp on the meat and potatoes. I also prefer tasting the tortilla and they deliver. My friend enjoyed hers too, but prefers more egg. Great to stop and go grab a quick bite after a hike. No need to feel underdressed...after writing all this a trip to the bathroom changed my feelings about coming here. A backed up, unmaintained rest room *barf* if that's how the public restroom is I can only wonder about the kitchen (where my thoughts go).
