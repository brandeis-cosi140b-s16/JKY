My husband and I have eaten here several times and have really enjoyed it, however after last night were not sure we'll go back. We were seated by a very nice hostess at a table right in front of the entrance to the kitchen (that wasn't the problem). We sat for a least ten minutes with buss boys and waitresses alike just walking past us. We finally asked if there was a waitress for our table? We had to ask for chips/salsa, then napkins and silverware,  a waitress finally came and took our order.  Ten to fifteen minutes later we had to ask if we could get our drinks. Our appetizer never came, then after we had sat there almost an hour...our meal came out, warm, not hot and not complete.  My father had one lone tamale sitting on his plate and asked the unapologetic waitress for the rest of his order...by the time it arrived, the rest of us had long been done. It all was so frustrating as we saw people being seated after us, getting their drinks and dinner and then their check and leaving and were just sitting there waiting. The sad part is we were sitting front and center of the staff and nobody seemed to notice or care. They are in desperate need of training and supervision by the owners/management if they want their businesses to thrive. Too bad, not sure we'll go back.
