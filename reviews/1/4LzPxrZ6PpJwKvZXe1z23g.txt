The one time we went here, we were served the "specialty drink" from a plastic pitcher that was left out on the counter (not made fresh, not even put in the fridge), our appetizer that was listed without meat (we had a vegetarian with us) had tons of chorizo on it when we got it, the waitstaff was flustered and disorganized, the food was small and overpriced (my dish was pretty decent, but not worth the $), and then to top it off, my friend found a hair in her food, and when she had it sent back to the kitchen, the manager (owner?) of the place came out and tried to accuse her or my wife of planting it ("that hair looked blonde and no one in the kitchen has blonde hair" ??!!!). Will never go back.
