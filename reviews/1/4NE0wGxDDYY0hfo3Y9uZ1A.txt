After having such a miserable experience, I feel socially obligated to post this review no later than 30 minutes after eating at Ocarnivores so that others do not suffer the same fate as myself.

In no particular order, let's count some ways that make this place the worst attempt to copy Chipotle ever:

1.) They were out of pico de gallo;
2.) They were out of lettuce;
3.) The food server picked the salsa and sour cream bottles out of a container with melted ice and the water from the bottle dripped all in the burritos and rice bowl as the items were poured;
4.) The food server continually touched the tortilla to her filthy shirt as she made the burrito;
5.) The food tasted stale and the salsa was not good;
6.) The bowl was almost the same price as Chipotle yet it was half the size;
7.) There weren't any other customers and the servers stared at me while I ate; and
8.) They didn't have any type of sign for visibility.

A $9 "meal for two" Groupon brought me here.  The pictures were grossly misrepresented on Groupon.

Without a doubt, save your time and money and avoid this place like the plague.  Some businesses truly deserve to fail and this is one of them.
