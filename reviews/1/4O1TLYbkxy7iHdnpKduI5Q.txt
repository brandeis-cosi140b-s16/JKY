I had an absolutely nauseating experience at Mucho Gusto.  I dined there a couple of years ago and had a pleasant experience, so I was pretty confident a repeat visit would be the same.  I was wrong.  The waitress was very rushed and seemed like she had some other place she wanted or needed to be.  The posole my boyfriend ordered was not even lukewarm.  When he asked if it was supposed to be cold, she just hurried away and sometime later plopped a new one down in front of him.  The worst part of the evening is when I pulled a huge, red hair out of my mouth that had been mixed up in my salad.  I called the rushed waitress over and showed her what I had pulled out of my mouth.  She simply grabbed the plate, hurried off and plopped a new salad down in front of me.  I then stopped her and explained I had completely lost my appetite and asked her to take the food.  She returned, dropped the check and said "It's half off" and hurried away again.  Feeling like they were trying to dismiss the situation and not actually correct it, I asked for the manager.  He simply reiterated that he had taken fifty percent off of our bill.  I couldn't believe this was considered a satisfactory solution to such a disgusting mistake on their part.  I think if you're sickened by an experience due to the restaurant's negligence, you shouldn't have to pay for that repulsive experience.  I will not be returning to Mucho Gusto a third time.
