Don't come here. At least for a few months. I've been in this drive thru line for a long time. Finally, when it was my time to order, the worker informed me that they don't have the normal "Del Taco" menu because they're new!  What?  Then why are you open. Thankfully I convinced the cars behind me to back out!
