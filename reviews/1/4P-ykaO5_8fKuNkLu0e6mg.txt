Overpriced and frankly it was gross. I got the surf and turf burrito; everything came from a steam pan so nothing was actually hot just lukewarm and when they added on the half cup of guacamole, it all turned lukewarm. And really, who wants that much guacamole on their burrito. The tortilla wasn't even warmed before making the burrito. The chips... oh the chips. Remember that horrible "baked" chip fad that hit the country in the mid 90's? Well apparently Zaba's bought out the stock when that product went under. Cardboard. It was basically salted cardboard. I could forgive cheap and disgusting chips if the salsa was any good but unfortunately the fresh salsa sucked. The tomatoes were translucent and looked like they had been frozen at some point and salsa verde was flavorless and disappointing. After spending $30 on a burrito, fish tacos, two chips and salsas and two sodas, I took about 6 bites (I gave it a fair shot) and then went next door to Panda Express. If you want good, fresh, Mexican food, this is not the place. If you want a crappy knock off of chipotle with higher prices than by all means, try Zaba's.
