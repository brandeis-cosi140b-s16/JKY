This is the second time I am leaving this restaurant before ordering.  The service is terrible.  Wait staff is very snotty and when we told the manager we were leaving because they could not accommodate an elderly customer they charged us for the two iced teas and a soda ... Terrible service.  And then we had to wait to pay.
