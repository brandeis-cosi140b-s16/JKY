Went into this taco place awhile back because of the Yelp reviews. I was very excited to try it out. Went in and the employees were friendly. Customer service is there. That all went away while waiting an hour plus for my order and being told that it took that long because they had a phone order. And having customers who ordered after me get their food before me. I honestly think they forgot my order and tried to cover it up by saying it took that long because of a phone order. Food was ok. Same as all the other cheap Mexican places. The wait ruined my experience.
