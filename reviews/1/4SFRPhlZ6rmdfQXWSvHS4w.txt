Friends recommended this eatery. We got there before the dinner rush and got our name on the list with a wait time of 15 minutes. As we were waiting (only two of us) they kept taking parties of two, three and more and left us waiting. After almost 30 minutes and other folks who came in after us, we left and went to Que Mas. Will not be going back.
