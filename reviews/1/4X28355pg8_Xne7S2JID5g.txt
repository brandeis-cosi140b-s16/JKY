We came to this zabas after receiving a bogo coupon in the mail. We enjoy Mexican food so we thought we'd give it a try. I'd eaten at the zabas inside of the  Plaza hotel before and I thought it was decent at best. We arrived 10 minutes after 8pm and we were turned away immediately and in a rude fashion. What kind of fast food restaurant closes at 8pm in Las Vegas?!? I wouldn't eat at zabas when the direct competition us by far better. Bad service, bad hours, mediocre food.
