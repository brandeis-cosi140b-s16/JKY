The day before eating at the Providence Rd location, I ate the same luncheon steak fajitas at the Greenville, SC, OnThe Border location. There was no comparison in the two experiences.  Greenville was fantastic in every way. Providence Rd in Charlotte was a fiasco from start to finish. We didn't get chips and salsa when seated. It took forever to receive sour cream that we'd asked to go along with them. The waitress failed to bring my husband's salad until after his main course when we reminded her. She dropped my tortillas for the fajitas and I didn't receive replacements until after she helped two other tables and the steak was cold. The steak was a small amount of stringy, dried-up, gray pieces of meat on a cold plate whereas in G'ville it was a generous serving of thick strips of medium rare meat sizzling on a hot to the touch one.  We had to ask and wait for refills on drinks.  When we finally were able to pay the bill, with apologizes for the service, she then forgot to return my husband's credit card and had to go hunt for it saying she found it on the floor. I love On The Border and we do not have one in our home town but sadly we will never visit this location, that we do pass from time to time, again.
