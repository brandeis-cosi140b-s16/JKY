Would give a 0 if I could. Went here at 12 to the drive thru and the lazy worker tells me through the drive thru after I order that they don't have cheese or beef. Literally everything on their menu food wise has cheese and/or beef. Obviously he didn't want to make anything before they closed ... AN HOUR FROM WHEN THEY WERE CLOSING. 

Ghetto cashier saying "waddup" through the speaker phone too. 

Don't come here.....
