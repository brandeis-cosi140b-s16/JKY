Federico's is occupying the old El Polo Loco in the Sam's Club area between Ray and Chandler on the Chandler side of I-10.

The food is bland, an expensive for what you get. They even charge an additional $0.50 for self-serve chips.

I was going to give them a second chance, using a Val-Pak coupon on my iPhone's Passbook App, but they refused to honor the offer as it wasn't printed out. Telling me the coupon states it must be printed, when in fact it didn't state that.

For less money, and better food, head east on Chandler to Espos, north on I-10 to Original Burrito Company, or west on Chandler to Fillibertos.
