I recently visited Frank & Lupes in Old Town Scottsdale for a dinner with friends, and was very disappointed with the experience.  During the evening, our service was quite slow and erratic.  Our party was charged for small servings of chips and salsa, which they brought to our table before we ordered anything.  Some in our party were surprisingly charged for premium alcohol even though they ordered house/well quality.  Even worse, the salsa we were served was watery and of overall poor quality.  We had friends at another table, and they echoed the same sentiments.  

I will not be returning to this restaurant ever again!!  All diners are forewarned!!
