I'm a picky eater with almost all my foods, I just wanted a bean beef and cheese burrito. My girlfriend asked if there's onions and peppers in it the girl at the register assured us that there was not. My burrito was ordered and my girlfriend had ordered a carne asada burrito and we left. 

After arriving home I open the box and there's a few soggy chips in there, I take a bite and it's riddled with peppers and onions. After a 4 hour drive home, and stopping for a quick food pickup on my way the last thing I wanted to do was get in my car and go back so I tried picking it all out, I soon gave up. My girlfriend was far from impressed by her burrito too.  

So I think with this being a $16 waste of money that makes us one time customers. Unfortunately.
