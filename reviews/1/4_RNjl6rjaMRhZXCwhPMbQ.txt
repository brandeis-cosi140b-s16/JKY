I am not impressed with this Moe's restaurant!! There was old food dripped around the edges of the food bar, and I saw the employees push the old food back into the fresh food instead of cleaning it up and throwing it away. The salsa bar is also never full and rarely clean. The management needs to get a handle on this restaurant! I understand it is fairly new, but the employees and managers really could do a better job maintaining cleanliness. I live in fort mill and I pass by this Moe's to go to the Rock Hill location because the food is fresher and the staff is more organized and friendlier. I was really excited for the Fort Mill Moe's to open, but I do not want to spend anymore money there until the service picks up. They're are a lot of great Mexican restaurants in Fort Mill and Moe's has a lot to compete with. I love Moe's so I really hope this location steps their game up!
