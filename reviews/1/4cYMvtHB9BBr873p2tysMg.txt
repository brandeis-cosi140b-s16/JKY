It use to be good, however now it is overpriced and not good. I live literally across the street and when I got my food home it was cold. The Carne Asada in my burrito was cold and even the cheese in the enchiladas wasn't even melted! Staff was very unfriendly and I paid $20 for two combo meals.  I would rather go to Taco Bell at this point. Good thing we live in Phoenix where there is more choices.  Quite a shame.
