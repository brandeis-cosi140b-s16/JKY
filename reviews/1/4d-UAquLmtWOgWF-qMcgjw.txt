Meeting for Brunch today We were seated after the hostess was having a lengthy conversation with a coworker.
We ordered the Carnitas Hash and a order of street tacos.
My meal arrived and after waiting for a few minutes for the other meal to arrive I proceeded to start eating my meal. After quite a while we had to ask where the other meal was and please see why it hadn't arrived.  I'd like to preface that the restaurant was not busy at all.  Finally the tacos arrived.  My Carnitas Hash was swimming in grease.  Will not be returning as there are so many other restaurants that have excellent food and great service.
