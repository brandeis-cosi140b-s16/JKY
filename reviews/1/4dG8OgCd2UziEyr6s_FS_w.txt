My cousins and I eat out often and have eaten at Los Dos in many of the locations over the years so decided to go to the new one on Camelback.  Bad mistake.  Walk in the place is a din of noise.  We were seated promptly four of us, one menu.  Took forever for a waiter to return with , one more menu.  Finally the waiter returns took our order and service was pretty quick for the food to get to us.  I had posole which actually was tasty but would have been a lot better if it had been hot, it was just luke warm.  No time did our waiter ever return to fill ice tea glasses, and finally when we were  done he did return and fortunately did not ask how it was.  We had to ask twice for a carry home box.  The salsa of Los Dos is gone replaced by some gringo salsa.  The food is fair not great.  The service terrible.  Ambiance great.  Noise level high.  Worth trying again....nope.  Many people at different tables were complaining of getting no service.  I will await to see what moves in here because Los Dos is not long for this world at this location.
