This place is a joke. I should've known from the start with the  V8 salsa that I should've spent my lunch hour and money elsewhere. The "veggie" burrito only has lettuce, tomatos and rice - oh, and V8 sauce on top. If you want a REAL veggie burrito... go to Loco Lime in Huntersville. Best Mexican cuisine I've had in a long time. I was unable to give less than 1 star for this place, by the way.
