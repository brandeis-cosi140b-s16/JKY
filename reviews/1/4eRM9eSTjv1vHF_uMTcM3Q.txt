Total let down! We went to the N 16th st. store, FYI, so if you are going to try don't do that one.  Nice modern interior - so no complaints about that - the food was just super underwhelming.  This place is said to be a triple D hit, but I think Guy Fieri may have been a bit off this time.  Chips and salsa were meh, the taco's were not very flavorful (so once again, meh) and my boyfriend burrito was kinda dry and bland.  Everything had to be doused in hot sauce to make kinda ok.  We were so pumped to try this place after all the great reviews.  I recommend don't waste the precious real estate in your stomach on a meal here.
