Food was pretty good but service was horrid. Came in a big group and they lost one of our orders, didn't tell us for 45 minutes, when they finally brought our food an hour and a half after we got there, they forgot another persons order. All without a single apology. Then the waitress spilled a pitcher of water on my purse and just said "sorry" and walked away. No napkins or anything. It was one of the worst service experiences I've ever received.
