Wow, this place sucks. While waiting for our table, we were repeatedly ignored by the bartender. We must have appeared too we'll groomed in contrast to the rest of the patronage. 

We had a party of 8. After all the food was dumped on the table, the W. Va. hick that was serving us came over to me and said, "you must not have ordered", which I certainly did because, that day, I had only eaten an apple and I was starving.  I do love it when I am assigned blame for a service mistake by my waitress.  

So, at that point, I decided to forgo a meal and just have tequila - to kill the pain of listening to the insolent and aggressively poor-performing waitress and to help me better assess next steps for the evening. I ordered a shot for me and the guy next to me. She asked if I wanted salt and a lime. I said no. The shots came with salt and a lime.  Worse, I think the "shots" may have been premixed margaritas without ice.  They were certainly not the Cuervo that we had requested. So, I asked for two Patron shots, which were just what the doctor ordered. 

After action assessment in brief - worst service I have had in years, maybe ever - can't even get tequila right - horrible patronage (could have been some LA5 gang members in there) - can't assess food because I was never given any, but chips were ok. 

Recommendation - 1) don't go - 2) if you have to go, order a shot of Patron immediately - 3) make sure you get some food 

The combination of food and Patron will dull the pain.
