I have been to Loco Patron a handful of times, the food and service have always been mediocre at best. The only thing it has going for it, is that, it is dead on Thursday nights to watch Thursday night football.  This past Thursday (12/4/14) was no expectation. Let me just say, that I have been in the service industry my whole adult life. I've done everything from washing dishes,  hosting, serving, and bartending. I get it. Off days happen. I don't think this was the case.  Our server was....awful. She barely acknowledged us and was inconvenienced to tell us what beers were on draft. When our good arrived, 75% of the orders were wrong. Instead of shredded beef, we all got ground beef. Not a big deal. I'm still going to eat it, but she never came by to ask how everything was. We sat there with empty beer glasses and greasy ground beef. When she saw that we were finished with our food, she handed us our tab and never cleared the table. We paid our bill and apparently she couldn't wait for us to leave to pick up the back book. She opened it up in front of us before we even had a chance to sign the slip. I have NEVER written a bad review before and NEVER tipped less the 20%. I just think that bad service and attitudes shouldn't be enabled. Oh and I forgot to mention the ear piercing full bass techno music that was playing  during the game. Sure it's the bears and the cowboys, I personally could care less, but those are somebody else's teams that want to hear what's going on.  Come on Loco Patron, get it together!
