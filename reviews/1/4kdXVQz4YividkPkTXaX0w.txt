This place really isn't good at all...I ordered a ground beef burrito.  I don't like rice in my burrito, so the guy making it said do you want double beans then?  Umm no I don't, then he proceeded to give me a tiny spoonful of dried out ground beef.  I added queso, Pico, hot (strange flavor salsa) and shredded cheese!  All I can it say is that this $8.45 burrito was pure slop.  The canned beans are flavorless, the ground beef and lack thereof was a joke.  Again just not good at all.  The place seems to run by a bunch of very lazy young Hispanic employees who don't grasp the concept of a clean restaurant, or replenishing the steam table with fresh ingredients.  Pancheros and Chipotle certainly blow this place out of the water!  How this place stays open is beyond me!
