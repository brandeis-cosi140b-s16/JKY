Our family loves Caf√© Rio. This review has nothing to do with the food (which is great), but everything to do with the service. We had placed an online order that was to be picked up at a specific time. When we arrived, precisely at that specified time, we were told that the order was not ready. I waited and watched as several other online orders were filled, despite having shown up after me. 45 min later, (yes, 45 min later!!) we were given our food. I could have stood in line 2-3 times and still gotten our food faster. Needless to say, we will never go to this location again.
