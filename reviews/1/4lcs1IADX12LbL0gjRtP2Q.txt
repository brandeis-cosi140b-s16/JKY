I've tried this place multiple times and there's no consistency. First time I visited, their street tacos and side salsa were delicious. 2nd time around, the street tacos were filled with fatty meat and honestly were the most disgusting thing I've ever tasted. Third time wasn't a charm as the people cooking were so preoccupied in their conversation my meal took over 20 minutes to be cooked and once again wasn't anything to write home about.

Needless to say, will not be visiting, and be aware this place always has flies flying around the tables while you wait for food... yum
