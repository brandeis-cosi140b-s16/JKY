We decided to try out La Ristra this past week. The restaurant itself is very nice. Love the decor, colors, tables, etc. The location itself is mainly what earned it the 1 star.

Our server was ok. Both my partner and I opted for the 2 entree combo meals. I had the machaca enchilada and green pork tamale. My partner had a taco and enchilada. The chips and salsa were really good, minus the mild salsa. The mild salsa had too much of a tomato taste to it. 

As far as the entrees go, we were not asked if we wanted red or green for the enchiladas. The server did not seem educated on the whole idea of red and green from New Mexico. I had to ask which chile sauce came on my enchilada, as I wanted green.

The actual meal itself was very bland. I don't know if it was an off night...but if not they need to add some flavor. The only thing you tasted from the green sauce was spice. (Which I do like spicy!) The machaca was tough and not tender as it should be. The beans and rice were absolutely flavorless. Our bill was outrageous for just mediocre food. We could've gone somewhere and had a meal full of flavor for how much we paid.
