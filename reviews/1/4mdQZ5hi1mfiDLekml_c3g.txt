This place sucks balls. It really does. We only stopped in because we needed something quick to eat. I go the shredded beef taco bowl or whatever the hell it was. My fiance go the bean burritos or whatever the hell it was. When I say, "Whatever the hell it was", I mean that it SUCKED and it was not the most generic mexican food I have ever ever eaten. This place should be shut down because they are lying. They should just replace them with a TACO BELL.
