I'm very disappointed after dinning at this restaurant.  The decor and layout was nice, but the food failed to deliver on taste.
Dish 1- guacamole with lump crab and key lime: not enough lime nor cilantro, crab pieces doesn't have the seafood taste to it (fail)
Dish 2 - crispy calamari with sweet chile, chile, sesame and lime: the calamari pieces were drenched in the sweet chile sauce, which was extremely sweet, that I can't taste the chile nor the lime (fail)
Dish 3 - Korean beef Taco with soy, sake, sesame, and kimchee: I was expecting sliced BBQ Kalbi beef. But instead, it was a kind of pulled pork style beef.  Doesn't taste that bad, but no Korean style by any standard (not bad)
Dish 4 - Kimchi fried rice: there was no kimchee to be found in the whole dish. It tastes like Chinese fried rice with a lot of mushrooms. It lacked the red chile flavor that is in all kimchee fried rice. Super salty as well.(Epic fail)
Dish 5 - Pad Thai Al Pastor: again, not authentic at all. Noodle wasn't cook all the way through. Very salty as well. ( so so)
Dish 6 - Vietnamese style shaking beef: I have to honestly say that it was delicious; however, $24 for 8 little pieces of beef was a little pricey even for Scottsdale (yum)
Desserts: mochi: store bought so nothing to say yay or nat about.  There were 4 dishes that I wanted to order and was told are out. I was here at 8 on a Saturday night. Hmmmm.... Overall, I give it 2 out of 5.
