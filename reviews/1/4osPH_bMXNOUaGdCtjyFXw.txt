This place is next to Hell's Half Acre so I believe they should rename it Hell Hole because that is what this place resembles. I went into this place because of the signage outside the restaurant that mentioned their happy hour currently being served. After being seated, I waited for twenty minutes before I got up and had to ask for service. After being greeted, I was informed there was no happy hour despite the multiple signs advertising it. The food took forever and was not very good. The quesadilla was a tortilla with a piece of cheese in it. The menu said it had guacamole but mine did not come with anything on it. The tortilla and slice of cheese cost about 11 dollars. This place is a disaster and they do not seem to care.
