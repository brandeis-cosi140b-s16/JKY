Went in at 6 PM on Tuesday and the restaurant was mostly empty. We were a group of three.

The first thing the waitress tells us is the price on the menus are wrong by "two or three dollars" because they just updated their computers. OK, I guess I could deal with that.

We proceed to order 1 appetizer and 3 dinners. After 20 minutes, the appetizers and two dinners come. We pray before we eat, and when we informed the waitress we were told it would be 20 MORE minutes. 

When I asked to speak to the manager, I was told there was only one chef on duty, which she conceded was her problem. 

The food, particularly the cheese quessidiia was terrible. The rest was edible but sub par.

This was probably the first time in 25 years I left zero tip. My normal range is between 22 and 30 percent, based on food, service and friendliness. 

I'll never return.
