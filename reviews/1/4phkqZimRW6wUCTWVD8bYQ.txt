I went here for dinner last night ordered take out for myself and my wife. I ordered a Red Chile chimichanga and my wife ordered the Lisa taco salad also I got a large hot sauce. The Red Chimichanga meat was tough and the red sauce was refrigerator cold the Red Chile tasted like it was made from a mix. My wife's taco salad had old wilted pieces of lettuce in it, and the hot sauce was way watered down if you dipped a chip in it without using a spoon there would by no hot sauce on the chip. all of this for $ 30.00
best part of meal was cheese crisp and plain chips. What happened to the old Matta's used be the best Mexican food in Mesa Taco Bell taste better than this.
