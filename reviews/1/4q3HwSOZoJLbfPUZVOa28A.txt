Me and my friend came here to support a local business vs. going to a chain restaurant. The waitresses didn't know anything about anything on the menus. I guess they're new.

My entree was 3 eggs, burnt at the bottom, raw on top (how did they do that?)

These eggs were on top of a pound of soggy tortilla chips in verde sauce with bits of sour cream floating around. not a joke. I tried eating it, I think I got through 2 eggs and a few spongy chips in my mouth before I stopped.

The waitress told me that it's because this is 'real' Mexican food. I'd bet the entire 10% off coupon she gave me before I left that it's not.
