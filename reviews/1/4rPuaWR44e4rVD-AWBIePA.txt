This place use to be reasonable for good authentic mexican food. My past 4 visits have been disappointing! The company seems to be getting greedier each time. The positions of rice have become very small and the food quality is bland. If you ask for a preparada the beer is $5.00 and u pay another $5.00 for the tomato juice, which is just ridiculous. I also asked for a small side of a spicier salsa, they said it would be $3.00! Seriously! Never coming back!
