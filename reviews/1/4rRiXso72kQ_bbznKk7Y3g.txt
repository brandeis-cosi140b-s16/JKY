my review has been deleted, and my review explains my exact previous meal here. I'm only speaking the truth, not trying to talk trash just to ruin this restaurants reputation or no reason. They literally need to restart from the ground up. have you ever seen the movie The Waiting, will this is the place in real life. My father sent his food back because it was cold, and he told her to put it in the microwave and not to spit in it (no joke) she laughed and said, " What do you think this is the movie Waiting"???? I ordered the street tacos because it was there signature dish, it was incredibly cold and had a bunch of unedible fat. Thirty minutes after i ate i had the worst pain in my stomach and threw up consistently through the night ( end of the weekend for me. not half as bad as when we were playing pool and we saw a waiter with two plungers in one hand and cheese dip in the other hand leaving the kitchen and stopping thorugh the bathroom first!!! man how does the health department not shut this forsaken place down.
