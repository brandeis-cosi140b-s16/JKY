They take so long to make your order, I waited about 20 minutes and watch other people wait long as well. Not only that, they take so long just to mess up your order. Oh, and when you go through drive-thru, check your food. My order was wrong and I've called 5 times, still no answer. Is it that hard to answer a phone?!
