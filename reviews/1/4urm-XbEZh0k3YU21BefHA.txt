I wish I could give this place 0 stars. I repeated my order multiple times and still got mixed up. I asked for a chile relleno burrito and they gave me a pork and rice burrito. Soooo pissed. The meat was trash. This place has become the Mexican version of McDonald's, the quality of ingredients are terrible. Order a side of chips and watch them dissolve a day later in their container.
