When we first went here about a year ago, the food was good, decent portions, ok service.  Over the next few months, it all went downhill.  The restaurant got dirty, as mentioned by other reviewers, the waitstaff got a bad attitude, and the food was no longer very good....small portions, burnt or undercooked.  So we haven't been back in about 4 months and will not go back again.
