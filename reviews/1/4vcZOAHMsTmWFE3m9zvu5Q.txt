Waited in line for 30min!! Finally get to the front of the line then all of a sudden the girl leaves and we had to wait even more just to place our order!! Not organized at all! We decided to leave and cross the street to chipotle! We weren't the only ones that left they were other people behind us and left to!! I will never go back! Sucks cuz we didn't even taste the food just the customer service ruined it!
