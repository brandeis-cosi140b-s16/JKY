No! 
Service was fairly rude, to begin with. Then the food was just bad. I ordered the sweet pork barbacoa and, yes, it is sweet. VERY, VERY SWEET. It tasted like meat candy. Then, on the side I got a helping of hard rice. It was probably 5-10 from being fully cooked. 
No desire to come back here. Why do people love this place?
