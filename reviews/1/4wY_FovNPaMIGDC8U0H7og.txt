Let's get straight to the point--I've never experienced such bad Mexican food.  I'm not a diva, and I'm puzzled why this place gets 4 stars.  I'll give it one star for a nice space--and it might be a good place for a drink--but low quality and bland Mexican food in AZ makes me sad.  

It doesn't help that the service was very slow and indifferent, however, I can put up with a lot for some simple, soul-warming Mexican food.  Not even close here...

Not a single person at my large table liked their food nor finished their plate.  Even the two east coasters (with low standards) said this place was surprisingly bad.  

I got the Chile Verde, and instead of the slow cooked meat one would normally get at a decent Mex food place--I got chunks of hard cubed pork with green sauce thrown together in a saut√© pan.  Companions complained of bland and dry chicken and beef in their chimis.

Sorry, if this is the best there is in the neighborhood, but if so, I'm driving half an hour to Los Dos Molinas in Mesa.
