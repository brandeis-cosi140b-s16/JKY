Bland, boring, "Mexican-esque" food. 

Warning sign #1: all white people dining there.
Warning sign #2: salsa that's bland as ketchup
Warning sign #3: no hot sauces on the table

The three of us each had a different item from the lunch specials. Yet our plates looked almost indistinguishable from one another. On each was some configuration of flour tortillas, mountains of shredded iceberg lettuce, and a slick of pale refried beans, all topped with  orange cheese.

You can get more flavorful "Mexican" food at Del taco. This place is more like Mexican't food. Ulgh. I want my $5.25 back.
