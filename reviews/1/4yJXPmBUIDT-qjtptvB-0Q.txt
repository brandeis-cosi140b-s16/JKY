I was so excited to come here after reading all the reviews. Gosh was I disappointed!! I ordered combo #1 and only the rice and taco was edible - the enchiladas were terrible. I also ordered guacamole which was disgusting and I could tell it was old. Don't come here! Azteca beats this place all to heck. Sure wish I could find a good Mexican restaraunt here!!
