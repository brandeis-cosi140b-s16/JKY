Service was terrible, I was waiting in line with 2 girl friends when the bouncer strolled by and complained about my sneakers when everyone else was wearing sneakers such as mine. I felt totally discriminated , I'm no college muscle head jock so maybe I didn't fit in, lucky for the bouncer the oink patrol was there so my 2nd degree blackbelt and boxing background didn't have to be used to shame his ignorance and lack of respect.
