My grand-daughter and I recently had lunch at the West charleston location.  There must of been 6 to 8 employees standing around doing nothing,  We placed our order and proceeded to sit down by the window.  The stainless steel? were streaked and dirty.  My grandaughter went and got wet/dry napkins, washed the table down and dried it.  We then sat down to eat.  The employee's will still talking.  It's near a college  I don't think this would be acceptable to college students either, although I can't speak for them.  It was the first and last time for us. No more.  Just a warning to others.
