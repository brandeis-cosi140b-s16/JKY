I stopped by this location tonight to pick up dinner for someone and they were surprisingly nice. Normally in the drive through they are sneaking "meows" in or other teenage jokes. Although annoying, it is not enough to stop me from going to the convenient location 3 minutes from my house. Tonight was a different story. While eating the bean burrito I picked up, the person stopped chewing and I asked what was wrong, assuming the messed up again and put onion in his no onion bean burrito. When he finally put his fingers up to his lips and pulled out a piece of metal from his mouth I was shocked. He immediately threw the other food away, which was over half of everything I had picked up. I am thankful that he felt the metal before he swallowed it. I didn't even bother going up to complain because the location is run by immature 16 year olds who would have laughed it off and given me a new burrito.
