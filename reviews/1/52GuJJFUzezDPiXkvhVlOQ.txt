So I figured out why this place has 5 from one and 1 from another.... 

It is owned ny our friends up North. Yep The super nice yet bland group we call Canadians. They have created a tourist trap that appeals to tourist and lovers of SW crap. 

LOL

Here is a copy of the business plan. 

Lets create a super nice place that attracts people to it, eah? (cuz they end the sentence with a question)
But we do know anything about Mexican food?
Lets make it so neat just to be in the place that we will get by on our looks? Eah?
OKAAY... make sure the drinks are good.
