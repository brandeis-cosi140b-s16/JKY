I came to Manuel's at 3:00pm for a margarita and a moment to myself. 
The restaurant was dead. I walked in and saw no staff, waited 3 minutes and started walking around.... Found the staff hanging out in a booth on phones and hanging out. 
Finally I was seated with a menu. 11 minutes later (purse in hand ready to leave) my waitress asks what I want to drink, gets my margarita wrong and has to return it. An employees on break comes outside by me, plops down and starts listening to loud music on her phone and signing. The most unprofessional staff! 
My "steak" tacos tasted like beef jerky.
-I will never be back.
