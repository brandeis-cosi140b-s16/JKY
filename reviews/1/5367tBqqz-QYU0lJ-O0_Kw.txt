Roaches crawling  around like they work there  and maybe they should  considering  the dirty looks  and cold  reception  you get from the cashiers, along side the shit talking  in Spanish cause they think you don't understand. Not to mention  the cooks who cook your food first  if your Mexican  rather  than the order it was received and for some reason  there is some sort of ticket booth in there dispite  how small it already is . This booth would be better  placed if at all in the outer  dining area  where the is more room.
