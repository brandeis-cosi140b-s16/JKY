Never had a worse experience at a Cafe Rio ever and I've been eating there for over 10 years. Walked in at 5:50 and didn't get my food until 6:27 and there were FIVE people in front of me in line. Staff was openly complaining about having to work on Halloween, picking up stuff off the ground with same gloves as handling food, ran out of all kinds of food by 6:30, kept burning things, food was scattered all over the place. They even let people come in the door about 6:15 and then told them at 6:30 they were closed. Whoever owns this one should never be allowed to own another one!
