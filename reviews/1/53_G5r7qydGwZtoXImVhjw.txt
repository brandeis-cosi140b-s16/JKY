The worst moe's ever. Rice was burnt and it permeated through the whole rice bowl. Service wasn't stellar and even some of the staff looked like they didn't care to be there - and it wasn't even 1pm! Wouldn't have even served the burnt rice to anybody. Unfortunately it probably should have been thrown out. It basically ruined the entire bowl. I did what I could to pick out the chicken and beans. In the words of the father eating Nacho Libre's cooking, "This is the worst meal I have ever had." I just hope I won't have "diarrheas since Easters."
