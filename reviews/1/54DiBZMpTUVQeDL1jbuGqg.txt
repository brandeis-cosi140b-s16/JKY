I LOVE fast Mexican food! I had such high hopes for this place.  I'm trying not to comment on the ridiculous wait for a fast food Mexican joint since it's only been open  2 days.  But we waited 35 mins, we wanted it that bad.  We ordered the Pollo Asado and the Machaca burritos.  SO disappointed.  They were tasteless and unsatisfying.

Pollo Asada:
-Boiled Chicken wrapped in a flour tortilla
-No flavor
-No other fillings
-Measly amount of chicken

Machaca:
-Onions, green bell peppers and shredded boiled beef
-Flavorless beef
-Measly amount of filling.. more tortilla than filling

We won't be returning anytime soon.  So sad.
