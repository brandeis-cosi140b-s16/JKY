After living in Las Vegas for 35 years I was not the only one to mourn the closing of El Sombrero. So I was obviously pleased to see it reopen. Went with friends on a Saturday Eve. No reservation but not needed since there were only 2 parties of 4 and 2 parties of 2 (including us). Regardless of the small crowd the service was so bad we finally decided that the owner must have been serving since there he was the only one there and it was obvious he had never been trained for waiting tables. I ordered the stuffed chil with "brisket". It came without the brisket which everyone except the waiter heard me order. It was stuffed with what seemed like cream of squash soup and had a cup of dry, flavor-free rice on the side with no sauce or cheese. Friends had quesadilla. Hard to mess up, right? Wrong! It came out greasy and pan fried, burnt like an over done grill cheese sandwich. We collectively decided that this was the worst Mexican restaurant any of us had been to. Call it "upscale", "chic", "bistro", as some reviews state but as the saying goes..."If it ain't broke, don't fix it, sell it". Really miss the old place. Worst was not over since me and 1 other member of are party got sick a few hours later. That prompted me to contact Health Dept. Something I have not done to a restaurant in over 20 years.
Only upside was the comic relief provided by the unattended hostess stand outside front door. Anyone from Vegas knows that the only foot traffic in that area is transients and tweakers. Very unsafe area especially after dark.
