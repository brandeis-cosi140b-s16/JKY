Rude staff. Andrea and Eric. The barbacoa in my bowl was cold and chewy, I just asked for some freshly made meat which they denied me. They stuck the thermometer in the meat and we're like "no, the meat is fine." I got eye rolls from ALL of the staff when simply asking for food that wouldn't make me sick. I got a refund on my card but no other compensation.
