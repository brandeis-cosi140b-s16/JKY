There is no way this restaurant should be classified as Mexican.

The good stuff first: I came here because of the location - it's one of the few restaurants that have an open patio on the strip. Great for people watching and checking out the Bellagio fountains.

Now the bad stuff: the food sucks. I felt like tacos and the server recommended the grilled fish tacos. He said they were really popular. I like fish tacos so I went with his recommendation. When I got my plate, there was a huge side of disgusting goopy fried beans (I had asked if they were black beans), oddly dry and favourless fried rice, and 2 very sad looking fish tacos. The tacos consisted of a thin strip of cold dry fish jerky with some shreds of lettuce and tomatoes. I managed to eat one taco and a few scoops of rice because I was hungry and left everything else on my place. The server took my plate away and didn't even ask about my meal. I really should have complained but I was just too tired to even deal with it.

I might come back for drinks on the patio but I would be scared to try their food again!!
