I will just hit the highlights: 

Ordered the carne asada chimichanga with rice & beans. All of my food was room temperature when it came out. As a side note, I've never seen carne asada meat cut so big. They were each sized like pieces you'd cut off a steak. 

After forcing down half of the chimi I sent the entire plate back to the kitchen. Ultimately it was removed from our bill. 

The waitress brought one of their regular heavy-bottomed glasses to the table for my 6-year old. She also filled my drink so full that it dribbled all over the table as she was handing it across to me instead of walking to my side and setting it down. 

The sopapillas were flat, thick, and very bubbly like fry bread, not light and thin with one big pocket on the inside.
