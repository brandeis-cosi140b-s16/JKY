Terrible! I had family in town and they said that their friends wanted to go there. I had never heard of it and was making other suggestions, but the friends insisted they go there all the time, know the owners, food's great, etc.
We called ahead because we had a party of 8 and still we waited 15 minutes to be seated. There were dirty glasses of ice water at each place and we could barely get into our seats because the tables were pushed so close together. The chips were stale, unsalted and not homemade and the salsa was unimpressive; one was red and runny with minimal flavor, while the other had huge chunks of stewed tomatoes and a spark of spice. As we were browsing the menu, a waitress came up and asked if we were done with our menus because more people had come in and they didn't have enough...The guacamole was smothered in shredded cheeses and not made at the table, the soup had elbow macaroni and the second round of margaritas came in hot glasses (like they had just come out of the dishwasher). Our meals were disappointing, but we knew they that because there was nothing extraordinary to begin with. The pricing was fair, but the extra 20 minutes it took to get the bill was completely unacceptable. I'll pass next time!
