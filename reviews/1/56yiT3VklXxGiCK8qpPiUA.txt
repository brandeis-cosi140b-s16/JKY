Great atmosphere, decor, and hostess.
Poorly trained servers and food was only tolerable.  I expected prices to be higher in this location, and they are, but the food quality was lacking.  There's no way the carne asada was marinated before burning it on the charcoal.  Beans were runny and lacked salt.  Chips could have been store bought, thus the extremely small quantity served to the table.  It annoys me that there's "only one free refill on soda"; maybe OK for the bar, but for the dining area?
