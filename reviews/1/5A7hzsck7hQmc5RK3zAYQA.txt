RATS!!! See the manager's 'appology' , Hell,he didn't even visit our table on our less than acceptable experience and he never followed up on his promise via e-mail to take care of us with a discount next time we come in. We still haven't received anything even though I gave him our address. Apparently they could care less although they feel a need to do the requisite "lip service" giving the illusion they are concerned. I've been coming here since they opened the Ahwatukee location and it was a favorite haunt for drinks after hitting 18 at Ahwatukee CC. No more for me, my family and anyone else I remember to tell about our experience
