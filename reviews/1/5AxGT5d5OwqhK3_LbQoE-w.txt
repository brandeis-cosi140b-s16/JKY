I've been here a few times as it seems more authentic than Chipotle or Taco Bell.  The food is fairly disappointing though - very stodgy and not very fresh.

On my last visit I came away with awful food poisoning.  It took me two days in bed and a $155 doctor's bill to recover.  Needless to say in future I'll be going to Chipotle instead.
