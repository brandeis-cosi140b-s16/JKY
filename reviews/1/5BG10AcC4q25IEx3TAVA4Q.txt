This was the poorest excuse for Mexican food that I have ever had.  In this area, there are many family run places that are authentic.  Not only did we not finish our meals, we didn't even bring them home.  I had the combo plate with a chili relleno and tamale.  The "relleno" was a large omelet with 2-2" pieces of plain poblano tucked inside then covered with way too much cheese (I guess so that you couldn't tell that it was an omelet?).  The tamale was an extremely thick coating of masa with very dry meat.  I had to use the salsa to moisten it.  My husband's chimichanga was the same overly dry meat.  The guacomale is not homemade, but the type you can purchase in quantity at Sam's or Costco.  It was a thick, ultra creamy blob.  
It's too bad that in Old Town Avondale where one should find really good Mexican food, you are getting this stuff.
