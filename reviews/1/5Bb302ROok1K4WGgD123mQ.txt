the other reviews must have been written by friends and family because they are down right lies.  The food was horrible they werent serving half of the menu since they were having a party that night.  They also took 35 minutes for drinks since they didnt have "clean" glasses ready and when they came out finally they were warm since they were just ran through the dish washer.  The food took about 75 minutes to get one appetizer.  The wait staff was outside smoking with customers right next to our table.  This place is a dump and to be avoided at all costs when I asked to speak to a manager I was told he was busy setting up for this party.  Well I hope the party paid for expenses for the month because this place will be out of business soon if this is how they run things
