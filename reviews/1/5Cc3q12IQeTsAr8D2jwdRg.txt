We were really excited to try this place ever since we found out it would replace Loco Lime (which by the way was pretty decent). We arrived on Monday night and realized we were the only ones in the restaurant (never a good sign). We were greeted and asked immediately if we wanted drinks, so we ordered a Jalapeño Margarita and a house margarita, which were on special. We were also given some chips and salsa. Let me break down our experience:

Margaritas: The Jalapeño did not have much kick to it, but it was drinkable. Unfortunately, as mine (house margarita) was being made I noticed that our waitress and another waitress were sampling different combinations and looked very confused about how to mix the ingredients. Needless to say it tasted like coconut water, so they definitely did not get it right. 

Food: Chips were extremely greasy, salsa was sub par. We ordered the cheese dip, which was pretty good but again could not take down anymore of the extremely greased-up chips. We ordered the steak quesadilla and no lie, within 2 minutes we received it from the kitchen. I have to say we make better quesadillas at home. The cheese wasn't even melted inside and it was extremely small (was also not cut).

Service- our waitress was really nice, but it was interesting to note that the other waitresses were sitting at the bar, chatting and on their phones. 

We will never be back here. Azteca brings much more to the table and it's worth the drive. I hate to be a pessimist, but I can't imagine this place will stay open very long.
