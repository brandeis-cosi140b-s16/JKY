Rip-off. Maybe I'm a SoCal snob when it comes to taco shop, but this was a huge let down. Guacamole was thin and watery. Carne asada fries were over $8, but there were about 20 French fries in the box and the Carne was tough and bland. Even the salsa was watered down. I guess not all Roberto's are created equal. I paid over $12 for my food and was still hungry.
