First of all, I am not one to complain about food service. 99% of the reviews I write are positive because I am a small restaurant owner and I understand what bad publicity can do for a business... That being said; I was just at Lauritas for the 50th time and today, while the food was as passable as any "Robertos" would be, the service must be the reason for my grievance. I was waiting in the car while my husband ordered 1 burrito ($6 with tax) 1 set of (3) rolled tacos ($6) and 1 order of fried chicken wings ($10). I was charged $30 and then we did not receive a receipt. The clerk made it sound as if he didn't print the receipt with the transaction, that it was lost. I called a few minutes later to speak with him and he hung up on me after I asked him to ring up those items and tell me the cost with tax. Then I called a second time, this time I spoke in fluent Spanish to ease the language barrier . He hung up a second time. I called a third time and explained that if I need this remedied and he said 'I am busy!' And hung up a third time. By the time I've spoken with a manger tomorrow (which I will), my pilfered moneys as well as many other people's is going directly into his pocket and not into the business who's name he is tarnishing. DO NOT EAT HERE!! THE FOOD IS SUB PAR AND YOULL GET RIPPED OFF!! Save yourself the trouble and go to ANY OTHER MEXICAN FOOD RESTAURANT ... They are more likely to at least charge you appropriately.
