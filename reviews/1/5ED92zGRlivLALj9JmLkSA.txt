Been to Calico Jack's three times; first time service was very good; all we had was drinks. Second time, service was bad- food horrible. Decided to go a third time Tuesday April 12th at 1:30 PM, service was absolutely attrocious. We ordered two margaritas, tasted like margarita mix only (no alcohol); when questioned to bartender she tried to give a history of Tres Generacions Tequila and how mix is made; gave us an additional shot (essentially a quick splash into our drink). After we decided to leave low and behold we were charged $2 a piece for the so called shot. Did we leave a tip? HECK NA- WE WILL NEVER GO AGAIN! We will tip very well for good service- this place is terrible when it comes to service- TERRIBLE! I absolutely do not reccomend Calico Jacks. Check out Marc's on 43 Ave & Peoria; service is great; drinks and food are very good; price is reasonable!
