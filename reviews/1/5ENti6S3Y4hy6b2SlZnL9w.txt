The worst ever. First they are not equipped to handle a busy crowd they have a line out the door and only person serving up food and one person at the cashier, second I had a gift card that I checked the balance on, but they couldn't figure out how to use it ( he swiped the card backwards three times and then manually entered it in. I had to pay with my debit card!!!!!!! third They SERVED raw chicken and didn't even offer to replace the meal until after I was leaving... A little late The customer service is horrible.
