I went into this location on three separate occasions. 

1) seemed fine, the workers didn't know how to explain the menu so I kind of stuck to ordering a burrito (chipotle) style. Tasted really good but I paid a sold $17.78 for a burrito meal.. should have gone to chipotle and treated a friend to a meal for that price!
 
2) gave it another chance since my co workers hadn't been in. I and another coworker ordered burritos so no issues, tasted good. My other co worker got a quesadilla w/ veggies.. They did not have the veggies ready so her order had to go back into the kitchen... Needless to say, I ordered the same thing as last time, paid $10 this time around and my co worker finally got her quesadilla with veggies AFTER my co worker had to complain to the manager...twice! And as we were finishing up with our burritos. She also said it was bland and not worth the overpriced amount she paid! 

3) went in on a Thursday night, there were ppl in there but no line, ordered my usual and they didn't have any rice made, said to wait 2-3, I waited 7-9 mins. and they were finally able to toss some from the kitchen over into my burrito,  the employees looked pissed, lazy and not wanting to be there and the gentleman that checked me out or any other staff did not even apologize for the delay in not having their main option, wtf? Paid $10 this time too, had the burrito but it was very BLAND, Disgusting. Tossed it !! as we were leaving the manager like figure asked how it was and I said it was ok! He apologized because he had seen us waiting for a while and we said ok.. Then he came chasing me down as I was sitting in my car with a free Taco with a meal or something. No thank you. 

Honestly, gave them 3 tries, service is horrible, food is decent, good luck figuring out what you want to order since no one knows to really help you.. And if you order something from the back kitchen, good luck getting it in time!
