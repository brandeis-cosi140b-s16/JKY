I hate to say it but I keep having bad experiences here. I used to love Caramba's and have been going to the Bell location since highschool. I got a "Giant Caramba" with Machaca yesterday because it was on special. My wife got a machaca burrito and added beans and guac (which is her standard, she's been gonig here off and on forever also).

My burrito was huge, covered with melty cheese and really good red sauce. Sounds good right!?

Unfortunatly, no. My huge burro was 75% tortilla with just a little bit of meat. Seriously. I actually counted 7, YES SEVEN, layers of tortilla on the bottom of my burro. I'm shaking my head in disappointment while writing this.Where's the beef?!

My wife's burro was just as dissappointing. Just a very small portion of meat. When you get a beef burrito, and add beans, they are not supposed to take away beef. It should be the same damn amount of beef with beans ADDED. Again, where's the beef!?!?

I would much rather be at Cafe Rumba on 59th and Union, or, better yet, Caminero on 83rd and Deer Valley, both of which have excellent food at the same (or better) price point. 

I waited a while before deciding to leave a bad review, something I don't like doing. This was my 4th time at this "new" location, my 4th time hoping for something to change, and my 4th time dissapointed. I won't be back again.
