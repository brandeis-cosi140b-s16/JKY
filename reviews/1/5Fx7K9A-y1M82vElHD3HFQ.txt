So sad for the chef, loved the food but service was terrible. Server Jose never once smiled and ignored our requests numerous time. Manager accused us of skipping on one tab out of 16 even though we weren't even ready to leave. Literally had security tell us to pay the tab while we were still trying drink and eat. I'm sorry chef Sal can't recommend this place cuz of this terrible experience on my friends birthday
