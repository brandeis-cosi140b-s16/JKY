Yikes! This place was terrible! The place seemed deserted and yet another waitress was helping our waiter out and seemed upset that she had to pick up his slack. The food was ok. Nothing spectacular. The tacos were in shells that you would buy at Walmart, the chicken was dry and flavorless, the only thing they had going for them was the complimentary chips and salsa.
