Wow. I have never had more bland food in my life. I judge all Mexican food places by there Green Chile Burro, and man... there was nothing special about it at this place. Pale and tasteless, the burrito was very disappointing. The pork looked like it was just ladled straight out of a can and .
 My wife chose a bean, egg, and cheese, breakfast burrito. What could go wrong with that , right? Just like an earlier reviewer said, the beans tasted right out of the can.  No, I think out of the can may have a bit more taste. Even their Guacamole was bland. It was obvious that whoever was back there playing Chef had no sense of taste. Please folks, save your time and money and just go to Filibertos's on the corner.
