Okay so it was my co worker birthday yesterday she just turned 20. I thought sitara would be a good place since some of our other coworkers are over 21. So we got there it was good they only changed our bowl once. This girl came took our order so we excited so we waited 20 mins passed my coworkers started leaving so I had to physical get up and chase the girl to be like hey where are our new bowls she was like there's coming. 50 mins go passed I found this other server guy to be like hey my group leaving we've been waiting almost an hour to get our new bowls he was ill go get them. That's when I got pissed. The girl was prancing around like it wasn't her job to make sure that everyone was satisfied. She went to the table that had all guys asked them if they were okay fixed there hookah, flipped there coals, and got new bowls. Like I was so livid. But after an hour an 40 mins we got new bowls. My whole group left so it was just me and my best friend but when we go our hookah it was harsh and disgusting. They only cater to the 21 and over. Overall they need to hire more employees and train them in customer service
