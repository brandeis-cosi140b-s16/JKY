Back when I lived in Phoenix, I used to come to Filberto's once in a while when I was looking for some decent fast food Mexican.  Upon my return to Filberto's a few days ago, I was so disappointed when I ordered Chicken Quesadilla to-go and received an unappetizing mess.  It was a monstrous tortilla shell uncut, folded over multiple times in the to go box. If that wasn't bad enough, the quesadilla was missing the sour cream and guacamole and had a clear, slimy, rubbery, circular, unidentifiable object inside.  Yuck.  1 star
