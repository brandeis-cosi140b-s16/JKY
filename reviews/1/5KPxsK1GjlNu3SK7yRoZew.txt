While the food is typically good, the customer service is simply awful. A few weeks ago, I placed an order online so that I could quickly pick it up on my way home. I arrive to pick up my food at 6:15 (exactly when I said for my order to be ready when I submitted it hours prior). There is a line for call-in/online orders. The woman at the front of the line was standing there for 10 minutes before anyone even came over to acknowledge her! Long story short, I waited for 25 minutes in line to be acknowledged and when I got to the front, they JUST started making my food. The people working the register were unorganized and not polite. Today, I tried my online order again. I showed up and they couldn't find my order in the system. I showed them the email confirmation on my phone... But that was no help. So, the manager came over and was so completely rude. I said "so, do I need to get in line and order now?" And she said "Yeah I guess if you want". Mind you, I am 8 months pregnant and my back hurts. I placed the online order to NOT have to wait in line and deal with the madness that takes place when you are trying to order more than one meal. They need to fix the mess that is this restaurant or they will be losing my business. The workers toss food all over and put ingredients in your meal before you even tell them what you do/do not want. I'll be visiting Chipotle where their staff is overly friendly and their online ordering system has been wonderful!
