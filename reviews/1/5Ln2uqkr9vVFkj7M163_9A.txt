Review update!  Caution!  Caution!! This place has new owners and I guess they don't like good food and service cause they got rid of everything that was great about this place before.  It took FOREVER to get our food, the salsa was horrible, it tasted like burnt gasoline, the food pretty much sucked, and the dining area was hot and stuffy.  
DO NOT EAT HERE, SAVE YIUR MONEY. I would seriously rather eat Mcdonalds than eat here again.
