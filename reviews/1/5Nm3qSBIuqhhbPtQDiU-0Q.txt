Ok Filibertos is Filibertos but today they really mad me mad and ripped me off.  I ordered a a Ham Breakfast Burrito with Potato's I know (Guilty pleasure) and xtra cheese and it came to $7.00 and I said how does a BB start at $4.59.  I got my receipt and they charged me $1.19 for cheese OMG.  The guys came back and I asked dont you think that is exseccive for cheese and said that is just what we charge for 3OZ of cheese that $19.04 per LB.  OMG go to Costco and stop ripping people off never going to this Filies again!!!!!

Once again ripped off 1.19 for cheese I just forgot do they even read these
