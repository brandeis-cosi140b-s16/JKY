If it weren't for the rude owner of this place I would have given it four stars based on the bartender and ambiance. 

We were greeted by the owner with hostility, not seated when a table opened up because "we asked too many times if the table was ready" and she actually told us to leave because she couldn't care less either way. To top it off, every time she walked by us when we were standing at the bar she made a snide comment about us sticking around. The bartender apologized to us a thousand times for her behavior (he said he finds himself doing this a lot) but I will never go back to this establishment. Simply awful.
