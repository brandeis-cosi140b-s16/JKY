I'm not a picky person and I don't typically complain, but I have never eaten food that tasted this bad. The queso looked like it had been sitting for days, the carne asada was horribly seasoned, and there's not much good that I can say about the carnitas. The biggest mistake I made in all this was not rating this place a no star establishment.
