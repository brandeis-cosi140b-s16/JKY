This looked exactly like the place which I typically enjoy - a locally owned, authentic Mexican restaurant. Chips and salsa were very promising but everything went quickly downhill from there. The chicken (Pollo Mas Amigos) - apparently their signature dish was poorly presented (a heaping mass of veggies) and poorly cooked with no flavor - either in the veggies or in the chicken.

The desserts were nothing to speak of either. Skip it.
