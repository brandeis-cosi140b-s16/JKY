Bland. Old. Cold.

Pros
Nothing. It's literally taking me time trying to come up with something positive to say here. 

Cons
A lot of food was out buffet style and it looked old and reheated.
The food and salsa was bland. Why would a place like this not have made to order hot fresh food?
The menu was hard to read, change the font and overall style of it.
About 60% of the tables had dirty plates on them. When we left there were still dirty tables and no it wasn't busy. If the front of the house is unkept, I can't even image what their back looks like.

Overall
I would be willing to give them another try but I'm honestly scared of getting food poisoning. There is a lot of food out and I doubt they throw it all away every night. Also, why don't I just go to a place that serves me fresh food?
