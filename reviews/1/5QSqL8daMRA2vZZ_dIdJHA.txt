I had an issue that I wanted to bring to the attention of management, so I went on the website and wrote out my issue, went to send it, and no matter how I wrote the date it said "format invalid" so I could never send my comment. 

In order to help other people who might go to this location (or any filiberto's I guess, you should know that there is this potential for mix up.

Here is what I experienced:

On the menu there is a heading of "Breakfast Burritos" and underneath the first 1 is called "Breakfast" followed by other types of burritos. When a person orders "a bacon breakfast burrito" they likely want 1 burrito from the "Breakfast Burrito" list...the "Bacon" one. Unfortunately, when there is also a burrito called "Breakfast", the employee thinks you're ordering two burritos...a breakfast one and a bacon one. The person doesn't realize until the order is complete and the total is double the listed price. But by then the employee is no longer on the line to correct the order. When the customer pulls up to the window and tries to explain, the employee can't understand why the person thinks they only ordered one burrito and he argues that they ordered a breakfast burrito and a bacon burrito. 

I imagine the breakfast burrito ends up in the trash or eaten by employees and the company loses money. I'd suggest a different name for the "Breakfast" Breakfast Burrito. Maybe "Deluxe" or "Special"? I dunno, but a breakfast burrito called "Breakfast" is like a taco filling called "Taco". What kind of taco do you want? Beef? Chicken? Taco? And how do you order these? I need a taco taco or a breakfast breakfast burrito? And how do I order the type without saying the heading? Like "I want a machaca"...uhhh...a machaca what? Can't say "breakfast burrito" because then you've just ordered a breakfast breakfast burrito! See how confusing this is? It makes no sense. Not my loss if you keep wasting food because of this issue, but I wanted someone to know.
