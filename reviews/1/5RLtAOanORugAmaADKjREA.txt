I've only been here twice this past summer and the food was good. Thought i'd come back for more... I ordered 2 burritos. One had tons of fat and hardly no carnitas. The other had no beans-n-rice inside. Tortilla on both burritos was so large that it felt like i was only eating the wrap instead of a meal. Lastly the nachos were stale, the meat over cooked and soft drinks tasted weird. I won't be coming back.
