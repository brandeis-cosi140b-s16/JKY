Pure debauchery! BLAND ASS BULLSHIT. We got the huevos rancheros, chiliquilles verde, and banana peanut pancakes. The first two were boring and tasteless. The pancake - barely mediocre. I should've stayed home and had cereal, or grabbed breakfast burrito to go at filibertos for $2.50. Do not come here for breakfast.
