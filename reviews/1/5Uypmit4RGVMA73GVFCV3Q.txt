The worst service and tacos I ever had. I ordered 2 carne asada tacos. It was 1240pm and not too busy. It took 20mins to make 2 tacos. Then the only flavor the meat had was burnt taste. No flavor! The lettuce was like a wet paste. This did not enhance the flavor. Thank goodness for the hot salsa or my 2 tacos would have been 2 tasteless corn tortillas of mush. They had a big grill but the cook apparently could only cook 1 order at a time. Hey buddy, put all the quesadillas and corn tortillas on at the same time! Way too expensive for what you get.
