We might try it again (some day) based solely on the overwhelming force and persuasion of Yelp. Now based on our isolated experience, wtf was that on our plates? We did not order WTF. I did not want a room temp tortilla pulled from a plastic bag and filled with my choice of green or red goo. 

I thought I was being punk'd until I realized I'm not a very well-known celebrity in these parts. I am big in Europe and Asia, but Ashton doesn't care about Eurasia. And he'd never come to Surprise either. So, I was 86-90% sure that AK wasn't about to jump out. 

This. was. apparently. real. life. 

And real life was actually quite terrible in that moment. But don't listen to me. Listen to the 444 other reviewers praising Rito's food. Statistically your experience will be more closely aligned with "their" perceptions than ours. 

Good luck.
