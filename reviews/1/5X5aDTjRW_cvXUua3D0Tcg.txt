! Do not get tamales with Baja sauce...it's mush. Burritos were crap and on top of that they make you pay for meat?!?! What the faaaack who does that?!?!? Mango margarita was pretty bad. I think they just add liquor into a pre made smoothie which is way too sweet. I'll never come here again it was horrible
