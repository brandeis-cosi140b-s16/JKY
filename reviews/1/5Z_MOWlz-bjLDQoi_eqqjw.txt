This place has gone downhill!!! When it opened everything was spectacular. The Margaritas, Quac, Chips, Tacos. We went there this week. Our 5th or 6th visit. The only things that were still good were the chips and swordfish tacos. The service was poor the food seemed old and/or poorly prepared and the prices have gone up since the opening. I even showed our waiter that the tacos that he recommended were uneatable full of fatty pork. We will not be returning or recommending any more!!! Hope the next restaurant opening at Red Rock is much better! T


Their Response: Hi Terri. We are sorry that your most current visit was not the service or quality you have previously received with Mercadito. We thank you for your feedback and will be addressing your points with the kitchen and staff. Please reconsider coming back in the future. Please note: Most definitely, the prices have not increased since opening

My response:  The prices at Happy Hour on Tacos and Margaritas went from 5.50 to 6.50.  The waitress when we commented said they were testing the market and adjusted the prices.

Cannot even give 1 star anymore.  The only things palpable re the swordfish tacos and the chips.  I have had to leave for the bathroom on two different occasions
 feeling like vomiting while visiting Mercadito at Red Rock.
