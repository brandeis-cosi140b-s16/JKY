I think this place had a lot of potential but we had a terrible time here. We waited 25 minutes to be seated, which is fine, but 2 groups were seated immediately when they came in after us.  When we were finally seated the waiter took 30 minutes to notice we were there. Finally he took our order checked our id's and everything is fine. Then a minute or so later, the manager comes over and says he needs to check my id again. Since I am from utah, we are issued paper id's before we get our normal id's and that's what I had (including my expired id). He told me he could not accept my id because arizona laws are very strict... I explained the situation and told him its a goverment issued id, but he didn't budge. this was the only place who even questioned it.  Obviously, not a good experience.
