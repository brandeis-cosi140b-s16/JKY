We tried to go here today after my daughter's dance recital. She picked the place. It was 2:45pm. I asked if we could have a booth, and the hostess said, "well, here's the problem. A lot of our servers just want to get out of here, so the only room I can seat you is in here", pointing  to one little overly crowed area. My husband and I looked at each other in shock, and said, "well, we can help them get out of here. We'll just go eat somewhere else!" I will NEVER go back! How freakin tacky!!!
