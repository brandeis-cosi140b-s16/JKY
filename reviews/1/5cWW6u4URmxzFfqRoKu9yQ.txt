I go to all of the Harrah's properties USA wide. This Mexican cookery is BEYOND TERRIBLE! It is nothing but a swirl job to hook you in and charge to double for all items. Here's how much it is a real Mexican restaurant. I asked for some "hot sauce" and they brought me "some from the back that they make up for the employee's" They DO NOT HAVE any hot sauce on the table besides some bottles stuff that we all can buy in a store..??? ZERO!  They DO NOT have ANY hot sauce for their customers!! The salsa and chips that they charge you for,  I think $5.00 (not free) the salsa looks as plain as "stewed tomatoes" give me a break!! It is a COMPLETE JOKE of over priced Mexican food that does NOT even come up to Taco Bell standards!! HONESTLY!! Never again!! A COMPLETE JOKE in ever aspect!! Here is the summary's you want some food that resembles Mexican food that is BLAND and you feel like paying $12.00 for a $5.00 burrito then go here! gOING TO taco bell is more spicy, exciting and fullfilling that this place! Food for people in a REST HOME!  I live in Cali and the TACO TRUCKS taste better that this $H!T....!
