Oh Dear what a shame
Must have changed hands
New menu, much more expensive, favorite items have gone.
Husband's burrito was tasteless and my crispy chicken was supposed to have fresh pineapple salsa but had nasty spicy red sauce too hot to taste. Potato polenta was just a pile of mushy home fries.
I sent it back and ordered ceviche, no one came back to table, no offer of fresh drinks and 20 minutes later still no food. We left cash on table and went home!
