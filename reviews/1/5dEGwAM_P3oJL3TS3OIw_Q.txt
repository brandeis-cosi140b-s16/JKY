The food is so watery and very bland. Everything tastes store bought including the tortillas. On top of everything it's cash only and they refused to allow my 7 year old to use the bathroom!!! My kids also had to sit near what I'm assuming is the manager while she had a personal conversation with cussing every other word!! I will never go to this place again!
