I hate to say it but I was VERY disappointed with my experience. 

Before I go deeper I will say that the guac is very good but that does not save this place in any way. 

Lets start with the food. I ordered what is their version of fajitas, now I saw cheese on the list of ingredients for the dish, and to me meat and cheese is not a bad thing. What I did not expect is: mealy textured meat, as if defrosted wrong, meat cooked on a flat iron that had no flavor of its own and a puddle of salty, oily cheese that was disgusting. The flavors were out of balance and one of the worst dishes I have ever seen or tasted. The tortillas were wet and sticky on one side and dry on the other, I mean how do you screw that up??????

Service started out good, there was a delay in getting our first and second rounds of drinks, but I can understand a busy bar. The fact that our server filled up an ice tea a table away and did not bother to fill my water glass when it was empty was not good. But when she leaned across a railing that was behind me to ask me if I wanted another drink, is where it went down hill. Three steps more and she could have been table side. So now we forward to me telling our server about my main course, she takes it away, I never see a manager, and before we could consider ordering desert, coffee or even finish our second round of drinks she plops the check in front of my face. The asks "Oh you didn't want any thing else did you?"  WOW! I have never been so insulted of felt like I was being told to 'Get the hell out' in my life. I was so mad I could not speak and no manager ever bothered to follow up with us about dinner.

I am in the service industry and have work in every thing from Chevy's to Micheline Star rated establishments and this by far was the WORST experience I have ever had!!!! I will never return to this place!!!!!!!!
