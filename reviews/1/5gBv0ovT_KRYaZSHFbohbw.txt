I don't understand why this place gets good reviews, their food is mediocre at best. I have eaten here 5 times now (the people I live with keep ordering from there other wise I would have eaten there once only) and had a variety of things and the meats always taste reheated/microwaved the beans are dry and the rice is flavorless. Seeing how so many people like this place I never bothered to throw in my 2Â¢ about it but the last order I got was the beef tacos and one had half a splintered tooth pick in it that nearly went through the roof of my mouth! Now today with a sore mouth I'm writing this to warn others, the people who work there are nice but clearly do not care about the food they are serving.
