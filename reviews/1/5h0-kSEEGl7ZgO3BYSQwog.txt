Wow so the reviews about Ricky's running out of food are true, I thought they were a joke. No joke folks I went here last night with with a friend on Labor Day weekend. You would expect them to have a stock of food,right? Hell No! I would normally give this place a 5 because of the great chicken tacos they had, but after reading reviews, I'm sure they screwed those up. Anyways chicken tacos is what I ordered and they told they were out of chicken, beans and rice. My friend ended up ordering steak fries and I ordered a quesadilla. I guess it was ok, too much vodka in me to remember. But I remember Rickys running out of food. My question is If Rickey's so damn worried about spending money on food supplies, why you even in business? #1 reason why you will go out of business and these reviews will warn others
