Awful! I went through the drive-thru and ordered two chicken enchiladas w/rice & beans. I got home, opened the box and took a couple bites & got no chicken, so I cut the enchiladas open and it had 95% onions & peppers and 5% chicken! I love Mexican food, but this is the worst I've ever had! On a positive note, the rice & beans were good.
