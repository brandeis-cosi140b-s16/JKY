HORRIBLE! We ordered our food at 2pm and it was expected to be delivered at 3pm. Finally at 4pm I called them and the woman couldn't speak English very well but what came out of the conversation was that they weren't delivering the food. But they have already taken our money. This place doesn't know how to run a business. It needs to be closed down!
