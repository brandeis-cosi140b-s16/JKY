I would have originally given this place like three stars, maybe.  More on that in a moment.

I usually get chili rellenos or a burrito or fajitas or something, but tonight I decided to try the pollo con rejos y crema.  It was pretty good, although I would have liked more lettuce in my "salad".  The chicken was pounded thin, the sauce had a lot of flavor...well not really.  It was just green and watery all over my plate.  I didn't get nearly as many strips of pasilla as I thought I would, but I got a heck of a lot of onion...

We usually get there after six, so it's already obnoxiously noisy, crowded, hot, etc etc.  Today we showed up around 5:30 and got a small break before the crowds poured in (why!?) and raised the decibel level of the place by 10000.

But I could even deal with that.  My glass stayed full, and our server was friendly and accommodating in spite of our picky (aka personalized) orders.  It was when the check came and the debit card left my hand that the real fiasco began.

Our server returned to our table, politely and quietly explaining that my card had been declined because the bank was refusing to approve the transaction.  Well duh.  Wait a minute.  WHAT!?

After 20 minutes of struggling on the phone both inside and outside (it's so LOUD) with automated lists and air headed operators, the issue was finally resolved.  No, my account was fine.  No, there had been no lock put on it due to unaccounted for activity.  Yes, the server incorrectly punched in my expiration date.

Seriously?  I know five and six are right beside each other, but SERIOUSLY?

I was steamed and so upset that the mediocre meal I'd just semi-enjoyed became a churning, angry mass in my stomach.  Thanks Lindo for frustration induced indigestion.

And I think their tortilla chips suck!
