2 words: not good. The mexican food here is as far from authentic as you can get, plus it is overpriced. I got the chicken tortilla soup to start off with and it was soooo bland and flavorless and loaded with tons of cheesy goop. Then I got a taco and tostada and both were of lower standards than taco bell (I would have preferred a taco bell taco). When I go to a Mexican restaurant in Arizona I expect a freshly fried taco shell, not your store bought Ortega brand taco shell and I expect shredded beef, but at Aunt Chilada's you get the store bought shells and ground beef! I won't return.
