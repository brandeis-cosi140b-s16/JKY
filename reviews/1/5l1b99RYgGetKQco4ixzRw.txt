Gourmet Mexican food?? Other Chipotles maybe but this location is mediocre!! I literally have no idea how  current management was selected to run this place. 

First of all, every time I go there (usually around dinner) the music is EXTREMELY loud. The loud music combined with all the ruckus the crew makes on the grill has the crew on the food SCREAMING at me. I'm sure they aren't deaf but it is difficult for any of them to hear me since I can barely hear them myself.

As for the customer service, a young gentleman with short brown hair who started my order was very polite and friendly until he passed my bowl to the tall girl with long curly brown/reddish hair who was doing all the toppings. Her manner was very rude, she never smiled and just stared at me waiting for me to tell her what I wanted. The only time she spoke was when I asked for guacamole and she said it was gonna cost extra. 

The food on the other hand is another disaster. I ended up asking for chicken on my bowl instead of the steak I usually get because the very little steak that was left in the pan was very dry and crusty looking. I couldn't believe they were out of steak as every other Chipotle I've visited has never been out of food and the food always looks fresh. 

What a shame to be such a poorly run chipotle considering it's very beautifully constructed and in a wonderful area. Will not be back.
