I love me some Chipotle!  It's the closest thing I do to fast food...but this location is TERRIBLE!  Avoid unless you are desperate!

I have now been there three separate times when they were missing important things.  This includes LETTUCE (really?  There's a Food Lion across the parking lot). Onions, peppers and today was the best....ICE!  There was a sign that said "No ice for the rest of the day."  Ummmm ok!???

Besides the fact that they are often out of something, the line is always completely ridiculous.  I understand this is near a college but other people (professionals!!) also visit this location!

Don't go here.
