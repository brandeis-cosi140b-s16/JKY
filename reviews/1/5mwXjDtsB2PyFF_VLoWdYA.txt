I am never coming back.  The food is bland and dry.  Every time, we've ordered from here, we get a certain item on the menu.  They decided to stop serving the dish with one of the sides.  Not worth it anymore.  Chips are stale.  I'm pretty sure their guacamole is just ground up avocados. There are many other Mexican places to eat that has way better standards and quality.  I actually like their salsa.
