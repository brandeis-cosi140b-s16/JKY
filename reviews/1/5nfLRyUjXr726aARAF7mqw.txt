I'm looking at the other reviews for Cafe Rhumba and I can't believe we all ate at the same restaurant. We found it to be very bland and boring. There is no way this restaurant compares to Chipotle in any way. There were 4 of us and we all had something different as none of us had ever been there before. All 4 meals were tasteless. The salsa had no taste, the chicken was not seasoned, etc. We will NEVER go back again. I could eat at Chipotle weekly and was happy to have another similar restaurant. What a shock to find it to be so bad.
