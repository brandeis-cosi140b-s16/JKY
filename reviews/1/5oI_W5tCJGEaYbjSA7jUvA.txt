I used to go to this Chipotle a lot, but not after today. Pretty much the worst experience at Chipotle ever... First, when we got there the line was already to the door and the manager didn't even seem to notice. He finally came over to the line to help the crew out after we'd bee waiting 20 mins. Only all he did was tell them to speed up and then he started rushing the customers... next we ordered 4 bags of chips with salsa and we got the salsa but apparently the cashier didn't hear because she didnt charge us for them. When I pointed out that we didn't get our chips she made me wait while she rang up two more guests... and then she rang me up... which surprised me since I thought she had already charged us... now any chipotle I have ever been to before would have just given me the chips and not made me wait further and since she asked me what type of salsa I wanted with my chips I figured they were responsible for the mistake not me... but I guess this location is not as interested in good customer service.  And she also failed to bring me the tortillas that I ordered with my bowl like she said she would. Last but not least both the dining room and the bathroom were filthy... like I said, not going back to that location again.
