Went here with a party of 8 around 8 pm. It took about 45 minutes to get our food, and the server got two of our orders wrong. I ordered the pesto shrimp tacos- they were bland and I was still hungry after eating them. I tried the steak burrito too. It was basically a pound of meat wrapped in a tortilla. 

The pro: good margaritas. Come for the drinks, skip the food.
