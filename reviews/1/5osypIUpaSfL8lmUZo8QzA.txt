Literally the worst happy hour ever.  Do not go there for the free buffet there is a reason its free.  Not even mexican food.  They had uncooked potato wedges that weren't edible, spaghetti w alfredo sauce that was coagulated and cold, burritos filled w beans and rice and slathered w jalepenos also cold and tasted the best of the absolute worst.  Drinks were no big deal and overpriced for happy hour.  Big mistake going here.  Both hubby and I can't stop talking about how bad it was and how we got ripped.  8-18 just wanted to update.  Told the manager at the time how bad it was and the food they served wasnt food.  He insisted that it was food and told me that he would send me an email with a coupon to come back and have dinner on them.  I never got an email.  He was full of it and could really care less.  During happy hour they kept telling us that the premier marg was only .30 less than the house which was over 7 bucks.  Dont make the same mistake!  Go somewhere else!!
