This place is a great place to cool off and people watch. Fantastic idea, really. Who else serves jungle juice by the pitcher?  My problem came  when I tabbed out and got the wrong card back. Lots of cards back there fine, but when I got mine back it had a guys name on it.  I was fine with that, both our last names started with the same letter and it was the same blue card.  I was fine with not only them thinking I was a guy, but also giving me then wrong one.  It happens.   But when I pointed it  out that it was not me they claimed to give me my card back. Really? But the card in my bill is not me. The were still positive they gave me my card back.  Finally I gave up and they told me to call back later to see if my card was returned.  If you gave me my card back, why would I return it, I'm so confused?   Blah, blah, they didn't give or even a "hey we are sorry".  Which stinks.  I would suggest going, but would just not pay buy card!!
