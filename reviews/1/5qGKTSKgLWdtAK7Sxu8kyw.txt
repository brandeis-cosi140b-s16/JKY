Pathetic translation for a restaurant.  People heed to the Yelp stars! Waited 35 min for food, we walked out. The service was so so bad.  The salsa was horrible, tasted like a can of El Pato chile.  The waiter was perspiring and kept wiping his face with hands & touching everything! Disgusting! Hostess were high school rejects lacking customer service.  The restaurant is dark the ceilings are filthy.  We never got  passed the chips & salsa.  Thank God we walked out when we did! Will never return.  I give it 1 star for diet Pepsi. There is an abundance of excellent restaurants in area.
