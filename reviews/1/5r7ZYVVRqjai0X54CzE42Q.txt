Is there a zero star?

This place would be great if you got to sit in the open area but we were stuck up against the side of a window.  It was awful and hot.  

The food was mediocre.  How can you screw up a burrito?  They did.  

The rice was white rice smothered in tomato sauce.  That is a far cry from Mexican rice.  

We had no utensils when dinner came.  We asked the server for them.  He had his back to us and never acknowledged that he even heard us.  We went up to the bar for our own utensils.  After some time our server came back saw we had utensils and promptly threw on the counter across from us.  

Basically not that great.  Gets great business because it is on the strip and in the Monte Carlo hotel.  Skip it.  Go to Fatburger.
