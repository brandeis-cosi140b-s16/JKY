I've been to fuzzys a few times and about 50% of the time there food is sloppy. I got a burrito today and the tortilla was mushy because the burrito was dripping liquid. The wrapper that it came in was soaked. They have upped their prices and the food keeps getting worse. The line is ussually long and they one have one person running the register and making drinks while I watched 2 employees come up and not help out at all. Not worth it.
