Not impressed. Food  was terrible. Did not feel me up. Cheap, however for what ur getting, its not wrth it. Wat mexican place dont have asada. Oh thats right this place. This is the 2nd time I came here, and what a disappointment.  I will be surprised if there around much longer!!! Just terrible food. Wood not recommend!!
