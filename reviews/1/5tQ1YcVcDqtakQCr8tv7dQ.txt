Don't waste your time and money.  Horrible, over priced food! I ordered the steak(ok) burrito, with black beans (bland), lime rice(awful awful awful), and cheese. There is a $1 upcharge for a spoonful of regular salsa. (That's like charging $1 for ketchup when you order fries) The margaritas are a joke, I don't think there was any alcohol in ours. I can't believe this horrible place is located in the MGM Grand.
