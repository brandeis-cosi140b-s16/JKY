Expensive meal that still hasn't come after an hour and forty minutes. Made reservations in the early afternoon, and the table wasn't ready in time. When we were finally brought to the table, it still wasn't ready and we had to stand around while they prepared it. Took one hour for a salad to arrive. Waitress never checked in on the table, completely disappeared and never offered us bread or water. No one talked to us. Awful.
