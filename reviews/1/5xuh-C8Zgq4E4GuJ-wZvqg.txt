We are so incredibly disappointed in the quality of the food there.  We've probably ordered from them about 50 times within the last year and their food is usually amazing.  Their chicken tacos were absolutely awful! What happened to the big awesome shells they once  used that made that taco over $2.00 so worth it? Now it's a small tortilla dipped in oil and hardly cooked.  
The rolled tacos use to be huge and amazing, a huge hit for our family.  Now they are tiny, rubbery and frozen tequittos from the grocery store would taste better then the rolled tacos there do now. 
Rice tastes like boxed and beans from a can.  So incredibly sad that what once was our favorite place is now officially the worst place we've ever eaten at in AZ.
