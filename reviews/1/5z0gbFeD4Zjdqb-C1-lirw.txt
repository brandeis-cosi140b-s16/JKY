I had a lot of hit and misses at this location but since it was the one closest to my house, I go here every so often ( not as often since the one time they gave me raw chicken )

The stars are base on the raw chicken and the service because let's face it, this is a chain restaurant so basically it should taste the same everywhere just different people making it and different attitudes. 

My sister and I love Chipotle and and we went through our phase of wanting/eating it everyday. One hot afternoon we came in to get our usual the chicken bowl and when we went to eat it, the chicken just feels off. Then I looked down and to my surprise the chicken still had blood on it. We contemplated on telling someone because we don't really like complaining about our food. But we ended up doing it and the response we got was off. 

The guy who looked like a manager or something said that he will replace this 'on the house' and that our meal 'will be free' which makes no sense because we already paid for them ???  Then the girl who was working was really defensive and went to tell us she don't think it was raw and that she took the temperature and everything. She didn't get to look at the bowls before he threw them away in the trash but is she trying to imply that we were lying? He obviously saw and apologize so what's her deal? Anyways after we got our new replacement bowls, we barely ate it because the thought of raw chicken just freaks me out and ruined my appetite. 

It's been a few months since the incident and I would not go back to this location if I had a choice but it's extremely close to my house. 

That last few times I've been here, the employees do skimp on ingredients and when you ask for more, I feel like I get attitude. Even when theres no line, I feel rushed. I like extra pico and lettuce ... What can I say but they just dump it on and push you forward. Like it's a sin to ask for more lettuce. 

Anyways I still love chipotle just not this location.
