I ate here twice. The 1st time my super nachos were very plain flavor. My carne asada meat in my burrito was nothing but fat no actual meat gross gross..  So I gave it some time I decided to give breakfast a shot.  Chorizo burrito added bacon and potatoes. Agian!! no bacon I paid for not enough chorizo in the egg and potatoes seemed deepfried. There low prices for sure. But there tight with napkins and extra salsa chile. Dude gives me 2 cheaply thin napkins. Ask for more naps he gives me exactly 1 more.  They act like cheap asses. GO TO FEDRICOS OR FILIBERTOS. THEY TRY TOO MAKE THERE FOOD LIKE THEM ANYWAYS!
