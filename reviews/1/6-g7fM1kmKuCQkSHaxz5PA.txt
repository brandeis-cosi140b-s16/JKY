We bought a groupon to go here, The food was terrible. Chicken burrito was dry as dirt. Wish we had not purchase another groupon because we really do not want to go back! Very small portions and most items are al a cart, including limes! Guacamole was mostly tomatoes. Very little avocado. Server was new and did not know anything about Mexican food. Owner went around to every table and apologized for multiple problems. Owner ended up finishing waiting on us and the server stayed behind the counter.
