The best word to describe my experience I just had at Taco Bell in one word is. DISGUST.

My boyfriend and I went to Taco Bell tonight to have a quick late dinner; we decided to "dine in" which is not what we normally do, but we didnt think there would be any problem, and figured it wouldn't be busy as it was just after 9:00 pm on a Monday night. 

We walked into the establishment and were quickly greeted and helped by the cashier at the front counter. She was patient and got our order correct. We noticed that there was 6 *what we thought were customers* in the lobby sitting, eating and talking.  We filled our drinks, got our hot sauce, napkins and found a seat in a booth 2 down from the one that seated the other *customers*. 

I heard a woman in their group say something about manager, or management which caught my attention so i looked over. Turns out the woman sitting at the table WAS indeed the manager, who was eating and talking with the 5 other guests of hers at the table. 

This *Manager* was so loud and obnoxious we honestly thought about switching our order "to go" because she made us very uncomfortable. Every other word out of her mouth was F*** that, F*** this- B**** that, B**** this. If i would have happened to have a kid with me, i would have got up and left without my food.. 

It was like a train wreck, and i could not beleive what my eyes and ears were seeing and hearing, so i continued to listen to what she was saying. She was talking about her employees to her friends, and went as far as to talk about one of her male employees having a "Girl A**" she then proceeded to call her employee out into the lobby, lift up his shirt, while her friends laughed and gawked at his butt. I mean you are a manager, if that isn't sexual harrasment I don't know what is.  The employee seemed to be upset, and very embarassed, he went back behind the counter and continued to work with the other 2 employees i saw on shift. 

I have written Taco Bell on their website and will be looking into a General Managers number to contact with to share my story as well. Anyone who is willing to listen needs to hear it, and this woman who calls her self a *MANAGER* should be fired immediately. She was a complete embarassment to herself, her employees and the Taco Bell franchise.

Shame on you.
