We got frustrated with traffic trying to look for Leticia's Mexican Cucina, with patience running thin we opted to go to Zabas instead. 

Ordered 2 steak Zaba bowls (they were ok - mediocre really), a kids meal (quesadilla) which my son didn't even eat although he loves quesadilla - (that should have been a sign) and chips and guac. So there sign for chips and guac is $2.99 but if you order a large guac it is $3.79 and chips (stale and probably the worst) is $1.79 which the cashier failed to mentioned that I have to pay for chips if I wanted a larger size guac? What does the regular serving comes in then, a spoonful? I mean what am I going to eat the guacamole with? Seriously a total rip off - $35 for two and a half on a "fast food Mexican place" - NOT WORTH IT. I'd go to cafe Rio anyday than this place. Or should have stayed with the original plan...
