The worse food ever, the manager had an excuse for everything; empty salsa bar poor service yet the cooks were standing around and visiting with the waiters. Then the waiter walked by our table three times until I had to ask him to take the dirty plate. When our main course was brought he didn't bring an extra plate for the fajitas or the condiments to go with them. 
Very disappointed and will never go back.
