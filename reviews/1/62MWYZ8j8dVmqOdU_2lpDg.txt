I wish I'd gotten the chance to try the food. I walked in today at around 5 pm and I see the manager standing in the kitchen eating. When he saw me he turned around & put some gloves on. Already two health code violations in this visit: he was eating in the kitchen and didn't wash his hands before helping me. While I stared at the menu for a minute, he scooped some rice into a container and put it aside. I guess I took too long to decide because he huffed out, "Let me know when you're ready", grabbed the rice, and continued to eat. I turned to tell my fiance I didn't want to eat there anymore because of how rude this guy was and we walked out. A couple minutes later I went in again and asked the other guy behind the counter for his manager's name. When he said "Danny" the manager, who was helping other customers, turned and saw me. I told Danny that I live across the street & would never come back because of his attitude, to which he responded "What attitude?", WITH that same rude attitude. No apology, no attempt to explain himself, no attempt to keep a potential regular. So no business from me.
