AWFUL. first off, husband got food poisoning from eating here. Took the server forever to come take our order. This was after the hostess forgot to leave us a menu. Took 45 minutes for our appetizer to show up. It was kind of gross. Then it took another half hour to get our regular food brought out to us. It was disgusting. they got my husbands order incorrect, but we didn't send it back because we didn't know when we would actually get it brought back out to us since it took so long to get to us in the first place. We were lucky if our water got refilled. The atmosphere is ok. The chips and salsa we're good. I like the green chili salsa stuff whatever it was. Many tables around us did not get their food forever either. But we will NEVER EVER  go back to this place again. Especially if my husband's going to be puking within a few hours of eating there. I would give this place zero stars if I could. One star seems like it's too high for them.
