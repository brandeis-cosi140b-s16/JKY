They did not take my order down correctly. I ordered a burrito and requested all bean vs rice as a side.  They did not specify this on the ticket. When I got a plate full of rice I expressed that I did not want the rice and requested all bean.  Instead of placing the burrito on a new plate that had all being they just didn't even give me my side f***** my burrito in a bag. They're extremely slow so if you're in a hurry trying to get to your next flight I do not recommend this establishment not to mention they can't even get your order correct.
