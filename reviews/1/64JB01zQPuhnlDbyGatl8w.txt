Terrible service and handling of food at this location. We love chipotle and have given this location multiple chances. If this was the first or only location we would never go to Chipotle again. There are many locations nearby that are safer to eat at. DO NOT GO TO THIS location. Service manager Isaac and General manager Jessica are of little help.
