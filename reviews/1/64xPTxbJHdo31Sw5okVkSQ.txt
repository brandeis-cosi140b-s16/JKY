I went to Three Amigos to order one tostada for starters the chips and salsa brought out to the table was bland the chips were cold when my  dish came out they brought out three tostada's instead of one. When I brought this to the waitresses attention she stated that she made a mistake and took the other two tostada's off my plate! This alarmed me because I figured why would they want to take back to items off my plate I could have coughed on them or anything and your not supposed to re-serve them to other people!!! Needless to say I was very disappointed and will never return I also question they cleanliness and wonder what they did with the food that they took back off  my plate!!!!
