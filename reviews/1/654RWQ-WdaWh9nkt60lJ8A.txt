The service at this location was terrible! My husband and I wanted to get a quick bite to eat for an early dinner. Since Del Taco is walking distance away, we figured we'd give it a go. What a mistake! 

First off, this location shares a building with a Shell Gas Station so the parking lot was a hot mess. We almost got run over just trying to get to the door. 

The store had a sticky dirty feeling to it inside. We stood at the counter for a full five minutes before anyone acknowledged our existence. Finally, a man wearing a drive through headset took our order. He was very curt with us and rushed through the transaction. When I asked how big the large fountain drink was, he simply rang me up for a large drink instead.

The food was passable at best. We both opted for one of the epic burritos. More like mediocre burrito! The beans in mine are undercooked, the avocado was turning brown and the chicken was extremely bland. I'm not familiar with this chain, however, so maybe this is just par for the course. I'll give them a pass on the food.

While we were trying to enjoy our meal, not one, not two but three different people came and asked my husband and I for money. Now I understand that this is Central Phoenix but this made for an uncomfortable dining atmosphere. 

As we were leaving, I attempted to use their one and only bathroom before making the half mile walk back to the house. No such luck. I thought perhaps I needed a key to use the bathroom so I walked up to the counter. I made eye contact with the girl behind the counter, starting talking to her and she literally turned and walked away from me, and started playing on her phone. My jaw just about hit the floor! It's one thing to be too busy to take orders or help customers. It's another thing entirely to be so rude and unprofessional. I ended up using the bathroom at the Shell and walking home. 

If you want Mexican food with a side of sass and bad service, this Del Taco is the place for you!
