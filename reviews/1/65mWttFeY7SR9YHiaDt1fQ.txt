It's Friday. I went in for a quick bite to eat. Ordered 2 shredded beef tacos and 1 fish taco. While I was waiting for my order I look down in disgust. This place is infested with cockroaches. I completely lost my appetite. I did mention this to employees. They said they'd let the manager know. Ewwww, I want to give them 0 stars
