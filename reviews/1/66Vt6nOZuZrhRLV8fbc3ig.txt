If you want overpriced tasteless mariscos this is your place. Its smaller than your average popular mariscos in phoenix and doesnt have those loud live bands(it did have karaoke). But the food was just bland and extremely overpriced. The servers keep trying to push to buy more beer(gets annoying) and never offer to refill sodas or water, just beer(strange). I had the shrimp and octopus coktel. and it was just plain. no good flavor. I think i have given up on Phoenix marisco restaurants. as they are all the same concept: overpriced food and the place to come to show off you can buy a bunch of beer.
