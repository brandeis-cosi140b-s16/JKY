I will not be returning to the Tempe Market Place Chipotle. We order from there at least once a month and the last three times I have placed an order they have gotten it wrong. It doesn't  matter if I order over the phone, on line or have someone else pick it up for me. How hard is it to add all the ingredients you ask for? Take your time and do it right quit trying to rush people through your lines!
