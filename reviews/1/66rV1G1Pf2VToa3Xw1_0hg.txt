This should be a zero star experience.  Came in at about quarter to 8 on a Saturday night.  Can't say the host was particularly welcoming.  The decor and menus were interesting but we were completely ignored by all of the waitstaff walking by for a good 15 minutes.  Departed.  Phoenix has plenty of other places to spend our money.  Taco Guild fail!
