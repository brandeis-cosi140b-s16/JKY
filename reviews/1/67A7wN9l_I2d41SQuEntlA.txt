Horrible experience. Ordered one if the most simplest plates 'Quesadilla w/ Carne Asada' waited,...and waited my family finished eating before I even got my plate. By the time They brought the plate over everyone at my table were done eating, so I had to get it to go. One thing I hate the most is people messing around with my food. This is ridiculous.
