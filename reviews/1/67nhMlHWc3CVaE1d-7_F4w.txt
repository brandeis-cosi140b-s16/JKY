Happy hour soft tacos (plate of 3) had a few near-microscopic cheese crumbles and three small tomato chunks. I asked for hot sauce with "please" on top and what was to be a 30-second favor turned into me going up to the counter and asking for a bottle after several minutes. There were only 2 other occupied tables in the place.
Gorgeous servers, but they didn't care about us gringos and I felt dismissed, ignored, resented and stiffed.
IF I return with my friends in the future by way of being out-voted, I'll give it another chance and update my review hopefully for the better. If NOT for the better, you can bet you'll hear about it here.
