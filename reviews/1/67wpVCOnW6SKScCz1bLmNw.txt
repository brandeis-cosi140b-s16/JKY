Against my better judgement, I stopped here to get a snack on the way home Friday.  The whole point of me stopping here was to be in and out quickly and this experience was anything but.

I could see they were busy since the drive-thru had wrapped around the building once so I decided to park and go inside to save me some minutes and some screaming and yelling in my personal vehicle.... I ordered a regular value meal thinking it would be faster, but it took a really long time for it to come out.  I'm trying to be objective and not exaggerate, but if I wanted to go to a sit-down restaurant I think the food would have come out faster than this taco bell.  Not only that, but it seems like the people in front of me waited forever as well - it was a group of friends and one of them had already finished eating and his friends were still waiting on their food.

Overall, bad experience - could have been a bad night, but I don't think I will be visiting this location any time again.
