Today we arrived at Macayo's with a large party of co-workers. We did not make a reservation, so we had to wait a while for tables to open up. When we were finally shown to our tables, we proceeded to wait approximately 40 minutes until our orders were taken. After approximately another 30 minute wait, we were finally served. When our meals arrived, they got our orders incorrect. When we attempted to point out the discrepancy to the waitress, we were promptly ignored as they helped other guests. After about another 15 minute wait, we had to explain to a ANOTHER server that our order was incorrect. We finally requested that the order just be dropped from our tab completely, due to the fact that they could not get it right. We were told that the person who prepared our meal was new and couldn't quite work it out properly. We then waited approximately another 15 minutes as they had to correct our final check. While we were leaving, we noticed the manager at the register and we attempted to let him know about the discrepancies that happened to us during the course of our meal, but his explanation to the problem was "if we would've called ahead, we would have gotten better service". No Bueno!
