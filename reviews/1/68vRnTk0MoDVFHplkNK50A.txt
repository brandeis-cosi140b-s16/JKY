It's shocking when AZ yelpers get Mexican food wrong.  The fact that this shit hole has a 4 Star average is comedic.

I took my wife and kids here for the second and last time over the weekend.  I'd ordered the carne asada burro the last time I was here and it was OK for a dive, but nothing special and it didn't taste fresh.  This time was one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had.  I shudder to call it a "dining experience" at all.

First of all, they had some unhappy, unfriendly, unkempt high school chick working the counter.  She didn't say hello or make a half assed effort to offer decent customer service.  After I sat my family at a dirty table, or at least the cleanest in the place, I reluctantly ordered the pollo asado and rolled tacos.  

The rolled tacos tasted like they were frozen and reheated.  Not fresh, bland, boring, and I'm not convinced it was beef.  

The pollo asado was also clearly not fresh and the meat looked like turkey pot pie pieces, except this was no comfort food.  These chunks of meat had the consistency of rubber and the color of ash.  And it tasted funny...  That's the best I could describe it, just didn't taste right.

We quickly informed the asshole working at the counter that the food tasted funny and asked if we could get something else.  She looked at me strange, like I farted, then asked me to yell across the room to tell the manager -- while guests were in there eating.  The lazy manager finally stammered over, stared at the food, never making eye contact, and asked, "What do you want me to do?"  No apology, just a dirty look and some slightly better shitty food.

Stay away from this place.  They don't care about customers.  They don't care about putting out quality food.  You shouldn't care about them.
