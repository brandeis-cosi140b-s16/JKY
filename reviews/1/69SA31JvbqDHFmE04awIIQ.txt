Alright well first of all. As we speak i am on the shitter with massive boiling diarrhea. Pollo loco got my ass burnin!! I suggest you dont go anywhere near this place unless you want rectal cancer. The chicken taste like they wiped it across the bathroom floors and the customer service, dont get me started on the customer service. Not be racist but are they trying to hire any whites any time soon? I have to read a fucken Spanish dictionary before i walk in this fucken place. Overall i'd eat there again. It was alright..
