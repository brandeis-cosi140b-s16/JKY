We were in last week and have been in before several times. Our waitress was really nice. During our meal, we flagged her over to get more drinks. She looked upset and tried to cover it up. We asked her what was wrong and she finally told us that Paco the chef was yelling at her and being a huge jerk. She said she didn't even do anything wrong, he has such a bad temper. 
Paco is so unprofessional and out of line to handle a back of the house situation like that. As someone who was in the restaurant industry for years, I knew to talk about issues at the end of a shift or on a day off, never in the middle. 
I hope upper management steps in and reprimands Paco for his immature behavior. We will not be returning to the restaurant!
