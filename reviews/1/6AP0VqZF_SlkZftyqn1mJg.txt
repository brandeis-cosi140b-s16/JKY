My wife and I decided to give this place a try while in downtown for a show.  We sat at the bar, which was covered in dirty glasses and plates.  The bartender (Michael) seemed a bit occupied, but managed to clear some space.  

We asked for menus, but were never asked if we would like to order.  They had some chips and salsa in the bar, but neither was good.  After one drink each and some chips and lousy service we decided to try out luck elsewhere.  

I am all for supporting locally owned places and like the location, but would never go back here again.
