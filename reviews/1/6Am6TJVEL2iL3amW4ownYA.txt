Why is it that every time I go here I fool myself thinking it's going to get better. It doesn't.  A one-star rating is super generous for this location.

Went through the drive-up about 7:30pm Friday night, they were holding all the cars back from ordering by announcing "we'll be with you in a few minutes" over the speaker.  Well, a few minutes turned into about 15 considering there were a couple of cars in front of me.  After I ordered and rounded the corner to the window, I realized what the hold up was.  They are timed at how long cars sit at the window and didn't want a line of people waiting and messing up their numbers.

So, I was extremely specific on what I wanted, and again like an idiot I got all the way home to find out it was wrong.  So back in my car I get and drive all the way back to have it corrected (knowing that by the time I get home everyone else will have finished their meal and I will be eating alone).

I walk in and immediately the night manager Sergio gives me a bad attitude.  I showed him the receipt and asked him to remake the item and to give me a refund for my time, gas, trouble...whatever.  He cops a total attitude with me and says I can have a refund or item re-made but I'm not going to get both.

You know, for a couple of two dollar tacos (that probably cost them a nickel each to make) you would think they would do what they could to keep a pretty regular customer coming back a couple of times a month.

There are way too many other options out there for me to ever go back to this Del Taco.  Thanks to Sergio and his lack of customer service skills.
