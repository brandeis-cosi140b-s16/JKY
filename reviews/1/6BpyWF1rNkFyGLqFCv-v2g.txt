This place is always busy but I don't get it.   Went here last night for dinner with my parents after not having been here for over a year.   The portions DEFINITELY are smaller.  The food, in my opinion, is very inconsistent.    Sometimes ok, other times awful.   However, the only thing you can count on here is over salted food, warm salsa and chewy beef.   Poor quality con queso, tastes like out of a jar.  A manager came by our table and we asked if they reduced their portion sizes.   He said the  portion sizes have not changed just the size of the tortillas.  You figure that one out.
