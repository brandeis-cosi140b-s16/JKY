Asado has closed, proving reviewers that gave this place high marks know nothing about good Mexican food. From the start this business provided terrible service and even worse food.  While the margaritas were good, that is not a way to drive business. The owners have posted a sign on the door blaming the neighborhood for not supporting the restaurant, when had they simply paid attention to sites like this one it would become obvious they were serving bad food. Instead of reworking the menu, or hiring someone that knows how to cook, they just watched until no one would go there.  The sign on the door makes it a certainty the next concept will fail, blaming your customers for not eating your lousy food is no way to build goodwill, all that nasty sign does is alienate people away from the next restaurant. Not too bright are we?
