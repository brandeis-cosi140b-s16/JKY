No no no...do not go here, now I'm not talking about the fact that the place looks crappy, or the bathroom is suspect but the fact that the food is nasty. It was completely empty when we were there and that should have been some indication on what to expect but no I am a glutten for punishment. I ordered some tacos and didn't even finish the meal I ended up just tossing the food and still got a tummy ache from what little I did eat. This place is definitely not a good look
