Okay I have being going here off and on for years and for the most part they done pretty decent with 3 1/2 stars with me. This last time was not pleasant I found tortilla chip crumbs on the seat on the floor and  my table it felt and smelled like it was wipe with a bar rag or worse! I was seated right away but was not acknowledge for 10 minutes and the place was not busy. For me I ordered the typical Sonoran lunch which consisted of a Red Burrito rice and beans. So here it goes... the rice and beans were average you can't really mess those up! As for my Red Burrito it was more like train wreck coming out of Tijuana! The red chili tasted too pasty due to the fact they put too much flour in The red chili sauce that's what gives thickness to red chilies and green chilies in a lot of these Mexican restaurants. The thicker the chili sauce means too much flour! I can go on an on about my lunch but I like to be a nice guy on yelp! My Experience this time around was well below average! let's be fair I will come back in about 3 to 6 months after they get the new cook!
