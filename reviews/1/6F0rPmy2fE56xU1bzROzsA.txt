very rude! customer service is a total zero here! First off cashier was asking what sauce i wanted but i didn't hear so asked her to repeat and she yelled "sauce!" as if I'm deaf. Then at end of a extremely long wait at the drive through window despite no one being in front of me  my order was completely incorrect! VERY dissatisfied customer will not return! if you want quality  customer service and food spend the extra few minutes driving to a place that can politely get your food in a timely manner correct
