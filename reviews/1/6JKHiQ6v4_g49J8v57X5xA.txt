Recently opened in the old max & erma's, the outdoor renovations are beautiful. The inside is weird. Sterile, overly bright, carpeted floors and odd decor for being a brand new place. 

Both experiences here have been dull. Chips are too thick and salsa couldn't be blander. They did accommodate my special request for onion and pepper chimichangas. 2 came on the plate, and it was a ridiculously large amount of food. However, the chimi had been fried too long and tasted of stale oil. Combine that with the cheese dip on top, the meal was too much. Too heavy and no flavor. 

I recently tried the weekend buffet (11-3). There is almost nothing vegetarian on the buffet, but for $7.50 one can't possibly complain.
