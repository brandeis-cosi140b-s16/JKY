Don't go here! Waited 20 minutes for quesadillas. Wanted cheese only for my 4 year old, they refused and said they could only do meat in the quesadillas. Then they proceeded to tell me that I was waiting so long because the food is made fresh to order which is fine, but then why can't you make my quesadillas cheese only? I paid for extra salsa that they insisted was in the box. I looked, didn't see it, informed them and they told me it was. I was too irritated over the wait, so I just left. Thanks for the bland nachos and subpar chicken quesadillas. To add insult to injury, the manager kept coming to the to-go counter, but not addressing a single problem. Useless.
