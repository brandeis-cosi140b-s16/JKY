This joint just opened up by my house, so I thought that on $1.99 burrito tuesday i would give it a shot. What a mistake. I was pulling chunks of inedible food out of my mouth. It was those parts of the chicken, you know the ones, the connective cartilege, chunks of bone, grizzle, fat. I know that it was only $2.00 but really? Taco Bell delivers better food, and that is saying alot. 

Their salsa is weak at best. I asked for hot salsa, it was not even close. The mild green tabasco sauce i buy has more flavour and heat. 

What a complete waste of money. I would never go back.
