OK let's establish right off the bat that this is a bar/restaurant  INSIDE AN AIRPORT. Still, is it too hard to pleasantly greet a customer when they come in or at least point them to an empty table in this hellhole of an establishment? I've been here twice and like all airport restaurants, the upsell starts as soon as my rear end hits the seat. Do I look like a guy who needs a drink at 9:45am? No, I don't want the keg-sized beer.  And no, I don't want a shot of tequila (for just $2 more!) with my beer.

Food is just ok...sort of a faux-Mex. But the rudeness is what kills this place. The only ones even remotely pleasant are the bartenders, who are constantly trying to push the gigunda-sized beer...and the shot of tequila....
