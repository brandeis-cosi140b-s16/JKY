This place sucks.

The amount of food on the plates is absolutely TINY and VERY expensive. Not to mention the actual quality of the food is mediocre at best. Got the enchilada combo plate and there was a thin layer of food that barely rose above the lip of the flat plate. It was like eating food in 2D since there was no depth of sustenance. I think my printer could print out a thicker layer of ink than the thickness of food on the plate. Honestly, Taco Bell destroys this place in quality and amount of food given. The food is very simple and could be made for a couple dollars at home. No value whatsoever.

Service was meh. Large party? Forget about it as they can't deal with it. I was continually bumped in my shoulder by the servers as they retrieved and placed dishes and glasses.

They have a live mariachi band on some nights which was pretty cool but they don't play at some stage in the middle of the restaurant, they walk around and play RIGHT by your table VERY loudly which is extremely annoying while trying to eat or even talk with your party. 

Also, location? It's in a dive of a place with many rowdy bars nearby and just a single working light pole in a rather large parking lot. It's the kind of place you wonder if your car is going to get broken into.
