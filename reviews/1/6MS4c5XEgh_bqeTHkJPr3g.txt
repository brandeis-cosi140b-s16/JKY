STAY AWAY. There is a creepy 50 something guy that is working there. He never changes his gloves either and made some disturbing comments to my friend. This gentleman looks like a misplaced construction worker. There was a Mexican kid right next to him making tortillas and he bullied his way into making all the orders. He should be digging ditches. Also the cashier was another white guy that seemed out of place. At least RIO keeps it real with workers who I usually can't understand.
 Anyway, the food is equally disappointing in this chain hell. You got three kinds of beans - all of which looked nasty and my pinto beans lived up to that hype. Enchilada was a disaster - don't order grilled chicken, it appears to be packaged strips thrown on the grill prior to cooking. Prices were reasonable. No salsa bar at all and the rice (at least the Mexican kind) was very gummy. This is not even Mexican food. Go across the shopping center and get a great falafel. This place should close soon, but Vegas idiots love chain food and it will probably become a hallmark of the shopping center for years to come.
