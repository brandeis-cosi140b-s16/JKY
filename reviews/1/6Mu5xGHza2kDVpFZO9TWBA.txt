Ick!  Everything was bland, service was slow, no bathroom.

After reading reviews tried the green chile burrito. No flavor.  Same with rice and beans.  Bland.  My son and husband had tacos and the shells were tough and greasy.  My husband ran to the bathroom when we got home.

You have to pay for chips and salsa (they were out of guac).  Chips were also tough and greasy.

Won't go back...ick.
