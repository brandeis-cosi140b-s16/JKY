This truncated review is based on free fish taco promotion that they have, I guess annually, at this chain. One time was all I needed to stain my amygdala with the horror that is the experience of a fish taco at Rubio's Fresh Mexican Grill. 

We went at nighttime. Not sure if this mattered; and it might have been for ANY tacos, but all they had left was fish. I cannot remember; it was maybe two years ago. I figured this place - the location -  if not the entire chain would be CLOSED due to insolvency by now, it was that terrible. 

So we had fish tacos. My girlfriend had one and I had one. I don't remember there being that many people there; it was weeknight. We were going to the Regal right next door afterwards to catch some forgettable picture. 

The fish taco was the worst fish taco I have ever had. In fact, I have never had another fish taco since then, now that I think of it. My organism as a whole said NO MORE FISH TACOS, GUY after the experience. 

I will never patronise Rubio's again, but I hope to someday, with lots of therapy, be able to overcome my fear of fish tacos and have another one (somewhere far far away). - E
