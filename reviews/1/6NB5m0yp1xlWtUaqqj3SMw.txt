Went in for lunch today. Could not believe bad service I received. Hostess seemed confused that should have been a sign to leave. Got seated but was 15 minutes before  someone came to take my order. 15 minutes is not good. Not like they were busy, only 2 other tables were seated. Finally got my food. Food is there is always good. Was surprised that didn't get my drink refilled at all. Normally service there is awesome. But didn't recognize any of staff today. Very disappointed with experience today. Will be awhile before I return.  Hope they work on service...
