Went here for lunch upon arrival in Las Vegas. Husband and I were super hungry and thought Mexican food would hit the spot. Service was very attentive however the food was disappointing overall. Salsa was less than impressive, chips were good. I got the taquitos appetizer and for $8 they were disappointing. My husband ordered some kind of Angus tacos (3) with rice and beans. For $18 I expected tacos with some beef to them, they were about the size of the palm of my hand, very unsatisfactory. We will not be returning. Too much money for very little food, isn't Mexican food generally inexpensive?!
