How can I be still hungry and spending $15 for 4 tacos and soda my tacos were broken so oily in the amount of meat it was sadly very insignificant for being a Mexican restaurant with no flavor is so sad but the prices are so high I do not recommend this place,and I will never go back those prices are crazy.I called  they say that the manager is the ones who make those decisions I'm surprised they still have a job and a place still open. The quality of the food is embarrassing for The truth Mexican food.
