We had never been here before and heard the commercials so thought we'd try it. Hostess was a capital "B"!! We were sat after 15 minutes by the wait station even though the restaurant was only 1/4 full. 

They had brunch, not what we were interested in. The menu (I assume because of brunch) was very limited. We got the trio chips appetizer which we both liked. Nothing special but good. DH got a draft beer which was flat. I had ice tea it was fine. I ordered the seafood enchiladas, DH the Barbacolla enchiladas. Both were horrible. Tasteless. There was no spice, no heat, bland and gross. Maybe good for our winter visitors. Our waiter was fine. There was a tray of dirty dishes right behind DH the entire time we were there, besides the fact that it was right by the wait station where at least 5 wait staff placed orders there. 

Don't know what the hype is. Won't be returning, I have had better prepackaged frozen dinners.
