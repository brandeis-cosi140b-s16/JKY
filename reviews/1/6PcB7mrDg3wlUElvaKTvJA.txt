What happened to this place! It's been a while since I stopped in but it was most likely the last. The staff seems uninterested and depressed. It took an eternity to get our food. Apparently drive thru has priority, so we had to wait about 15-20 minutes. The prices have skyrocketed. I ordered a California Burrito and was shocked it was $7.50! I asked for guacamole on the side instead of inside, I didn't get it at all. Also missing from my burrito was cheese and pico. I asked for the pico and she said it was $1 more!  I basically got a scoop of old cold carne asada and a few undercooked french fries (yes I said french fries). It was gross. Also the chicken in my wifes tacos was dry and flavorless. This place used to be good at one point. Someburros and Cafe Rio are right down the street, I can get a much better and fresher burrito for the same or cheaper cost. No need to come back here.
