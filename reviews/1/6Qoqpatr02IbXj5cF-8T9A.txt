I have flown numerous times and never, once at an airport have I been kicked out of a place because I wasn't eating their food. I've been at the airport for almost 9 hours due to airplane problems. Ate at this place this morning. There are no community tables or an area to really eat except in the benches by the terminals. The lady was rude. Kicked out flight attendants on a lay over as well. Just rude. Ps the food wasn't all that great. Ended up throwing out half of my burrito that was 9$  waste of money
