I decided to try this joint out since it's just around the corner from my house today. I ordered a bacon breakfast burrito with red and green sauce as I like to mix them. My first few bites were egg and grease only. Grease dripped out of the bottom and top of my burrito. Gross. Why I continued to eat I'm not sure. I hit the bacon in another bite or 2. I'm not even sure it was bacon... I chewed and chewed and chewed. I ended up having to spit it out (Sorry if that was TMI). I opened the burrito to check out the rest of the 'bacon' only to find the worst quality of bacon fat and pools of grease. My appetite was gone. From now on I'll drive the extra few miles to Los Favoritos which is 150% better quality and better prices!
