Awful experience. Sat at the bar and waited several minutes before plates and glasses were removed from the previous customer and had to ask for the counter to be wiped clean for us. Took 10 minutes to get a drink and 30 minutes to get our food...which was served cold. When we asked for the manager she came and removed the cold food. We told her we didn't want anything else since the rest of our party had already finished eating. When the bill arrived and we asked if there was anything else they could do to compensate us for our terrible time, she argued with us. We will NEVER go back to this place. The food is great but it's a shame the management is so terrible.
