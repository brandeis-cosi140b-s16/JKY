I'm not sure what exactly has happened, but something has changed at Pasquals. Unfortunately not for the better...

 I have waited a long time before addding this update - I wanted to make sure I was being fair to them.  

The service has really gone down hill!   I cannot believe how long we have had to wait to order and then receive our food.  Again, to be be fair to them, we keep coming back.  However we are going to take a seriously long break from Pasquals.  The last time it took 45 minutes to receive our food once we ordered it.  We have young children.  One of the appeals of Pasquals has always been how family friendly they are.  45 Minutes is too long for young kids to sit waiting for food.  People around us were equally frustrated.  One couple asked to cancel their meals/order because it was taking so long and they had a movie to catch.  Another couple had to corner the server when she was at the wait station just to pay their bill.  

Finally...  get some shades for those windows!!  It is ridiculous that people have to sit there and be blinded.
