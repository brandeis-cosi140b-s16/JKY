Horrible customer service. I ordered a grilled chicken salad in it so it was supposed to come with avocado I got home and there was no avocado the manager claims that he put avocado on my salad. Instead of putting my name down he made me come all the way back down. He was down right rude, unprofessional and should not be running a restaurant by no means. He would not give me his name or any of the stores information, he ignored me and I had to ask his employee. I do not recommend this place to anyone. I will travel down to rolibertos in a heart beat off greenway and grand.
