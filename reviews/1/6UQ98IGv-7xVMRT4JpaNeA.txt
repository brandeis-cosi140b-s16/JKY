I've gone here 4 different times with family/friends that wanted to try this place. Each time I ate here, I absolutely hated it.  I tried to convince family/friends to go somewhere else, with no luck.

So, in hopes of a change of heart, I ordered different entrees each time & tried to keep an open mind. Everything I ordered was mediocre or tasteless.  The chicken wings are decent to my surprise. Pina Coladas taste like there is no alcohol and prices are high for the quality of food/service. 

Service is the worst and extremely slow, even when it's not busy.  I almost always tip 20% when I dine out, but I find myself tipping 15%  or lower every time I dine here (and this is being nice/polite). The servers aren't too bright, seem like they don't like their job, and act unprofessional.

To confirm my rating,  I say/express absolutely nothing to the people I dine with. I ask them how they liked dinner AND... I always get "it was ok", "probably won't come back" and *drum roll please*
"IT WAS AWFUL".
