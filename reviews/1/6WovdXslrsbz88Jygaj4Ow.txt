Just avoid this craphole.  We've lived in the area for about six years, I know it's fast food but over the years the quality has degraded to the point that my dogs run from it.  I'd go into detail about the crap we got but I'll save you the sickening details.  Worst part is I actually filed a complaint with their corp and still haven't heard back.  Take the time to drive an extra mile if you really need fast chain Mexican and get Taco Bell.
