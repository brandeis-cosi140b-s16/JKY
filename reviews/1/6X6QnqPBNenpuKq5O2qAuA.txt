Wow, what an absolutely horrible experience!

We've been coming to this Chipotle for years, and what started out as average has become well below unsatisfactory. We got there tonight about 7:30pm, and knew it was after their dinner rush. Once we walked in, we noticed the dining area was pretty empty, and the line only had 3 people...score!

Well, so we thought. The crew except for 2 people were hanging out in the back and although they saw us and we all saw them, they didn't budge (including the manager). Finally, we got to get our order started and the rudeness of the girl at the first station was almost enough for us to abandon our attempt. Then, as we proceeded down the line, it just got worse and worse. I'd say they skimped on our burrito bowls, but that would be way too generous. I actually had to request and pay for extra meat just to get some in my bowl.

Sure, it's fast food, and kinda sorta used to be cheap. But skimp on the food AND the service? Shame on you Chipotle, shame.
