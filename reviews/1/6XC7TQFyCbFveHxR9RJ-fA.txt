So, misleading and sub-par food.  "Free chips and salsa with 'any' purchase." Nope.  Only with food.  $3.00 tequila shots? The display is a bottle of 1800.  The $3.00 is 'in the back' and cheeeeap.  1800 is $8.00-misleading.  Margaritas?  No tequilla we can taste, but plenty of Kool-Aid.

The "2 for one" margaritas?  Only applies to the BIGGEST Margaritas.  So again, all false and misleading.

Now to be fair-chips are 'meh' and salsa really is Pico de Gallo in a thimble cup.  But if you just buy a bottle of beer and sit at the bar (unmanned right now) overlooking the strip, it is o.k..  Save your eating cash for anywhere else.
