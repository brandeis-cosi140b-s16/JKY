They triple charged my credit card ......and gave me some ridiculous excuse that they would remove the charges within a few days.

I called the Manager who has yet to call me back to take care of this. Basically they are holding several hundred dollars hostage.

I have NEVER seen a restaurant that fraudulently triple charges your credit card and then does not fix it IMMEDIATELY.

AVOID THE SANDBAR.....their bartenders are morons.
