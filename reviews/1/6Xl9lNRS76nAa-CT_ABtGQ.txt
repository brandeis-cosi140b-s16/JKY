Horrible place. Went there last week and after I had placed my order I drive up and they tell me they have just ran out of beef! WTF?! Taco Bell out of beef!?! Just ridiculous. So went back today I ordered a salad, the fiery box and a side of lava sauce. First off the tacos looked like they were wrapped by my 3 yr old, produce was falling out of the bag, tacos were not placed in a "box", container with lava sauce not even a third way full, plus it has a funny smell to it, no fork with my salad and to top it all off I found a strand of hair in my salad!!!!! Only giving it 1 star because I have to give it something. On my way back to get my money
