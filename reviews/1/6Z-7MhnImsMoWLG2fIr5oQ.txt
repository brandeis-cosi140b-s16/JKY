There are alot of great choices for Mexican food in the Phoenix area. Macayos is not one of them.  We've eaten at several of the restaurants in the Valley including the Surprise location (twice), and the only consistency is bad food.  We're finally done with Macayos.

We lived in Arizona and New Mexico a great part of our life and we've experienced wonderful cuisine. We've also lived in the Pacific Northwest where Mexican food is awful. Macayos reminds me of some of the gringo places in Seattle.

The food is bland. The salsa has very little flavor. OK, the portions are big if that's what you want. There are so many better options out there.
