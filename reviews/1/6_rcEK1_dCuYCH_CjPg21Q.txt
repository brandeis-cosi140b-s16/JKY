Tried to go to dinner here. Was told there was a 30 minute wait, said that was fine, we will sit and wait in bar. Nope 30 mins wait for everything bar and restaurant! But lots of open seats in the bar..didn't matter. We left shaking our heads as did next 2 couples that walked in behind us. I think they need to rethink their seating policy.
