Worst taco restaurant I've ever been to. Stood in line for over 30 mins because the girls behind the counter took their time. One lady was bad mouthing to her coworker about how my fianc√© and I because we were putting to many toppings on our tacos. She should not be working there. Then after that she was flicking the cheese off her fingers all over the other toppings. Very poor customer service!!!!! Never coming back again.
