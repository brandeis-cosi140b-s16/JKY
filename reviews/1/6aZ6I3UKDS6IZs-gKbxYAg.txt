I will never go back here again! Went here to celebrate my birthday, they refused to let one of our guests in stating his out of state license was a fake- with no proof and couldn't give us any explanation. The bouncer was rude and our guest had to go to back to our hotel to get his passport which clearly states the same information and come back to Old Town Scottsdale. I say stay clear it's not worth the hassle. 

The staff is on a HUGE power trip!
