I tried to order 12 breasts via the drive-thru, and the woman's voice on the speaker told me simply "I can't give you twelve breasts" as if there was a rule against it.  This was a large order, but not so large that it shouldn't be fillable on demand.

We debated it for a little bit through the speaker, and she then said that if I were to wait 20 minutes, she would be able to fill my order.  There were other things as well, and a 20 minute wait in a drive-thru doesn't work, so I went inside to order.

When I arrived, the same woman told me that "if I sell you 12 breasts, then I don't have any chicken to sell other people."  She actually explained to me that "chickens only have two breasts."  I instantly felt like she did not want MY business. 

Let me take this forum to explain something to the woman who dealt with me:  YOU SELL CHICKEN.  WHEN SOMEONE COMES INTO THE STORE TO BUY IT, YOU SELL IT TO THEM.  YOU DO NOT TELL THEM THAT SELLING IT TO THEM WOULD BE BAD.

I've never had someone ACTIVELY discourage me from spending money in their establishment.  Thankfully I don't live in this area.  I would not visit this store again.
