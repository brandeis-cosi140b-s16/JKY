I would give zero stars but I am not sure it would post.
If you like freezing cold food with warm ice tea , you have found it! Horrible service, we were greeted with a bowl of broken store bought chips and weak salsa, that was the high point! The waiter forgot to enter our order, when the food finally came it was ice cold. The manager picked up the tab, I prefer to have a good meal and pay. This Was torture. The staff is clueless. Sam fox has jumped the shark.
