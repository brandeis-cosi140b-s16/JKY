Tuesday at 5 pm .
1) No a.c. in building 2 fans set up for ventilation
2) Not good food and sorta luke warm 
3) Bathrooms smell like raw sewage !!! 

It is very sad that a company makes 500 million a year and the CEO of the company makes 40 million a year but there resteraunts that have hard working employees at minimum wage must suffer ... so sad that this can be legal 

( I work for Fire safety and am in fast food and resteraunts almost all day long and no this is not just one occurrence , stuff never gets fixed ) 

SO SAD
