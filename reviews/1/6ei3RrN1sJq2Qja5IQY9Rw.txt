Oh...heck, no...never again!

Went there on a Sunday afternoon around 1PM with my daughter.  The family in front of us was seated quickly, and then they turned to us and said, "Would you like to sit in the bar?  It's faster in there?" We quietly sat down, opened the menus and then said "What the H?????"  We didn't go to Garcia's on a Sunday afternoon to SIT IN THE BAR and have FOOTBALL as our entertainment!  We got up, told the hostess she made a very poor decision in asking us to sit there and we left.  Did I mention that there were only about 4 tables with patrons at this time?  I don't know what that was about but I can tell you it's the last time I'm going to Garcias!
