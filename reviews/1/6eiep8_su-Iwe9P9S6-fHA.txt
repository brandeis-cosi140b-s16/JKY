Went here for lunch on the suggestion of someone who raved about this place. It is essentially like a Qdoba (do they have those here?), and in my opinion, Qdoba is MUCH better. This place was, how do I say it? ew. I had a fish taco, and I didn't even finish it. Bland, watery fish. Even the mango salsa was no good. I have no desire to return here.
