The food is good and so are the options BUT..

The food could be so much better! The food did look like it was left out and was only bothered when a customer walked through the door. The girl who helped me was very nice! 

However, the supervisor came to help another customer and her entire attire was just a mess! I felt inclined to tell her to fix herself up. Not out of disrespect but this woman's hair was really bushy and she had white flakes around her entire uniform (she wore a black polo) shirt. I ended up eating the food which was actually pretty decent. 

Two weeks later I drove by the place again (to go to Starbucks) and saw the same bushy haired woman through the window. My sister was in the passenger seat and said "Look at that girl! Why isn't she wearing a hair net?" I mean this was through the window of my car and the restaurant.

I didn't leave a review before but after seeing that again I thought I should give civilians a heads up. I mean if someone doesn't feel their appearance should be maintained while at work, then who knows how they run the place - especially a supervisor!

Thank God I didn't get sick because I noticed some reviews said they had. If you decide to eat here you better pray over your food.
