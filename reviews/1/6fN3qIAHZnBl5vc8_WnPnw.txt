La Bamba where the burritos are as big as your head.  I suppose this would be true if I had Beetlejuice's head after he gets it shrunken by the voodoo guy.  They aren't as big as your head, so if you go in there thinking you are going to nosh on a seriously huge burrito, you are going to be let down.  Just when you think "oh well, maybe it'll at least taste good," you find out the disappointing truth, the burritos are bland and full of dry rice.  Booooo!  The path to gigantic burrito enlightenment is not here my friends, just keep on drivin' by.
