This was the WORST Mexican food I have ever had, by far. I would give it a minus star or two if that was possible. Had to pay $2.75 extra for a beef machaca option on my chimichanga, and I expected shredded beef with no fillers. There was huge pieces of piping hot tomato and bell pepper inside, and the meat was flavorless and watery. My wife was asked if the would like sour cream & guacamole with her dish (which was also not meaty and very watery). She said OK- they brought two tiny containers. We also were charged an extra $2.50, and were not informed of that. I am from California, and am almost 50 years old, so I have eaten a lot of authentic Mexican food. This was garbage in it's highest form. The place also didn't smell good, and was dirty. Amazing they have been in business this long. The prices are also very high for any restaurant, especially one with this poor quality.
