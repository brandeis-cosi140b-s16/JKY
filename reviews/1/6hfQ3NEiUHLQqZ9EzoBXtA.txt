I have been to this particular store before and have had decent service and food, but I will NOT go here again. 

 After a long day of errands I stopped here on my way home.  First off the speaker system was so bad the lady inside had a hard time understanding what I wanted and I had to repeat things 2 or more times.  Then once I got home I found that half of my order was missing and the part that was there was burnt beyond being edible.  The chicken was so burnt and dry I can't imagine why anyone would serve it, the fries looked like they had been in the fryer for way too long and then had been sitting out for hours.  The only thing I was able to eat out of the whole thing was the tortillas and even they were cold by time I got home.  I would have gone back to complain and get my money back but didn't want to waste my time on a lousy fast food place.
