Lunched here today. We used a "Living Social" coupon, which obviously confused the lady who was running the register. As a result of her confusion, she charged my debit card for the whole amount, then had to refund it, then had to charge it again, and somehow came up with a different amount that I owed every time. 

The second strike against this place was that it took 45 minutes from the time we ordered our four tacos until we actually received them. 

Third strike, the food was below average in my opinion. I had the beef taco and the carnitas taco, both super greasy meat, with less than impressive flavors. The salsa was ok. My sister had the AZ super taco and the shrimp taco, her were better than mine, but still not fabulous. 

Add those three strikes to the fact that they have a very cramped little parking lot and that pretty much left me knowing that I won't be heading back there anytime soon... or ever.
