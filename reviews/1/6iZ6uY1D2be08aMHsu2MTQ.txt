One of the all time worst restaurant experience. Service was non existent...except for the bus boy who told us we weren't one of his tables so he couldn't help us. After 15 minutes I finally went to the hostess desk and someone who appeared to be a manager finally found us a waitress. Unfortunately this waitress was obviously not happy to be serving our part of the restaurant and made it clear she wasn't our waitress but would help out. Food was very, very bland. When we couldn't find anyone to bring our check we made our way back to the hostess desk and saw the manager and wait staff eating their dinner and chatting. Apparently they forgot they still had paying customers in the restaurant.
