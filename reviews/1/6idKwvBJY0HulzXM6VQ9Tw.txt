I live in this area and I first thought it would be a descent place ..first experience Menudo was descent but overpriced ...second time came with friends only because they wanted to try it ....worst experience ever ...horrible service they ran out of bread for the Menudo...hominy was out of a can ...meat was not sorted and was all dark Menudo meat aka bad meat ....80% meat 20% canned hominy...chips were stale...I asked for new chips and was told they are the same as the others in back ...torta was dried meat..best part TORTILLAS WERE SUPPOSED TO FRESH...WHICH THEY WERE THE FIRST TIME I WENT CORN SPECIFICALLY...2ND TIME I WENT I GOT FLOWER AND THEY WERE STORE BOUGHT AND SMELT LIKE MISSION TORTILLAS!!!! WTF I won't ever go back ....note my 6 friends who joined me 2nd time ...over priced too
