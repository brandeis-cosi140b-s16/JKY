HORRIBLE MEXICAN FOOD!!!  People who think this is good Mexican food make me laugh.  Very low quality food. Been here twice now and everything was just awful.  Finally learned my lesson. Never going back!  Go to The Mission in old town Scottsdale or the Barrio Cafe in Phoenix, then go here and tell me it's good!!!!!
