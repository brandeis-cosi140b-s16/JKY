If you seriously want to catch a good laugh this is the place. 
Ordered a Asada burrito with no beans substitute for rice. She said no beans it's a dollar extra I asked why she said because we add more meat! Are you kidding me you are replacing the beans for rice so what extra meat are you putting? Anyways didn't feel like arguing. When I see my burrito all it consisted of was literally beef and rice! Seriously an $8 something burrito no cilantro nor onions? Wasn't good at all so plain no flavor even with the salsa. 
This place needs to get there stuff together with the big competitor to the side & this kind of quality. No no
