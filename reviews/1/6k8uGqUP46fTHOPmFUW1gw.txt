Terrible customer service even by fast food standards. Drive thru advertised as open til 1 am. Arrived at 1250 to order the bacon club chalupa. Was advised they could not make that item any longer that night because "the fryers have already been cleaned and drained for the night" unacceptable to start closing things early before the restaurant drive thru closes. The employee on duty, Mark, thought this was completely acceptable to close the fryers before the restaurant had closed. Plan to reach out to this locations GM as well as corporate.
