Yuck. Without a doubt the most tasteless, bland Mexican food ever. Salad was greens with a jalepeno vinaigrette  that equated to oil covered field greens. Dinner was a steak that lacked even salt served with bland rice and watery black beans. Margarita was passable but short on both lime and tequila. Friends took us to dinner, so I shouldn't complain, but no one should pay for this disaster. Avoid, avoid, avoid.
