As a fan of Javier's rising success I'm thoroughly disappointed in my visit to the Las Vegas Javier's location. Upon arrival my service was lacking extremely. I had to order my drink with two separate bar tenders before getting my orders fulfilled. Even on a slow night I waited 45 minutes for my medium filet Antiguo. Once my steak arrived it was extremely under cooked. When I sought my server he was extremely unapologetic and would take zero blame for their mistake. I went to find a manager and instead of resolving the situation he encouraged me to empathize with his servers mistake. The only resolution I received was my half eaten filet placed on the grill for a while longer. I  am thoroughly unimpressed and dissatisfied. Will not be a patron here again.
