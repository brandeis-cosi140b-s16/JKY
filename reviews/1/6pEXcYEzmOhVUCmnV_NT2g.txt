Just left there noon on Sunday, maybe a dozen customers and still were not seated. 3 employees walked to the front and looked at us none acknowledging us. There was a customer at the counter trying to get a refund for his take out order that they still had not filled. One worker came over and told him the reason it was taking so long was because of the bacon. That's when we decided to leave. If they can't seat us or even cook bacon in a timely manner no way would we be eating in the next hour. We use to love this place, hated when it closed rejoiced when it reopened but are now done. Last few experiences were not stellar and now it's clear the level of customer service we enjoyed left with the old staff.
