As a proud AJ resident I'm very disappointed that I must do the unthinkable and reduce my previous rating. I've returned two more times to enjoy the soup only to find that it consistently takes and hour to receive a bowl of cold to luke warm soup. The incredibly stale chips don't even begin to fill the void. 

Tonight we sat outside, for the second time, at tables which have obviously not made it onto the cleaning list, again. As dusk approached it was clear that they don't have lights nor do they plan to use what appear to be misters. It's apparently just a smoking area for the few existing patrons. 

What a missed opportunity to capitalize on a beautiful outdoor area to enjoy Mexican food in the midst of this beautiful desert! 

I've called numerous times to ask if they have Happy Hour specials to which they always reply, she hasn't decided yet. We've give up and have agreed not to try again, they clearly have no intention of making things better.
