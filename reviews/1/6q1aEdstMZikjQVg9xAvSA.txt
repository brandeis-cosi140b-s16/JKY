Worst service I've had in my life!!! Avoid this restaurant!!! After 2 mins of sitting the waitress comes to take our order. And after notifying her I needed more time she disappeared for 20 mins before coming back. I didn't see her for the rest of the night, but the table next to me got to see her 4 times! Another waiter brought out the food. Which was completely wrong and ice cold. Asked for the manager and waited another 15 mins before he decided he got around to my table. All in all we just got up and left. I will never return to this horrendous restaurant.
