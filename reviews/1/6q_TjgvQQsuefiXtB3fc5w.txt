On Nov 2, 2013 hubby and I went thru the drive thru about 9pm.  Had to repeat my order twice.  The order taker was snippy and rude.  Got to the window received our order pulled away 1 foot hubby said wrong order.  The person behind me  had not pulled forward.   I was able to back up and I said to the open window we received the wrong order and the lady said loudly, snippy and rude ya I know here's you order and I won't charge ya the difference.  OMG I would have paid the difference for nicer service that's for sure.  Her name began with an M and she had dark hair and major attitude....  she definitely need to go thru customer service training.
