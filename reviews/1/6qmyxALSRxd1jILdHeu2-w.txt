Horrible. Skip this place and go somewhere with REAL Mexican food! The chimichanga came with 80% beans and less meat than you'd get in a 50 cent microwave burrito. When I called to complain, the person told me they ""have to use beans to make it go down in the fryer." WTF? I guess EVERY other place just knows how to make it go down in the fryer with only meat inside. I paid $8 for something I wouldn't even throw at a mangy dog. I eat at little taco shops all over the state and this one is hands down the worst I've tried!
