California Taco Shop occupied this space until recently when the San Diego-transplant hispanic family that ran it, tapped out and closed down. (very bad location, imo.)  The food was positively delicious and accurate of the Southern-CA. style of casual Mexican food...  Edgar, the former owner of "Taco Loco" in the South side apparently took the lease over and has in the process, raised the price of everything $2-3 while at same time, managed to reduce the quality of food.  I had high hopes but was very disappointed after trying, recently.  (A couple friends have relayed similar feelings.)
