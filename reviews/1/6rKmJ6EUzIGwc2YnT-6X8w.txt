This is the worst macayos ever.. I got there and went into the bar area and was told by the bartender to sit WHEREVER WE WANT. we sat in the "banquet" area even through there was no sign stating that's what it was. We sat there for about 15 minutes, not offered chips and salsa or drinks. A waitress walked by and got a group of people drinks and everything. After a while I asked a busser if we could get service. She talked to the manager and came and told us "you didn't get service because yoy were seated in a closed banquet area", even though that wasn't stated anywhere and I even saw a waitress starring at us as we steated ourselves. I told the busser that it wasn't stated anywhere and the waitress that walked by about 4 times should have said something instead of ignoring us. She said "well she's paying attention to her tables not you" the only table I saw her service was the one group of people In the banquet area with us.. at this point I was annoyed and said "why do you keep putting the blame on us? Like its out fault we didn't get service?! You're so fucking rude" she then said in a whiny voice "how am I being rude?" I walked away and decided to go into the regular eating area and eat because I'm pregnant and was craving macayos.. I talked to the manager and told her what happened, she seemed apologetic but not too worried about it. So we get seated and still had to wait forever for chips and drinks. The manager brought us cheese dip and guacamole.. when we get the check, we were CHARGED for the cheese dip and guacamole. This place is a joke!! I spoke to the manager AGAIN and she said the waiter was supposed to come to her so she can take the charge off. How unprofessional!! I'm never returning to this macayos!!
