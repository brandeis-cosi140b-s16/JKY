if I could give no star I would. So after my last disgusting visit I tried again on Tuesday after work. I really do want this place to be good because I have had good food and service before. Well, what can I say? It definitely was cleaner but still not great.The trash can was cleaner but still stained with red goo down it. Good Lord, buy a decent trash already.  I went in for Taco Tuesday which is 99cent tacos. So I order, and my total comes to $5-something. So I ask the girl why its almost $6 for 4 tacos. She points to the sign and yes there are new signs with a price increase. Okay, no problem, whatever. I tell her that for almost $6 I would rather have the carne asada burrito. Nobody was doing anything at that point (cooks) and she just looked at me for a second and said ya. YA?? What is that all about? Whatever at this point. So I get my food and it is by far the worst tacos I have ever had there in over two years. Nothing in them and extra greasy crap dripping all over. Well I guess if there is not too much in them, you basically get a grease soaked shell. So disgusting. I am done with this place and maybe if they get their crap together I will go back. No big loss.
