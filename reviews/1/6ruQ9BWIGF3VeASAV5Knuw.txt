This place is terrible!  First, I had a hard time just placing my order because the girl kept interrupting me.  Then, after a long wait, I get my order, but they screwed it up.  Then, they give me this dirty cup for my 'chips and salsa' (which is a ripoff) and give me a dirty look when I ask for another.  Then, I have to wait and wait and wait behind this woman loading up for winter at the worst salsa bar I've seen this side of the border.   For all the trouble, the food wasn't worth it.
