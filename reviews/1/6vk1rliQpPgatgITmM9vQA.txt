Cool d√©cor, mediocre food, eh-prices. 

I want to like it, really I do. Every time I leave Two Hippies I tell myself I probably should have ordered something else... But nope, still feels like an unskilled friend whipped something up real quick and poured cherry syrup in Minute Maid lemonade and called it gourmet. 

The food might taste better if the atmosphere and decor didn't get your hopes up. When you walk in to any of their locations you can't help to be excited about the possibility of falling in love with another trendy downtown restaurant, only to be disappointed. It's like a date with someone you met on Facebook who had a really interesting about me section and who's display picture portrayed them as a model, only to find out they're just average in real life.
