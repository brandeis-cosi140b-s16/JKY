Only 1 * and that's for service only. Went for lunch as its close to work, but I won't be back. Got tacos with chicken and steak and it was cold and over priced. No beans or rice. At least at cafe rio you rice n beans. Three cold tacos and the steak tasted lie rubber gristle and chewy. Chicken was cold, but bland. So disappointed, I've been to others, but I'm not coming back to this one.
