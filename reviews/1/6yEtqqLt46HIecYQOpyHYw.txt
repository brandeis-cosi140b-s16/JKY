I went there thinking it was Gallo Blanco. Apparently they had very good tres leches cake. I've been craving it for over two years and thought, finally! I will get my cake! I was looking forward to it.  However, when I got there I walked into some eclectic modern Mexican American type place. I like authentic Mexican food so I was skeptical from the beginning. I ordered a Carne Asada taco and the cake.  I waited quite a while for my order to be ready. I got my cake, which was placed in a plastic container in a paper bag. The bag leaked all over my car seat on my way home. Good thing my seats are leather, not cloth!  Again, I was hoping for the best so I took the cake out of the bag and noticed that it was layered, with sliced strawberries between the layers.....um, really?!?  True tres leches cake does not have strawberries nor does it have layers! There was also some kind of whipped cream on the cake, which tasted like spoiled milk. I was quite disappointed in the cake, which itself cost me over five dollars. The Carne Asada taco was good, but again that was also sloppily placed in a plastic container and I had to scoop up the meat with my fingers and put it back into the tortilla!  Needless to say, if I decide to spend almost $12 again on one small taco and horrible cake, I need to have my brain examined. I will not be going back, just not a good experience at all.
