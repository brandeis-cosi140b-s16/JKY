If you like stinky-smelly-dirty food then sure you can eat here. The food has no flavoring and the order is put together super sloppy. I asked for guacamole & sour cream on my burrito and she said I choose the Mexican burrito so I can't add it. Before paying for my food I had to ask the cashier to give me a side of guacamole...Drama! The burrito was so nasty I just are some of the tortilla and was done.
