I won't be back.  That is right....I WON'T BE BACK!  

This was my second time trying this place as my first experience I loved.  Our food was outstanding.  However this second time around in 3 weeks just ruined it for me.  Food.....Yeah...still awesome.  However the problem was our server.  Nicole!  YOU SUCK!  

First our drinks came out AFTER 2 of our party of 4 received food.   Come on.  You couldn't even get a beer out to our table before a huge bowl of noodles?   The other part of this experience was that Nicole never apologized.   She actually never even asked to see what was going on.  2 members of our party only got their food after all of our other food came out and she didn't know.  We had to ask her again where the food was.   

Now here is what really ruined my night.  Management.   Tall Asian manager.  You too Suck!   You are in SERVICE.  When your product is not up to standards, treat me better then how you would treat me if service was good.   When I had to get out of my chair and walk over to the other side of the restaurant to tell you I am not paying for this food; that isn't service.  Also, when you agree that the drinks never made it to the table, comp them and take them off my bill.  I had to ask you to do so and you still wouldn't.   Up yours man!    

Avoid this place at all costs.   Save your self a headache and go next door to Holsteins.  It is a much better spot to eat.
