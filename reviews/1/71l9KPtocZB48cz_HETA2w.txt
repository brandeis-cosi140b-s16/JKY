Food is ok, good popusas. Other then that , service is terrible. Being the only table there I figured we would get our order in no time. Nope took 40min! To get 4 popusas out. My order of bacon wrapped shrimp was a disappointment as the bacon was extremely under cooked.. If you see this place just keep driving.
