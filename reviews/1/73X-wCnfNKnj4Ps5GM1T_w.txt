If give thus place a zero if I could .. Service is terrible .. Beer is warm.. People are not friendly... I have walked by this place many times and I should of done the same tonight..this place could be so much better but the first person you see is the bartender who has no people skills what so ever... No bueno...will never be here again not will I recommend anyone to this place... Emiliano's food sucks!!! But at least the people there are customer service orientated ..
Part 2 ... The good was just ok.. The only thing that seperates this place from Emiliano's is the terrible service at Los toros... Nothing spectacular... Mad NRC has better food.. And this is coming from a true Mexican who knows Mexican food... Avoid this lousy place.. You will just be disappointed
