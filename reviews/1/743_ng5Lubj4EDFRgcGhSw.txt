Service was terrible and not attentive at all. Ordered some chicken wings and they said it would take 20 minutes to finish. The order was a bit late and I was afraid of missing my flight and they were unwilling to refund me or cancel my order for something else. 

Avoid....at all costs. The bagel shop across the street is better. Or Popeyes.
