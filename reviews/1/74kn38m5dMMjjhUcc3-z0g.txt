This is by far the worst food I have ever had in a restaurant.  The microwave was the hardest working thing  in the place. Everything was microwaved and very bland, no flavor at all. Service was just as bad. Argued with us and insisted the food was authentic me ican. Far from it. Not one person on party of four was happy with our food yet they insisted on charging us for our drinks. Just a horrible experience all around. Will never go back and will not recommend to any one. The only reason they are getting one star is because  I have to.
