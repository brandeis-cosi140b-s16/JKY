I've eaten at Vida twice; once for lunch and once for dinner.  Both times were awful.  The food is just NOT good.  I go to Cantina 1511 at least  1x a month and love it. every time.

Lunch - Pork Green Chili Stew - I love shredded mexican pork and green chilies but HATED this stew.  Very little flavor and the flavor it did have was awful.  

Dinner - 
Tortilla Soup - Bad
Surf and Turf Tacos - I thought for sure the surf and turf tacos would be delicious....how couldn't they be??  They weren't.  The flavor of the steak and lobster was good but the tacos were dry and flavorless. I had to ask for a side of chipolte crema to make the dinner edible.  (I couldn't waste it considering I spend $24 on it) 

For dinner, I was with 5 other people.   Everyone thought their meal was just ok.  

If you're in the mood for mexican food, go to Cantina.......or even Qdoba or Chipotle.  

They don't validate parking either, in case you're wondering.
