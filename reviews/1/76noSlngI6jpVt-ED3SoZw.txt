I ordered a shredded beef burrito today for lunch through the drive thru and was disgustingly surprised to find that there were 3 leaves cooked into my burrito. Leaves like what you would see on a tree out side... not seasoning leaves by any means. I kept feeling some different textures as I was chewing and opened my burrito to find them. Check your food before you take a bite!
