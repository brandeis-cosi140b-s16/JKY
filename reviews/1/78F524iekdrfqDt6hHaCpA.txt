Terrible experience. I have been to Qdoba before and have always had fast, friendly service and decent meals. We recently moved to the Ahwatukee area and decided to stop in at this location for a quick dinner. It was not busy, there was one other couple in front of us in line. Standing in line I noticed a large pile of chicken sitting to the side of the grill with flies buzzing around it and quickly decided I would try the steak instead.  I do not know if they were running out of inventory or if the staff was just being lazy but never in my life have I seen such embarrassing sized portions from any Qdoba. My favorite part of Qdoba has always been eating half and saving half for later, this time none of it was worth saving.  As we watched our food being made we knew something was not right, so I politely asked why the portions seemed to be much (MUCH) smaller than what we were used to. The girl making our burritos literally rolled her eyes, laughed and offered extra meat for an extra charge. I did not want extra meat, I wanted the same size bowl I was used to getting. We declined, and she seemingly pawned us off on the other girl working.  As we approached the register we asked another employee (possibly the manager), why the portions seemed to be half of what we are normally used to getting at Qdoba.  She seemed nervous, but assured us the portion sizes were correct. After our 2 minute car trip home and opening our bag of food we realized this $18 meal would definitely not satisfy our hunger. To top it off, the steak tasted like it had been soaked in some type of oil, and everything was completely cold! Not  even lukewarm, cold. I hate to complain, but after this past visit we will not be returning to Qdoba. 

I have attached a picture of the food we received (next to an 8oz bottle of vitamins for comparison) for viewers to see how small the burrito actually is.
