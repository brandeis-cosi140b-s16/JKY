I have eaten here a number of times when it's late and don't feel like cooking it's okay not the best but does the job to fill you up. We'll tonight I ordered the 2 cheese enchiladas after I got home and stated eating it I found 2 YES 2 black hairs in my food. I was so grossed out i started gaging. I called them and the lady said "No we don't put hair in food you lying to get free food." Then just hung up. Will NEVER eat here again I will go the extra mile and go to  Federico's on 43rd and Peoria. There cleaner inside and out.
