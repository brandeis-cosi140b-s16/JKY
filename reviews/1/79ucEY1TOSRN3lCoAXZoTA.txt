Really horrible customer service. Mal servicio al cliente. They put the receipt on top of the corn, I asked to for an exchanged and the owner refused to exchange it. Even worse manager said they were closing at 9pm they kicked us out. You can see the time of the purchase on my receipt . So I left the whole corn out there and I left.
