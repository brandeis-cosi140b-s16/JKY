it will do if you are in the area. I used to stop by here late after a concert to grab a breakfast burrito for the road. The graveyard shift needs the boot. I had to go in the place because the drive thru window was stuck. It took 15 mins for a simple egg and cheese burrito. Had to wait extra cause the dude dropped it. This was not just an off night for this location , after a few similar visits I decided to seek my burrito needs elsewhere.
