This is by far the worst Roberto's in the area.

Its the nearest one to where I currently live so we would go out of convenience. Being that it's a Roberto's the food is basically the same as anywhere else but for some reason getting what you actually ordered is a challenge. 

They charge a $1.10 to add guacamole to an item and on 3 separate occasions I got home and they had neglected to add it even though I had paid for it. I initially shrugged it off and didn't want to get all bent about the situation but it definitely got on my nerves.

The next time I went in I made sure to tell them about the guac situation and this time they included it but still charged me despite their 3 past screw ups. I thought, alright fine it's just a dollar.

A few days later we returned for breakfast burritos. Took the order home and they had put the wrong meat inside of one of them. I don't know how Carne Asada gets confused with Shredded Beef - and in a breakfast burrito nonetheless. Gross combination. 

At that point it was clear that they are simply too incompetent to get a to-go order done correctly. A mistake or two is understandable but this is just ridiculous. It happened time after time, consecutively. I shouldn't have to babysit them while they make the damn food to make sure they are doing their jobs correctly. 

I have never had this issue at the other location I used to frequent and though it is a longer drive I will be going back to the old location. 

Don't waste your time and money on this Roberto's. They are sloppy and careless. They don't pay attention to what they are doing, especially at 1am when the place is dead and they aren't even busy (which is usually when we would go). No thanks.
