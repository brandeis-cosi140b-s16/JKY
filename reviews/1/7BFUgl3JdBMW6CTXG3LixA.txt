Just ordered 6 taco carbon they only come with three thing on it chicken, onions, cilantro and they couldn't get it right there's only two or three pieces of cilantro and no onions and I'm bad as heck my first real meal since coming home from the hospital 
And I might add they F up every time always check your bag!!!! 
I ordered 6 and got 9 thanks for the extra dumb teenagers but make it the right way next time

For the record this is store 6043 on N. Durango Blvd. they suck
