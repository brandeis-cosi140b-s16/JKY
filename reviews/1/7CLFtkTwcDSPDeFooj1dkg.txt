Have been here a few times due to working nearby.

Few consistent issues:
-order is never ready at the time requested
-order needs to be double checked frequently because have forgotten add on's that were purchased.

With the first issue, my one concern is that we have a short work lunch, and it is so convenient to be able to pick up food at a specific time.  It is not ready though when we show up, regardless if you placed it with 30 min for them to prep.

Multiple times as well the guacamole has been left out of the order.  No time to head back on my lunch, have called for the refund to be issued a few times and never was.  No use in wasting my time over a few bucks, but it would be nice to know they would at least attempt to make it right next time.

Take it as the warning it is, there is always a reason that place is empty.
