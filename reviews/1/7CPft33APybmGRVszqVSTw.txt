Food is good but their advertisement is false. I recently purchased their 5 mini tacos with a drink for 4.99. When he rings it up it was 5.98. Really dude - 97 cents in tax on a 5 dollar meal? Turns out they are ringing up each taco at the regular price of $1.09 which comes to 5.45 not 4.99. It's a trivial amount I know but its all about principal. It says 4.99 but apparently you like to charge 5.45. And to top it all off the guy says theirs nothing he can do about it. Uh yeah how bout ringing it up for the advertised price.
