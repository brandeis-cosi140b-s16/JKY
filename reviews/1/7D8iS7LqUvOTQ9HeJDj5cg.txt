After trying this place for the first time last year when I was in Phoenix and having a wonderful experience, I went back there today and was absolutely disgusted.  As we approached the front door a friend said he thought it looked closed, but it turned out it was open there just weren't any people inside.  

The place smelled like a sewage plant on the inside, and we immediately turned around and went elsewhere for food.  Luckily my friend said a new Ramiros opened near his house, because I will definitely never go back to this location again.
