This is supposed to be a hard shell beef taco. Really? I barely see any beef, lots of lettuce, a bit of cheese and a lot of tortilla. A sad taco really. 2 "beef" tacos rice & beans & soda for about $7.49. It should be called beans & rice with hard shell tortillas and maybe beef inside "if you're lucky", so GOOD LUCK! (See my pic)
