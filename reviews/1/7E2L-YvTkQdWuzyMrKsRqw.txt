Get there at 3:02am when they close at 3:30am. I just worked a 16.5 hr shift at work and had zero time to eat. On my way home I decide on some T Bell. I am forced to wait 5 minutes at the speaker box. Finally someone  says we are closed in a fake Mexican accent . I asked really? Same person says they are closed. Sounded like they were laughing as well. Not happy at all. Won't go to this location again. This has happened to me before. Missing items in bag from location as well. Thanks a lot
