Not a fan... You can get significantly better Mexican food elsewhere. I'm not exactly sure how to describe it. It's not the "Americanized" Mexican, nor is it the Mexican Mexican. It doesn't taste right, let alone taste okay. 

I think the biggest turnoff is how dirty and unsanitary this place is. Seats and tables are sticky. I wouldn't recommend stopping by here. There are so many other better options. Go to Taco Bell or the mall next door.
