My worst eating experience, EVER! I found a band-aid in my nachos here, and when I went back the staff pretended not to speak English. All this while they had a sign on their wall that said "Voted Best in Las Vegas." This happened to me in 2002, mind you, but I'll never forget that experience. I sincerely hope they have improved on the standards since then, but I will NEVER eat here again.
