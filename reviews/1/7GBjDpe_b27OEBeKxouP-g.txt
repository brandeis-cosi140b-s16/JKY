The tables were dirty, and the food was cold. The shredded Chicken quesadilla was wet and cold.... The cheese wasn't melted. The Fritos beef burrito was the only redeeming part of the meal. My burrito Supreme was cold as well. I keep going back partly because this seems to be the only place with the diet Baja mountain dew drink. Anyway, I will probably go back again because I'm a sucker... I will just have to refuse cold food with shredded cheese that's not even melted.
