As a group of 6, the waitress said there would be no problem dividing the check for 3 couples. We asked because the menu stated that no check could be divided  if there were more than 5 people. She said she could do it. We also had coupons from the Coyote book. Three couples...three coupons.  When we received our check, it was all combined in one. She also told us that the manager said it was one coupon per table. Nowhere on the coupon did it state that. The service was very slow and the food was mediocre. We were overcharged for a drink and a 20% tip was added on to the bill automatically.  The tip was way over for the service we got. When we talked to the manager he was rude.  Would we go back...NO!  Will we tell our friends to go there...NO!!!
