UGH!

Utter Disgust.

I recently moved to the Phoenix/West Valley area and as I'm driving around, looking for somewhere to eat, I see this hole-in-the-wall mexican drive-thru on the side of the road. Most of the best mexican food is found in some of the dirtiest, grimiest spots so I was all for tryin this place out... so I pull into the drive-thru and theres a guy standing outside, next to the menu, just staring at me. It takes me a minute to realize that he's going to be taking my order. That shoulda been a red flag but I ignored it, ordered my food and pulled up to the window. Waited a good 20 minutes... grrreeeeaaaat...... finally get my food (carne asada burrito & adobada fries) and I drive home. By the time I get home (about 10 minutes away), I pick  up my bag and theres a PUDDLE of grease sitting at the bottom of the bag. It literally had to be about 3/4 to a full CUP of grease!! SO GROSS! But i'm STARVING and i'm definitely not going to drive all the way back. So, I get rid of as much grease as possible and I eat the food. I had the fries. My wife had the burrito. Aside from the grease bomb that had exploded on my meal, I guess the food wasnt TOO horrible. Definitely not as good at Federico's or Filiberto's... but not HORRIBLE...

The next day, at work, I get this INTENSE stomach pain and knots in my belly. I end up having to leave work early because it hurts so bad. I ended up vomiting VIOLENTLY for the next 24 hours. 

NEVER AGAIN!
