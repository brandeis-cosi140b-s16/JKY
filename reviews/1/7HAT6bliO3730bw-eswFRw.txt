The food here is great, fresh and spicy and delicious. The service is also great, there's almost never a wait and the staff are quick and kind.  Specifically, the refried beans are amazing and the veggie fajitas rock.

The poor review is for their rice being made with chicken stock even though it's listed on their menu under vegetarian. It is NOT VEGETARIAN.  

Thanks to the waitress who brought it to our attention, shame on the inconsiderate kitchen manager that decided to lie to his/her clientele. We will not be visiting here again unless they update their menu or change their recipe.
