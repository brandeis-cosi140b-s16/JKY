Super gross! I went late, so I assume they thought I was too drunk to taste how disgusting the food was. I got a taco and it was soggy and cold, had more pico than anything else. The nachos were super salty, cold, nasty and full of onions. I was so disappointed in this place.  I will not be giving it a second shot. That's how bad it was. 3 items = $18 way too expensive for the quality.
