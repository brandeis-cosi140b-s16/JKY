Vile. 

You steered me wrong, Yelp.  El Taco Gordo is disgusting.  You show up and there's a giant flat-top griddle.  You have to go to a different station for each meat you order.  (Annoying.)

My asada ("steak," in theory) tasted like little gristly chicklets of shoe leather.  

I spent the rest of my night cradling my stomach in agony.   AVOID AT ALL COSTS.
