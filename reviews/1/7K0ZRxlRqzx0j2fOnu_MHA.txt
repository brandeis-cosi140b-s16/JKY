Very disappointing. Where do I begin?

1. My wife and I each ordered a margarita, and we both felt that the tub mixes you buy at Bed Bath & Beyond are better. Way sugared down and way over-priced for the quality of the mix.
2. The menu advertises "a trio of salsa's" with your appetizer or meal, but these tasted like they were out of a can and the menu should have said "a trio of salsa's - two tablespoons of each". I guess it's good you don't get much.
3. The music in a Mexican restaurant does not need to be Mexican or mariachi, but hearing Berlin followed by a karaoke version of David Bowie followed by 70's slow rock followed by another poor cover of an 80's one-hit wonder made me feel like I was in an off-strip casino listening to the house bar band on a bad night.
4. Very eclectic tables and wall art and light fixtures, somehow they just didn't all fit together.
5. I've had better Asada tacos at Taco Bell. My wife was not happy with her Pollo tacos either. Nothing special about the taste at all. Very bland.

I could go on. All this for $105 for two adults and two kids (again, one crappy margarita for my wife and I).

I'd rather have Agave.
