The employee was very nice and helped me with my order. However the place was gross I ordered my food n by the time I actually got it I was so disgusted with the place on how gross it was they had roaches in the plastic spoons and forks! And they were out of almost everything I paid about $13 on a Assad burrito and rice and bean with a large soda was I walked out of the place the food n soda went into the garbage! Can not believe I just wasted this much on something and not be happy. Couldn't tell you how good the food is cuz I couldn't get myself to even try to put it in my car. I will never go back there! I hope they get inspected soon cuz if they pass then we have some bigger problems in this city cuz I never ate at a place as gross as this place was.
