I ordered 2 sopes for myself and a burrito for my brother. My brother love the burrito and I like my food. The meat was cooked perfect and it was delicious. 

I give this place one star for a simple reason. My sopes came with guacamole. It wasn't until I got home and was getting ready to eat that I saw that the guacamole was almost black. I wouldn't even feed that to my dog. 

When I went back to the restaurant to have them change it they just looked at me like of there was something wrong with me. After explaining to them that I refuse to eat it because it was obviously very old, they made me fresh sopes WITHOUT guacamole. I expected the guacamole on them but apparently they didn't want to made fresh guacamole. 

I'm very disappointed with that simple fact. I refuse to ever go back or even recommend someone to this place. There are places with fresh food that is just as tasty.
