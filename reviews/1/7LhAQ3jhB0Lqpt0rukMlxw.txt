I was so disappointed. It looks like a place that would fit in perfectly with the direction downtown Gilbert is going in but the food will have this place closed in no time. They say good things come to those that wait, well I'll be waiting for quite a while with this place. It was a 20 minute wait and honestly, so not worth it. I got the La Paz burrito and there has been no peace since. The chicken was dry and tough, they used pickled jalape√±os, and there was corn in the rice. WTF? I won't ever go back.
