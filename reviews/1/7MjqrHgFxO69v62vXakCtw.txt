(I wrote the first chunk of this in the beginning of June on their Facebook page & felt it would be better on Yelp) Here goes:

The service is really horrible. The folks behind the glass will ask what you want and fail to apply what you've just told them. We have lost count of how many times they have gotten our order incorrect, even after we have repeated the ourselves several times. So if you're not watching like a hawk as your food gets made, they're likely to screw something up. Constantly having to repeat yourself gets a little old when you're ordering your food. Because of this, I would have to say that service is absolutely terrible. On the plus side, the food is fresh & tastes amazing. Oh and be aware that you cannot redeem your punch card on taco Tuesday (for tacos) because they would rather lose money. Just think about.

The following is from the June 27, 2015) 
Last night the order we were charged for was completely wrong. Unfortunately we didn't realize this until getting home. I looked at the receipt and noticed the $24 charge for 3 veggie tacos & 1 grilled chicken burrito.  I did return promptly to get it corrected. They did correct the charge and return the difference to me. So I will give them credit for that. This was and is the last time we will ever eat at Cafe Rio again.  If you're there for the tortillas, Costco has some amazing tortillas in the freezer section that you just finish cooking on the stovetop.
