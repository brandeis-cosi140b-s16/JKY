This is what I expect most of the douchenozzles and their accompanying dirty vagina'ed amigas have on an endless, thousand-decibel-loop inside their pea-brains as they lean like euro-cholos here at Loco Patron, never really acknowledging each other until the battle call "JAGERSHOTS JAGERSHOTS JAGERSHOTS" , is signaled to the witless congregation, first as a question, then as an affirming statement, and finally a rallying yell, like a slow-clap-progression in a John Hughes movie.

If this is you, take your hand and slap some sense into yourself ... you are annoying the piss out of me as I stand there drinking my shitty beer in a crappy version of Mexican Chili's.
