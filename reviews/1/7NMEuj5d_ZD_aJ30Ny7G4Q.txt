Went to get a burrito here and was so disappointed.  First if you order a green chili burrito it should have more than 3 pieces of meat in it and flavor would be nice... Next are the beans....my gosh they scream canned beans!!!  Flavorless and disgusting.  

Overpriced and disgusting food to boot.  Come on!!!  I expected more but got way less...
