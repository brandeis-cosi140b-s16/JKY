I stood by the entrance for about 5 minutes until one of the servers who passed by multiple times finally said "Seat yourself!" So I did, and I wasn't in a big rush so I waited patiently.... Ten minutes later I was brought a menu but not asked if I wanted a drink or anything, so I got to wait another few minutes.. A lady came and took my order, I was relieved, about 5 minutes passed and I got my drink, which was weak, but hey, I'm thirsty.. It seemed like forever for my food to come out, and when it did, I had already completely finished 2 drinks. The food was ok, definitely not something I would go back for, I was thinking come on, Jose Cuervo, should be somewhat decent Mexican food, right?? Wrong!! I had the shrimp enchiladas, very bland.. All that and the service sucked, so bad I would rank it in the all time low of lows.. Overall, terrible service, bland food and weak drinks...  Yuck!
