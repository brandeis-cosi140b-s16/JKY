This is the worst Mexican food I have ever eaten. We live just down the street so have gone here on occasion. Most of the time it is hit and miss. I ordered the carnitas plate this last time and let me tell you it was the most disgusting plate of carnitas I have ever had. It tasted as if they opened a can of dog food, heated it up in a microwave and then served it. It was so unedible that l had to through it out and ended up eating leftovers instead, it was so gross. As I said before most of the times I have been here have been hit or miss but this time was the last for me. Do not eat here if you are looking for good Mexican food.
