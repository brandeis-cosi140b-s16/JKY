I used to eat at Pedro's all the time. For years it was my go to place. I moved away for a number of years and just moved back to Madison 2 years ago. Friday we went to Pedro's for dinner. Worst meal I have had....ever. The service was great, our waiter though looked embarrassed when he asked us if we wanted containers for our meals which we had barely touched and we said no. The food had little to no taste, parts were cold, parts were super hot. It is so sad to see a place that used to have such good food drop to this level.
