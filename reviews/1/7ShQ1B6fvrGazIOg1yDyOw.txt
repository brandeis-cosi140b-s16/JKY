We've eaten here in the past and not found anything with posting aboot..
Try to give every place more then one chance..
Just in case it was a fluke..

The chips and dips were good..
That was it..

The service was slow and un attentive..

Ordered two two item combos..
Chicken Taco and pork tamale..
Beef Taco and pork tamale..
The chicken was dry..
The beef was spicier then advertised by the server..
And the tamales were just gross..
They were spongy and the pork was very grisly..

We didn't even eat half the meal.. 
The server never asked how it was..
Just took the plates and dropped the check..

Will not be returning..
