Very disappointing at this location!!!! Huge fan of Chipotle,  but will NEVER give this location a dime again. They skimp on their food more and more.. In Northern California our old Chipotle NEVER left us disappointed even after standing in line that was always out the door. Many times the steak is out or raw because of being unprepared . Today the cooks were standing around instead of cooking yet AGAIN meat was almost gone.. Seems like they should have been cooking instead of twiddling their fingers! Take your money elsewhere !!!
