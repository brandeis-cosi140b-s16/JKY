Every employee seems as if they do not care about their job. They move slow and blatantly don't care. I'm sure that's reflective of whose in charge. Also should probably have them ALL wear gloves when dealing with food. I'll definitely make that known. Gross. Twenty five minutes in line to get home to a burrito that was not closed and probably with germs. Trash we go.
