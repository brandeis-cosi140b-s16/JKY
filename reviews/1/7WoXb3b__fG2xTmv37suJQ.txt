When it's 11:30 pm and me so hungry... I need a burrito call.

Amando's Bros. sounded like it might satisfy my hungriness but this late night burrito call left me with regret.

The carne asada burrito was COLD. I had both hands wrapped on a cold burrito. It was such a turn off. I also had the carne asada fries that were equally disappointing. It was covered in cheese and the fries tasted like it was fried in lukewarm oil. It was not crispy or crunchy, just stale and old tasting. 

The next time I am feeling an itch for a burrito late at night... I will have to pass on Amando's Bros. La comida es no bueno.
