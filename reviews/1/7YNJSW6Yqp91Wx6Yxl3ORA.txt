Stopped in today with my boyfriend and our 6 year old.  I ordered the green chili burro chimi style.  Sour cream and Guac on the side.  As I cut into my burro, it literally deflated.  My curiosity led me to open the chimi, where I found 5 cubed pieces of green chili beef. 5. 5 quarter sized piece of meat in a full size tortilla.  I ordered the burro chimi style cause I like a crispy shell.  This was not the case.  After finishing my 5 with meat bites, I ate mushy tortilla with some semi par green chili sauce, and ONLY because I hadn't eaten all day, and I am pregnant.  And for $7, I couldn't throw it away.  But I will never buy it again.

My boyfriend and the wee one both had shredded beef tacos. Nothing terrible, pretty decent, I would of rather had the tacos.  He originally wanted a shredded beef burrito, sans beans.  The guy looked at him and rather rudely replied 'well we can do it but the burrito won't be big...'  Seems like a pattern here.  In addition... if you're charging me for a steak burrito, I don't want a bean burrito with some steak in it, I want a steak burrito with some beans in it.  If your informing customers that without the "filler" it won't be much of a burrito... it isn't a good sign.

They also don't take credit or debit which is a huge pain.  It wouldn't be as bad if they had an ATM, but they don't, so we had to order based on the little cash I had in my wallet.  

We got my meatless fake chimi, 6 tacos and 1 soda for $21.  The tacos were not that big.  Skip it.  Or drive the block or so extra to Rosita's.
