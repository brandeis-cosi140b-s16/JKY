We went late, so maybe the chef was having an off night. 

It was pretty busy despite how late it was, but it seemed there was only one girl running the entire bar and restaurant area by herself. She was darting all over the place. That being the case, it often took quite awhile for her to come back around. Our waters were drained and salsa emptied and then we just waited around for her. To her credit, she was pleasant when she was around. 

I ordered the chile relleno and a shrimp taco a la carte, while the boy ordered the mixed fajitas [chicken & steak]. When the food arrived, the fajita meat was super BLAND. The description said it had a spicy kick, but it just tasted like lightly salted chicken. It was thoroughly disappointing and not worth the $13-14 they wanted for it. We sent it back and ate the rice and beans in the tortillas instead. 

My shrimp taco was decent, but nothing to get excited for either. On the plus side, they were bigger than I expected and NOT coated in batter. I like my shrimp naked, so that much was good. 

Overall, a forgettable meal. Open 24 hours, but so is Roberto's and Pepe's Tacos.
