I've been to Don Tortaco before and it's great, especially for late night food. This one, however, was not open 24 hours even when it clearly says it's open 24 hours on the store front. I'm never up late eating food like this, but if I am up, I want something to be open without any issues. I walked up to this place and it was completely shut down. No lights, no staff, nothing! It was all shut down and I was literally standing next to a sign that said 24/7 while standing in front of the restaurant. I would definitely make sure you know when it's open or closed so you're not wasting your time like I clearly did.
