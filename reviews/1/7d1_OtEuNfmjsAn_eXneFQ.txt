We live right down the street, and always go to this location. I mean it's convenient......
BUT
This location is horrible. 
The drive thru is sloooowwwwww.!!!
They never get our order correct. Ever. 
The ladies are decently nice, but still have attitude. 
The meat is always dry and overcooked. 

We will be driving a little farther to a different location. Hopefully that one isn't as bad. 
This one needs to shape up a little more. But I guess it IS fast food.
