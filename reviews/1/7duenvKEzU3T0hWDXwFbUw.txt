Unfortunately tonight wasn't a good experience for our family it was our sons 17th birthday. Not a lot of dinner choices in Maricopa, so we decided to try Plaza Bonita. The service was fast, but the food was by far one of the worst meals ever. My daughter had a Caesar salad  her chicken tasted a lot like cardboard. I had shredded beef tacos, and I'm not sure what kind of meat I was eating. My husband and son had steak burritos with meat similar to beef jerky and 90% of it was beans and rice throughout their burritos. All of our plates were full of a water like substance as well. I don't recommend this place to anyone. Very disappointed!!!!
