Im not sure how people call it clean! DIRTY!!!!! DISGUSTING!!!! DIRTY!!!!! Small, dirty, hot, disgusting place! No AC, just a ceiling fan. The food is OK if you like grease! I ordered a steak quesadilla and the grease was running down my hands. The portions are huge, prices are low. Nevertheless, I will not go there again.
