Worst experience ever at a bar... 

My friend and I stopped by after grabbing lunch elsewhere in the marketplace. We had just order our first beer and started talking to a couple at the bar next to us. The guy jokingly attached 4 straws together and was trying to drink out of his dates cup. The bartender grabbed the straws, pulled them apart and threw them away without making any eye contact with any of us. 
Shocked, we told her she was very rude, and that it was completely uncalled for. She immediately cut all four of us off and told us to leave. 
We asked for the manager, who was in his early thirties, overweight and a complete underachieving nerd named Ryan. He said he stands behind his waitresses regardless of what happened. I told him I would ruin him on yelp and he replied, "yelp is worthless, nobody reads it anyway." 
Other than that, the bottled beer tasted fresh.
