I want to management here know that the food was just ok but what gave this experience one star was the waiter. All was fine till we received the check and the waiter abruptly and rudely gave us the ticket announcing "I am a good waiter" and turning on his heels. We were more than a little shocked, then he sent a waitress to retrieve our check when we weren't finished, pointed at us from inside the restaurant ranting to another employee, and ran to the table to pick up our bill as we left. Don't know what his problem was but we agreed we'll never go back. So maybe management needs to have a come to God talk with the waiter from Brooklyn about customer service and how that equates to return business and and tips.
