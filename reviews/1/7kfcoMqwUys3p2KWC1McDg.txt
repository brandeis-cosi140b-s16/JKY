I just can't believe the experience myself and co-workers just had. We decided this place would be a great choice because they offer online ordering! We all only had our individual debit cards so how convenient, right!? NOT!!! First of all when I arrived to pick up our orders they acted like they had never received an online order. OK I though, maybe it is a new system for them so no big deal... Ha!  It took 3 people to figure the orders out. They wanted me to pay for what had already been paid for. It took a good 10-15 minutes for everything to get straightened out. I checked the tickets for accuracy before I left with the food. Ok good to go. Wrong again! ALL of the food was incorrect! They forgot the meat on a Carne Asada Quesadilla. Forgot the cheese that was clearly marked and paid extra for on tacos. Forgot guacamole on everything. Not to mention they don't have sour cream in the first place. Holy crap, never again!
