Does it shock you that this place blows? Does it really? 

Ok, let me back up, as I'm assuming that every reader is as horrified with pop culture and the way our world cultivates youth. I for one am simply primed for vomiting when viewing the primordial meat markets the likes of Scottsdale clubs foster. 

But this place really takes the cake.

I'm eccentric and irreverent when it comes to decor, so the overall appearance of the place (gawdy, mostly) doesn't bother me... at all. It's really just the simple and complete brainlessness of the whole operation. The food is mediocre and the margaritas are standard. The waitstaff is commonly too busy posing and catching their reflections in the one of many shiny, distracting objects to provide any standard of service. And the management, my, are they pretty! Pretty useless!

But, I'll rip the term "doucheburger" right from Jake C. (that's awesome, by the way): this place is filled with 'em. Whom I'll bet pair nicely with the allll the cougars. (those two terms rhyme a little... try them together, I bet you'll like it.)
