I stopped in and ordered a T4 meal.  Anyone who has used a Taco Bell combined with a KFC would know there's a T4 meal.  However this one is combined with a Pizza Hut (just personal pan pizzas).  The girl did not know what a T4 meal was so I had to explain that it's Taco Bell combo with the mexican pizza.  She said she didn't know of a T4 meal but ordered me the combo meal anyway, I said she should still know what a T4 meal was.  I went to the fountain and poured myself a Sierra Mist, it tasted like carbonated water with no Sierra Mist syrup in it.  I poured it out and got myself another type of drink.  I got the meal promptly and the the girl who took my non-T4 meal delivered it at the counter (I didn't think the order taker would also delivered the meal at the counter).  She dellivered it with a smile.  I ate the meal, it was not held together well, everything fell apart as I ate, it was a mess.  The next day I got the flu, I had the runs all day.  
  I do not know whether she sabotaged my meal but I am sick as a dog.  After reading the other negative reviews for this Taco Bell, it would not surprise me if she did not sabotage my meal (spitting in it or hairs or who-knows-what).  
  Please do not eat here until this place has had a safety review by the health department, FOR YOUR HEALTH.
