First of all, the host was one of the rudest people I ever met. I broke my ankle out at the Flamingo pool and had borrowed a wheelchair from the hotel, and I asked him what the easiest way was to get through the restaurant to reach where my friends were sitting and he was not helpful. I told him nevermind, and asked if I could park the wheelchair somewhere out of the way so I could just hobble to my table. That's when he started treating me like I had a mental handicap and even started yelling at me. 

I was very upset and the waiter tried to assure me that the host probably didn't speak enough english to understand me. But then we ordered brunch and the experience got even worse. The bacon looked like it had been sitting on the floor for a few days and even stepped on several times. And, the bloody marys were all ice.

Sure, it's conveniently located if you're staying at the Flamingo but the horrible stomach aches and verbal abuse by the staff is not worth it.
