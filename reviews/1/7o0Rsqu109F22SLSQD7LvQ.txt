I am honestly surprised by all of the positive reviews for this place!  I LOVE Mexican food, and am all for a good dive, but this place was just... gross.  When we want authentic mexican (street tacos, carne asada, etc.) we always go to Los Taquitos in Ahwatukee, but since we live in Gilbert near Maria's, we decided to give it a try.  

The restaurant was DIRTY, the food was gross, the tortillas were dry and not fresh AT ALL, the salsa/hot sauce left little to be desired, etc.  We will never go back.
