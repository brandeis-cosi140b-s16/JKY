Gotta love when the whole restaurant smells like the bathroom. I've been to some hole in the wall places that haven't smelled as bad as this place. I've been to plenty of Robertos in the past. This one wasn't very good.
 It's hard to mess up carne asada nachos. I know it's an Americanized dish but at least melt the cheese on the nachos. There was a lot of meat on them but the whole thing seemed really salty.
