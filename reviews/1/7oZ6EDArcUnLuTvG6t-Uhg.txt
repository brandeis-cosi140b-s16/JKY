I should have read Alexander's Yelp review before I ventured out of my La Quinta hotel during my business trip.  But we went here for a quick dinner and although their fried ice cream was pretty above average, it couldn't equal out for their horrendous spinach enchiladas.  Everything was mushy tasting and their white sauce topping on the enchiladas looked like that kind of cheesy topping that is microwaved from 3 days ago.  Hal-O-Peno's is a nice pun but doesn't qualify as being a good quality Mexican establishment.  Keep walking down the street to find better food.  This is the second Yelp "warning."
