Absolutely, positively the worst food, Mexican or otherwise I have ever tried to eat.
Overpriced, flavorless and stale, the entire order should have been relegated to the dumpster, not served to a customer.
I ordered 2 beef tacos at $3.00 each. They do not come with any condiments (condiments are sold separate at a buck a piece!) such as taco sauce, sour cream or guacamole. They do give you a few tiny plastic containers each holding about 2 tablespoons of reddish colored water..mystery to me what they were as I was not brave enough to taste them. The taco filling consists of a tablespoon or so of stewed mystery meat which is flavorless, a few shreds of some limp partially melted process shredded cheese, and a few shreds of limp and browned lettuce all of which lie sadly in a tiny strip at the bottom of the overcooked taco shell. The shell itself was disgustingly flavored by the rancid cooking oil it was prepared with and was not only stale but overcooked...hard as a brick. My best guess is that the last time they changed the oil in their fryers, Texas was still part of Mexico.
No lie, my DOG turned his nose up at it when he sniffed at the trash...which is where my entire order ended up.

Next was a beef burrito served up in a stale, flavorless flour tortilla. The edges were hard as a rock and the middle was raw and doughy. 
The meat (again) is stewed and with absolutely no flavor at all, bland, bland, bland with a few sickly looking  strips of fried green pepper and onion mixed in. No beans, cheese, rice, lettuce, tomato or condiment...for $4.99 no less.

I lived in California among many Mexican families and am very familiar with authentic Mexican food which this restaurant is an insult to. My advice is to save your money and go to Taco Bell rather than visit this mexican dumpster. If I could give a negative star rating, I surely would!
