We come here 1-2 times a week with a group of coworkers. I'm sorry but when you fulfill 20+ online orders making over 30 people wait who actually came in to order in person, you can expect everybody to be pissed off and to reduce the chances of ever coming back in. Why should somebody who has ordered their food on the Internet have their food made before somebody who's physically in line. Learn to manage your staff if you want our business to continue.
