Worst service ever! Ordered 2 enchiladas over the phone to pick up. Got there handed my card...after I signed I thought about it and realized my order was two enchilada dinners. I asked her to refund it and charge me for what I ordered. She rung it up again for the cost. I ended up paying like 30 dollars for 9 dollars worth of food!!!! Then she was like give me back the food!!! What!?!? I live 5 minutes away and drive to Miguel's. Better food better service.
