I would give it no stars if yelp would let me. Health department needs to check this place out. Food was not cooked/heated properly. Took our food home, 3 blocks away and beans were luke warm, rice was ok and all the other main stuff was cold (taquitos, tacos and tamales)... Epic fail. Roberto's is same distance and tastes way better.
