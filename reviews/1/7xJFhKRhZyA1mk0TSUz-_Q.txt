We went here after visiting the website and expecting some pretty good food and drinks. This place is as "Americanized" as any Mexican place I've been. The interior, service, and food is mediocre but everything after that goes way downhill. The chips and salsa were very sub par but the fajitas actually had a little seasoning on them (too much to ask for most of the time). The worst part about the restaurant was the margaritas. I came in expecting a good drink after seeing it was voted best margarita in Charlotte and left wondering how 600,000 people could be so wrong. They have sweet and sour mix by the gallon and that's all the drink tasted like. Fresh lime juice is not bright green, so the drink shouldn't be. I even overheard some drunk young dude who knew no better comment on how good his margarita was while sitting at the bar. Thar poor soul has no clue what a mans drink is: good tequila, grand marnier/cointreau, and fresh lime juice. Mine had the first two but I couldn't taste anything but artificial mix. 

Go there if you want a step up from Taco Bell for three times the money! Otherwise seek out something more authentic.
