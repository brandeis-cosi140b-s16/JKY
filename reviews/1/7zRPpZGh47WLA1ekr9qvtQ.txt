parking is a mess...food...so so..they seem to think their salsa is the bomb..but the flavors just don't quite hit the spot. The concept is great and the atmosphere is good..
even the bar seating (which is extensive) is comfortable) Service could be much  improved...come on it took forever to get a bottle of beer....the burrito...carne asada..
not much flavor..meat was tough and the various other ingredients just didnt play well with each other...very dry...when I want a burrito grilled on one side..I will say so..
..overall I think they are trying to hard....
