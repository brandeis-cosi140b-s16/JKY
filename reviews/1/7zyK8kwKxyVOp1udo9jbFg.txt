Chipotle is awesome; however this is the single worst location I have ever been to, which is why the rating is so low. I eat at chipotle all the time, but will never ever go back to this location. 

Food: The staff (which are quite nice at least) never manage to make a decent taco. For example, everytime I order tacos with salsa, they put a dot in the middle of the taco, and I either have to ask them to correct it, or spread it on the taco myself. They also give maybe 50% of the meat any other Chipotle does. I would think a chain wouldn't vary this much with the amount of food you receive, but obviously that assumption would be wrong. 

Interior: Interior is terrible as well. All the tables are so close to each other it is impossible to not be enveloped in other peoples conversations. I often can hear the people sitting at the table next to me louder than the person across from me at my own table. Not because they are so loud, but because the tables are set up so poorly that I'm actually closer to them than the person I'm eating with!! Oh and the seating also holds like 1/10th of the people who come in on the average lunch. You might get lucky, but don't expect to be able to get a table the vast majority of the time at lunch.

Parking: Parking is absolutely terrible. The parking lot is tiny tiny tiny, spots are all small (which means very very often people park over the dividing line), and you'll often see people parking down the street in the apartment complex, or at the shopping center beside Chipotle. Horrible planning. 

Staff: Can't complain about the staff. Granted, they can't make a decent taco to save their life, but they are always generally polite and nice.
