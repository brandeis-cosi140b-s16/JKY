I have always had a good time at Top Shelf, but last nights visit proved different.  Are server was preoccupied with a baby at the bar then taking care of his customers.  I ate 2/3 of my dinner without anything to drink because he didn't check on us.  My food was cold and my tacos were so greasy that the grease was pouring out the bottom and the shells fell apart. While still finishing my undelightful  dinner, the server finally asked if we needed anything else or wanted desert.  I asked for water and my husband asked for more tea.  It took over 5 minutes to get the drinks.  My husbands tea glass was completely packed with ice and 2/3 full with tea, there was so much ice that he could not even mix a sweet n low in it. I will try one more time, but think I may have to love on to somewhere else.
