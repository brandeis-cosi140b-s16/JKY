I had been looking forward to coming here since I moved from New Mexico.  I saw all the reviews & I just KNEW it would be like I was back home. I ordered the green chile chicken burrito enchilada style & guacamole & my husband ordered the eggs & chorizo plate.  The sauce was so vinegary tasting & was loaded with cilantro, very bitter, so I was just eating the meat out of the burrito which was VERY tasty! At this point I was pretty bummed since I could tell this wasn't green chile that was used at all, halfway through I'm cutting into the tortilla to get the chicken out & I found a hair inside of it. They were very sweet & refunded my money as well as offered to make me something else but at that point I had lost my appetite. I know things like this happen but it still doesn't make it any less icky for me. My husband loved his meal so he will probably be back, but I can't say that I will.

Update 4/11/14 So the refund that the girl behind the counter was supposed to do was never done & it's been almost a month. Yeah, I'm def not going to be visiting this establishment again.
