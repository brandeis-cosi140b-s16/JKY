I would give it 1 1/2 because only because the service was ok. First we order a appetizer and when it came out it was just cheese melted in a pan now it was good cheese but still just cheese , before we ordered this we asked our waiter what it was and since he barely spoke english and I mean not really at all he could explain what it was. Then The food came out we ordered the chimichagas it came with jalepeno cream cheese and melted cheese on the top. I liked it and the rice was good but I have had better. I gave it such low star rating because the food was not authentic mexican food. I would not go here again even with a coupon.
