Two things give this establishment the one star rating.

They failed to disclose a surcharge for using credit as a form of payment until the transaction was complete.

The smell in this restaurant is unbearable.. It literally smells like backed up sewage!

I have been to MANY Robertos Taco Shops and this one is the worst by far. There seems to be no pride in ownership, as the restaurant is unkept and unsanitary.
