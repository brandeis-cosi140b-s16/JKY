My experience with the Taco Shop was as extreme letdown. My friend and I hit up Taco Shop after one night and were thoroughly disappointed with our experience. I could have made the tacos at home. The tortilla was cold, the cheese tasted like Sargento - not melty and delicious like the asadero cheese from Burrito Drive or the Sabores Latinos food cart. Not even decent enough for a late night snack. Horrible horrible horrible.
