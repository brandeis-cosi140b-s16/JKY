Don't let the awesome decor and delicious smells fool you. HORRIBLE service and mediocre, over-priced food! We initially to the back patio to grab a table because the inside is very small and there weren't a lot of open tables. Chips and salsa were very good. Waiter got us our drinks and then he never came over again. We even asked another server if we could order our food because we had been waiting so long but we didn't get assistance.

Not ready to give up just yet, we decided to go inside and see if we could get better service. It was less crowded now so we were able to grab the only clean table. (There was one waitress serving all the tables - on a Saturday during prime dinner time). I ordered the chicken fajita plate. There were no peppers! In fajitas! Chicken was chewy and didn't have much flavor.   I could get better fajitas at Chilis. How sad!   My boyfriend ordered the shrimp enchiladas, but our server let us know 10 minutes after ordering that they ran out of shrimp.  My boyfriend ordered the veggie burrito, which was supposed to come smothered in their home-made red sauce. It wasn't. My boyfriend said it was very bland, and we were overcharged for our food. His burrito was (supposed to be) $10 and my fajita plate was $13.

Overall I am very disappointed because this place had such potential, but the service and food just failed so miserably. I almost tried to convince myself that maybe they had an off day, but it was seriously a Saturday night during prime dinner time and there's really no excuse for this bad of an experience. Will not be going back.
