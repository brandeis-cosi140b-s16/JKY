I've never had a bad experience at any Chipotle until this past weekend. My daughter got a free kids meal coupon at a Halloween event and when we went to use it we were met with ignorance and disdain. She ordered a taco kids meal. When she went to tell them what toppings she would like on her chicken taco, they advised that the rice and beans on the side were all that came with it. Seriously? She got a corn tortilla and some grilled chicken and that's it for her taco? The lady advised it would be extra $ for any toppings which I elected to pay. I ordered a grilled chicken salad and got the skimpiest little salad I have ever gotten at a Chipotle. Were they running out of food on a Sunday? I don't understand how the salad I got from this location was literally a third of the size of the one I normally get from the west Sahara and/or the North Durango locations. Maybe they have something against someone using a coupon. Either way, you'll never catch me here again!
