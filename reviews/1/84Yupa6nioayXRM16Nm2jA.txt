Long story, but funny. My wife and I had a night out. Being very seasoned service industry veterans, we have a decent tolerance for people that are busy on busy nights. Our bartender/waiter was busy . . . Because he sucked. He was weeded from minute one, screwed up my order,my wife's order, overcharged us for guacamole and had the cahones to ask us if everything was fine.  We paid $50 to eat 2 dinners that we didn't order, waited a long time for everything and had to listen to him complain about his incompetency. He claimed that he had bartended for 7 years, but looked like he started yesterday. 
Our food was ok, but no where near what we ordered. I will give them another chance, but pray that "David" will be nowhere to be found.
