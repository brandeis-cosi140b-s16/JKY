Disappointed!!
I been to don pedro restaurants before, but this was my first time at this location. The place was almost empty so we got seated right away.
Five minutes later our waitress arrived not very friendly at all.
I  order sopa de tortilla witch I usually enjoy having (even when is hot). 20 minutes later pass after a got my soup. it was served in a huge bowl, boiling hot.the taste was nasty it tasted like water with grease and dry chile.big chunks of chicken I mean DISGUSTING ...THE waitress didn't bother to ask how the foo
d was.she took my bowl exactly how it was  served!
poor service & flavorless food. never coming back!!
