Bland and Flabby.  $45 for a small, mediocre and forgettable meal.  I had the shrimp "ceviche", which I don't think had seen a drop of citrus but instead was made with tomato sauce that tasted suspiciously like canned tomato juice.  The chicken enchiladas which were tasty enough... to eat, but not to bring me back.  Besides, I could only have a couple small bites because I'm allergic to chicken (I know, I know - very wierd).  I thought a glass of riesling woud pair nicely with the shrimp.  One would expect that a Mexican place would stock a nicely acidic ,crisp riesling, but theirs is on the sweet and flabby side.  The Texas margarita tasked like those horrid "pixie sticks" from when I was a kid - sweet and tart and like it came from a  powder.  If there was tequila in the drink, I could not pick up on it ... maybe my tastbuds were dulled by the bland ceviche and flabby reisling.  

On the good side, the cheesy paper fish hanging from the ventilation duct is the only bit of real character in the place.  It befuddles me as to why people had nearly filled the place by 7 pm.  Were they ALL first timers????  FYI, Yesterday's AZ Republic had a coupon for a free appetizer at San Gabriel, so dig your paper out of the recycle bin and see what you think of the place.
