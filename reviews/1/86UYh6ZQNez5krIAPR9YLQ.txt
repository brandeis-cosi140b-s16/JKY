After a meal at Moira Sushi, we decided on a whim to stop in at Jordon's for a fried ice cream dessert.  We walked in the door and the place smelled of old carpet and b.o.  Not very appetizing, but I'm willing to give any place a chance.

We ordered the dessert, it arrived promptly...and was clearly not freshly made.  A very icky mushy crust with some cinammon and a dab of whipped cream, after a few bites we both looked at each other and said "yuck!".  Worst fried ice cream we've ever had!

After seeing some of the food passing by, it's probably on par with any other chain mexican, similar to a macayos or carlos o'briens.  Crispy tacos, flaccid yellow cheese, tomato and lettuce on everything.  Surely a step up from Taco Bell, but what's the point of that?  

WIth so many authentic cheap (and good) Mexican food places nearby with great corn tortillas and cotija cheese, I'll call this one a total pass....and I understand why I've never stepped foot in the door in 10 years that I've lived within 3 miles of the place.
