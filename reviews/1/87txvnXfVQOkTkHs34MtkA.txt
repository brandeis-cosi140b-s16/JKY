Very simple: Poor service-Over charged
We came in with a group of 7 (not very large in my opinion), We just ate and had 1 or 2 drinks a piece (birthday dinner before going out). My food took 20 minutes longer than everyone else, despite ordering the same thing as one of the others. They were kind and waited for me, causing their food to get cold (i begged them just to eat ahead of me, and i would eat alone when it came out). After that poor service, I was still automatically charged a 20% tip... 20%..20 is for someone offering good service. Having my meal come out 20 minutes after everyone else is NOT good service. in fact, it really ruins a meal. I don't agree with an automatic good tip (regardless of how many people), automatic 15%, ok i can see why that is necessary, but an automatic 20%..automatic good tip regardless of service (and in this case, bad service).. i will never go again. food wasn't great, service was BAD (half of us didn't drink, the other half had 2 drinks, but we still had to flag the waitress down for those drink or anything else.  (I crossed out the tip and wrote the amount and signed my check, they still charged my account for the tip, i believe this is illegal, as the receipt i signed did not have the tip on it)
TLDR- They will force you to leave a good tip, even after the blatantly give you Poor service.
