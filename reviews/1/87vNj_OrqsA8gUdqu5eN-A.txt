Skip and goto Osha Thai opposite. We gave up a great meal to try this place. Knew there was trouble when there was dried food on the silver wear and last nights grease stains on the cloth napkins. I kept my mouth shut, the server had attitude at 'hello'. We left 3/4 of our food on the plate, it was bad, reluctantly had to open my mouth and tell the server food wasn't great, he replied with major attitude, 'oh thats funny, everyone loves our food' and then glides off. It was that blunt. Came back with bill. We highlighted the fact he didn't ask what was wrong and major attitude sprung again. Asked for the manager, he sprung major attitude again, manager came out, I felt for the guy, he did his best, some servers need new careers seriously or just need to jump off a cliff. 
Gave us half off the bill, we weren't looking for $ off, just to give our experience and really let them know. How many customers leave saying to themselves 'that was terrible' and they never know. I'm tired of spending my money on poor food and expected tips on rude servers. One positive.....Beer was cold
