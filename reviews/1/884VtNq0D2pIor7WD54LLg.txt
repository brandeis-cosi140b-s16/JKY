Walked in here during the Super Run on Water Street and received a Special Super Run Menu. We paid $47 for 2 meals with 2 beers. Side of salsa = $5. Soda = $4. Don't know the remainder of the pricing because they don't present an itemized check. Paid with $60 and they did not offer change. When asked about the pricing, they flipped the closed sign and shut the door. This place is trying to collect all they can now and they don't care about their future. I will not return!
