I wish I can give this location negative stars.

Went to this location because the local one by my house was jam packed during lunch. Very bad decision. It wasn't crowded or anything but they managed to forget my order. People who ordered way after me was getting their food. I waited for 10 no hues before I said something. The lady behind the counter did not even apologize. I'm never coming back to this location. 

The employees stink and they are so rude.
