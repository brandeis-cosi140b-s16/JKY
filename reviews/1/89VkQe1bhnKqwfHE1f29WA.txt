Salsa tasted like tomato paste and pepper flakes mixed. So not the best. We also had the guacamole crisp and it tasted like something a 10 year old would make. Definitely not authentic Mexican food tasted more fresh Taco Bell. No cheladas! And the To go box was a paper plate and aluminum foil. Only thing I would say about this place is that it's cheap but don't expect anything special out of mi amigo.
