Kitschy decor, annoying TVs, service was ok but disinterested.  This is a far cry from real New Mexican cuisine. Flavors are muddled and the dominant taste experience is spicy and that's it. Lots of bland, greasy cheese and no fresh herbs or fresh flavors.  Tomatillos were absent from an entree that was supposed to have them. Pozole was spicy and the hominy had no flavor.
