Worst food in the world!! So salty took 2 hours to get a refills. Waitress rude manager doesn't care. I will never come here again. If you want high blood pressure come and order anything on the menu. Don't drink any fountain or ask for a cup if water it's worse then tap! Oh and don't ask for an appetizer you will get it after your dinner comes. You complain and they will tell you to come back when there not busy to get better service. Nice management NOT
