Went last weekend. Service came in spurts but short staffed probably. The food was not the best.  Got a carnitas chimichanga and it was so bland and flavorless. It was extra dry. I asked for salsa and chips to take home and offered to pay. I was told I could take the chips left on the table. But they gave me salsa to take which I paid for got home and it was not the one I asked for. I won't be back!
