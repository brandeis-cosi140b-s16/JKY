We had fifty dollar gift card from a charity auction, still in the envelope. The server couldn't get the card to work for some reason, so manger said he would research the card. Then he had us pay the whole check, he didn't give us the credit. He had the power but not the will. Thanks for nothing management. Moral of the story over priced and under serviced.
