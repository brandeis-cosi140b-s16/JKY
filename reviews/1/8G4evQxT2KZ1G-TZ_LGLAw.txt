Another huge disappointment. This place was recommended by a Mexican employee in the VIP office. I wouldn't be surprised to find out this meat is leftover from the Carver station upstairs which I think is leftover from The Top Of The World. Was definitely not the Mexican food I'm used to in San Diego and even in mexico itself. The wait to get just a burrito was ridiculous long. I counted 25 minutes before my eyes started boiling. Not impressed by the handful of chips to make the $12 burrito look like a good deal. I'd be embarrassed if I were Mexican to recommend this place. I told the girl I was disappointed and she took it as a racial insult. Not the kind of 'sorry it was bad' I was expecting. Jandy is not qualified to recommend anything and I'm wondering how she has a job there.
