Too bad the food is terrible because this could be a nice place to go. The chips were so salty I couldn't eat them. The shrimp tacos had what tasted like 1000 island dressing on them. Tried to scrape as much off as I could. The refried beans were bland. Chicken fajitas were so dry and over cooked. The meal was so bad that my husband said he would have had a better meal at Chilis! Yuck!
