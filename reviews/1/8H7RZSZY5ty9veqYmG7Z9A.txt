Pretty good, but not the best. I compare all Street taco places to a lunch truck in Vegas behind the Walmart on Boulder Highway. That lunch truck had the best tasting tacos EVER! This place was kind of dry and not a great selection of salsa. Typical Mexican fare , little pricey for average quality, but I'd rather go to Polibertos on Baseline and hardy in Tempe. The biggest disappointment was the music selection. IT WAS TERRIBLE AND NOT FAMILY FRIENDLY MUSIC. I was annoyed because I was there with my wife, 11yr and 3yr old daughters, and the music was TOO promiscuous for my taste. Better suited for clubbers. Not family friendly environment when music is blaring about sexual content. AND YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR TORTILLA CHIPS AND SALSA. POLIBERTOS IS FREE SALSA AND TORTILLA CHIPS. MANY OTHER PLACES THAT ARE BETTER, NOT WORTH THE EXTRA DRIVE.
