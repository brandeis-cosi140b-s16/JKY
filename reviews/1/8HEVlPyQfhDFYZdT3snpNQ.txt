the place is suppose to be an upscale taco bar its just plain weird.
the only reason I gave it a try cuz I had promotional offers.

the place has skeletons and motor bikes etc all over the walls and they were playing weird music like power pop type music which was really annoying.
the service and food could have been better as well
