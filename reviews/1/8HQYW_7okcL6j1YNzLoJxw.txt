I'm not rating the food , as my wife and I didn't stick around long enough to try it.  Now, where to begin...
We entered the establishment only to find the lobby deserted.  We stood there for a couple of minutes, then I started down the hallway to where the hostess was having what must have been a very important conversation with another employee.  Body language says a lot and it was clear that I was interrupting her.  She told us it would be 10 minutes, at 3:30, on a Sunday.  
After a few minutes they led us to a half-table / half-booth.  I took the booth side.  While I was sitting, I noticed all of the crumbs, crayons, and crap along the edge of the cushion.  Once seated, my rear-end noticed how worn out the booth truly was.  I commented to my wife, who told me that her chair felt like it was going to fall apart.  
Then we both noticed the sticky table, and the fact that it wobbled with little provocation.  
I understand that things wear out.  I also understand that, when your business is in the restaurant industry, you must deal with that wear and tear, not just ignore it.  
Since it was impossible not to wonder about the condition of the kitchen, given the condition of what we could see (and feel), we were out the door before they could serve us chips and salsa.
