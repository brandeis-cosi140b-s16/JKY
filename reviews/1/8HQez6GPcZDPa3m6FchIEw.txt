I met my Wife here yesterday for lunch at noon. Since I had no breakfast, I am sure I got sick here. I had one of their shrimp dishes and started feeling sick before I even left the restaurant. I was in our bathroom most of the night, and could not sleep all night. I have never felt so bad. I will never go here again.
