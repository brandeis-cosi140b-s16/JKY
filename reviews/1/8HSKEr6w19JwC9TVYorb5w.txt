Why not a "zero star" rating.  Went in this week for the first time; rude people working there and the breakfast burrito was already cold when given to me.  This is the Seinfeld version of the 'soup Nazi" except the food isn't worth the abuse.  How can these rude and arrogant people stay in business?
