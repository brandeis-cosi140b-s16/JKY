Went here hoping to find Baja Fresh but they closed and now it's a Taco Shop.  The menu is somewhat limited and lacking imagination.  I bought the small chicken burrito with a side of beans.  Both were totally over priced, especially the side of beans, it was a small salsa size portion, too watery and way too much salt for my taste.  The burrito was small for the price but had a good flavor though the chicken was diced not chunky at all.  The sides of sauce that came with it had no flavor at all and went immediately into the trash.
The lowdown is you can go over the highway to the Original Burrito Company, spend 3 dollars less and get a burrito 2 times larger.  Chances are unless something changes I won't be going back.
