I went to Pittsburg back in April so this is an old review that never was published. 

Food was mediocre,  there was no flavor in the food. I ordered a taco salad, and it was so oily and the meat was extremely sauce. My sister order the enchiladas and she didn't enjoy it because it too was tasteless. The only thing we enjoyed were the tortilla chips and salsa that was complimentary with our meal. I was disappointed that we didn't go to Panera Bread instead and would have had a healthier meal.
