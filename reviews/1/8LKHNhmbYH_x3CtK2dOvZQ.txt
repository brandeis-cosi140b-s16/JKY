Bland food. Bad service. 

Disgusting chips and salsa were $3.95. There should be no charge for chips and salsa. If there is a charge, wait staff should not be instructed to upsell it at the table. 

Chocolate milk was loudly offered as an option to my son. I don't want my son drinking nasty chocolate milk and don't want it loudly offered. 

Empty plates and glasses stacked up and were not removed. 

Confusing children's menu referred to a two quesadilla dinner option that came with a serving of chips and a children's drink.  I ordered one with extra cheese and one with chicken. A single plate was served with a huge chicken one and a huge cheese one. A lot of food for such a small plate I thought. 

When the bill arrived, I was surprised to see a charge for two children's dinners. When I asked to have it removed, I was informed that the children's dinner includes only one quesadilla with "two flour tortillas." I had read the menu wrong. At the time I ordered, there was no request for clarification or indication that I would be billed more than one meal. Since I had ordered two dinners by mistake, I would have expected the dinners to be served on two separate plates, with two sets of accompanying chips with two children's drinks.
