This review is 100% based on the horrible attitude and service I received.  It is for that reason I have no interest in going back and would not recommend to friends.  The place looks great, the menu was easy to navigate and I would probably be a regular there if the employees had not treated me like a cheap because I ordered my 10 year old Son a quesadilla and did not order anything for myself.  It was right after school and we were in the shopping center.  Anyway after being given our order i asked them for a salsa for his food and they said it wasn't included.  I am sorry but I cannot recommend or return to a mexican food restaurant where they charge you for your 1st salsa!!  They then got extremely rude when I questioned it and the lady literally told me anything that comes with salsa states it on the menu... i proceeded to point out a handful of menu items that they confirmed came with salsa but it was not noted on the menu.  I am fine with places charging for extra sauces etc but for a quesadilla with beans and rice they should have given me 1 salsa and none of the other employees stepped in.
