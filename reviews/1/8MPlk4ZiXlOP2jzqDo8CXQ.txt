"Best Mexican Food in Arizona, California, New Mexico"? Oh God I hope not. If so, I am so sorry.

I went there the other day with some co-workers and ordered the #17--2 Carne Asada Tacos for $7.77. While I waited for my plate to come out, I helped myself to the self-service chips & salsa bar. The food came out relatively quickly and the portions were quite generous.

I was presented with the typical Mexican plate--tacos, rice, and refried beans. While the carne asada tacos were relatively average, the accompanying rice and beans were absolutely terrible. Honestly...how can you mess up rice and beans? They tasted like they were mixed with cleaning solution.

In retrospect, any place that prides itself as "Best..." is a self-delusional ploy at convincing yourself that your canned/frozen goods are better than other places' fresh goods. Methinks not.
