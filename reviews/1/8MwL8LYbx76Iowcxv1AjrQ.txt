I was very excited about trying Elvira's Mexican restaurant. I love the new building and decor.  But that's where the good news ends. It took us 43 minutes from the time we set down at out table until the time we got our food. I ordered a cheese and onion enchilada. It was very small and no onion. There was more lettuce on my plate than enchilada. My husband ordered 3 taco that were luke warm and his retried beans were hard and kind of gross. The manager discounted our meal by 20% so that was nice.  But with the food being bland, small portioned, and a long wait time, I would not recommend this place.
