I have been to this Filiberto's a few times.  On previous occasions, I have had a beef chimichanga, which was acceptable and a plain cheese quesadilla, which was tasty.

Wanting to take advantage of Taco Tuesday here, where the chicken and beef tacos are only 99 cents, I came here for a late lunch.

My first taco was a shredded beef taco.  On my second bite, I bit into something that was not meat.  Gagging on this, I took it out of my mouth to discover it was a disgusting piece of cartillage or meat lining - I really don't know what it was.  I have never had a taco with anything like this in it and I actually posted a picture of it.

I barely made it through my other two tacos.  The other beef taco, like the first, had very little meat in it and did not even come with tomatoes. The chicken in the last taco was not very tasty at all.

Looking to salvage this meal, I tried a few salsas at their salsa bar.  They were all watery.  They did not offer pico de gallo, which would have helped.

Honestly, this was an awful, awful meal.  Skip this place.  Trust me, its not worth it.
