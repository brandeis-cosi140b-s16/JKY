We went to this location a couple days ago and we got a 10 piece meal with 2 sides, and it was not enough to feed 3 people.  It is a shame cause i love their chicken, but this location is no better than the one out in buckeye  such a shame.     

First of all the size of the pieces of chicken could be bigger.  Second, the chicken was so dry from over cooking i have a hard calling it food.

The service was good, their new employee still had a positive aditude hopefully they keep it.

at this time they are a pass for me
