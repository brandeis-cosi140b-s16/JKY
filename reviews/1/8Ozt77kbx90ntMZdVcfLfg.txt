Don't go here. I would rather be gutted in a medieval torture room, have my heartbroken 3 times by the same person, live on the street for the rest of my life than eat at this shithole again. From the very onset of our visit when the waitress who poured our water didnt even understand simple english (meaning our questions fell on deaf ears), I knew this would be a disaster. After ordering from an unappealing menu, we waited for a bit until I started to feel itchy. Looking around, there were mosquitoes everywhere. Confused, I turned around only to find we were seated right next to a trashbag. When I asked the waitress (a different girl) about it, all she had to say was "yeah they come around a lot at this time it sucks haha." Wow, thanks for pointing out the obvious! Im no idiot, I've lived in AZ, and most indoor places do not have mosquitoes socializing around every table like some sort of insect rave. Instead of doing anything about it, my complaint fell on dead ears while I tried to enjoy my food despite having to scratch my arm like some sort of flea infested cat. Unfortunately, the food itself was awful. I had the "Pollo Rico" and although I am not proficient at spanish, I now realize that "rico" probably means "bullshit." Bland, uninspired dishes with nothing that stood out made the already awful experience shittier. Do not go to this hellhole. Do it for me if not yourself.
