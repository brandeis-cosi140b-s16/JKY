Yuck! How do you call yourself a mariscos restaurant and not sell fish? Also they have this picture of a big refreshing margarita and it says $.99 happy hour but when you go to order it its as big as a shot glass with ice filled to the rim and it actually costs $2.99! It's the worst Mariscos restaurant I have ever been to! Please don't waste your money!
