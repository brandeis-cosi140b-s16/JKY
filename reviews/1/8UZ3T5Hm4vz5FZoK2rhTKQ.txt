So bad, I must have been really hungry to eat here. Ordered the #2. (This is what THEY call it, so you would think that would be easiest on them to remember, right?) Delivered a #1 instead, that looked like a #2 on the plate, and tasted even worse.(Couldn't even get that right).  Beginning with the unidentifiable, grey, completely void of any taste, mystery meat contained in my taco, to the scarce trace of ANY filling whatsoever in my enchilada, the burnt tostada shell, the cold, stale, generic, tortilla chips and watered-down, thin, red-colored, pathetic lame excuse for salsa, was just about all I could take without wanting to chuck it all right back at them. Absolutely, without exception, the worst dining experience I have ever had the displeasure of having. Deserves whatever happens to them. No excuse for this.
