I went to Sabroso Fresh Mexican Grill with my son for dinner and it wasn't a good experience. Definitely not kid friendly...the options for the kids meals were not healthy at all or fresh for that matter. The woman taking my order seemed rude and inpatient and she ended up getting my order wrong. The restaurant was a mess the tables were dirty and a lot of trash on the floor. The food was the worst Mexican food I've ever had, I ordered the barbacoa tacos and the meat was cold it wasn't even warm. This place was anything but sabroso. Which in spanish means delicious...if they had less than a star I would give them just that.
