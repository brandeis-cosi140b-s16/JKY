The place looked great but after we sat down it was downhill from there!! 

I ordered the chicken tacos they were so spicy I could not even enjoy them beans and rice were plain so all I ate was one taco. 

My fiance ordered the chicken salad the chicken was over seasoned and he only ate maybe half. 

Our friends ordered the burgers and they actually said they tasted great and I wish I ordered that but who knew burgers at a Mexican restaurant would be their highlight! 

To top it off the service was so slow and it took about 35 minutes for the food to arrive I will never return to this place.........................................
