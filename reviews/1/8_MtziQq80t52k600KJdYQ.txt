This had been my favorite Tuesday night restaurant. My husband and I went so often that the waiters and waitress in the bar area knew our order. We ordered fajitas from the senior menu. We had not been able to go for a few weeks due to personal reasons, and went tonight and were not happy to see that the Tuesday night senior menu has now changed, and fajitas are no longer on it. Also you now have to both order a drink. I can't have caffeine or sugar and only drink water. So that is now another issue. I could order a soda and just not drink it. But unfortunately without the fajitas on the menu, we won't be going back anymore. They lost a very good customer over this. Before this it was a 4 star restaurant.
