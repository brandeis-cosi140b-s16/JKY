I usually love Filiberto's but the last few times I have been there, the quality of food has gone down. Their beans tasted so watered down. I got the Huevos Rancheros this morning and it was so nasty. It looked like they took old pico de gallo and plopped two fried eggs on top.  My husband got the machaca breakfast burrito and there was barely any meat and the eggs were way overcooked. Super disappointed. Also, I noticed they put red tape over the ".99 cent" taco sign and wrote "$1.19" with black marker. Seriously? This is a super reflection of your business. Take the extra .20 cents you are making on your tacos and buy a new sign!  super ghetto!
