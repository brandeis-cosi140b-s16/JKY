Today was my second time going to this Tequeria.  I heard a lot of good things about this place and after reading the reviews I thought "wow,  I have to try this place.". Boy oh boy were these reviewers wrong. On my first visit I got a burrito de tripas and enough carne asada tacos to feed my family of 4. The tacos were edible but not "amazing" and the tripas were disgusting. They were just boiled and excessively chewy not at all fried like they claim to prepare them. After that visit (in April) my husband and I decided to give them a second chance so we went today(June).  BIG MISTAKE!  Our order consistent of Mendo 9 Carne asada tacos, 2 tacos de pastor,  4tacos de tripas ( we asked for them to be fried because we like them crunchy).  We had the order to go because it's  only  3 minute drive.  We arrive home and sit down for our meal to our disappointment they had forgotten 2 Carne asada tacos, the tripas were once again excessively chewy (not fried at all), and the menudo was cold, greasy and lacking flavors that it's well known for.  Not at all the "RICO MENUDO" they advertise. I did try calling to speak to who ever is in charge unfortunately the phone rings a few times and goes into voice-mail but the voice-mail is full.  I will definitely NOT be patronizing this place again.
