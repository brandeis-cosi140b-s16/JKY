The worst huevos rancheros I've ever tried to eat. Two diners near me sent their lunches back, both for being cold.I just ate a little of the rice and beans and walked out. No salsa, generic hot sauce in a squeeze bottle, a dollar if you want some chips with it. I was tempted but for the fly under the saran wrap of the next bowl in line.

I've seen reviews in favor and one said it can go either way. I must have hit a bad day, too bad for me to return anytime soon.
