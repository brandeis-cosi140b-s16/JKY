Dos Gringos can kiss my California BOOTY!!  The only people who come here are losers who THINK they are cool, people looking for a fight, and people who just turned 21.  The place is dirty and the staff is rude.  The bouncers think they rule the world and if you're not a "regular," they hassle you.  God forbid you hold your beer bottle in a way that they don't like.  Listen up peeps - do yourselves a favor and pass this place up!  Meeting behind the dumpster with a bottle of tequila would be better than going inside this dump.  NEVER AGAIN DOS GRINGOS!!!!
