Tacos were expensive and tasted bad.  Mom spent $12 for 4 large tacos which is absurd for a taqueria. I only ate it because we were hungry, it was late and at least it's not greasy spoon fast food.  The food was not the best quality as it did not hold up well by the time my mother brought me the meal, and she was not far away from the UMC where I was.  The tacos were cold, tasteless and the tortillas fell apart too easily when eating.  The vegetables in the taco did not taste like they were not at the peak of freshness even if they were still edible.  A good quality and fresh tortilla should be warm, soft and hold its shape as you eat it.  The red sauce was milquetoast.
