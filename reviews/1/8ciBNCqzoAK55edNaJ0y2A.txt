My fiancé and I came here last night (7:45pm on a monday) for dinner and the hostess sighs as we walk through the door and the first thing she says is "you can sit at the bar or there will be a wait because we only have 4 servers working tonight."
...wonderful greeting...

I look around and there were already several families waiting, and over half the restaurant was empty tables because they are severely understaffed and just not seating most of the restaurant. I asked what the wait for a table was and the hostess says "I don't really know exactly..." Just as her manager walks up and loudly whispers, "just tell people 20 minutes." 

When we decided that we would wait for a table the hostess hands us our buzzer and says, "just let me know if you change your mind, and ill erase you from our list." As if to try and convince us not to stay. My fiancé and I just looked at each other, handed back the buzzer and left.  

I have been here and the food was decent, but the service has always been horrible, and something tells me there is a reason they only have 4 people serving a half empty restaurant.  

I'm not one to write a bad review either, actually I don't know that I've ever written a bad review, or any reviews for that matter.  This experience just irritated me enough to get back on yelp and let others know to go somewhere else.
