This is an update to my previous raving review(4/2/15).
This Filli's has changed. Their ingredients have changed, their potions have changed, and their recipes seem to have changed as well. I'm am most disappointed with their red enchilada sauce... It's awful. Almost enough to ruin an entire plate. Whatever management did has officially destroyed my favorite place in the valley. I will NEVER come back. The city has also made it practically impossible to get to this joint due to their poorly planned light-rail construction. I have years (15 +) of memories at that location and its a travesty it is gone now. The building is there, some of the same workers are still there. But it's not Filiberto's.. All good things must come to an end, and it is with a heavy heart that I tell you that 'that' time has come for this establishment. I am on the hunt for a new fast-mex place, but not in west Mesa.
