We were disappointed... we were very excited when they opened and had to try.  The tacos were just ok, nothing great about the food and overpriced.  We went during the week for dinner and the seating arrangements are too close together.  We were at a table/booth for 2 and I felt like I was having dinner with the couple to the left and right of us.  It was so loud in there we could hear the conversations of both couples next to us which made it hard for us to talk and enjoy our dinner.  Not a great experience, so we will not be going back.
