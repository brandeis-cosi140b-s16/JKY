A few of my friends went to Amigo's inside Fiesta Henderson on a Wednesday night for dinner.  We went there because we heard they have great Mexican food for relatively inexpensive prices. Both of those things were true.

The food was good. My wife and I split a chicken fajitas and couldn't finish all of the plate. The restaurant serves multiple salsas and hot bean dip with chips before the meal, and we were so hungry, we ended up snacking a little too much on them!

The food was good, the prices (except a $2 side of cheese) were decent, but the service was Terrible (notice the capital "T"). We had an older lady serve us and from the moment we came in, our experience was terrible. She asked us if we would want anything else from the kitchen because they had to close down (we were in and out much before closing). She walked away in the middle of a conversation with me and was just generally rude.

I only write this because I have had similar experiences with the waitstaff here before. I know yelp is not a place to rant, but it's a legitimate concern for all of us who are considering a place to eat. 

I had such a terrible experience that I will not eat there again. At least not on a Wednesday night.
