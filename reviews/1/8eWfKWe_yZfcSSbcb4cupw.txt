They have a $4.99 any burrito special with a purchase of a large drink. But they won't tell you about it, you have to ask for it or you won't get it. Burrito is filled with fillers and hardly any meat! It's sad to see business fail, but Baja Fresh is doing it to themselves. Go to Roberto's instead. You'll get what you pay for, lots of meat!
