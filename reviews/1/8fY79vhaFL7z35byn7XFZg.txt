Wow,  this location has really gone down hill over the past month.  How can they be out of proteins and hour before close. This is twice that I have come in and they refuse to make some steak.  The attitude you get here is horrible.  Very unfriendly staff. Make lines and utensils look like they haven't been washed since last night. Guess the management here has no standards or accountability for thier staff. I get it. .. minimum wage, no work ethics and uneducated kids.
