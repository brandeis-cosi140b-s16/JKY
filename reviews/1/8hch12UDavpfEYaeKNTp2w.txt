Undoubtedly the ghastliiest food experience we have ever endured. My wife and I are very seasoned travelers, i am English and work on cruise ships across the globe, 50 weeks a year. We are also food adventurers and eat in some the oddest places, especially in the Far East. But this was utterly abysmal. Chicken and beef fajitas that had past their sell by date at least 2 days prior - stale chips, guacamole the strangest shade of khaki and salsa which resembled something that had been meticulously scraped from the bottom of a parrot cage. We paid begrudgingly only because the waitress was so attentive (mostly to distract us from what's as languishing on our plates). The following day, today, I have even had a bad stomach. My wife phoned the manager this afternoon, not looking for recompense or a free meal (god forbid) but merely to point out how poor the food was, and was curtly informed that it was our fault because we didn't complain enough at the time! This is truly the Mexican Fawlty Towers and not quite so funny either. If you are considering eating here, I would avoid this place like hemerrhoids.
By the way, avoid the churros like Ebola. I was still chewing the wretched thing 15 minutes after leaving the restaurant.
