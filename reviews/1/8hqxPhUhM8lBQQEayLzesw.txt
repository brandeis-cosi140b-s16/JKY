Oh zabas. I loved you, I really did! Did you see the excitement in my first review? 

You're normally great but tonight I went in at 5:30 and things were different. The girl helping me was throwing out some rice and scraped the bowl clean and then hit the serving spoon on the side of the trash can and stuck it straight into the new rice! What!?!? I should have left right after that but I don't ever get rice with my salad.

Everything, and I mean everything on my salad was awful. The chicken was cold, the black beans were sitting in their disgusting thick juice for way too long and totally ruined the delicious flavor of your cilantro pesto. The sweet potatoes were old and stale. I am so sad, I am always astounded when I see the reviews here because I normally have a great meal every time I come. Then again I normally go for lunch when the food is maybe fresher? 

Either way, I probably won't be back...
