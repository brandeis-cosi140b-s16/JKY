Another Rolled taco disaster. The plan is not for me to go back to my house with my rolled tacos, wipe off the dark green guacamole (?) and have to reheat those tacos in my toaster oven to make them crispy. Dammit, your supposed to make those things crisp all over, not soggy in the middle. Also ordered a decent cheese quesadilla, but this place keeps raising its prices. This is not fast casual or Rubio's quality. This is a lowlife taco shop, charge us normal prices for your usually below average food and we won't complain and please learn how to put a frozen rolled taco into oil for the proper cooking time. Good onions on the salsa bar, but better food in NV.
