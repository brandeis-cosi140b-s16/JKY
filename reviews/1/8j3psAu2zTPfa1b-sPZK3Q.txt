I have a 30 min for lunch, apparently they are unable to make an order within 20 min. I go to this location at least 3 times a week and order online every single time.


Personal issue: 

I understand my order was set for 7:30 pm but I showed up at 7:15 pm. Why not make it then? No, they make me wait till about 8 more people get their orders, I leave due to . So...I get to wait longer for showing up early, I don't understand. I understood it is always super busy but maybe they should hire more staff or put a better trained staff during rushes.
