Normally I have a good experience, but today I got two sausages breakfast burritos with wheat tortillas. Upon getting home I realized both tortillas were covered with mold. When I confronted the "manager" he mentioned that he had seen some with mold on them but continued to use them anyway. I was disgusted beyond belief.
