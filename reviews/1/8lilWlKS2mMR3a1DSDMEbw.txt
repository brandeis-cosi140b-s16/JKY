Normally we do not do bad reviews, but this was so bad and customers should be warned.
My husband called in a pick up order that should have been ready by the time he got there, it wasn't. he was greeted and told it would just be a few minutes because they were fixing the his order. 10-15min later his food was ready and he was told his total was $84 ( the order was 3 hard tacos and two burritos) he said "thats not right" the cashier said "ya that's the total", he again said "no" and she then fixed it with help for another worker. he then paid $30+ for the order and left 20min after arriving.
Once home the food was cold, the hard tacos were all soft tacos, the chicken burrito was unflavored shredded chicken and that's it there was absolutely nothing else inside and the chicken wasn't even seasoned, and the carne asada was like a normal burrito just cold, salsa was good, chips were just dry chips.
My husband called to explain that all the food was wrong even after he had already waited for them to "fix it" when he arrived to pick it up. he was passed to three different people and the responses he received was no better then anything else. They said the don't give grande tacos as hard shells even though he clearly ordered hard and they stated that their chicken burrito is just shredded chicken roll up as a burrito in a tortilla. They said the carne asada burrito is a special burrito that's why it came with other stuff inside of it. The menu does not state what they say, so please be very careful when ordering so that you don't get surprise like we did with my dry shredded chicken in a tortilla. 
We would have loved some apologies for the poor service and food but instead we received excuses and statements that this is how it is. We threw out most of the food, wasted $30, and we will not ever be back to Rudy's:(
