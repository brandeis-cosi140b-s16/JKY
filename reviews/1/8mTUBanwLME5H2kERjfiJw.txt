I must admit. Fili b's isn't the same as it used to be. As I sit here still hungry after buying a $7.00 Arizona Burrito.  I think this might be last time i eat  Fili bs.  This burrito was terrible . I sat in line for 25 minutes in the drive thru.  Burrito was very small the carne Asada was burnt. The potatoes were soggy.  The cashier gave me an attitude because I asked for both red and green sauce. Its kinda sad, I've always enjoyed eating there for the last 20 years or so.  Funny thing is, my experience has been the same way at this location  for the last 2 years at least. I just keep hoping its a hit or miss. But been too many misses lately. I'd give it no stars if it would let me. :(
