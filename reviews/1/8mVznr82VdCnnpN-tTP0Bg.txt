We all know airports are a bit pricey but this is pathetic. Stopped in for a needed drink and ordered a margarita assuming a Mexican place would know how to dish up a nice one - WRONG! I watched as he poured the same mix that you get at the grocery store into a glass with ice and dropped it in front of me - just a glass of cheap syrup... after A sip I asked politely if the bartender could give it a little more 'kick' with some tequila and he said "well I already put 3 shots in" (complete lie, I watched him make it). so I asked for a little more anyway. it still tasted cheap and bland but I just drank it and called for the check ... which was $24.99!!!! WTF really? for a cup of premix and a shot of tequila. this place is pathetic. If someone is willing to pay $25 for a drink the least you could do is make it a good one. I hate this place... DO NOT GO THERE it is bland menu food also (which i already knew from previous experience), but even worse drink menu. I was tempted to refute the tab but didn't want to create a fuss$14 for the glass of premix syrup + $8.99 for a (small) shot of tequila. I felt conned big time. this place cheats you with extreme rip off prices (even for airport standards). Even when I am on the business expense I will refuse to go back here.
