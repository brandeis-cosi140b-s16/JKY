Okay maybe out east our fake beef is tastier or something but this was hands down the worst Taco Bell I've ever had. 

First off, they messed up our order but being hungry and having a grumpy toddler yelling in our ears, we didn't bother to correct it. 

Second, the steak in the chalupas my husband ordered was extremely bland and the chalupa bread was bitter like it was old or fried in bad oil or whatever they do to that. The "beef" in my soft taco was the right color and consistency but was also flavorless. Stranger still was the normally soft tortilla wrap was crispy on the edges but soaked through everywhere else. How long had it been sitting there anyways? 

Hmmm, hoping that not ALL the Taco Bells in Arizona suck. But thankfully with all the Mexican food around, it shouldn't be hard to find decent tacos elsewhere.
