Terrible food, service always rushed.  I've waited longer at Taco Bell, and had better tacos.  The food is greasy and tasteless.  
Zapata's has a few small positives.  Their outside patio looking over the man-made pond is nice.  Their margaritas are good, chips and salsa decent.  When I'm just meeting a friend for drinks, not a meal, this place is fine.
