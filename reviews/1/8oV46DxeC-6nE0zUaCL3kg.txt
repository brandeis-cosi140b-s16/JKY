I used to love this rubios, until they got rude. I prefer to call in my food on my lunch break so that it's ready when I get there. Rubios apparently doesn't hire anyone to answer the phone, even though they have cashiers and managers ALWAYS standing around. They will let you call 5-10 times before answering. Seriously, how hard is it to add "answer the phone" into a minimum wage job description anyways? So after two months of this I went to the manager, who sounded 18. I expressed that I hadn't been able to get through and had been taking my business to Baja Fresh, and she said I'd be better off going to Baja Fresh and also that the phone is a low priority for them. If a LANDLINE phone was ringing off the hook at an establishment I would not want to be there. So, that doesn't make me want to go IN to eat at rubios either, sweetie. Waiting for a call from the owner, most likely done with this joint.
