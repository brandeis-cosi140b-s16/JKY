Not good in my opinion. Sure, it is plentiful and cheap, but that is not really my first priority with food.


Went for lunch with a few friends and two of us ordered the barbacoa burrito. It was gross. Not only did it not taste anything like barbacoa, but just looking at the meat was gag inducing. It was gray and gelatinous. Not good at all. 

Our waitress was very nice but also very incompetent. She brought out the chips and salsas, which are served in small carafes, but brought no bowls. She had trouble taking the order, she didn't check on us, never informed us that the checks go to the desk and you pay there - she just wasn't great. 

Additionally, and everyone has their opinions, but I find the location to be pretty shifty. There are people in and near that hotel that don't seem on the up and up!  Park at your own risk!
