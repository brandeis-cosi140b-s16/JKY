I only ordered ONE item at this Federico's and there were NO other cars or customers and it took the woman forever to bring my food to me at the drive through. There was hardly any chicken on the pollo asado five mini tacos and they charged me over $7.00 for them with tax. They were cold and mostly hard pieces of grizzle. Horrible service and horrible food. EXTREMELY displeased.  Will NEVER waste my time or money there again.
