I've been a regular at the old La Fonda (curry and scottsdale rds) since time began.  They always satisfied.  Then the entire strip mall was sold and everyone had to leave.  I was sad.  I was thrilled to find they were relocating right next to my favorite chinese restaurant, Wong's Place, on Baseline and McClintock.  Couldnt wait for them to open.  A really nice upgrade in the design of the new digs.  However, each time I ate there, the food was different.  The last two times the food was so salty we had to send it back.  This is usually a trick to keep patrons thirsty and ordering more alcohol.  However this is not good for high blood pressure.  I personally would fire any cook that cannot taste the salt levels in food.  Just thinking about it makes me sick.
I will NEVER eat there again.  They've lost my trust.
