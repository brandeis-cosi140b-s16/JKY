I will not return to this restaurant. The service being the main reason. The servers seemed unorganized and out waitress hardly ever checked in on us. Food took an inordinate amount of time to receive and the order was wrong when it arrived. Taco Bell includes more meat in a taco than what I had. 
The salsas were good, and our chips were fresh- but this is an easy "pass."
