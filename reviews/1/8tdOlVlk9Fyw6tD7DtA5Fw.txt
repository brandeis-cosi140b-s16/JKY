By far without a doubt the worst Taco Bell I've been to between North Carolina and South Carolina!  The only positive was my order was accurate.  As for the negative, NONE OF THE TABLES WERE CLEAN!!!  THERE WAS FOOD EVERYWHERE!!!  I had to take napkins myself and clean off the table I wanted to sit at.  Looking around at ALL the other tables, there was food on them.  F'ing gross!  I'm not paid to clean tables so why do I have to?!?!  AND the place was slow.  How much effort would it really take for an employee to wipe down tables?!?!?!?!?  Food on the floor is way more acceptable than food on a table.

On a side note, I was there for lunch around 1:45pm and the average ago of the customer was 95.  This would be normal for Golden Coral but Taco Bell???  I don't get it....

This location isn't near my house so I won't frequent it on a regular basis but if I lived in Indian Trail, NC, I'd drive to Washington State before I eat at this Taco Bell location again.
