I wish I could leave no stars, because I would. The best thing about this place is the "complimentary" chips & salsa $3. These service is horrible, the staff the worst. And let's not talk about the food. The drinks were all watered down, the food was all dry. We saw our server 3 times in the two hours we were there. Never again
