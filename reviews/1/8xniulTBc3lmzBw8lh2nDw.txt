I've now been there twice and can honestly say I will never go there again.  Seriously, the service is the worst.  The first time I went there we waited an hour for our food.  People that were seated after us got their food, paid their check, and left before we got our food.  The second time it took forever again, I thought I was safe ordering nachos, but it came with a "cheese sauce" and the meat left a lot to be desired.  I sent them back and didn't order anything else.  My friends really like the fajitas, but after two bad experiences I'm not willing to go back to try those.  The servers were nice, but non attentive, beyond that I think it's really the management and kitchen staff that need a lot of help.
