Went there last night in hopes of finding some decent Mexican Food. Unfortunately, this was not the case. First of all, the service was lacking. It took us asking twice to just get a container of salt to the table. Also, the waitress was less than interested in helping us with anything more than taking our order. 

Second, the food was atrocious. You know you have an issue if you need to add salt to Mexican food. The rice was dry (almost hard and old) and completely tasteless. The beans were bland and tasted like paste. There was barely any cheese in the enchilada I had. My husband's tacos wee haphazardly put together, falling over and impossible to pick up, and needless to say did not taste good. 

The only saving grace was the shredded beef burrito and the Tomatillo-Avocado salsa. No, I will not be going back, even with the Yelp offer.
