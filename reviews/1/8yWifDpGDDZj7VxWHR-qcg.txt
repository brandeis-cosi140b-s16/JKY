Do NOT go here! Save your money! They will close early if they feel it is not busy enough. We attempted to go here for dinner TWICE and they had closed early...The 3rd time was a charm, but the place itself is NOT!. They had live music, a Mexican Group playing cha-cha music, which was horribly loud! The Chips were stale, & the salsa wasn't really salsa...it was more like hot sauce. I ordered the Albongdigous (Meatball) Soup...It was lukewarm at best. The Chimichunga was just okay... Jim's tacos were too spicy for him...  Baja Fresh is way better than this place!...just sayin'.
