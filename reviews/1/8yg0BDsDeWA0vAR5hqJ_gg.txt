Visited Sunday afternoon after a round of golf. Dishes were stacked up everywhere and it took 10 minutes to get a beer.  Another couple that came in the same time as us walked out. Soft tacos were tiny and lacking flavor. Salsa was also lacking flavor and served in a chipped bowl. Refried beans were homemade and the best thing about the experience.
