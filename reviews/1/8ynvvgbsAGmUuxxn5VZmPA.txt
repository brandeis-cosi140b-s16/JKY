Well... How do I start? 
I'll be honest, did not have the food, so I would not be able to rate it for the taste or flavor of the food but the experience was HORRIBLE!!!!  My family and I were on vacation and wanted a great Mexican breakfast, who can ask for more.  Well we didn't get that at all.  We were very excited to find this place, and with a 1  1/2 year old who loves Mexican food, what can go wrong, right???? Wrong!!!!! As soon as we got there the place was full, not too full because there were plenty places to sit.  Well if you don't consider dirty tables, that is.  No eye contact from the servers, we sat at a dirty table, and the waitress started to clean a table that was empty.  Sat for over ten minutes and my  little boy saying "yummy, yummy, yummy" was not getting the attention from the waitress at all.  We then moved to the table that was cleaned (not very well, since there was salsa on spilled on the table).  Nope, No one said anything to us, not even a hello.  By this point, two other families came in (after we did) and they got menus, chips and salsa, while we sat there waiting.   We waited ten more minute and yet no one had said anything to us.  Looked at my husband, mother, and child, and we left.  It was RUDE that we did not get menus, water, or chips...at this point we didn't want any.  We walked out!  I have NEVER walked out from a restaurant at all and I was happy to keep my money and not give them my business!
