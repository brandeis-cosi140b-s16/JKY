We had a few problems with this place that just made it a "no I would never go back or recommend it" type of situation. We sat in the booth area of the bar so we could watch the game. Ordered beer and sodas and the beer took ten or more minutes to come out. The waitress asked if he wanted a water while waiting for the beer, he said yes. Five minutes later he got the beer but never any water. We ordered the mini chimi platter and asked for half chicken and half beef. Two plates were brought for a total of 16. We called the waitress over since the manager ( the manager tried to give it to the table in front of us) had brought it out to make sure this was only one order.  She said yes so we canceled the entr√©e we ordered, we didn't expect such a big appetizer. The mini chimis were average at best.  We order guacamole and never got it. We were going to order desert but the waitress dropped the check saying how she fixed the mistake with the second chimi plate. We were confused at first since we didn't know there was a mistake since we asked about the appetizers before we started. Guess it was a mistake and our order was wrong on top of it since one plate was beef and one was chicken. We never got the the guacamole and was charged too. 

Honestly, I was just annoyed the service was bad and slow. They obviously didn't know what was going on. Since we tried to make sure they didn't make a mistake before eating, I don't feel great full they didn't charge us for it as the waitress tried to make it as a favor. But I guess in a place that can't get people what they ordered and understand when a mistake is made when it is point blank pointed out. 

There was rips in cushions and over all the place wasn't well maintained. For a place that is called top shelf it prices were the only thing that matched.
