Stopped here on a whim looking for a quick enough meal. The fact that when we pulled into the lot I found myself wondering 'Are they even open?' (because there were quite literally three cars in vicinity of this place) should have told me to turn right around and find something, anything else.

If you're going to charge $10.95 for a cheese enchilada dinner (just as an example) you should probably ensure your food is good. It wasn't.

Bland, uninspiring, pretty much exactly what most of these negative reviews stated. The best part of my meal was the refried beans. Not even because they were that great, but because it was the one item I had on my plate that tasted like it was supposed to taste!

If you're thinking of distrusting the negative reviews and trying for yourself, have at it and good luck. Honestly, and I mean this, save your money and go just about anywhere else. We had a discussion at dinner where I mentioned that I didn't $10.95-like my food, but that I'd maybe $5-like my food. I was wrong. If I had $5.00 to spend on a meal I *still* wouldn't come back here. I'd go to Subway or Taco Bell or something else. 

Friendly staff, cool enough atmosphere (despite the lack of customers). But the food was just meh, at best.
