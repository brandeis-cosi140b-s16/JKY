This is a chips, salsa and margarita review only. Salsa is 4 stars. Chips get 2 stars. Margaritas took an eternity to make and seemed to be limeaid, orange juice and a whisper of tequila. But the service... Ugh. 30 minutes to get our margaritas with maybe five other tables present (one who left because the waitress never came).   Next door at L&B, the margaritas took less than 5 minutes (though their salsa is inferior).
