Not sure where to begin about this place.  (If i could rank below 1 star, I would)

First off, service was basically nonexistent. If you go, sip your drink, not sure when that water re-fill will come back around.  

Food quality is gross.  Both taste and appearance of the dishes is very unappetizing. Not sure how it's possible to mess up very simple dishes consisting of beans/ rice/ salsa / tortillas, but they accomplished it.  

The kids meal has zero effort put into it, I think the burrito was cheese wrapped in a tortilla topped with a Mexican ketchup or something ( I had no problem telling my daughter that she didn't have to finish her meal). 

By far and away the worst Mexican restaurant I have ever been to.  
Recommend this place to any enemies you might have.
