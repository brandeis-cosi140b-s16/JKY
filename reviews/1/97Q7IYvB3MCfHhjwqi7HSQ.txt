The most greasiest mexican restaurant ever!! They give you tortilla chips in the beginning and my lips were glistening with the oil. but the salsa was good. My husband ordered the pink taco. Again, it's sooo oily. If you pick it up with your hands, be prepared to use A LOT  of napkins. Although, it was pretty ok. THe tortilla is stuffed with black beans and it is topped with chicken and some other stuff. The side rice is good, but...it was so greasy! how do you make greasy rice?? I got carnitas tacos and it was not good. We just ate here because we were leaving vegas on new years eve and didn't feel like eating lunch on the strip cuz of the crowds of people. but seriously, pink taco is major oil overload.
