I was leaving REI today and decided to stop in for a taco and a burrito at Taco Nazo. I am huge fan of cheap taco shops and will try just about any. This place will be on the list of "Do not Return".  

The beans in my burrito were soupy and tasted burnt, and the shredded beef in the taco tasted like beef jerky. They also charge for chips and salsa. Lame.
