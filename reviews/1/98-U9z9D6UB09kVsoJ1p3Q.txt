I am truly baffled that this place has any good reviews at all. My fianc√©e and I want here because I had a restaurant.com certificate. As soon as we walked in we saw a sign that said that these are not accepted, which I've come to recognize as a red flag that businesses resort to when they sign up for restaurant.com and then don't like not getting as much money as they want to for a transaction. So we should have walked out but stupidly didn't. Their ordering system is incredibly chaotic so it is almost impossible to order and have your order understood. It is also insanely expensive. One burrito (soggy and undercooked), a coke (their soda machine was broken), three street tacos and mole fries was $28. I have had much better food in greater quantity at Del Taco for $5. When the DJ (?) started setting up we couldn't get out fast enough. Please save yourself the hassle.
