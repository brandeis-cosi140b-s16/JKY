The area where they prepare the food was very dirty as was the fountain soda area.  The girl that made our burritos was very unfriendly.  She also rang up our food before bringing our chips to the table.  The tables were all messy and hadn't been wiped off in a long time.  The food was very bland..blah!  Over $40 for 4 bland burritos, chips, and 4 diet cokes and my husband wasn't full.  Not again!
