Stopped here to grab a bite to eat before seeing a movie ( Taken 2, which was very good by the way). Was'nt my first choice as the cafeteria we wanted to go to had been closed down.
Ordered the classic which was steak or chicken with rice ,beans ,salsa and cheese.
You would think a Mexican burrito would come with spanish rice and refried beans, but this one came with flavorless white rice and plain unseasoned pintos. The steak was good and tender but over all the burrito had no flavor and was served barely luke warm. Even the cup of hot sauce I got barely had any kick. Guacamole, chips, salsa and the like are all an extra charge, so we passed on those.
The burritos were large and filling, but mine was pretty bland and the tortilla itself was kind of mushy and cold, and at almost $17 for 2 burritos and 2 teas, way over priced.
Two visits in one for me, first and last.
