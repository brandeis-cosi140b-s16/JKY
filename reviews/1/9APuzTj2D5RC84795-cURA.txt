I wouldn't usually come to this area to eat but was in a hurry and wanted something other than taco bell. The menu online is completely different than when you walk in but so was everything else. Service was friendly and food came out relatively quickly but this place just gave me the creeps. There were flies flying around, place was almost dead during the lunch hour and just wasn't clean. I also didn't feel like I should have been in there...like a fish out of water. I ate my ham torta and undercooked fries quickly, just so I can get out of there. I will say the bread that the torta was on was really amazing! If I could just get that to go, I would come back. For everything else, no thank you.
