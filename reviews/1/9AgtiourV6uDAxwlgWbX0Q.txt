This place is a mess. The past 6 times I've been here over the past 3 months there has been an incredible delay in the drive thru, orders messed up and overall just disaster. Food came out cold one time, which is surprising consider I waited 20 minutes in the drive thru for it. Another time 3 out of the 4 crunchy tacos were crushed when we got them. The employees look like they have no idea what to do. Overall, this taco ball falls short in capable management.
