5 months ago they had a different chef and the food was fabulous. Since then the chef quit and the place sunk like the Titanic. The service was always great. Bartenders were great. I am a foodie, and I just liked the atmosphere of the place from its opening. Well the new "cooks" ( at best ), even the new so called "trained chef" was terrible.  New management ran the place into the ground. A couple of us made many suggestions but the new person(s) in charge didn't listen. Ivan (the server) had great ideas to tweek the menu but again DEAF ears. Our ideas and thoughts : How do you name a place "Tequila" and not have a signature dish made with Tequila. Why isn't the bar promoting different Tequilas.  Why aren't the dishes consistent from day to day? Again just really bad management. Too bad because 5 months ago it really was great. 
THE PLACE IS NOW CLOSED !!!
