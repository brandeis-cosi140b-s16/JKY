I was a huge fan of Carlo's O'Briens. I have been dining here for years.  It definitely has gone down hill over the years. We had a reservation yet they were seating walk ins first.  We got to our table and there was trash everywhere, chips on the floor, salsa on the table which the hostess wiped with her hand, trash all around the busing station. If you have ever been to a restaurant that has saw dust on the floor I would say the same here except chips on the floor. The waiter was pleasant and did the best he can.  We ordered appetizer and when he gave me the plates I started to serve the appetizer to my family I picked up a plate and in between the plates was salsa they were dirty!!! I ordered the fajitas' and asked for all rice no beans yet we got all beans no rice? My son ordered the chicken burrito and it had bones in it which is very dangerous, luckily he didn't choke on the bones.  When I told the waiter he didn't seem concerned.  

Still the best salsa in town but too dirty for us.
