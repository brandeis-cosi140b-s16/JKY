Ok...if you look at my previous reviews - I don't flame places...but Espos service is HORRIBLE. If you're in a pinch, there food is typical greasy type mexican that tastes ok but leaves you feeling crappy after you eat it. 

But WARNING...don't do takeout there. For 2nd time in a month this place screwed me on a a take out order and it's difficult to check your order becuase they bundle everything. This last time they had THREE items missing. And when I called to complain their manager (who wouldn't give me his name) he initially offered 10% off my next order...and then said "we'll reverse the charges, MAYBE".

Im DONE with this place. That said, I only go there a couple times a year anyway (for 10 years) because there are alot better options than this.
