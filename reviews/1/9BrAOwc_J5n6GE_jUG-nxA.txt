So all I've been hearing around town is how amazing this little Mexican joint is. I and the family decided to give it a shot. We ordered the $1.75 tacos... They lay less then normal amounts of meat. The salsa bar was nearly empty (my refrigerator at home has more salsa) the tacos came with cilantro and onion (needles to say it had more onion and three little leafs of cilantro) I asked for more cilantro and they said not we mix the cilantro and onion together and don't have any with out onion. What in the world?!?!?!? I've never heard of this. The customer service is horrible... The ladies in the back are rude and they have poor hygiene this place needs to get a random inspections constantly! I hope you don't get sick eating here!
