Very bad service. Every other chipotle I've gone to, I am able to get a good amount of extra vajitas because I don't eat meat. When I asked for extra, I was given an attitude and was given exactly two pieces of fajitas. My sister was told she would have to pay extra for more BEANS, seriously? What kind of "customer service" is this?
