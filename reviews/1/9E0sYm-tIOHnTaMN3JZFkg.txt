Like getting what you didn't expect?! Neither do I... This place is almost like a slap in the face to any appreciators of Mexican food. I haven't tried their burgers or anything, but I don't plan on it.

I went here with two other family members for lunch, and I didn't expect much. I thought it would be comparable to Ramiro's or some other generic fast Mexican food, but man was I wrong.

After receiving my carne asada burrito, I realized once biting into it that it was mostly beans and rice. Cheap beans and rice. There was hardly any meat. So I thought, maybe it'll get better as I go down- it didn't.
I expect a lot of good meat when I order a carne asada burrito, but it wasn't there.

My two other family members had beef tacos and chile verde enchiladas. The sauce on the enchiladas definitely tasted like it was from a can.

Actually, a lot of this food tasted like it was from a can, and I found this embarrassing. I felt like this because Buckeye deserves better food than this. I grew up here, I know what great, good, mediocre and abysmal Mexican food tastes like and I felt like I was being fooled into paying for this crap.

I'm never going here again.
