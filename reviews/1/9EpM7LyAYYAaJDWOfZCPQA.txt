From the outside this place looks decent, and something about the 9 neon signs covering the windows that draws you to this location. 

Upon entering, this place the first thing you notice is how terrible the inside looks. The tile flooring resembles the bathrooms that you might be encounter in tijuana or rocky point bar. 

Ordering can be interesting, and due to a lack of a menu, and but they have handy pamphlets. The wife and I both ordered a Carnitas burrito And tacos. 

The food was edible, and bland, and flavorless. The Carnitas were cut into cubes, and it had quite a large amount of fat, and a ton of onions. The carne asada tacos were full of onions too. The food was flavorless and generic. 

I will never come here again.
