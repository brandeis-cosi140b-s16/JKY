Used to come here at least weekly, food is ok but they where cool and had good prices on patron and had a good poor, except last night, we always have two drinks with dinner " we live in the neighborhood and walk home" and how , first  one was a little short and I noticed  it was some one else working the bar, so we ordered another and when they showed up it was half the size of the first one that was barley 1.5 oz. So we complained very nicely and they didn't do nothing, no refund on the crapy shots, no new shot, nothing. And when I told them I wouldn't be coming back ever again because they didn't fix their problem, they didn't care and kept saying that so annoying word :im sorry"  Never again, my tab is always over a hundred and now I will not ever go back over 3.00 of Patron and Ill make sure everyone of my customers and friends and family do not support them or places like that , that think its ok to act like you work at wal-mart
