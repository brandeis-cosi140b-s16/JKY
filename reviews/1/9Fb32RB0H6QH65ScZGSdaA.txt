Dude, don't eat at Filiberto's.  I do not understand why they are so popular all over the Valley.  Maybe it's good for drunks whose stomachs are so polluted with skunky beer and whose palate has been ruined by smoking cheapass ditchweed, but the food at Filiberto's looks like someone already ate it and they put it on a paper plate.  I tried it twice to be fair and I feel lucky to be alive.
