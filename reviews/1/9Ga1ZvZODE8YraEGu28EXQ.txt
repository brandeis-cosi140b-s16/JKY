The food was incredibly bland. I would not eat here again, even though the service was perfectly fine. I should have known not to trust a Mexican restaurant that charges for chips and salsa.

I had a taco salad (which isn't exactly a savory dish, I realize) but everything from the shredded chicken to the salsa was just BLAH. My fiancee had the shrimp tacos and had the same complaint: bland.

I won't go back to this location - but will probably try the Pasqual's on Monroe. If I'm near Hilldale and want Mexican food, I will stick with Laredo's just down the road.
