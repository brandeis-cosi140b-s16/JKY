Chipotle is such a RIP OFF!! I swear, does anyone else not see how SKIMPY THEY ARE WITH THE amount of MEAT SERVING ON THE BURRITOS!!!!!   When I am ordering I say "Hey! Put more meat on there please" but tonight my 16 year old daughter went and picked up dinner.. I don't know if they took advantage of her being aloof, but there is literally NO STEAK  on this $7 STEAK BURRITO!!!! Then they want to insult you by charging you $2 when you actually ask for more meat!!!!! So aggravated right now!!  Have a good mind to go back up there!!!!
