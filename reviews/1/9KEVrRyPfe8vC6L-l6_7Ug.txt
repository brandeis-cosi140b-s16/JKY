Nicer employees would be a plus. Went in today at 8:30 pm and all of the chairs were up on tables and they were cleaning as though they were preparing to close. The employees were incredibly rude and informed us that they were out of chicken and queso. This location is a joke and the owners should seriously consider firing the staff because they clearly hate their jobs and provide a completely dismal and unpleasant consumer experience. I will never go to this location again and recommend that you think twice as well. These people seem to care so little it makes we worried about cleanliness and etiquette behind the scenes!
