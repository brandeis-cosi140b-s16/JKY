This was my favorite restaurant. Used to he eat there a lot over the years. They had a small fire from what I understand and the main restaurant has been closed for more than 6 months but they kept open the taqueria. My daughter and I recently went to the taqueria where the counter staff was rude and the food was dry and tasteless. I was not surprised when I drove by the other day and the place was now completely closed and they were moving all of the furniture out. I hate to see that beautiful restaurant closed down but really the food and service was slipping so I guess for them it was a good decision..but non the less it will be missed!
