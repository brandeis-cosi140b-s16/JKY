I recently went to Blanco on a Friday evening with my boss. We were immediately seated as it wasn't too busy. We ordered a drink and some guacamole and some queso. Since she had to catch a flight we decided to order everything at once. 

I ordered my food and when the server asked which beans I asked which ones have bacon in them, told her I don't eat meat and then took the black beans (no bacon). I then ordered the CHEESE enchiladas. When she repeated the order she said I ordered the chicken enchiladas, I said no, I don't eat meat (again). 

My bosses drink came and then the guac and queso. No chips and no drink for me. Our server came by again and said my drink was coming and started to walk away and I said, excuse me... can we get some chips and plates. "oh yeah" another 5 minutes later she returned with chips but informed us the plates were still in the dishwasher. 

Our food arrived and still no cocktail, I asked her again to check on it. I then tasted my food and thought it tasted funny, I took another bite and asked my boss to do the same, she informed me it was a meat sauce. I flagged down the server and asked her if it was meat and she said I don't know, let me find out. REALLY!! As a side note, I have never had this much trouble at a Fox restaurant, they seem to be completely clued in and know their menu). She came back and apologized and offered me something else. She also said she would tell her manager. Never saw a manager. 

I am shocked at the poor service at this restaurant. I enjoy True Food on a regular basis and they are so professional and are very knowledgeable about the menu. I am not sure I will be returning to Blanco. 

Perhaps more training is necessary.
