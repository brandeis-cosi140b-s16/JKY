Since the conversion to Salty Beach Bar in late March, this place has taken more steps backward than forward. The new decorations are cheesy and do nothing to inspire a feeling of tropical vacation or spring break. 

One real spring break attribute you can experience at Salty Beach Bar is the overwhelming aroma/odor of puke when you pass through the front door. My gag reflex was so strong we moved outside to patio where we found more spring break.

Old, dried food - specifically shriveled rice and torn up tortilla pieces - littered the patio floor around the high-top table we chose to sit at and reminded me of closing time in a cheap spring break bar. Doesn't anybody there know how to use a broom/dustpan? Yeah, the TV didn't work in that area either.

Very few North Scottsdale bar patrons will make this a regular hang. Too many other options.
