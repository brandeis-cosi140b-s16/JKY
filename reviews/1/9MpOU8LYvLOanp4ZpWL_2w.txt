Literally the WORST Mexican food I've had in my entire life. The food was swimming in a pile of grease and I literally vomited in my plate and the manager still made me pay for this slop! My son got sick as well. 

I emailed the owner for a refund which I did not receive but should have called the health department instead! 

THIS PLACE IS ON THE BEST OF LAS VEGAS?!#$%*&
