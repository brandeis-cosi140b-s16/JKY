Sucks!  Why did it take an hour to get our food?  Why did people's orders get out of order?  It was probably a bad day, but they did nothing to make us want to come back and see how a potentially normal day is there.

The food's ok.

One a positive, I actually got to hear a black guy from one group of people tell another black guy in another group have this exchange:

"Hey, that's nacho cheese!"  

"Yeah, that's what I ordered"

"Yeah, but that's not yo's.  It's my nacho cheese!"

And the whole restaurant burst into laughter.  I never thought I'd ever hear that happen in real life in front of me.  That's the only reason I 'm glad I went here.

Still, screw this place.  I'm going to Jack In The Box up the street next time.
