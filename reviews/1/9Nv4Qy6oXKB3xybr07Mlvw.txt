Boy they really do treat you like gringos in here, sat down at the bar seating area no one greeted us (which didn't bother me I know places can be busy) sit down the kind red headed bus boy brought us chips and salsa and water sat for another 15 minutes no menus, saw people sit down at the actual bar and get drinks and menus right away so my boyfriend and I move to the bar, sat there for another 15 minutes no menus but got a smile from the bartender (which was enough, I'm a server I get busy too so I understand) then two guys sit down at the end of the bar and get menus and drinks right away... This is when I stood up and said this is "bull shit" and left... I will never come back to this place again... But it makes me feel good as a person that I'm a better server than the three "servers" that we're working the bar area
