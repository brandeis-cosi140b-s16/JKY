I was ecstatic when they opened this place so I went and ordered a combination plate consisting of enchilada, taco, beans and rice. I was very disappointed with this dish. My beans were very runny and bland. Everything else was just bearable to get down. I'm sad that this place didn't meet my expectations but I will not be returning there.
