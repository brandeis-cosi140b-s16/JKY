This one was located at the Miracle Mile. The service was great. We were seated quickly and the waitress was nice, but.....   I ordered the fish tacos.  

Never again.  I was served two tacos with one over overcooked tiny fish stick in each taco. Even the rice and beans were awful. I've had better Rice a Roni spanish rice.

For good cheap fish tacos go to Rubios !!!!
