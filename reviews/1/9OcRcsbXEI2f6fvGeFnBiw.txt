I went for my first time today and ordered a barbacoa burrito.
It made me sick.

Cons
Cold tortilla
Cold and Flavorless barbacoa
Beans tasted like plastic bottle caps
Salsa had a weird taste  

Pros
The little red tray where they put your burrito on
The guacamole 

I know it's fast food but I just don't find what's so exciting about this place.
There are better places here in the valley that serve delicious Mexican food for the same price.
