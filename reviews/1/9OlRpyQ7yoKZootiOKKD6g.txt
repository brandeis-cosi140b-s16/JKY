I was there for my lunch hour one day. I like that they had a "buffet-style" condiment cart... And that's about it. The Carne Asada tacos were so dry I began to choke on the first bite! After I literally drowned my tacos in salsa, due to how dry they were, I dumped the last taco and left. I finished off the rest of my lunch with a double cheeseburger from across the street at the McDonalds :/
