My family went to this restaurant on a Saturday night . Walking in and seeing how vacant the place was should have been a sign to walk away. My family was seated promptly and the service was ok, One of the dishes ordered contained shrimp. The shrimp was horrible! It was tough and not fresh. The shrimp tasted as if it was cooked without being defrosted. The waiter was informed of how horrible the meal was. He took it back with the food still on the plate. 
We asked to see the Manager and after multiple request it took over 15 minutes for him to arrive. When we informed of the meal he said there was nothing he could do and would not refund the meal. The way he handled the situation was very unprofessional and rude. He then took out his phone and showed us a photo of the plate and it showed the whole plate cleaned off which it wasn't! This manager was horrible and should never run a restaurant. He was very unprofessional and I would never go there again!
