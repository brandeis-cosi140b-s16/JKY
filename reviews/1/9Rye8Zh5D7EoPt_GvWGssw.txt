Unfortunately I can only comment on the poor service as I waited 20 minutes just for a waiter to come greet me to take my drink order.. No server ever arrived, and I had to leave and grab food elsewhere to go. I really wanted to try these tacos and experience this restaurant as a first time visitor. Bummer, but I had to get back to work in an hour, and this place didn't seem too worried about prompt service!
