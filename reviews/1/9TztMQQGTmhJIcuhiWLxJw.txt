The worse experience in a restaurant!  My wife ask for a plate that it was overcooked and salty. Told the owner and the plate was replaced with something different. And when the bill came was charge for the 2 plates!!. Never in my life heard of this before!  Poor customer service! !! Oh by the way food wasn't that great either! !
