This place was very disappointing and there is no way that I will ever return. The service was absolutely horrible. Took forever to get drink menus, the waiter was a scatter brain, and it looked like this was happening at every table. We ordered a lot of different drinks, it took forever to get them and they were HORRIBLE. They all tasted like water, no alcohol at all. When you are paying 17 for a martini, they better put some alcohol in it. The guacamole was good but they put a huge piece of Romaine Lettuce in it so it takes up half of the bowl. Totally not worth it and definitely not for more than 2 people. 2 people at our table ordered the same item for dinner and they both came out missing an item. Are you kidding me?? They didn't bring the items back to the table until we were finished eating. We were here for a birthday and they never brought out the birthday dessert. By the time we got home, I had food poisoning like you can not even imagine!! Thanks Javier's! Still feel sick, hoping this will go away soon. Save your money and eat at Taco Bell. It will be a much better experience.
