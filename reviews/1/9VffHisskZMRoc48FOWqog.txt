Went to a movie at the casino theater and decided to have a quick dinner at Cabo not expecting anything great and it's pretty difficult to mess up mexican food.
Sat at the bar and the first thing that happens is we get a bartender that is by far the worst I have ever seen in 20 plus years in this town.
There aren't enough words to describe this guy but RUDE is a big one among other I probably can't say here.
We ordered food and drink and having to argue with him to do so then asked for our check and he just stared at us and went past us to talk to some new customers.
We then had to ask the bar back to get our check.
OMG this guy really needs to get fired and when we returned home and looked at the receipt there was his name GERARD.
In any other situation I would not have tipped at all but thought of the other people there who deserve their share of tips so did leave something but not even close to what I would have.
The food...it is what it is; Santa Fe Station Cabo food. Don't expect alot and you won't be disappointed.
