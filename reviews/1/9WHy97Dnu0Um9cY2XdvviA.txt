Last time there really enjoyed it, but this time couldn't have been more disappointed!  Not busy at all, but our food and service were really lacking. One meal was so salty it was literally inedible, other one was missing a main ingredient (no onions in fajitas?) and was mediocre. When we complained about the food, they didn't really apologize, and took not a cent off the bill.  Manager apparently didn't care.  You think we'll go back with all the other great Mexican options?  Not likely...
