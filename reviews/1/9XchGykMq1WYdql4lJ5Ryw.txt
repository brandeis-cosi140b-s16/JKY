I used to go to Mi Amigo every time I was in Casa Grande on my trips, and it was always good. I had not been there lately. Yesterday, I went with my family and it was a big disappointment. You get red sauce with 
chips no salsa. The cheese crisp came cold. The taco,enchilada,
tamale,flauta was sub par. Very disappointed.
