Love their location downtown but this one really missed the mark...food was not as good, atmosphere like a fast food eatery, cold.  The food was cold in the middle, had to send back twice and finally took it home.  The music was so loud we could not talk.  It just was not the fun and tasteful experience we enjoyed downtown.  Sadly as we live closer to this location than downtown, so wed be more apt to come there, but we wont' be back.
