If I could write a review with zero stars I would. 

I actually use to work at this location in 2006, it has gone down hill drastically.  

My my boyfriend and I went in to use the restroom and get some food to go. 

Once we were inside the place was horrendous! The table tops were filthy and the employees didn't even look like they worked there. Super unprofessional. We ordered some food and I asked if I could use the key to the bathroom. The guy said I didn't need one so I went in and used it. It was disgusting! There was trash everywhere and the toilet wasn't even white anymore. 

We got our food relatively quickly and left. We started digging into the fries ate a few and then I pulled them out of the bag. There were several long black hairs in the bag. We stopped eating it. I almost lost my appetite, but I stuck through it. My bf got a burrito and I got a couple chicken taco's. I took one bite of my taco and had to spit it out! I almost threw up! My boyfriend took a couple bites of his burritos and said it tasted awful and quit eating it. My boyfriend is ex-marines and by him not wanting to eat that food made it even worse. If you know what the military gets fed, this food is beyond that. 

We threw all the food away. So in the end we spent 16$ on two drinks. 

I think the place needs to just close down. I don't understand how it passes health food inspection. Maybe the health inspection needs to go there with no warning.

Whatever you do don't even bother stopping!
