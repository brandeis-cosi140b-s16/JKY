The only reason this establishment has earned one star is the service and even that's a stretch. Greeted with stale chips and bland salsa, I asked for some warm chips. I was told I could visit the salsa bar for more chips. I ordered a taco salad. It was so very bland and the texture was that of baby food. After a few bites, I could not bring myself to eat any more. After my iced tea was replaced with sweet tea, I was done! Check please! Never to return.
