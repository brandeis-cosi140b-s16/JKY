I was in Mesa and was craving Mexican food! I turned to Yelp and  found Casa Ramos which had some excellent reviews! 

It was a horrible experience!!! We waited more than 25 min for our appetizer and another 15 min for our entrees. Once I got my food, I found a hair in my food!!! 

The waiter asked if he could get me anything else but never apologized. I was pretty much done with this place! The only good thing was they didn't charge me for my plate!!! I will not be going back to this place nor recommending it to any of my friends or family!!!!
