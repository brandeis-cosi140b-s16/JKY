I've eaten here twice and both times I got sick. Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me...there definitely will not be a 3rd time. The food tastes good....I just seem to get sick around 30 min after eating here that resembles food poisoning. Although the food is decent it's  still Over priced mexican food. Plates average $15-$19 and it's small portions. The sopes are the size of pizza bagels. I believe 3 street tacos with beans n rice was $19. Combo plates 20$. I expect a little higher quality food when paying almost 20$ a plate.
