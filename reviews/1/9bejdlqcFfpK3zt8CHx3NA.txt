This is the second time I went here. The first time the food was AMAZING. Huge burritos stuffed with ever topping. The people were so nice and friendly. This time. Well the people were not mean, they just were blah. They were not friendly or welcoming as I was used to. The burritos were made skimpy and they were bland. Barely any beans, barely any meat, barely any cheese and sour cream. The only thing it had ALOT of was rice and lettuce, which I get are fillers, but if that is all I can taste I am not willing to part with my $7. The bark was delicious as always. I live all the way on Fort Apache and I am sorry it is just not worth the drive.
