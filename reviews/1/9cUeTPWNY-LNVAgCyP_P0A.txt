I love Chipotle, but this location is just careless. I put in an order online to pickup in an hour and when I got there, it wasn't made. They simply forgot. The cashier even said, "oh, I don't know why it didn't go through" with no apology. To make things a worse experience, I found that they didn't include every ingredient I asked for in my order by the time I got home! They forgot 2 items and I didn't have the energy to go back to have it remade. I don't understand how my order was messed up with extra time even after they were already over an hour late with making it to begin with. I won't be eating at this particular Chipotle again.
