There was a food truck event outside our office building today so a few of us thought we would check it out.  Out of the 3 trucks this one had what looked to be the quickest turnout of food. As it was crowded, and we were on a tight schedule we went with it. Big mistake!

2 of us ordered the Argentine quesadilla (steak, potato, spinach, grilled onion and chimichurri sauce). Neither of us received potato, the grilled onion was almost non-existent, there was no chimichurri sauce on mine, and my spinach turned out to be hot wilted lettuce - not to mention a random disgusting tomato that was not in the description. Plus they must have buttered the tortilla (which is so not needed) and it turned into a big greasy mess.

The steak had no flavor, there was very little cheese, and the whole thing took up almost my entire lunch hour just to get it and get back upstairs.

The salsa they had set out in little containers tasted exactly like the Macayo's jarred salsa I have in my fridge.

They had one person working the grill and one person taking orders. This is ineffient and created such a backup people were complaining.  Not only that, my order came out before about 10 other people who ordered before me and that started the group talking.

I am truly disappointed.  It was an absolute waste of $8.50 and 45 minutes.
