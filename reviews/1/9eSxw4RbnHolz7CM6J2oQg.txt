this place sucked!! we heard about it so decided to check it out. the food SUCKED!! and the service SUCKED!!  
we walked in and no one was in line and there were 5 people behind the counter and it took several minutes for anyone to ask to take our order. 
the kid was too busy in his conversation to listen to our order we had to repeat it multiple times! 
the rice was waaaaayyy over cooked it was like eating oatmeal in a burrito! the beans were disgusting! the meat was like grease soup! the tortillas were way over toasted that it was cracking and breaking. all around a horrible experience! 
some people seem to love it but theyre obviuosly high or have never tasted good food.
