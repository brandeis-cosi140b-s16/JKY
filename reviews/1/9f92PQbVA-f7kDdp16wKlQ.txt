Rolled Taco special was a bit disappointing. The tacos were not crunchy and were soft in the middle, leading to the ultimate rolled taco  soggy mess. It was 4 bucks for rolled tacos without carne asada, but 7 bucks with the meat and thats the only thing that is special about the special order. The Carne asada was average at best, too chewy and not all the fat trimmed away. Guacamole overwhelmed the five skinny tacos and cheese was not melted great. Horchata needed more taste, as the classic flavors of vanilla and cinnamom were tough to detect. PLace might be good for drunken students, but the experienced Mexican drive through tongue knows the truth.
