You know that "off" smell and taste your glassware had when a mouse died in your dishwasher and you didn't notice it for a few days?

Yea, I don't either but I imagine the glassware smelled and the water would taste something like the water tasted and glasses smelled here.  Ugh.  Seriously bad.  We all had to order sodas at $2 each.  They tasted off too but not as bad.  They need to look in to that.  I've had tap water in the valley and it didn't taste that bad.  If it is your tap water filter it.  Now.  I don't think it is though.  Check that out please.  Now.

The whole smelly water and glasses was so off-putting that the food would have to be unbelievably good to earn even 3 stars.

I ordered the shrimp diablo.  The shrimp was good.  Not overcooked, it was nice and tender.  The sauce was hot.  Not much else.  Just hot for the sake of hot.  It seemed like a finely blended tomato salsa with lots of jalapeno.  The rice was light and fluffy...pretty good.  The beans were forgettable.  

My wife had carne asada.  I asked how it was.  She replied "If you write a review use the words shoe leather."  Ouch.  My kids picked over their food.  One of them ordered a kids enchilada with chicken.  They forgot the chicken.  Other than that it was reported as "Not very good.  The sauce is flavorless."  This is a kid that knows Mexican food pretty well.

I hate to drop 1 star reviews on independent restaurants because I want the little guy to succeed but this place was just bad.  I didn't even get into the service which was passable but no more.  Get your dishwasher examined.  Now.  After you make sure there are no dead things in there run a couple cycles of bleach through that sucker.  Further, if you are serving water from the tap install a filtration system.  Now.
