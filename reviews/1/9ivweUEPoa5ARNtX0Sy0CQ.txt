No adobada nachos aka (pastor) for tonight. Really! No good. The food went Down hill since the company split. Water down salsas to not so good marinated meats.For once Yolanda the cashier was exceptional. She let me try carnitas before I bought them, witch I din't like. The asada nachos were ok, but you can't always have everything in life. Right !!!!
