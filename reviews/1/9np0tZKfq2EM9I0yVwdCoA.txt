the good:  i know, now, this place is a hit it and quit it joint.

the bad:  food. Joseph tasted his smothered burrito and put his fork down, and said, 'I always expect Mexican restaurant food to be as flavorful as your friend's mama's  homemade, and it always remains as bland as hell.' even my entree was bland. the only tasty thing on my plate was rice. dessert did not even make up for any of the blah entrees. i have had fried ice cream before and this was not. the ice cream was rolled around on some cinnamon sugar churro-like crumb sprinkle. the only thing previously fried was the ready shell that their taco salad comes in.

the ugly: no warm greeting. no warm service. no good MIXED DRINK! and, i think, many of the plain clothed people walkin around the service areas must have been related to the kitchen and service staff somehow. ugh, this turns me off because it always makes for poor service.

with the quality of the food here, menu item prices should start at $4.95 and be no higher than $7.95 {that would be for the seafood entrees} I'd hate to see how little seafood is served on such a plate.
