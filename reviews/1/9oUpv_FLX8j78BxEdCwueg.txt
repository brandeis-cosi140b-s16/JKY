Not a fan.  I had pretty high expectations based on reviews and was sadly let down.  I really don't understand the hype of the older reviews.  Something must have changed.  

For what it's worth, Taco Bell has better food and this place makes chipotle look like fine dining. There is a major lack of flavor.  Everything was dry and bland.  I asked for a side of rice and beans and they put it inside the burrito.  The $12 overpriced overfilled burrito looked so sad all alone on the plate.   Seriously who charges $12 for a burrito with no sides?

It's also worth noting they don't serve alcohol, and Mexican without beer should be a crime.  My co worker ordered a combo platter and although it looked good he also complained of a lack of taste.  

I know I'll never return here and I'd suggest you pass as well.
