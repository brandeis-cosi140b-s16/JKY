Just a bad experience. Walked in, sat down in the bar area. Never greeted. Took 10 minutes to have a server finally come to our hightop and bring us menus. I actually had called the store and spoke to a host. Was in the process of asking her to send a server to my table. She arrived as I hung up, lol. She proceed to act like it wasn't her mistake but she would help us. By the way, only a handful of people in the restaurant. She forgot our check and took several minutes to realize her mistake. Server seems like a nice girl, just an awful server. We frequent TQLA because it in our neighborhood, but the service has always been poor. The food is okay and the Tqla is great. Just don't think we will be coming here any longer. We will make it a point to not recommended our friends here also. Too bad because it's a nice atmosphere. Work on customer service for future reference.
