I will definitely not be returning to this location. I'd rather drive to the Pineville Matthews or the Matthews location than come back here. I thought the University location was bad, but no this is the worst I've been to. They are super slow and unorganized. When I was finally able to order I asked for fresh Lettuce because the corner of it left was old and brown. She said yes and went and got fresh Lettuce then filled my bowl with the old lettuce and topped it off with a pinch of the fresh. UMMMMMM 'SCUSE ME! There's a reason I asked for fresh lettuce!! Once they finally got that together, Making my way down the line these people don't even give you a full spoonful of stuff. I was constantly asking for more. Even with the beans. I've never been to a location that's stingy with the beans. Can I at least get a full spoon please. They don't bother to drain the beans or mild salsa. Then the cheese she literally gave me a pinch with the tips of her fingers that sat in the middle of my salad as if it was just a garnish. I then had to ask for a handful at which point she gave me another pinch. By this time I was just staring at her annoyed and she finally got the point and gave me some cheese. We stood there for a moment as they scrambled to make togo orders constantly coming from the back and reaching over peoples food. One guy eventually asked for a lid. Then sat down and ate his bowl inside. My bowl was so watery that it leaked through the bowl. I had to scoop my salad on a plate to eat it. Left in the bowl was a big puddle of fluids. I don't know what's going on with this location but if you want a decent bowl drive to a different location. I understand that they just opened so I tried to go in with an open mind. But I've visited other new locations and they were never even close to this bad.
