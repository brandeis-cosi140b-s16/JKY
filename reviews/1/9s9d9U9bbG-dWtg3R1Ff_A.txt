We went there recently on a Sunday at around 2:00 in the afternoon. There were only four other tables with customers. We sat there for quite a while, and no one came to wait on us. It's like we were seated, and then forgotten. We had PLENTY of time to read the entire menu, and thought it looked delicious! Too bad the service was non-existent. There was a "server call" button, that we pushed, but even that did nothing. Once we decided to bail, the manager came rushing out and offered us a free meal if we stayed. Lol. We didn't want free food. We just wanted to eat, and be waited on like a normal restaurant. Idk if we will try again...it was our first time there, and it was weird.
