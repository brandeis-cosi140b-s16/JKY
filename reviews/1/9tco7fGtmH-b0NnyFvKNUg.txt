I ordered the nachos and they skimped on the cheese. When I asked for more cheese they said there will be an extra charge for that. It was basically nothing on my nachos. The rest of my order was greasy and soggy no comparison to the famous Roberto's. The portions are incredibly small and way overpriced. My recommendation find the nearest Roberto's and stay far away from this place. It's funny but chorro in Spanish means diarrhea
