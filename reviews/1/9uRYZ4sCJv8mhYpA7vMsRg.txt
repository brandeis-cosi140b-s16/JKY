Worst dining experience ever. My friend chose this restaurant for her birthday which happens to be Cinco de Mayo so naturally we expected a wait. When we put our name on the list we were given an expected wait time of 45 minutes for a party of 6. Nearly 2 hours later we were finally seated. We placed our orders and when the food came out everyone's came except mine. The waitress seemed confused about what happened to my order and said she would be right back. She came back about 5 minutes later saying my food would be up soon. 15 minutes later after everyone else has finished she comes back saying it will be 2 more minutes at which point I explain that I am no longer willing to pay for it. She sends her manager back who seemed annoyed that I was unwilling to pay. Long story long, after being there nearly 3 hours I never received any food nor an apology. I will not frequent this establishment again.
