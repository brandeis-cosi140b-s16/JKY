This place has terrible margaritas. We even ordered a second round to see if perhaps it was just the first drink we got however; the second ones were just as bad! The "large" guacamole was not very filling at all and was very bland.... I definitely  wouldn't  recommend it and won't be back. For four 6 oz margaritas and an order of guacamole,  our bill was $50-- The atmosphere was not even that great either it's a construction zone surrounding the whole patio.
