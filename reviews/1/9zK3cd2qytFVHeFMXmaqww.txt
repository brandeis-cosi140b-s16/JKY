Objectively bad. When I found out this place was owned by the people that owned El Toro it all made sense. I do not know how this place or El Toro manage to stay in business considering that they are literally some of the worst "mexican" places I have ever eaten at. 

A friend of mine ordered the guacamole and reported feeling not well after eating it (she hadn't been drinking so you can't blame the booze).
