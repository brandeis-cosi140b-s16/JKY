Every. Single. Time... We come to this location they are out of something. The line is to the door as like any chipotle, but what's different here is you'll wait 30 minutes to get to the counter. We started ordering using the app thinking what could go wrong, we put in the order about an hour before the pick up time. When we arrive (of course they have to inform me that something is missing) they then get around to making our food. Usually they help the majority of the line first. So we end up waiting even more. It's a shame because my love for chipotle is ridiculous but this is the only location in surprise. Once, twice maybe three times this happening would be acceptable but they are 10 for 10.
