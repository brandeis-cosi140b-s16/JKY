I went to see GlassJaw there last night. It was the worst experience I have ever had at a bar. It was hot. They had fans but none of them were running. The misters were on but were not functioning well. The bartenders were slow and took a long time to acknowledge everyone. The security guys were very aggressive. The reason I went there was to see the concert and since it was a bar I assumed I could drink while watching the concert. Nope... They do not allow you to drink in the room where the concert is. So I go to buy some water. They only accept cash at the nearest bar. I didn't have cash so I made my way through the crowd to the other bar. They are out of water bottles. I finally make it to the other bar where there is a $10 min purchase so I had to buy 5 bottles of water. So frustrating!!! The concert tickets were way over priced. I don't care who plays there in the future. I will never go to this place again.
