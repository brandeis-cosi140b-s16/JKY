Too bad one does not have the option for NEGATIVE stars. Eat here if you are a masochist. The service was horrific. Our drinks were never refilled. I ordered 1 bar drink, an Almond Peach Margarita which was stunningly made improperly. It was saturated mainly with Peach Schnapps. It resembled a drink someone who knew nothing about bartending would conjure up.

Next was the CUZAMIL PLATTER. For 16.95 one gets the experience of Chef Gordon Ramsey's kitchen nightmare experience prior to the makeover. None of the food had ANY taste to it. If one wanted to make these items and left them sit in the fridge for 10 days, threw it in the broiler, laden with grease it would recreated this wretched experience. If my husband and I don't get food poisoning I will be shocked.

The fascinating aspect of this memorable experience was when the waiter (and I use this word lightly) came to remove my plates. He asked if I wanted my food wrapped as I barely eat it. My response was "Absolutely not. I forced myself to eat as much as I could so I won't be hungry later. This food was horrific." His response was "okay, so your ready for the check." Nuff said. The best part about this experience was leaving the restaurant.
