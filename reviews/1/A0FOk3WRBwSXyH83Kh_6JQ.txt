It's hard to explain how dumb people can be in real life until u experience them. I asked for a sample of beef and they said they don't have any. When I said it says carne asada in the menu they said "oh" and gave me a sample. I'm so glad I asked because it tasted like a beef jerky with no seasoning.

I will laugh at you if you come here and support these stoners.
