We always come here to get the famous cucaracha shrimp and it has been always great but today the shrimp it was totally over cooked and we asked our waitress so respectfully and she took our plates to the kitchen with no problem; 15 min later she came with the exact same plates saying they didn't have more shrimp to make another plate for us and replace the over cooked ones! And the waitress said that they don't have anymore shrimps,I didn't bolive, they just put more dressing and that's it.and 10 min after I saw that same plate with shrimps for a different table,  After that the waitress didn't come to check on us for the rest of our staying she just brought the check and didn't say anything else. Poor servece
