THE WORST MEXICAN FOOD I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. I don't eat beef and I ordered a chicken burrito, when I confront the lady she says "oh I heard carne asada" and stares at me as if my mind is going to change. Then, I tell her "no, I ordered chicken" & she says "oh, well it's already made take it". WHAT THE HELL. Eventually got another burrito and it was chicken but it was the most disgusting burrito I've ever had and I've had frozen burritos that are on an exquisite level compared to this place. DONT DO IT. DONT. YOU. DO. IT.
