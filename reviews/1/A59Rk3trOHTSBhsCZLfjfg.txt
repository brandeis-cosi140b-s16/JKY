If I could give this place minus 5 stars it would be appropriate. Nearly $13 for a burrito and a coke. The burrito was mostly an extra large flour tortilla with nothing in it but some veggie and about 2 ounces of meat.....literally, I'm not exaggerating. An extra large $8.50 burrito should fill up a grown man but this may possibly fill up an 8 year old girl. If  you like being ripped off and taken advantage of go here!
