Anyone who knows me, knows the depth of my affection for Chipotle. So it pains me to say that this Chipotle location would turn any believer away.

I went in for a late lunch on a Saturday at the end of Feb and I immediately noticed that they were severely understaffed. As the line moved up to my position, I began to hear the employee say they were running out of chicken (and some other meat). When it was my turn, I had taken the last portion of chicken and the next person was told that the next batch of chicken WAS STILL COOKING and there would be at least a 10-20 minute wait.

As for the rest of the toppings, they all seemed to be running low and it was all very messy. I could only see two girls in the back and they were in no rush to re-fill anything nor clean up. 

It didn't appear to me that this location was run by anyone in management. If so, they all clearly have given up and not trying to make any improvements. I will not be going back to this location until there's a massive revamp in operation and management.
