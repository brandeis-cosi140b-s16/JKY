I just went through the drive they and got the steak platter with eggs rice and beans.   Within 10 minutes my stomach is upset and I got diarrhea. I called them and they tell me it's all fresh and it must be my system. I only ate some steak egg and beans!  He says he cannot help me to talk to his manager Victor tomorrow or the next day. BAD food. BAD service. They didn't offer me a receipt either so I can even prove it.  Give them less than 0 stars.
