My husband and I tried Nando's based on a recommendation from a friend. We arrived and there was no hostess to greet us. We just stood there looking around trying to make eye contact with anyone who worked there. After 5 minutes, the hostess appears and seats us. No apologies, just seats us. She tossed the menus on the top of the plates. Now we all know how disease-laden all restaurant menus are. That move totally freaked me out. Needless to say, we didn't eat off those plates. 

The waiter comes and takes our order. He was polite and friendly. We get a tiny bowl filled with a massive amount of chips dropped on our table with the worst fake salsa/hot sauce in the world. I say fake because there is nothing in this concoction that resembles salsa. Bland, bland, bland. Our meals arrive and I will admit their rice was delicious. I had the #3 (chicken taco, cheese enchilada, rice & beans). The cheese enchilada had so much cheese that I could feel my arteries harden with every bite. I like cheese - a lot of cheese - but this was overkill. The enchilada sauce was O K. No zing to it. The chicken taco was extremely average - bland. My husband had the pork chops. They were thick with bone-in. One of them was drastically under cooked. My husband commented on the total lack of flavor. He was surprised there was no spice - just bland. 

Now I was born & raised in AZ and I am 1/2 Hispanic. So perhaps my Mexican food grading scale is higher then most people's. I expect flavor and a little kick to all Mexican food. This place is BLAND. We will never go back. Notice to all Mexican restaurants - Mexican food SHOULD have flavor and spice with an option to make it fire hot. As for the friend that suggested Nando's - we are re-thinking the friendship!!!  :o)
