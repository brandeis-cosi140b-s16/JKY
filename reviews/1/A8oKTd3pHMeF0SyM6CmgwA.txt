This is part of a local chain, this location is the missing-link in the chain.  This location is in an older part of Phoenix not a location for the tourist.  
I can only compare this place to my high school cafeteria during "Mexican" food day.  The place is as cozy as a cafeteria, the servers must have been trained by the "lunch ladies", the noise from the children is only outdone by the screaming parents and the food is a step below Taco Bell.  If you are looking for Mexican food head back to high school.  In a city full of Mexican restaurants you can find a better place by throwing a dart at the map.
