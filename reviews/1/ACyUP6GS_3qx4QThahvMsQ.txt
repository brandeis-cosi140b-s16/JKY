Negativo stars for this dump. We waited so long for our server to come back to the table that noone could even remember which server was ours. Half the table received their drinks AND FINISHED THEM  before the rest of us ordered. It was a Monday with plenty of open tables so no busy excuses apply.

Oh yeah also. My wife and I shared a knife and fork. Gave up trying to get another roll set
