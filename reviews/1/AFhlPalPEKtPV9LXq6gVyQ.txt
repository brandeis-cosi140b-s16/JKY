the restaurant was nearly empty at lunch time 12:30. this shouldve told me something, even though when i got there i had to go to the back of the rest. for someone to help me. i finally sat down, and ordered one taco, one chile relleno and one enchilada. let me tell you the girl brought the plate and it was so hot i think the plate had either been placed in the microwave or in the oven. the taco and the chile were deep fried and both were dripping with so much oil it was disgusting all i could taste was oil. the enchilada was really salty and the lettuce was basically a spoon full. the presentation of the plate was horrendous there was so much enchilada sauce on the plate it got into the chile relleno and the taco. the salsa i got with the chips was watery and it seemed to me it was not fresh at all, seemed more like canned. i have had many great foods at low eateries..this place charged me 15.00 for this simple plate. it was such an outrage i did not finish it nor gave a tip. i will never return nor will i recommend. this place is a disgrace to mexican food, especially labeled "home made" unless "home made" is code for crappy. taco bell cooks better.
