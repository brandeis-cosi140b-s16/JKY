Very disappointed.  The first time I went here, the food was good.  This time the food was adequate, too.  We had been shopping in the area, and decided to dine here again.  My problem was the service was dreadful - slow and inattentive!  And when I mentioned it to the manager, he was snotty to me!!  Really bad attitude!!   Defensive and angry. Their entire staff is way too young to realize the importance of good client relations.  We'll not go here again.  These chains need to hire personnel who are trained - not angry youngsters who don't care!!
