I had to join Yelp just so that I could write this review. It's important to me to warn the people about Filibertos just West of Dobson on Southern. I drove through yesterday and asked about the special. It was two beef tacos with a drink for $2.99. Who could resist? I thought they must be small tacos so I also tacked on a carne asada taco. Oh, my tummy protests even now. 
I consumed the food items at 3:30pm and at 6pm began to feel really uncomfortable. I had to take a walk. Within four hours, I was retching and squirting from both ends at the same time. 
Food poisoning? 
I say YES. Drive thru with extreme caution. 

Note: I've eaten at Filiberto's on Broadway by Hardy many times and have never gotten sick... maybe a little discomfort but never the double projectile.
