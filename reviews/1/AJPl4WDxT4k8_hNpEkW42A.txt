It's a shame when the best thing I can say is it was clean and well lighted. The reviewer that said "mediocre" was, in my experience, more than kind. While I'd love to find good Mexican food in the area, I can't even call this good Americanized Mexican. It's just plain bad. Thinking I might have been mistaken the first time...every place has a bad day...I went back.  The food was just as bad, but time the service was I inattentive as well.
