I've been sitting here for quite some time now. I've eaten a meal of chips and salsa. I've had two drinks. Some of us have had three. Still no food. It is not busy. I really don't understand what is taking so long. We don't have steaks. While I've had a full drink the entire time I still have no food and am ready to leave. I still not return. I'd hate to dine here on a busy night
