Food has gone downhill from 2 years ago. Servers are kids...not trained well.  The steak in the tacos was chopped real small, dry and overcooked...not fresh.  Chips were cold.  Just not what this restaurant used to be.  And iced tea is now $2.75, which is sad, especially when the server doesn't come fill it up or add ice.
