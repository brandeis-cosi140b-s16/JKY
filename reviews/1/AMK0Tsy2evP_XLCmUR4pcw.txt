Waited a little over an hour for a table for 5!!!!   Watched over 22 people get seated before us!!!  All because the stupid hostesses could not figure out that if you have a table for 4 open, wait for the next table to be open so you can push the tables together to accommodate!!!  No the ignorant asses just kept seating other people!!!  I have never been treated so poorly by an eating establishment!!!!  Bad, sloppy and poor customer service!!!  I voiced my distaste and asked the others in my party to go somewhere else. The 2 hostesses overheard me so I have a strong feeling that the wait was done out of spite!!!  They told us our table was empty but we would have to wait for it to be cleaned. Another 20 minute wait on top of the 45 minute wait we had already endured!!!  We had to wait 20 minutes because the bus boy was too busy flirting with a waitress and the other bus boy is just surly and lazy!!!  My sisters and I frequent this restaurant often but I won't be returning any time soon. And I will probably never go back on a Friday!!!  Hey Cabo, your food is good, but it isn't that good!!!!!
