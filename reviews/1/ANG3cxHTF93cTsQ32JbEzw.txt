A group of us ate here last night, and sad to say no one enjoyed any of the food. As a group we ordered the 

-'Spicy' red onion rings, which were not spicy at all, and instead overpriced, over crispy, over sized onion rings.
..
-Panuchos, which as the menu describes it  are verde masa stuffed with mexican cheeses, plantain, cilantro & caramelized onions, on borracho black beans with crema, lettuce, pico de gallo: In reality, a crunch corn tortilla folded like an empanada with sppon fulls of black beans topped with lettuce. We didn't taste any plantains, cilantros or caramelized onions 

- Grilled chicken burrito, which literally had 5 tiny pieces of grilled chicken meat and ladles and ladles of black beans.

- Grilled veggie burrito, with what seemed like their entire pot of black beans in one burrito. There was no sign of the pico, guac and onion that were supposed to be in. 

If you want to leave the restaurant bloated and feeling gross since at every bite you've literally ate a spoon full of black beans then this is the place for you. Totally felt like a waste of money and all that I paid for was a plate full of black beans. 

Unfortunate since the ambience of this place is nice, and the menu items actually sound delicious...but don't be fooled.
