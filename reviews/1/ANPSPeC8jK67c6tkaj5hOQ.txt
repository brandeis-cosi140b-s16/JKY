We went here based on Yelp reviews...bad decision. The cashier was rude, food was bland, and found hair in TWO  of the four dishes we had ordered. 

Cost was $40 for two cheese enchiladas, two potato and egg burritos, one carne asada burrito, one side of beans, chips and four small sodas.

 When we ordered, we didn't realize they didn't provide chips- no biggie, just went back up to the register and ordered some. Then, when I asked for salsa, the cashier looks at me funny and says I have to order that separate from the chips. Really? After her attitude with the chip "situation", we didn't bother mentioning the hair in the food. 

Bottom line- don't waste your time or money here.
