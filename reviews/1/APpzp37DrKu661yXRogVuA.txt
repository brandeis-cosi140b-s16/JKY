I realize i shouldn't expect much from an airport bar but I was craving a margarita.  The most attention I received from the bartender, although I was waving my hands and calling out for my server, was the heavy handed encouragement to order the "top-shelf" Margarita.   I stupidly fell for it, only later to realize, my plane ticket was comparable in price. I finally ordered my food from a different bartender and then had the long wait for my bill... Good thing i wasn't trying to catch a plane.  ahh wait...
