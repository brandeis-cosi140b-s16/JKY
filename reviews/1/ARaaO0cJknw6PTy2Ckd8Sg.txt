I ordered the taco enchilada combo.  The taco was soggy from the tasteless enchilada sauce.  The enchilada was rubbery and salty, but no other flavor.  The rice was truly nothing special and the beans were watery and gritty.  I had heard that this place was AMAZING, and it really did not live up to the hype.  I went to the Mohave location and I hated it.  Hot and dirty.  I had a stomach ache after I ate the taco and one bite of the other stuff each.  I will not be going back.  It's really not worth going out of your way for a completely mediocre taco.  The homemade tortillas looked okay but I'm not a fan of flour tortillas, so that doesn't mean a lot to me.
