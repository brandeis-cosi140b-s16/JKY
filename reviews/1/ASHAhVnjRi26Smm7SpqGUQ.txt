Que horrible! This was my favorite local Mexican restaurant...until tonight.  My husband and I go there enough to know that they are capable of better. Unfortunately today they did not care about providing even the most fundamental elements of customer service. Our server clearly did not want to be there which was evident by his blatant lack of attentiveness.  After he finally brought us menus, we quickly decided on what to order. Unfortunately, in the amount of time it took our server to return to the table, we could have read the menus front-to-back, two times over. We figured hey maybe the kitchen is very busy at this hour. Then I realized that our server was sitting in a booth rolling silverware. Not just him, three others as well! I've been a server before. I get it. You have to roll silverware, but to do that in lieu of tending to (well-tipping) patrons is a sign of carelessness. What was most annoying was that I made eye contact with them and was ignored. Eventually, I was able to wave down our server and we ordered. I guess he grew tired of us and recruited a coworker to take over. The new server was better. Although he did take my drink and disappear without refilling it for a while. At least he cracked a smile and showed some sign of life. The worst part of this experience was watching everyone else get service...except us. I'm not likely to return to a restaurant when I'm left feeling unwelcome.
