The worst experience since moving to Arizona. I understand  Friday night's are busy for almost any restaurant. We got sat promptly because we were ok sitting outside on a cool-ish night since inside seemed to be on a significant wait. They had patio heating lamps; which were devoid of the propane tanks. My husband and a gentleman at the next table both asked if they would light them. Never happened. My husband noticed several tanks sitting across the patio, and since our server had not come yet(10 minutes after being seated), he went to get one, installed it and started the heater himself. The other guests on the patio were very grateful to him for the help. 
As we waited for our server, we overheard SEVERAL other tables complaining about the significant wait on their food. By the time we left, a total of 2 tables had left before ordering and one table got their food to go because of the wait. 
My husband ordered the shrimp tacos on recommendation of our server, and I got the chile verde. Server asked if I wanted corn or flour tortillas. I chose corn. Both our kids got the kids cheese enchilada. At least 50 minutes later... My chile verde looked like slop. Seriously, slop. And tasted like it. So bland. The pork was cut into such small cubes, it was obvious it was well overdone(and it was). And I never got my tortillas. The husband's shrimp was so severely overcooked, and overly sweet. And let's be honest, 2 tacos for $14? That were terrible?! My pork was $14 as well. Kids enchiladas were just as bland as the rest. So terribly disappointing. Took forever to get a refill on drinks, also. Salsas were not great, especially the over-sweet green salsa. 
We honestly felt like we were robbed when we left. $61 tab for bad service and terrible food. Never, ever again. We should've made the 25 minute drive to the restaurant we wanted instead of staying closer to home. Don't do it, unless you have no taste buds and like disappointment. Taco Bell would've been better.
