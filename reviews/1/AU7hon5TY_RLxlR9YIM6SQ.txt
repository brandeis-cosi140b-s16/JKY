Definitely recommend this place if you're bored when you get off work on Taco Tuesday and hit the dinner rush hour. Its refreshing to sit and wait 30 minutes for your order and afterwards wondering if the reason I feel like vomiting and having explosive diarrhea is either a gift from god pushing your Faith or possible food poisoning. I don't know if I'm just lucky enough to be the only person to feel this way especially on God's day (Taco Tuesday) or if they were in a big rush during dinner rush hour. Won't be going back again.
