Mediocre food at best. They nickel & dime you. Ordered food for take out for my family of 4 & they wouldn't give me the included drink with the kids meal because my child was not present, really?! I ordered a side of chips & had to pay separately for salsa. I will never return to this place & will not recommend it for the simple fact that not including the kids drink as advertised, because the child is not present is pretty tacky & cheap. The mall is surrounded by residential areas & I'm sure I'm not the only mother bringing home dinner to the family after shopping. Food is also sub par & customer service was lacking. 

There is a nearby Moe's & Chipotle which offers tastier food, better service & much better value for your money.
