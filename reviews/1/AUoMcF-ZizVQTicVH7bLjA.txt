Usually I would give this place 5 stars but today I'm giving 1 star . Here is my reasoning, it only takes one time for someone to dislike your restaurant  . You change one thing and you get one bad review and that one bad review can ruin your whole business .
I'm sorry but you guys changed one thing and I'll never be back I don't care how hungry  I am .
I ordered a Carne asada burrito like I always do and today it had tomatoes  I've never had a Carne asada burrito with tomatoes in it . This one ingredient ruined my whole expiernce and for that I have to part ways with you . Now if you tell your cook he messed up and to cook it the regular  way then Maybe I'll be back .
