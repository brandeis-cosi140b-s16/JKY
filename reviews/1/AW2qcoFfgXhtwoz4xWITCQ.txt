Ehh, I always pass this place & was never tempted to try. So me & hubby go to a Comedy Show at the V theater with some friends, & we were starving after. We walked around 10- almost 11pm & one of our friends pointed this place out. I asked if we can keep walking to find a better place but we were too famished we just had to stop. Very depressing it had to be this place. If you're hungry & walk by, keep going. There are better places to eat and drink in this desert. Drinks were decent, service was terrible, food was worse. We all took a few bites & left the food at the table. For the price you pay, this place needs to be ashamed. Don't even think about it, just skip this dump!!!
