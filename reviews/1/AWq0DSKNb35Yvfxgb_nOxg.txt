I was very disappointed in the food here, especially for what I paid for it. I ordered the stuffed pepper (for lack of better term) that was supposed to have meat, rice, cheese along with a few other things. And all I got was a pepper stuffed with rice and a few scraps of meat. I was hoping they would redeem themselves with dessert. They said all their deserts fed two easily, and for 9 bucks I would hope so. So we ordered the fried icecream. And got a small scoop of fried icecream drowning in whipped cream. So basically paid $9 for whipped cream. Very disappointed and never going back or recommending this place to anyone ever.
