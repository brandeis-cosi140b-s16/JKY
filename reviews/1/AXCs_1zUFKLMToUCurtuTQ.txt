Horrible... I am still been dealing with a gastrointestinal nightmare for 2 days after eating at this place.  The food quality is mediocre at best.  I tried the Chorizo Torta and it was flavorless.  The fish tacos were still slightly greasy and also lacked flavor.  I think I would rather eat a can of Alpo than at this place again.  There are much better choices for Mexican in the area.  Heck even Taco Bell is better.  I hope this place close up as soon as it opened and something more respectable opens in its place.

Update:  Man reported on ground in agonizing pain after ingesting just one bite!  Do your intestines a favor and go savor the Mexican flavor some place else!
