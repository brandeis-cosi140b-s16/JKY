I am giving this restaurant one star tonight for one reason, and one reason only.  I came here tonight to eat, I got seated, looked over the menu, found what I wanted, and waited.  And waited.  And waited some more.  About five minutes go by, and one of the busers offered water, chips, and salsa while we waited for our server.  Another five to six minutes go by.  Nothing.  All the other servers looked over and made eye-contact, but not one of them bothered to come to the table.  By this time, about fifteen minutes pass.  I've had enough.  I could understand if someone came to the table and explained that the server was finishing up doing something, in the bathroom, getting fucked by the cook, whatever, but nothing.  I got up to leave and told the manager that I had been sitting at my table with my fianc√© for over ten minutes, and the only person who greeted us was a buser.  She apologized, and offered to be our server for the night and comp our meal, but I did not accept the offer.

I have been here several times, and this is the first time I have EVER experienced such horrible service at this restaurant.  Granted, all my previous experiences were good because I was sitting in the bar section....apparently, they have their act together over on the bar side.  Now I know.  I hope the person who was assigned at the table I was at gets fired, or, at least, reprimanded in some way that causes him/her to lose more of his/her tips for the evening.  

It'll be awhile before I come back to this location again.  I'm the type of person that will give a restaurant three strikes before I will not go to them again.  Serranos at Rural, this is strike one.  You have two left.
