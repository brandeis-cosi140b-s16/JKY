My husband and I called before to verify their kids eat free every day offer and the person on the phone said they still offer this.  When we got the bill we had to have the waitress reprint the bill less our two kids free meals.  She said thy no longer are doing this or advertising this but still offer it to people who have known about it during previous trips there.  We won't be going back though, not because of the kids eat free confusion but because the fish tacos I had were over battered and greasy. The oil was not hot enough when the fish was fried so the batter was heavy with oil and tasted old.  The corn tortillas were thin and didn't fry up soft like "street style" are supposed to be. Just heated up warm and fresh would have been much better. My husband was not impressed with his steak tacos. No fresh limes came with them either. I guess we could have asked for them but we didn't bother.  As for the "Good For Kids:  Yes" rating I would have to say not really.  This place seemed more like a "pub" than a "grill." - reminded me of somewhere I got two for one Coronas and a free shot of tequila in Tijuana when I was in my twenties!!!
