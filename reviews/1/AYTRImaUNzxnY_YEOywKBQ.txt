I've been to Salted Lime on about 6 different occasions.  I have always been seated promptly and the service is very attentive.  I usually go early evening.  Although the prices are decent, the food is always inconsistent.  I would order the combination plate and one time it would be fresh and moist tasting.  The rice would be exceptional.  The next visit I would order the same combo and it would taste old and dried out.  The rice would be hard to chew.  As stated by other reviewers the chips and salsa are always consistently good.  The other reasons for poor review include lack of any unique dishes that can't be found at a chain restaurant.
