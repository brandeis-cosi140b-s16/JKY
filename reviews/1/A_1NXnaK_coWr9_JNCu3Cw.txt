They should call this place Yuppies Cove. The eating area is dark and unwelcoming, both times I went the woman behind the counter was extremely unfriendly,  the prices are way to high even for Mill and to top it off, the food sucks. Also, no one working there seemed to care about the fly that was buzzing around  the open food containers, helping himself to a free lunch. No one except me.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not a snob, I eat at crusty looking establishments and as long as the food is good and the place appears to be marginally clean I am a happy camper! But  the food doesn't lie. 

If you want fake mexican, you would be better off going to a chain like Chipotle. At least they have vegetarian options.

ALSO, the2nd and last time I went I witnessed a man who works there snatch a cup of beer out of another persons hand and in the process dump said cup all over another patron. My vote is stay away.
