Went to this place and ordered 1 carne asada burrito!  That is all just 1 single burrito.  I literally waited 25 min after I ordered and paid for my burrito.  I finally just decided to leave burritoless!  For all I know they may still be back there birthing and raising the cow that in a year or two would grow into a nice meaty cow, they would eventually butcher and then make my burrito.  But I like most people don't have two years or let alone 25 minutes to wait for a carne asada burrito!  Incase you are reading this going oh they must have been busy!  I swear to god three other people in this place 1 of which just received his food, 5 min later another guy got his to go.  As for the other lady in front of me, who knows how long she had been there waiting.  So if you have an hour or so you want to waste on some "fast Mexican food" then by all means hit this place up.  If not avoid it at all costs if your time means anything at all to you!
