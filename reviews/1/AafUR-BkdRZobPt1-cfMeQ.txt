The sign said open, and the doors were open. When we walked in, 2 managers and the hostess were standing talking to each other. The hostess said "we don't open until 4" (it's 3:15) and I said "well your sign said open" and she said "yes we are open for business but we don't serve until 4". So we left. And because the managers had nothing to say, I won't go back. Too bad they aren't at the palazzo anymore because they seemed to have lost class as well as customers.
