rude employees! I got there to pick up my online order. I was expecting it to be done by the time I got there (15 minute drive from my house.) NOPE, I waited another 10 minutes cause they still had to make it. I sat right in front of the register until it was done & they knew. they just put my bag to the side and didn't tell me. A couple girls were just taking their time and laughing and playing around. I got up and asked if my food was ready, and they look at me like they didn't know what I was talking about and they were like "oh yeah, it's done." and just pushed the bag near me. they also messed up my order too.
