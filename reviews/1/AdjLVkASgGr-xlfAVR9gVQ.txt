Absolutely disgusting. Came here 15 mins out of my way for a breakfast burrito and a breakfast plate for my boyfriend and I. Get home and his burrito isn't in the bag. I call up and ask what happened and the girl straight up says' oh yeah I forgot to put it in the bag...etc what do you want to do about it?' 
I knew coming here was a mistake in the first place and I don't know why I agreed to it. The first time I ordered from this place a year ago, I ordered a carnitas burrito. I got a burrito with half shrimp and half chicken and it was not only the wrong thing, but foul. I swore to never order from here again, and today reminded me why.

Disgusting, flavorless, unidentifiable food and on top of that, horrendous, rude service.  Do NOT waste your money on this garbage.
