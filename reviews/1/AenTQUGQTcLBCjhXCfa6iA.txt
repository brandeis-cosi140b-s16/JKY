Here it goes...I was driving by today and decided I would stop in for some carne asada nachos. I got them to go. When I got home, they really didn't look that great but I was starving so I decided to eat them.. Halfway through I had to stop eating them because they were so greasy and tasted horrible.  Later on in the night I started feeling so sick to my stomach. I will never eat there again.  Very disappointing considering I ate there frequently.  I do not recommend this location to anyone....
