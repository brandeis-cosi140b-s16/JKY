We waited 1 hr and didn't even get seated so we left. Before leaving I spoke to the manager about the situation and he didn't even care if we where leaving . It was 9 of us total in my book that's great for business but he said ok have a nice day . Never will I go back first and last .. If I could I'll give them 0 stars
