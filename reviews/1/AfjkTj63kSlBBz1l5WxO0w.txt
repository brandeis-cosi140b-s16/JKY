My husband and I really enjoy this restaurant. Today was a totally different story. We went for lunch and our server Yaeir was not the best. The only time we saw him was when he took our order and when he gave us our check. My husband had to ask for refills on his water more than once (which someone else filled).  He never asked if we needed anything else, or how our food was. IF we return to this  restaurant, we hope that we get better service than what we received from this server. It was a slow time of the day, there was no excuses for this.
