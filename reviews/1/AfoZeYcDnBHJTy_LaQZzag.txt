I don't know where all these good reviews are coming from. Must be drunk people that go in the middle of the night.

First off, they charged $8 for a carne asada burrito with just beans and meat (which tasted like dog food). I couldn't even eat it.

Second, I ordered al pastor tacos because that it what everyone raves about on the reviews. Mediocre at best. Also, the woman who took our order was incredibly rude. She called "next" so we stepped up to order. Then she proceeded to organize her cash register while we stood there for a good while. I understand that you may need a minute but at least look up and acknowledge us. I don't even care if its in spanish! I asked for flour tortillas and she told me it would be an additional $2 PER taco. Then all of a sudden she changed it to $2.15 out of nowhere. I'm sorry but $2.15 for a freakin flour tortilla on a street taco?! I'm pretty sure she just made that price up to discourage me from ordering it (which worked). 

I got the orange colored hot sauce thinking it would be the hottest and put it on my tacos. Literally had to drench them in it to get any sort of flavor. It wasn't even hot. I was also surprised at how bland the meat was. It looks so delicious but definitely does not deliver. 

All in all, I am very disappointed with the food as well as the rude service. And yes, I understand that this is a street vendor but I was hoping for more.
