Was a loyal customer for a year.  Under new ownership, it's now called Torres Mexican Food and it is awful.  The last 7 orders have been raw (taco shells, tostada shells, etc.). Food isn't cooked after a 10- to 15-minute wait : /  The last order I informed them of this problem and asked them to cook the food (which is a new low in my dining experience).  It came back completely raw.  When I showed it to the PM cashier, she became argumentative and said "they didn't fully cook it because the items on the menu are no longer offered." Seriously???  After I've paid for the order??? This was not a language-barrier issue.  Bad food, worse service.  They just lost a regular customer.
