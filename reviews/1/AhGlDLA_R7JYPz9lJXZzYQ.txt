I should've read review s before spending my $$ here. I order a mangonead and strawberry and cream. Mangoneada flavorless, bland had no taste very very disappointed. Pictures do look good but thats it. Fresa w/ cream they mix bad strawberry with good ones they did not bother to cut they just threw them in a cup with lechera. If I new I was getting this I would of done this at home but nicely cut with more cream. Will not come back to this place.
