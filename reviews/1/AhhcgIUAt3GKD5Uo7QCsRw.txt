Adios!  Maybe dinner service has the true professionals at work versus the lunch service we received today.  It was a 2  hour ordeal that was painful...orders were wrong, empty glasses not cleared from the table (and there were quite a few over two hours...), clueless wait staff and  when we left, other tables of two that came in 45 minutes after we did still had not been served.  Fortunately the chips are good but if there are 5 special salsas, would have been nice to have them offered as the standard offering seemed a pur√©e of Pace picante with the flavor drained. The "customized grill stations" were not used.  Had visions  of one guy irunning around the back of the kitchen microwaving things although if that were the case then the food would have at least been lukewarm...whe we finally got it. It's mediocre at best.  The rice has no flavor , the salsa no spice.  I didn't think there was such a thing as bad Mexican food but this is a definite Miss.  The only reason to go is to see if you can get a deal on one of the grills or the tile art when they close in 2 months.
