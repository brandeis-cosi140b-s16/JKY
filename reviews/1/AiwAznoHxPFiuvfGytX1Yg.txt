I'm going to go ahead and put it out there that I didn't even venture into the actual restaurant portion of this establishment, but rather camped out in the bar for happy hour.   So, consider this a happy hour/appetizer review, if you like.

They tried really, really hard to make this place feel festive, but succeeded only in making it look like a junkyard full of angry fruit salad.  If you're unfamiliar with that term, head on over to Urban Dictionary.  Go on.  I'll wait.

Are we all together again?  Good.  Let us proceed.  This place sucks.  Not even the free all-you-can-eat appetizers could keep me in here, and I am one cheap bastard.  The only thing they had going for them was the $2 Dos Equis during happy hour. 

The appetizer selection was pretty shakey.  There were these things that I think were supposed to be beef enchiladas, a potato concoction, and chips and salsa.  The incognito enchiladas were... stretchy.. and bland.. and the potato thing was about the same, sans the stretchiness.  And how do you fuck up chips?  Seriously?

To top it off, the bartender was slow as shit.

I'll say one.. okay, two good things.  The happy hour is a good deal if you can stomach the food.  They also have a pretty neat lobster claw game where you can "win" a live lobster.  Might be worth going in there just to check it out.
