This place would be out of business if it were not located next to 3 hotels and the convention center. It is not completely horrible, but I would recommend walking a few blocks up to Arizona Center complex where they have 3 or 4 different choices. If you are staying at the hotels and need some quick take out, sure this place will work (across the street). But if you are on vacation and planning a sit down dinner, don't waste one of your few vaca nights here.
