I went around 9:30 they close at 10 pm . That makes it a decent time for them to make my food correct . I got 2 orders of 3 tacos . The fish was just a little piece . Most of it was burned and I had asked for corn crispy tortilla . They gived  me flour tortilla on all 3 , no sour cream , no lime , no ingredients that I asked for .  I live 5 minutes away from there . My food was completely cold. To me it was like they were in a hurry to get out of there and just gived me crap. I pay money for my food and I got trash .  I had one bite and I just had to trow it away . 
I usually check my food  before I live , this time I didn't because I trust  them . Last time!!!
Definitely  I won't ever go back to this location.  
I wanted to call but no point on driving back almost when they gonna close and get same crap 
No thank you!  So disappointed on this place.
