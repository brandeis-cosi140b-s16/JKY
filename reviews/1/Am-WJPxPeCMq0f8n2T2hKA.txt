All I can say about this place is that it is a classic tourist trap.  They know that the snowbirds will flock in no matter how horrible the food is.

I am a local who has avoided this place until today when I finally succumbed to a friend's insistance that I try it.  I ordered the enchalada's.  What  a disgusting mess was delivered to my table.  The enchalada's were hard as logs and I could barely cut them with a knife. The taste was not much better.  It was quite apparent that this product was frozen and then microwaved prior to serving.  Despite the fact that I was quite hungry, barely ate any of my lunch.

Again, this is a tourist trap and clearly they care little about the quality of the food.  It's a nice scenic area, but do you yourself a favor an eat before you drive up there.  This food is horrid.
