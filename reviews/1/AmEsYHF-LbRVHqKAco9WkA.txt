Because of all the previous positive posts, I decided to check it out. Unfortunately all the 4 stars reviews for this business are mis leading or must be reviews from the employees. The food was PINCHE HORRIBLE!!! .. ordered 2 carne asadas burritos with a small horchata and trust me what I'm going to state.... I got a bean burrito with little meat and no flavor.. not to say a paid close to $30 for this meal.. I'm a person who likes to see business do well for the benefit of our beautiful city but it's sad to say that I will never recommend this place to anyone!!!
