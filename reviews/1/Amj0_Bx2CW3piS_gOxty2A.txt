If you have ever read any of my reviews you know that my wife and I always support local eateries.  We have eaten here before, although it has been a while, and have always had good service and great food.  This experience was intolerable, we didn't even eat here, we turned around and walked out.
When we walked in the first thing we noticed was the girl behind the counter just standing there watching TV.  There were two tables that still had dirty dishes on them, mind you there are only about 8 tables or so in this place.  The chairs were ALL in disarray and a few more of the tables looked as though the dishes were removed but the tables were not wiped off.  The next thing was a pungent stench of sewage.  I grabbed one of the chairs to move it and the chair was sticky....EWWW.  Obviously not going back.  UGH!
