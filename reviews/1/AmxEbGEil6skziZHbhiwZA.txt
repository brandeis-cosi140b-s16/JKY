I am only giving -THIS- location a 1 star because of their horrible early hours!! They close like at 7 pm during the week, & they already closed at 3 pm on Sunday! ...I was pissed! The new Chipotle a block away at City scape is open til 10 pm daily! ...So there! What is it with everything closing sooo damn early in Phoenix! This is such an early city! Some eating places even close at 2:30 pm, like The Good Egg & First Watch... They wouldn't DARE close that early in LA because they would lose a lot of profit!  (...I am from LA).
