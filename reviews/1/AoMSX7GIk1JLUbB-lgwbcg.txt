Not happy at all with our experience. My office had a training video to watch today so the boss payed for lunch. We ordered online to go pick up and bring back to the office. You would think that ordering online the order would be accurate with no mistakes.....completely not true. Our email receipt clearly shows ready today at 12:10 pm for pick up and the order is exactly what everyone wanted. When we arrived the food was not ready and the person behind the counter argued with us that she said her ticket said 4:10 pm. So we waited a long time for them to make it while we waited. When we got back to the office three of the four orders were not correct. Completely wrong item on two of them and the wrong kind of rice on the other. When the office manager called back to tell them that they messed up the order and that things were not ready on time like they were supposed to be the person she spoke to was really rude. After stating her complaint the employee's response was " well what do you want me to do, maybe go to Chipotle next time, I have customers waiting." SERIOUSLY!! Very rude, very inept. You would think that ordering online would remove a lot of error but it multiplied here. We printed out our emailed confirmation and receipt to see if we were wrong, but everything on there was completely correct so the problem was 100% on their end.  We will not be returning.
