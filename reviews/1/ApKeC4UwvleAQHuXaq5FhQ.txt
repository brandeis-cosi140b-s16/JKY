This was the worst experience EVER!! It is never a good start when on the Menu it is written "If you order it you eat it"
To start those of us that drank soda had to send our drinks back more than once since they pour them out of 2 liters and it is flat and watered down. 
Our waiter seemed clueless and a little like a deer in headlights when ever we asked about any menu item. For and example we asked what the size difference was for the large and small guacamole his answer was "Well you know the small is well a small bowl and the Large is like a large bowl" 

When ordering a few in the group let him know that they did not like spicy food and asked what the best choice was and he directed them to the enchiladas with Red Chili Sauce. Four out of the seven of us ordered that and when the food was served it was so spicy they could not eat and and told the waiter and his response was "do you want me to box it up for you" No they were still hungry. 

When we asked to see the manager the response was nobody new where he was and didn't know when he would be back. 

He finally showed up 15 min later and would not exchange the food or comp for the uneaten meals and said that we should have seen the note on the menu that states "If you order it you eat it" and he does not know why the waiter would have told them the red chili enchilada's where not spicy because they were VERY spicy. 

The service is awful and the food is Spicy and any restaurant that does not even try to make a customer happy is not worth the trip. 

Way over priced and they treat you like crap!!
