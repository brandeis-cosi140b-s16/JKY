This place is gross. Hole in the wall place but not good. The carne was not good , beans were like soup and so was the guacamole.. Rice was also not good either. I don't even know how this place has good reviews. Also it smelled nasty in the part when you sit down and eat your food. Seems good for construction workers who are really hungry because that's all there was in there!
