If I could give this place negative stars I would. Awful service, awful drinks, awful prices. We were lured in by the pretty outside view and the buy one get one free coupons we were given for margaritas (spoiler alert they just double the price of the drink and add waaay too little alcohol). Our server came over once after mouthing obscenities to himself when he saw our table sit down. It was pretty deserted except for a group of people wearing obscene balloon animal hats (blow jobs, penises, scissoring - who knew balloon art could be used as a force of evil!). 

I don't have one good thing to say about this place. UGH!
