This restaurant is close to my home so it is convenient. I've been coming here for years and service has been up and down but over the last few months the consistent direction has been down. We visited on a Thursday evening (about 5:30) and were seated promptly. Chips and salsa arrived quickly and were very tasty. Both the salsa and the bean dip were spicier than usual (I am a wimp with spicy foods-most people would probably say the spice level is average). After ten minutes passed with no server approaching, I began to worry. When the server arrived, after five minutes later, we ordered drinks and food. I mentioned that I was very thirsty as we had been eating (the now empty chips and salsa). At this point the server left but did not return with our drinks or any waters. We could see her in the restaurant but she would not make eye contact. The busser never refilled the chips and salsa-it was as if we were invisible. Finally, when she was serving the table next to us, I flagged our server down and asked if we could please get our drinks. She said that they were out of glasses! I asked if I could have a drink in a to-go cup or anything else as at this point I was very uncomfortable from the spicy salsa-she laughed and left. A full 30 minutes after we were seated she returned with our drinks! No apology for the wait, no mention of any issues. I asked her if the restaurant was having a problem this evening and she replied that they ran out of rice and cheese. How does a Mexican restaurant run out of rice and cheese??? And what does that have to do with clean cups? The food, when it finally arrived, was decent. Not spectacular but flavorful and well-prepared. Service at this restaurant has been sporadic over the years but after watching several other groups give up and leave their tables before their food arrived we wish we had done the same.  The real kicker came when we got our check with the sodas still on the bill! Sadly, we will not be returning.
