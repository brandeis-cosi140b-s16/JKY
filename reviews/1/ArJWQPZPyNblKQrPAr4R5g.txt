First off I have to start by saying, I LOVE TACO BELL.  I have grown up eating it and go there often.  

I went to this particular Taco Bell the other day after shopping at Kohl's.  This was my third time to this location, and once again I was not impressed.  This is the third time in a row that they have messed up my order.  This was the worst.

I am vegetarian, so I typically order my Mexican pizza with rice instead of beef.  I do not have problems at any other location, so I figured I would order it on this visit.  

Was charged an extra .60 for the "rice", got my stuff, and headed home.  I was starving by this point due to working all day.  I ate my pintos and beans, and proceeded to dig in to my pizza.  I ate one of the little triangles, and realized that something didn't taste right.  I looked closer only to discover there was rice ON TOP OF the beef!! I almost threw up my dinner on the spot!

Fuming, I immediately grabbed my receipt and called the store.  I asked the lady on the phone (who doesn't speak English) for the manager.  After trying to explain three times who I was asking for, she put me on hold.  

Around five minutes later, a lady got on the phone.  She didn't speak English either, and had nothing to say after I explained my situation.  I told her she needs to talk with her employees about paying attention to order's because some of us don't eat meat.  I also got into the disgusting details about what happens when we do eat it.

Needless to say, nothing was done, and I'm sure my complaint fell on deaf ears, but I at lest got to voice my concerns.  I will not be returning to this location no matter how hungry I am.
