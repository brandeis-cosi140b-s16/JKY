I am typically a pretty understanding customer and realize that with anything mistakes on orders can happen.  Last night I placed a take out order and ordered the super nachos and only wanted beans cheese and sour cream.  I have gotten this order once a week for the last month and never and I do mean never have they ever put green chillis in the cheese.  

After getting home last night when I found that the order had the chillis I asked them to correct it.  The cashier was accomadating but the owner was very rude to my wife and I and lied to ou faces saying that is what they always do.  I informed him of how often we come to his business and he still did not show any concern for us. I WILL NOT BE RETURNING their and they lost a customer for life.
