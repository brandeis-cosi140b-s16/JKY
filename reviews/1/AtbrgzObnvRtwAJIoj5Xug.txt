This is going to be a really short review.  Why? Because we didn't even get into the place.

We arrived looking forward to trying out the new place.  I knew it would be overpriced and the food only so-so ahead of time as its a tourist trap restaurant.  We get there, and its a 30 - 45 minute wait.  that was fine as it is to be expected.  We get our buzzer and patiently wait outside in the casino in the designated waiting area.  45 minutes go by and I go up to the hostess to check on our status and am informed that the kitchen was having issues and needed to be partially shut down about 20 minutes ago.  She told me it would be another 30 - 40 minutes.  Guess what we did.  We left.

My issue is simply the poor guest service.  If they are having issues such as this then people in the waiting area need to be informed their wait is going to be twice as long as they were told.  Senor frogs is not worth a 15 minute wait much less a hour and a half no matter what its location.  Won't be going back.
