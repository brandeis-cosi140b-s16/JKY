POOR SERVICE: It took a very long time for the waiter to greet us and get drink orders. We received silverware that was not cleaned. Once we ordered our food the waiter never once came to ask us if we needed anything. We ate out entire meal without any refills of our beverages. When we discussed our concerns with the manager, his only response was sorry.
