Screw this place. Seriously.

If I'm going to TB, I'm 90% of the time doing drive-thru. If I don't have the time to respect my body, I don't have the time to sit on plastic chairs and listen to top 40 garbage, either. Both times I've been to this particular restaurant, I got held up for an excessive amount of time behind a female who so charmed the drive-thru personnel that I had to wait an extra 10 minutes. The first time I had to fight off a horde of angry ASU sophomores who took exception to the trollop who cut in front of us on foot and got service. This time, I decided to share it rather than cause trouble. Take that, class of 2012.
