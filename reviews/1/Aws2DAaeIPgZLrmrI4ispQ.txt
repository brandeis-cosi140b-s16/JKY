If you enjoy social injustice, poor business ethics, being completely disrespected, and ripped off, "La Huas-teca your money and run" is sure to deliver.

I really thought I'd be a regular here after my first experience.  I even tipped the nice lady that served me 40% on my first trip. 

Today changed that:  after the staff member requested that I pay almost $3 more than the same meal that I got on my first trip, and despite the fact that the real value is clearly stated on the menu, he still demanded the extra money.  I gave it to him, figuring that if he wants to take the money and earn his employer a horrible review, so be it.  

After I gave him his stolen money, he didn't even have the courtesy to thank me in any capacity.  I asked for the name of the 5'3'', 145 bugger and he called himself "speedy."  Speedy he is- at trying to make up crap and take your money.  

So, unless I get some kind of written apology from the owner, I am done with this place and suggest going elsewhere.
