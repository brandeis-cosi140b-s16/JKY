Located in the old Embers space in Boca Park, this place offers no reason to return.  $10 for 2 tacos.  Do I need to write more?  Ok.  The woman behind the counter - it is fast food, akin to Chipotle or Cafe Rio - told me the tacos are very large.."worth the price".  Not.  The carnitas taco was flavorful, the fried avocado taco was not.  Neither was large - About the size of a street taco (if you are familiar).  Do yourself a favor and go to Cafe Rio or Chipotle - cheaper and better.  *I was not drinking, so I didn't try the "best margarita in town".  Maybe that's worth coming back for.
