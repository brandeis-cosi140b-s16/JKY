I'm Sorry But I Was Very Disappointed, I ordered flautas & there was barely any meat inside & they were burnt on the ends a quarter on each end. The beans taste like they are from a can & what was suppose to be guacamole was more like green salsa. 
My boyfriend had the pozole & that was good. 
Nephew had the Big Bootey Burrito, he was pleased.
Will I ever come back?? No!! I'd rather go down the street to Mixteca. 
P. S. 
$2.50 For a 32 Oz fountain drink, in a dive place like this?? I was raped!
