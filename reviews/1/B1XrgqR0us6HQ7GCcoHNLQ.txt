We've been coming here since it opened and was such a fan of the carne asada and breakfast burrito but this time our food was cold. They have a real hard time understanding our order over the phone unless you can speak Spanish. Once there they seemed to work on differing orders one at a time so they were so disorganized. We hope this is just an anomaly and am sad to rate them low this time around.
