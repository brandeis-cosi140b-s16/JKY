Seriously the worse food for Mexican food. Food was either too salty or too bland. Order the "Wet Bean/Cheese Burrito" and 12 rolled tacos. Burrito was horrible assembled and the red sauce was way too salty. The tolled tacos we bland and the guacamole was watered down. I know I don't come here for the service cause it sucks. Lady who took my order was rude, horribly representing service. Food was priced OK but they charge extra to use your credit card and if you want refills on your drinks. 
For this type of food place, I would totally recommend to go to Don Tortaco or Tacos el Gordo. Way better price, service, and quality.
