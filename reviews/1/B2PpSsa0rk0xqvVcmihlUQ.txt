the food is good, but the customer service is completely null and void.  this place seems to be trying to go out of business,  i have never been so upset leaving a restaurant ever in my life.  here is what i don't understand that hopefully someone can change, when i take off the expensive items like guacamole, and the pico, and ask to replace them with lettuce and cheese-can you please figure out a way to not make the taco $1.10 more expensive????????  PLEASE!!!!!
