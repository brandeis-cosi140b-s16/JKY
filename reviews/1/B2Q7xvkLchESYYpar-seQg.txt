This place has possibly the worst waitstaff I've encountered. I took my son for his 10th birthday. The waitress literally stood 20 feet away talking to her friends and ignored us until I got up and walked up to her. If you have a can of Rosarita refried beans and a jar of Pace you're already well ahead on quality.
