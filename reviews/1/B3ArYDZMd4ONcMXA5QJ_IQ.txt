I love me some good Mexican food and I have to say Senior Taco is one of my favorites, but this location sucks! The food is way to greasy, the service is POOR and the atmosphere is not welcoming at all! If you want good Senior Taco food, service, and an inviting atmosphere head west to the location off Estrella south of the 10!!! Way better for sure!
