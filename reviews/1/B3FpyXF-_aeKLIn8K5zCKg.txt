This location of Filiberto's was once my FAVORITE local Mexican food joint. My fiance and I go out for Mexican every Friday night, we've even named this tradition "Fili-Friday". 
However, we no longer go to this location, and for good reason. Nothing is even close to as good as it once was. I would even day it's borderline bad. Every recipe has changed from wonderful to pathetic. 
We have taken our Fili-Friday tradition elsewhere and will not return. So sad...
