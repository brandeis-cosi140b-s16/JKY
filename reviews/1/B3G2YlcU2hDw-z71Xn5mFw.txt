Went here last night and ordered the carne asada nachos. 

The Pros: 
Nice customer service.
It appeared cleaned inside.
I got a lot of meat. 


Cons:
Bland meat.
Luke warm meat
Meat tasted as if it was cooked a few days ago then frozen only to be cooked again to sit in lukewarm water till ordered! 
More meat then chips, sour cream and pico de gayo. It's not nachos if there are only 10 chips and a 2 pound of meat!!!!

I wanted to give Roberto's a try again but disappointment is what I keep getting from this place. Regardless of the location.
