Carlito's was disappointing, first thing I noticed when I walked in the door was that the menu items were misspelled for example "Pozole" was spelled "Posole" I knew we were in trouble! dun, dun, dunnnn! The sopapilla tasted bland. No flavor, no texture, nothing. I would've enjoyed a KFC biscuit a lot better. My girlfriend was having hot flashes in the smoldering restaurant. The New Mexican art they had on the walls were tacky and not art. From Mexico with love :)
