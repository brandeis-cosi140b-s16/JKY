1st, I swear the beans are Hormel chilli. ..which is just ew for a supposed Mexican place. Just no. Why? The rice has no flavor for "cilantro lime"...Chipotle is better.  2nd the margaritas are awesome and strong (maybe so you get drunk and forget that the beans are probably chilli from a can?). So, go here fo the bar and NOT for the beans. The steak tacos were good but we just couldn't get over the beans and rice...yuck! Even worse that they had the nerve to put those godforsaken  beans and rice in my husband's burrito. Double yuck!
