Gross. Just gross. I wanted to like this place, it came highly recommended by locals. But I cannot understand what they are all raving about. Greasy, slimy, overcooked, mess. One of the nastiest Mexican meals we've ever had and upset our stomachs for days. 
The local Taco Bell has better reviews than this place, which I thought was hysterical, but now can understand why.
