Do not eat! The pork slop called Al Pastor tasted like a slimy pile of seasoned salt covered in horse crap that was 2 weeks old. The carne asada tasted like salty dog food. The torrillas were like hard card board. I tried to cover the awful taste with over priced guacamole because I was starving, and it was alright, and the also several day old pico was almost edible. The staff who looked like they had been up for a couple days straight were pretty nice. I want to go make myself puke.
