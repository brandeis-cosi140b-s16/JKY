Ordered to go food. Came home and half way thru my son had a metal piece in his mouth. I called them to let them know and the guys response was What's wrong with that? Well that set me off! A simple apology would have sufficed but to say what he said?!? Is ridiculous! If you want a little more iron in your diet EAT HERE. WTF!  Wish I didn't have to put a star up but I wanted to post!
