Today my daughter went to the LC and they lost the order and she did not get the food for over 45 minutes.  The said the order was not placed in 'it was lost for a few minutes'.  The order goes from the counter where you place the order to less than 10 feet away to the cooking area.  She probably wished she had just left because she got food poisoning from the Los Chief salad.  She had a large order and the food was placed in a cardboard box that she took to her car.  NONE of the plates inside of the box were secured for travel; simply two paper plates with the food on the bottom plates.  The enchiladas spilled off the plate and the poisoned Los Chief salad placed between the plates also spilled off.  They used to put the salad in a bowl and tape it shut.  She said the tortilla for the cheese crisp was stale and just lousy tasting.  I'd warned her I no longer would order anything but their shredded beef tacos.  I use to get the green chili burrito but the last time I ordered it was made with a store bought tortilla.  It was gross.  My family has been going to this restaurant since the 60's.  The food was excellent and service outstanding.  However; the owner of the restaurant Mary died and the food has been going to h*ll rapidly.  The service is with a snotty  attitude that the management is doing a favor to serve to the customer.  There's just too many good Mexican restaurants to waste your money here!
