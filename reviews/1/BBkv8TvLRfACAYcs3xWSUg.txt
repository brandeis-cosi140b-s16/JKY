I don't like Top Shelf...  I don't like Top Shelf...  This is what I tell myself everything while shaking my head and pulling into the parking lot.

A short story about the sad state of affairs on the west side...

It is pretty interesting when you can be AT a restaurant, and talking to a packed bar full of people IN the restaurant, about how much the restaurant sucks.

This was my experience the last time I was there.

Then why are we all sitting here!!??

That concludes my short story about the sad state of restaurant (especially Mexican) affairs on the West Side.

Their tortillas are just horrible.  Thick like door mats.  Tacos, OK.  The fajita quesadilla is supposed to be top notch, but at $15 bucks, I haven't tried it.

Go across the street to the Caminero if you want some darn good Mexican.  No booze there though, just solid Mex.
