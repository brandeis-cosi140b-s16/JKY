We have tried this restaurant a few times. Unfortunately one time was when all my relatives were visiting. I had been to the Garcia's in Phoenix years ago and had great memories, so I expected it to be great. It was a big disappointment. Our enchilada sauce tasted like barbecue sauce. Everyone in our party was very disappointed in the food, and my husband and I paid for it, so it must've been really bad for them to complain about free food!  We tried again and the food was so bad tasting I couldn't even eat it. And I'm a really hungry girl who loves Mexican food!  Too bad it's not like the old Garcia's I remember since it's 2 min from our house. I wouldn't chance it again, though.
