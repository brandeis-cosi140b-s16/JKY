I haven't been to a Garcia's in at least 5 years.  I have nothing good to say about  the experience last night, except that the chips and salsas were good.  First, it was too hot inside.  I am not one of those ladies that gets too hot or too cold and complains all the time; it was ridiculously hot at our booth.  Second, the waiter told me that he didn't know why they listed some of the wines on the wine list because they don't have them.  There were 6 chardonnays to choose from and then he said they had none.  The beer I settled for arrived in a glass that was not chilled and it was not cold enough to enjoy so I left half of it.  The chicken on the plate was tough and dry but smothered in cream cheese sauce.  My date ordered a side salad which arrived with no dressing.  He wanted a salad instead of rice and beans, but the waiter didn't quite understand and brought out one dry salad before his meal- he had to ask for dressing.  Finally, the prices are just too high!  Each of our meals was $11.99 and each beer was $4.25 on a Friday night at 5:30 pm-- come on!  How about a happy hour special for the regular diners who don't want to be in the loud cantina crowd?  I felt that the meals were worth about $6.99 and maybe $2.50 for beers.  I will not go back :(
