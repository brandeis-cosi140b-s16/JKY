My wife and I were regulars at Secretos, but after they changed owners we stopped going. Then we found the Groupon deal and decided to try it again. The primary restaurant has turned into a bar and so has the food. Smoked food has been replaced with chili powder and their fresh salsa now tastes like canned salsa from New York City.
