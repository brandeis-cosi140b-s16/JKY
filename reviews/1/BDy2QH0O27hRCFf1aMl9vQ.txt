Walked into this chipotle tonight to get a $4 quesadilla. Asked for a side of salsa and the girl stated that she had to ring it up as a burrito. Huh???? So my $4 quesadilla is now an $8 burrito cause I wanted a side of salsa. The cashier seemed clueless and didn't understand why this was messed up. Will never go to this location again as they don't do this anywhere else. Get a clue. I called 4 other chipotles and none of them do this. They just give you salsa free of charge.
