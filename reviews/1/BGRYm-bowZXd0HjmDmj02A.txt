Good thing I stacked up at the sauce bar because they forgot my salad dressing. An "advocado mango salad" with one slice of advocado? So I asked for more and he grabs it with a napkin.... Also, the description said nothing about cheese so why was there cheese... No emotion from the cashier. Smiling makes the time go faster just so you know sir! 
But seriously the cashier was touching everyone's food without washing his hand it was one step away from being gross. Restaraunt needs more energy, better service. but chicken was perfect!
