This place serves some pretty low-quality food. The carne asada is chewy and they put shredded cheddar cheese in their burritos. No bueno amigos! 

Being a recent transplant from Chicago and knowing some pretty fantastic Mexican places (i.e. La Pasadita, Zacatacos, etc). I was hoping that there would be equally good Mexican food around Mesa. It is clear that Filiberto's cannot compete at all and has little to offer. The girl working at the counter had an attitude to top it all off.

The only thing I can't really understand is how this place was able to propagate all over the metro Phoenix area.
