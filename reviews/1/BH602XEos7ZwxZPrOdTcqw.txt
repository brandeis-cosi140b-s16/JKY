I'm sorry but El Pollo Loco sucks. Every commercial and sign they have makes their food appear to be so delicious with hearty, fresh avacados and nice portion sizes. However, I am regretful every time I go spend my money there. When I ordered a taco salad once, I could barely even find an avacado with the little tiny slivers of them that were in my salad and it's funny how the commercials show the salad as having all these fresh slices of avacados and a large portion size. I am always disappointed when I eat there...and the food is never nearly as good as the signs and commercials make it look. I don't know how they get such great business and customer reviews.
