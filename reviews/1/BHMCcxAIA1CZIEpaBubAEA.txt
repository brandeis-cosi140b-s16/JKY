I just ate here and I order some garlic shrimp. Unfortunately, the shrimp was so over cooker, it was super hard and I could even taste where it was burnt on the edges. The garlic, needless to say, was also very burnt. I pretty much didn't like the salsa and beans all too much and I generally could have had a much better dining experience here.
