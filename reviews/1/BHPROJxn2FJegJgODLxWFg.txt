We have been eating there at least one to three times a week for many weeks.  Last night we had to eat at the bar because it was so crowed.  Didn't mind at all.  The bartender served our chips first and these chips were not their regular chips, which I love.  They tasted like Fry's chips and I asked about them.  The bartender said they were the same chips and wanted to argue about it so I let it go.  After dinner we wanted to take the rest of our large fajitta salad home and we asked for a box and he gave us a box that was about a 5X5 flat box.  I asked if we could have the larger box and he said that is the only one they use for the past year.  I knew he was lying, for what reason I don't know, because we just,  days before had taken the lager box home with us.  With even this horrible attitude we left him a 20% tip and stopped to talk to the Hostess and told her what happened.  We see her all the time.  He came out from the bar and yelled,  "He was the owner and if we have a complaint to talk to him".  He yelled in front of the whole restaurant.  I said I wanted my change (tip) back and we left.  The margaritas were warm over a few cubes of ice, the food was warm not hot, the flour tortillas were warm, not hot, and, well the chips were horrible.  Maybe the place has changed hands, but we won't be going back.
