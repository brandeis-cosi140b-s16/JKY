To be fair, i will start this review off by saying i have eaten here once or twice in the past and it was "better" than my last experience. But my last experience will be just that...my last.

My boyfriend and i sat outside, which is a very small area, right on the sidewalk. The misters are a nice touch, but don't really reach you. I am a strict vegetarian (vegan actually) so ordered off the a la carte menu and ordered "vegetable tacos" and "potato tacos"...one would assume something called a "vegetable taco" would be vegetarian, but just to make sure, i asked our waitress. She said very confidently that there was no meat in them. I requested no cheese on them even. When the dishes came out, my boyfriend asked me what was in the tacos, so i started to push the food around with my fork to get a better look and it's a darn good thing i did, because all of a sudden i saw big chunks of fish. GROSS! I nearly lost my appetite. We explained to the waitress the problem and she didn't have the apologetic reaction i would have expected. She was less than sympathetic but took my plate back and got me new tacos. Once we began eating though, our table slowly became infested with flies. They were all over the chips and salsa, all over the glasses of water, all over US...it got so bad that i couldn't even eat anymore. It was disgusting.  We spent our entire meal swatting flies and pushing them off ourselves and our food. Add to that, an employee from the restaurant next door literally walking over to in front of right where we sitting to beat out a filthy dusty carpet, with plumes of dust going everywhere. I had had it. Truly awful experience and will not be back!
