They used to exceptional service! Now they lack in that and are lazy with there with build. Today I just in with my dad and got the new nacho stuft box and they didn't even get it right. And all their sour cream smelled like bleach. They need to wash their hands more often. They broke all my taco shells and it's just crazy hopefully they hire on new staff. The dinner crew today were just terrible.
