Worst experience at a Z Tejas ever. First, there is no parking. Then Ivey was a horrible server, non-attentive, didn't bring more drinks as we sat with empty glasses for 20 minutes. Then food was mediocre at best, they over-cooked my $26 steak, then took so long to bring a new one that I had to eat alone as the rest of the table had already finished. To top it off, in the middle of dinner, there are blinds in the ceiling that they opened while food was on the table and watched the dust fall into food. Completely unacceptable and would not recommend this Z Tejas location to anyone.
