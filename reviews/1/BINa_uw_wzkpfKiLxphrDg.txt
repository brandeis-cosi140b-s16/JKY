Very disappointed, have now had a bad experience twice in the last week. What used to be my favorite restaurant has really lost its charm. From a rude server to incredibly slow service at breakfast our family will now be going elsewhere for our go to neighborhood restaurant. Even after talking to the Manager, I don't think he really cares if they retain customers and offered little in the way of apology. Bye, bye Nando's! No longer for us!
