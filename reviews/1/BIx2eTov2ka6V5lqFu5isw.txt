Came here craving queso- sampled prior to ordering and thank goodness. Tasted heavily of beer. Went ahead and ordered a taco salad after the dip trio came out and was decent. The taco salad is a must not. There was a ton of mozzarella on it instead of cheddar. The "taco seasoned beef" was very familiar to a can of Hormel chili. The lettuce was already turning brown. Our salad was out within two minutes of ordering. The shell was glistening from oil, although it was fresh oil. I wish I had decided on Cafe Rio salad and not decided to try the queso. Being pregnant I already feel nauseated. The waiter was very pleasant and my water was fresh. Sadly, we will not be back. It's connected to a bar so don't expect anything beyond bar food. So if you are drunk... This may be what you are looking for. As for me I'd rate this below a taco bell salad for double the price.
