Go to Taco Bell. The food there is better. Honestly I can't remember the last time I felt this way about an eatery.  I will tolerate some pretty sh#%tty food, but I think this place might take the cake. Choked down a half of burrito and my gf ate about a quarter of taco enchilada combo. Seriously go somewhere else.
