It was a bad experience.  We walked in and it s freezing inside.  The salsas, even though they say are fresh were more like tomato sauce instead of spicy salsas. The tables were dirty.  The service was "where".  The condiment table was dirty. Don't have their enchiladas, it tastes like tomato powder.  I thought it would be better!!
