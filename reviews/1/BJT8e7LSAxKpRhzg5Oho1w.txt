Run! Seriously, just keep driving, do not stop. Cabinet doors for cleaning supplies standing open with brooms leaned up against him, employees with their shirts up above their fat rolls, unwashed tables, empty condiment and straw bins... orders took forever. Saw two different people have to get their orders fixed because of so many mistakes (One couple was given to completely wrong combos than what they ordered). Everything from the filthy interior to the creepy clientele and unwashed employees just screamed health hazard. Don't risk your health... Go somewhere else.
