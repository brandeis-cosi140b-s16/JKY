Not a good experience at all. And, this was my second time giving this location a chance. 

When we first arrived, my fiancé and I waited about 5 minutes to be seated or even acknowledged. From there, the wait for our server was another 5-10 minutes. We ordered our drinks and again, waited another 15 minutes for them to even be served to us (the bar was not very busy) and to have our order taken.

I ordered chicken tacos and my first bite was, eh, okay. The server came and asked how we were and I politely responded "fine!". After the next couple bites I really didn't like the tacos at all. When I expressed the fact that I was I unsatisfied with my tacos she didn't seem to be too concerned and asked my Fiancé if we wanted to eat them. He told her he didn't really like them either so she took them away. 

After we received the bill, we were charged full price for my meal. Maybe I shouldn't have tried to be polite in the beginning but, I was a little shocked when she charged us full price for a meal  we both didn't like, without even offering us something different. By that time though, we were already tired of waiting for service.

I've never been to any other locations for dining but, I don't think we will be returning to this location again.
