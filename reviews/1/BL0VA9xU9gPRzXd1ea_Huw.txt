This place was a bust! Either someone in Univision is related to the owner or Univision owns the joint!!! The food was gross and the service was horrible! The "aguas frescas" were gross, the place is beyond dirty and the waiter/ waitress need an attitude check!! Save your money and avoid this place!!! Never going back
