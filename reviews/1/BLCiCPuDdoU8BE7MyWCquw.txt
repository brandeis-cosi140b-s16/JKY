Ordered 2 burritos and a parfait. They told me the parfait would take an hour to make. An hour to put fruit in a cup with yogurt. There were 2 people waiting on food that had been there for 45 mins before us waiting for burritos. It was us 4 in the place for over an hour. Bartender was nice, manager was a joke.
