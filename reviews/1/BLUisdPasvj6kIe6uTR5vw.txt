Horrible chiptole.  Parking lot is a hazard, I've almost had a few accidents here.  The parking lot is way to small for the amount of traffic this place gets.  This location is pretty much always crowded and long lines.  The service is subpar.  I've had a few instances when I would call my order in ahead of time and I would walk upto the cash register only to have the lady help 5 people before I can pay for my order.  Rural and baseline location is much better and far less people.
