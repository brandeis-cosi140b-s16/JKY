I swear I must have died sometime last weekend because when I came here to eat this weekend I was treated like a ghost despite standing right next to the two hostesses. Your food has good reviews but unfortunately I fear that I would have to jump through hoops and eat fire just to get serviced. HOW CAN YOU FEED THE PEOPLE WHEN YOU CAN'T EVEN SERVE THE FOOD. 

Locals FAIL!
