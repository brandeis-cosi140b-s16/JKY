Tried this place for the first time yesterday with a friend since we heard that they are very similar to Chipotle. I was very disappointed.  The food was not as tasty as Chipotle and the service although similar to Chipotle is horrible, I mean terrible.  For a Sunday evening and not very busy the service should be excellent.  Out of the 6 people behind the counter ONLY the lady making the tortillas smiled at us.  And the rest of the staff were all grumpy, not one of them said hello first before what can I get you. Not even a smile.  I got the shredded chicken with black beans, no cheese burrito and then when I got to the girl serving the salsa, I said can I have it on the side, she said sure what else? I said lettuce, she put the salsa down to get the lettuce but never handed it to the cashier.  My friend got the grill chicken taco plate.  We got our order to go and left. My friend said she did not give us the salsa, I said never mind.  I got home and my chicken was dry, the taco plate was not bad.  
Advice to Management, if you are going to compete with Chipotle, even if your food is sub par,   your service needs to be excellent.  I prefer to drive the extra 4 miles to get Chipotle. I give you 1 star because of the service over the food.
