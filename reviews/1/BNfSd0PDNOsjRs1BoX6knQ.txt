If I could give this place no stars, I would. 

This was the only place with open tables when I got off a long flight and was just looking for a place to sit down. 

I have seen better food come out of a college dorm microwave. Which is probably where most of this food comes from too, because though there is a window into a semi-open kitchen, there are no aromas of anything cooking, no sounds of sizzling, not even the ubiquitous scent of fryer oil in a place that has french fries on their menu. 

Everything comes out on microwave safe dishes, as well.... suspect, right? 

I split some nachos (tostitos style chips with shredded mexi-mix cheese barely melted on top), and a burger (uniform grey color throughout the 'beef' patty, and bacon that had obviously come out of a bag, pre-cooked). 

My traveling companion and were starving, but we couldn't finish anything. And due to the tepid temperature of everything on the table, we began to wonder if we might get sick later. The only thing that was any good on our table was the cokes. 

This place should be torn out of the airport.  It's a form of biological war-fare.
