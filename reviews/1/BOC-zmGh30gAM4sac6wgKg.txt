I went here with a group of friends (4 of us total) on CINCO DE MAYO just trying to get some tacos and margaritas. We sat in the empty waiting area for 3-4 mins before even being greeted and sat at a table. We got waters and chips & salsa then ordered our margaritas. We then waited 30 mins and still had not gotten our margaritas or had our waters or chips refilled. Even after asking our waitress how much longer it would be and if we could get refills. Needless say we got up and left without being served.
