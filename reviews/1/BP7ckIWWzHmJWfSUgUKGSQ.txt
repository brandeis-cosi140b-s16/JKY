Went to Los Sombreros beginning of April 2009 right when they opened around 5:00 p.m.  Had baby in carrier with husband.  We usually sit at the bar outside, but with the baby, we wanted to be seated on patio.  

We ate chips and salsa.  don't like the little dorito wheels that come wedged in the chip basket.  The salsas are just alright and the tiny bowls aren't big enough for even the two of us.

Got crab queso.  It was good. We filled up on that and when my husband's carnitas (used to be our fav) came, so did the flies.  Yea, the regular dumpster variety.  ILK!!!!  We were surrounded by about 20 flies.  They were landing on the food and us, and biting.  The service was poor.  We finally got her to come over and we wanted to pack up the food and get out of there.  I had fish.  Oh yea, and a margarita.  They seemed  fine, but on we go...

The waitress noticed the flies and shooed them away while she gave us the "to go" boxes.  Our bill was about $70 with tip.  

We didn't eat the rest of our leftovers that night.  But the NEXT night, we warmed up the carnitas and ate it up.  It seemed fine.  The next morning we woke up with severe vomiting and diarrhea.  This lasted for 2 days.  I went to the ER and had to get 3 liters of saline from dehydration.  Now, we think this all came from the carnitas.  Perhaps we should have not eaten it a day later.  Maybe it was on it's last legs the night they served it and that extra day...it turned bad.  We can't be sure.  Stomach flu has been going around so it could have been that.  Thing is, we both got sick at the exact same moments.  Hummm... Won't be going back.  Ever.  Sad...
