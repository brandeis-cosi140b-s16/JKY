This place totally sucked!

When I first walked in, it seemed normal. I walked into the bathroom to wash my hands and there were filthy paper towels all over the bathroom floor. I figured I wouldn't let that get to me because maybe there was a rush and a whole bunch of people were in there before we showed up or something lame.

We ordered chips and salsa (which was way overpriced), the Carnitas plate and the taco salad special.

The chick behind the counter didn't seem interested. She forgot to give us our drink cup and was very distant. The chips were smothered and covered in oil. The Carnitas had grease all over the bottom of the plate and it was just utterly disturbing.

Save yourself a bunch of heartburn and cash and look for a roving taco truck.

Two thumbs down!
