I ordered double meat chicken and barbacoa and these guys are stingy, my bowl looked like it was half and half instead of double. Probably the worst chipotle I've been to when it comes to giving me the right amount of food. Will go somewhere else. This place is a tourist spot and they don't care if the customer comes back or not.
