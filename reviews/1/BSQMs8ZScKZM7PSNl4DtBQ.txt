Went just last week on a Wednesday night, wanted to check out there "glow party" very bad!!! Horrible service. There was barley no one there, took at least 20-25 mins to get a drink & we were at the bar. They do look like they hate there jobs. A waste of time, thank god we were only there for 45 mins, don't bother checking out there glow party, way more funner & better things to do on the strip! Wouldn't go back...
