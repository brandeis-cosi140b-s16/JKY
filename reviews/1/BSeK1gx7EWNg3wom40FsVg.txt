This place is dirty! Watched the girl in the back dicing tomatoes and goes straight to the register to cash out customers without proper hand washing. The only thing she did was wipe her hands on a rag and cleaned the rag out behind the cashier counter. I got curious and took a peek at it from the soda station and it was only a bucket of water! Not sanitary!!! I would give this place no stars if I could!
