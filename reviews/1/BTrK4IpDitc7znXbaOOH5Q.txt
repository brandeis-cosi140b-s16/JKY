i was here last June, was starving and craving meat, Flicka's carries excellent quality meat, the problem is they incinerate it, i ordered a  skirt steak rare, and a burger medium rare, to go. , i got home, the skirt steak turned out to be a 11.8th inch over well done ribeye, greasy as hell, the burger was impossible to choke down, i had called Flicka back immediately, he said he would replace the items, i gave him my name, said i would be in soon, well he nevr took down my name, cause when i went back, and asked for my food, they were puzzled,, i came back 3 times never saw flicka again, and its a shame, because ive had  a very very good burger there before, i guess he doesnt  care about keeping business. plenty of food for the money but if its inedible its not worth a cent, by the way, i was starting to heal from a bad accident a humerus break,, this was after 7 mo, and last time i triedd to get my food, an underaged young over intoxicated patron, came up behind me on the patio, shook my shoulders and rebroke my arm, almost a year later because of this i lost all use of my arm... 1st time i went i would have given this place a 4 star for its erasonable prices, tho i;ve only tried the burger great value comes with either nachos, fries or a very nice salad, but now , if i could  i would not put any start at all since this isnt an option, i give it 1, start flicka just doesnt give a damn and i was totally ripped off,also, dont evn think of using the restrooms here filthy
