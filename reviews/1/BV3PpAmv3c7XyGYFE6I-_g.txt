The service was horrible and the food was even worse.  Beans were like wallpaper paste.  The chicken tasted like a piece of charcoal right out of the fire.   Ceviche not sure what that was didn't look like shrimp to me.  I'm usually not a picky person but I won't be back to this place. I ll leave on a positive note...the chips were good.
