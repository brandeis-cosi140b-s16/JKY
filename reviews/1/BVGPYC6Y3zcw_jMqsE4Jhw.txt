I had high hopes for this location. It's right around the corner, urban industrial decor, it's Chipotle! What could possibly be so bad about it? As a chef, I know consistency is critical, from recipe, to portion, to presentation. They're new still and trying to find their footing, so this is a pass in my book. 

The part that is never a pass in my book is hygiene and cleanliness. I came in last night to grab a bite to eat, and as I was approaching the cashier to pay, I look over and one of the employees is cleaning the drink station with a CAT in her hand. Yeah, you read that right - a cat. She was nonchalant about it too, petting the cat in between wipes of the soda jerk and utensils, then picking up a broom to "sweep" around the drink station.  This is enough for me to boycott this location until it's addressed. I guarantee if the state health inspector saw this it wouldn't have ended good for the franchisee. I know you're a new operation, but it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out where this could've gone south. It's a shame because it should've been a common sense thing, but not a single person on the staff addressed it.
