This was place was terrible. We waited well over an hour for our food - seemed obvious that the waiter forgot to ring in our order as all the other tables were fed before us. When the food finally did come, the order was wrong and the food was borderline inedible. I've got to think my experience was a slight aberration because everyone else seems to like this place. Maybe you'll have better luck than we did, but I won't be risking a meal here again in the future. Just walk another hundred feet and get better quality food at lower prices from Chipotle.
