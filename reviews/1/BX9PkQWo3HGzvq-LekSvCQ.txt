No, just.... no.

I've heard other locals sing the praises of this place for years, but my return to this place was filled with nothing but regret.

'You ordered wrong - you have to try their burritos!" -- "not all stores are the same, you have to go to a good one!" -- "It's really good if you are drunk!" -- are just some of the qualifiers I was offered as to why people like this place, but whatever they are currently calling themselves, be it Roberto's, or their increasingly appearing new moniker of "Don Tortaco" (believe me, the menu, decor, and food are identical), these places are the lowest common denominator of food.

Last week I caved in to the pressure and decided to try their burritos - as reported, they weren't as wet and revolting as some of their other offerings, decent for the price, but then my wife and I both became violently ill and suffered stomach cramps (and you can imagine the rest) for the rest of the weekend.

Sure, Roberto's/Don Tortaco might be "great if you're drunk", but people do a lot of stupid things when they are intoxicated, and that's no reason to recommend these activities on Yelp.

Stay away.
