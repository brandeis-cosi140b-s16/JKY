Their catering service is absolutely horrible.  If you don't want to be embarrassed with colleagues, do not ask this company to cater.  You want to stay professional, Qdoba is far from it.  EVERYTHING went wrong from A to Z.  Delivery was never made since the driver was an hour late.  People had to leave and get back to work.  HORRIBLE!  Absolutely embarrasing.
