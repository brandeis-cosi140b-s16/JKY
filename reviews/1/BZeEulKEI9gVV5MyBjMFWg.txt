This is hands down the worst Chipotle I've ever been too. A couple weeks ago, I got a burrito and it was the worst. It was more of like the size of an enchilada rather than a burrito. It also fell apart immediately upon grabbing it out of the foil, which I attribute to the stale tortilla that was used. 

And then comes today. I walked in and politely said "I have been here many times before and haven't had any issues" and explained my last experience. Their response was "oh we have an inexperienced person wrapping them" and didn't apologize or anything. The girl adding the food was extremely careless. The scoop of steak was laughable (had to ask for extra sauce). Then extremely carelessly threw my salsa and cheese on there. I was so dumbfounded I ignored the manager and cashier paid and got the hell out of there. UN believable. And then guess what. I had the same falling apart stale burrito.
