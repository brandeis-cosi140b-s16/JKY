This place is tremendously bad.  It's the worst Mexican food I've ever had in my life.  No question.  My wife ordered a carnitas burrito.  The pork was awful.  It was overcooked, spongy and slightly green.  Yuck!!  I ordered the beef burrito and cheese enchilada.  The beef was undercooked and tasteless.  The rice was terrible.  The cheese enchilada was bland, and the red sauce tasted like wallpaper paste.  Bland as heck and too thick.  The beans were decent, but not enough to get two stars even.  Many better places in Vegas to eat Mexican food.  Avoid this place at all costs.  I don't get the positive reviews.  It's just terrible.  Never again.
