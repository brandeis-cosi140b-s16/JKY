Utterly disappointed. Ordered a #4. Simple right? Hard taco, enchilada, beans and rice with a blended margarita. Received the margarita first, and I'm not lying when I say it was the WORST margarita I've ever had. I took one sip and tasted nothing but blended water. Mixed it up, took another sip and the same thing. Now the food is next. It was nothing special. If I didn't know any better I would think they had a pipeline to Taco Bell. I should have trusted my first instinct and walked out as soon as I walked in. And what is that instinct you might ask? Never eat at a Mexican restaurant filled with nothing but white people! And before you get all "This guys a racist" on me...... I'm White!
