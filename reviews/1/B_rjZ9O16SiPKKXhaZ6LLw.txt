This was my 1st time eating at a Moe's & I have to say I'm very disappointed! People kept telling me how good they were.. Maybe I should have just stuck with the queso! When I walked in I was greeted then the guy took my order. He did not seem very friendly; he seemed irritate. He just put chicken on my tacos without asking me what type of chicken. I had to ask what the meat was. He checked me out in a hurry & just left my bag sitting on the counter. None of the ingredients looked fresh & I thought the price was a little high for tacos especially when not receiving a reasonable amount of meat & toppings. Lastly, the food was bland. I would not recommend eating here... They are nothing like chipotle!!
