I came here once before about 2 years ago and had the cheese enchiladas and thought it was good. I just recently came here and realized that this restaurant is not very authentic Mexican food but is targeted to the more Caucasian crowd. I don't mean any offense but, the food is not spicy, even though they say it is. The tacos had very little meat and te cheese enchiladas were a lot of cheese, and the tamales had no flavor. 
The prices for the meal are not outrageous but not consistent with what you order. 

As for the staff they are not very friendly and come off as if they don't care what the customer thinks. We were served by a guy of the name Moreno (that's what the ticket says and I'm not sure because he didn't have a name tag.) he never checked to see how our food was and hardly walked around to other tables to see how they were doing. He took more time trying to get a black folder to give our ticket and walking around us with our ticket rather than givin it to is directly. As for the bus/water boy was doing an amazing job clearing tables and all the duties that Moreno couldn't do. 

I almost forgot about the cheese crisp. It was very greasy but oddly the tortilla was hard and cardboard like. It was gross.
