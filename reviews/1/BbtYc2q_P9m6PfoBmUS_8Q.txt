Seat your self type of place.... Someone 10 min later brought us h2o but we didn't see anyone for at least another 10 min. 

All 4 of us felt sick after we ate there. I kept finding bones in my chicken enchiladas. 

Our drinks were so overly strong, they tasted bad. 

Overall, poor experience, won't be back.
