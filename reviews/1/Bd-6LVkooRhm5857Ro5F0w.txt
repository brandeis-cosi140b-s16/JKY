Terrible service; Even though we were there during a slow time of day the severs stood around chit-chatting and ignoring the few customers that were there.

Drinks; Run-of-the-mill Margaritas that tasted like they were made with a cheap pre-made mix.

Nachos; A pile of chips with the same cheap cheese sauce that you get at a convenience store...no kidding!
