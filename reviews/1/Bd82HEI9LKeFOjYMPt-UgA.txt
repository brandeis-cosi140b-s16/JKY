Sad excuse to be called a Mexican restaurant.  Ate lunch there the other day and ordered a torta de carne asada  took forever, no flavor at all, not ever going back.  The chips and dip see the only thing good.  I'm from Chicago and I'm considered a Mexican food expert. And this place is American Mexican food. And not what real Mexican food taste like. Too expensive an not authentic at all.
