This is when you wish Yelp had a 0 star option. 
On the surface, this restaurant has 3-star appeal. My husband and I were excited to enjoy a well-crafted margarita with some upscale tacos, and we left satisfied with our experience. Yet, when my husband wound up with an awful bout of food poisoning that kept him in bed for the entire next day, we instantly regretted our experience. 
Being on vacation, this wound up costing us expensive tickets to two spring training games and time with our friends that we hadn't seen in years. When I called the restaurant to alert them of the issue in their kitchen, the manager was rude and accusatorial. 

The manager said it was impossible that the food poisoning came from them, because it takes 24 hours for food poisoning to occur. When I mentioned that the Mayo Clinic disagrees and that it only takes hours, she went as far as arguing the Mayo Clinic's research.

She said that the restaurant requires customers to get a doctor's note verifying that the food poisoning came from their food. Well, since it was 7:00 on a Friday night and we were trying to salvage what was left of our shortened vacation, we weren't trying to pay $500 for an unnecessary ER visit. 

Food poisoning is bad, yet Cien Agaves' customer service is worse.
