Went for lunch as I was craving a taco. The hard shell was stale and I wasn't impressed with the rest of it. The salsa that comes out had no flavor, it seemed to just tomatoes. Booooring and tasteless. 

I will probably not be going back to see if it was a bad day as stale hard taco shells and flavorless salsa at a Mexican joint seems like blasphemy! 

This is sad face in the flesh. :(
