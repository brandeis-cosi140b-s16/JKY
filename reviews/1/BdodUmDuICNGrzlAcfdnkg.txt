It was a Saturday about 5pm when My wife 2 boys and I walked in and there was only a few other groups in the restaurant. We asked if they had margaritas and the waitress said they only had margaritas In a pouch which seemed odd. We ordered our food and 30 mins later we noticed they were just bringing out another group's food. We asked the waitress about our food and she said it was going to be another 15 minutes. We told her that was too long and we would just leave. The owner walked it and didn't say one word to us. As we were walking to our car we noticed the owner taking to bags of food out to his vehicle. I would suggest never going here!
