I really tried to like this place and gave it several chances. The food is good, however the management is terrible. They play incredibly loud music which makes it difficult to sit and talk with anyone or enjoy your food. The last 2 times they messed up our order. The very last time I called in ahead for a to go order and they didn't start cooking it until after I arrived. My experience with this place has been very disappointing.
