Ordered a bean, cheese and rice burrito and they gave me a bean and cheese.  I don't speak Spanish,  I shouldn't have to, but it seems they only employ Spanish speakers. I'll go to tacos El Gordo from now on. This is the 3rd time, I'm done. Called to complain and couldn't understand a word they said. I won't be back and I wouldn't recommend. Learn to speak English.
