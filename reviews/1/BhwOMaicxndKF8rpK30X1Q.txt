I cannot give this place a good rating. I had just walked out of 2 other taco shops, one didn't have Carne Asada, the other one smelled in the parking lot. 
So by the time I got to this place I had just decided I'm not going anywhere else I may be being to picky, I'll eat here, so I walk in  and i'm standing at the order counter and I get no response from anyone in the front or the back for about seven minutes when the lady comes up to the register she tells me 9.85 for 2 tacos, she takes my $20 and shuts that drawer forgets to give me my money back, just walks to the drive thru window and tells me to wait on my change because she had to take someone else's order at the drive-through. Ok then. That's strange, so I asked for a small soda they had no sodas this day, their soda machine was down and broken so I figured I'd get tea. She gave me a cup, but I find out there was no ice, so she fills my cup in the back, I sit my son down, when she tells me my tacos are ready (which don't take long) I go grab them, but when I sit back down with my son tells me he doesn't want to eat because he wants to play with the bugs. Yes BUGS, all over the booths, floor and around the window frames. I take pics and then I threw my whole tray away. What a waste of 9.85 I'm in the parking lot writing this review because I didn't want to forget.
 I wish I could load video, but pics will have to do.
Won't be back here EVER.
