I never got a chance to try the food, We came at 9:28 pm Sunday April 13, 2014, and the two staff were doing their best not to make eye contact. All the mats were hanging on the rails, and the young man was already putting away all the salsas. There were no other customers, other than a couple leaving and a gentleman standing by the register having a long leisurely conversation with the gal behind the counter. Neither staff acknowledged our presence. When the chat partner finally left, the gal leaves the counter and goes to the back while the young was still fiddling with the salsa containers. There was a long awkward silence until he finally, in resignation, (I guess we're just not getting the hint that they want us to leave) shuffled to the register and in a deflated manner, asked my husband if he could take his order. My husband asked for their combo, along with some fries and the gal yells from the back "were out of fries." That's when I had enough, and told him to cancel the order and that we'll be going somewhere else-that was the first sign of enthusiasm I got from him. He smiled as if he just won a grand prize. With a huge toothy smile, he kept saying "have a good evening" several times while we were walking out. Needless to say, I won't be trying their food EVER, no food is worth All That TROUBLE...:-(
