Bad service no manger around to take care of the situation, reason why is that cashier took my order did not wash her hands shoved them in the chips for the carne as√£da fries with her bear hands and then Denied after I watched her prepare my food and then tried arguing with me about it so at least she refunded my money not coming back to this place ever again !!sucks that I made this place my #1 for fast Mexican food
