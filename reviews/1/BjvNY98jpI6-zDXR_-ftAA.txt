I decided to try this place because it had many high scores from people. My daughter found this place. We all were craving Menudo with toasted, buttery bolio bread.  Walked in and several people were eating the menudo. Ordered my menudo with iced tea and my toasted bread. Served us some salsa and chips. Those tasted good. Then I received my food. Looked good - then my first taste was okay what is that taste. It wasnt spicey. So I added more crushed chili and salt. Then tried it again. Yup, I was very disappointed.  The menudo had a smokey flavor to it. Not smokey like burnt taste. But it was made to taste smokey. Yuk! I couldnt finish it. My tea was horrible.  Tasted like it had been sitting in a dirty pot that hasn't been washed. We thought it was the sweet n low sugar. But it wasn't. I give this place thumbs down! :(
