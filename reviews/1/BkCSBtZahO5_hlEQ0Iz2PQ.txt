Our first time in this location [Feb 8 3015] around 4pm. The customer service is the worst ever. I'm not sure what her name was but she was rude as hell! This chick did not greet upon entering. She kept say 'what' like she can't understand English. I said thank you and she ignored me. If I wasn't in a good mood it would have been mayhem. #Rude
