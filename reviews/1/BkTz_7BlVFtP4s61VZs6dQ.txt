The cashier took our order of a 2 taco combo for $5 and did not give us a receipt. When I got my food it was not the combo. I brought it up, and he said no I didn't. I pointed out that he'd even handed me a small drink that comes with the combo, and he continued to fight me over the rice and beans. I left without the rest of my food. 

The friend that I was with was charged $6.50 and he entered $2.50. She confirmed that she wanted the burrito and he said yes, $6.50. The cash register still said $2.50. No receipt to confirm.
