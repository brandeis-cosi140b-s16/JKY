Nice place, nice busser BUT OUR SERVER IS HORRIBLE!!! First we ask her about our yelp offer we got for checking in with YELP and she said the FREE HOUSE MARGARITA is only a tasting cup size not a full order! Then the busser show up and we ask him about it after he drop off our drinks order and he said wait that doesn't sound right let ask the manager then he came back and said it is a full size margarita order. Then we order our food, portion is very small compare to other happy hours food places we been. Then the worst part is while we still eating the chips and shrimp ceviche the server took our chips and leave us the shrimp ceviche without any chips left to eat it with!!! This is very sad first time we visited this restaurant and SADLY TO SAY THIS IS OUR LAST VISIT HERE!!! 

Server name is: Susana

Busser name: Matthew (excellent customer service!)
