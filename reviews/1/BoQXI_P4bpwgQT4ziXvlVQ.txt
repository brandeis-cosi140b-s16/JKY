New manager, same problems since opening.  

Asked for nachos with cheese and chicken.  First person in line rudely says there are no nachos so move down the line and we will get you some nachos.  Second person in line, the manager trying to keep things together, he takes control but I still end up am waiting for 15 minutes in the dining room.  He finally gets my nachos, melts the cheese and adds the chicken, then passes it down the line to a final third server.

The third server gets yelled at to get my nachos done and he picks up someone else's cheese only nachos and asks me what I want on them.  No one in the line has any idea what is going on in this restaurant, blind leading the blind.  I correct his mistake because I am watching for a switch.  I then ask him to "add pico," and he adds pinto beans.  I can't start over so I take the order the way it is and leave.  Total time from entry to exit is 45 minutes and there were only a few people in line!

What can I say the place is poorly managed, it has been since it opened and it still is to this day.  Better watch your food in this place because they don't have a clue.
