I  asked  the  server  it  there  was  lard  in  the  bean  burrito  and  she  said "No, only  beans".   Now  I  found  out  that  she  lied  to  me,  they  are  actually  made  with  lard.   it  looks  like   Filibertos  does  not  even  publish  their  nutritional  information,  probably  for  a  good  reason.
