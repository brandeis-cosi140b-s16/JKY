The only thing I actually liked about this place was an employee named Hector, nice old guy who was really working hard. I should have known this place would be trouble as soon as I saw the bartenders pouring premade margaritas out of a jug. So gross. The food was also not good, not good at all. It was over priced and very generic. Having lived in Mexico for a year, I was expecting so much more. We moved in right down the street and had been excited to try this establishment, but we will not be going back.
