One star because no option for zero.
We were seated promptly. After that, pure crap. I believe all the five star reviews for this shit hole were made by people that either work, have friends that work here, or they actually drank all 40 something shots of tequila then made their review! Our overly tattooed server acted like she was on some kind of drugs. She was confused to what went to what table and took 10min each between bringing menus, waters, drinks and chips. We were also told that there was a guacamole shortage, but yet she brought out this green slime crap. It may have been blended limes with some type of salsa? I think? When ordering they didn't have the items we wanted, so I asked our space alien waitress what she recommended and ordered that. During this hour wait I was entertained by the confusion of the other wait staff. At one point a cook came out and had a argument with our waitress! The manager came to us and apologize for the wait and said 5 more minutes. What deception! After about another 12 minutes I had enough. I shouldn't have paid my bill and left, but my date said to ask for the bill. Instead I asked the hostess to get our bill and cancel the food order. She vanished along with the rest of the staff?? Alien abduction? I left $30 on the table since the drinks were around $15 a piece and I think the chips and salsa were free? I usually don't wait over 2 hours for food, but a previous 5 star yelp review said it was worth the wait. I came to Vegas to do multiple things and not wait all day for crap food.  The chips=horrible! A step up from cardboard.
     Salsa= little less taste and freshness than generic brand at Walmart. 
 Green slime stuff = very unique sour with bitter at same time.
I'm thankful they didn't bring the food, because I didn't risk the chance of food poisoning.
