Very Disappointed!!!! Just brought a double chicken avocado salad off the 500 calories or less menu which cost me 7 dollars and this salad couldn't have been more skimpy and the lettuce was not fresh at all ... Looks like lettuce that has been sitting out for days ... For health purposes I would advise El Pollo Loco to get it together ... Please take every not so fresh looking salad and trash it NOW!!! Stop ripping off customers such as myself by giving them food that looks like you picked it out the Trash... Just the very reason why I don't trust any fast food corporation I feel safer eating food that only I prepare ... Some of these people preparing your food at these places don't even look like they take care of their Hygiene properly ... Never again !!!! Wouldn't even get 1 star  from me if I had a choice
