Awful service, mediocre food, and overpriced. Every time I go in there, it's like I am inconveniencing them by placing my order. I am never going back to this place. If you want good mexican in the area you should go to Elmer's, Taqueria Mi Casita, Si Se√±or (New Mexico), or mucho taco. There are probably a lot more than that!
