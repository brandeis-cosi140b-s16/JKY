Positives first.  Guac is great.  Music was awful and way too loud.  I asked if they could please turn it down. To which they replied.  "No.  But I'll check with manager "Corporate office sets the volume level.  They didn't turn it down.   Second.  The apparent manager was rude and rushed.  Seemed irritated that we were there.  I will NEVER eat here again.  Chipotle is near by.  And food and vibe is 100 percent better !
