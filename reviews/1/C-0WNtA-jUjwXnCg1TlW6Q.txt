I have no FREAKIN' idea why this place is so d@#n crowded cuz it is not good Mexican food! 

I bought me and my daughter each a grilled chicken burrito enchilada style. The sauce is sweet! Sweet sauce on a burrito. Whose idea was that?!?And what is up with the parboiled, crunchy, non-flavored, wanna-be, Spanish rice??? Yuck!!! 

And this place is EFFIN' expensive to boot! $23 and change for two burritos and 1 small drink. And it's nasty! Woooowee! I'm mad about this nasty expensive food. The burrito taste like it was vegetarian. What happened to my CHICKEN!!!

I could have gone to a roach coach and gotten better tasting, wayyyy cheaper food. The Horchata didn't even taste right!

Taco Bell is better than this place...

I WON'T EVER BE BACK!!!
