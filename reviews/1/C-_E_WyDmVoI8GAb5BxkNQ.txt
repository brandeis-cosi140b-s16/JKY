If you like good food and don't mind getting money stolen from you come eat at Penascos!  We came back because we like the good food. We're never going back and here's why. 

Things seemed fine to start. We had our delicious margaritas, chips and salsa and we had ordered our meals. Soon, our margaritas got lower and so did the chips and salsa. When we asked our server for more chips, the new bowls were literally tossed into the empty ones with a huff. Hmm? That was strange. Sorry we want more chips while we are eating at your restaurant.

The kicker: We, too, were victims of the 20% Auto-gratuity, for a party of FIVE. Then once we paid, the server totally disappeared, seemingly not wanting to face us, knowing that auto gratuity is uncalled for, I assume. Looking back, we wished we had just used cash to pay the bill and leave NOTHING for the insolent server (She said she was an owner. Ma'am, why would you treat your customers like this, especially AS AN OWNER? And to the co-owner family members, you may want to put this particular person in a role where she is not dealing directly with customers.) 

We felt taken advantage of. Although it is close by home and we enjoy the food, our only recourse is to never return. You do not deserve our business.
