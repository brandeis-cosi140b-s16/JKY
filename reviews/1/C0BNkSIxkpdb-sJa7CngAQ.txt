This is probably the worst experience i have had at a Roberto's the meat tasted old and dry like it was made during lunch, and it seemed like it was 2 kinds of meat the chopped carne asada and pulled beef.  My husbands chimmi had way too much grease like they took it straight from the grease to plate not shaking excess grease from cooking off. My husband asked for his sour cream on the side because he does not eat it but i like extra and they put it on the side and the top so he scraped it off. The restaurant looked like it needed cleaned like they opened and just didn't tend to the dinning room. The server was not friendly and like sat our food where you get your sauces instead of either waiting for me to get up to the counter or just bringing it out. I will don't be coming back to this location ever! This is not the quality of food or service that i am use to getting at a roberto's. This location needs to do better because it can ruin the reputation of the other restaurants.
