We absolutely love Del Taco, but after moving close to this location and trying them several times, we have sworn them off unless we are close to the one on Val Vista and Warner. The tortillas are consistently dried out and crunchy on the edges, they are assembled half hazard and make a mess, and the service at this location absolutely sucks. Avoid this location at all costs!
