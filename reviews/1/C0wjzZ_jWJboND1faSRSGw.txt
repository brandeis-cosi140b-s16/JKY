Even one star is to much for the Del Taco located at 4101 N 67th Ave, Phoenix, AZ 85033. Corporate seriously need to take a look at management at this store. I have been going to Del Taco's for many years in many states and this one SUCKS. They are rude, slow and always seem to be out of things. One night I go through the drive through Im the only car and I wait almost 45 minutes between ordering and getting my food then I ask for The Del Scorcho sauce not other ones. the girl at the window said she put some of all of them in my bag. I said I did not ask for the others I asked for Del Scorcho only she looked at me like I was retarded and well I never got the sauce I wanted. Tonight I go to the same one to order a fiesta pack, they said they where out of beans for the next 2 hours they did not offer to substitute the bean burritos with taco again they looked at me like I was retarded.

This store id dirty most the time the employees seem to only want to be there to collect a check not to work. I believe this is it I do not believe Ill be going to Del Taco any more. So for others that go to this store I warn you beware!!!!
