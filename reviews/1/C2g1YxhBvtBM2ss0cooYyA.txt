The guacamole $4 appetizer dip was small and greyish and when i told the waiter at the end, he commented with a straight face "really? It was from today or yesterday?! But i am happy to tell the chef". I strongly advised him also to tell his boss not to serve yesterday's guacamole!!!

Also, they didnt card any of us 5 ppl, including my 19-yr old friend.

The frozen margeritas had all artificial flavoring but werent too bad.
And the cheese nachos were good.
