Went to manny's for Cinco de Mayo. Big mistake! This is not authentic Mexican food! I ordered there version of albondigas soup. All grease. No vegies. Tiny meat balls. Who would serve this to anyone. There version of tamales are frozen heated  in the microwave. This is not fresh homemade food. Unfortunately for them not going here again. Should of went to Garcias.
