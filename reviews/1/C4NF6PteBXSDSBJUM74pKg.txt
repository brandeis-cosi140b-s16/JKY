We chose this restuarant after an reviewing an  article identifying this restaurant as one of the top authentic Mexican Restaurants in the Phoenix area. Upon walking in you seat yourself, the waitress was prompt and polite with taking our drink order. We went at about 5pm on a Saturday afternoon and there were only three other tables with patrons. 

Upon taking the drink order we let the waitress know we would need a few extra minutes to make a decision. The waitress did not come back for about 20 minutes...mind you it was not busy. She was on her phone at the bar most of that time. We had finished our drinks at the time she took our order. She didn't ask again for refills until the food came out another 15- 20 minutes later. The only time she was friendly was when she first greeted us or took our money for the meal. It seemed as if we were more of an inconvenience for her than anything.

While the food was average, there was nothing special about it, but it wasn't bad. The service was awful. I would not recommend this restaurant and would offer as a suggestion to try another location such as Popo's or Tia Rosa's in the east valley. There experience is considerably better than here.
