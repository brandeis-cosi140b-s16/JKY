I'm Mexican and I came here to eat and was really disappointed. I ordered two tortas that looked more like sandwiches. On the menu they looked full of meat so I thought paying 9.00 for a tortas and a side of bag potatoe chips was not too bad. But what we received was two tortas with barely any meat. We ordered carne asada and rice for the kids and the food was bland and they didn't even eat it all. Very disappointed, this restaurant might of started off well but I will definitely not be coming back. I feel the food is bad and over priced.
