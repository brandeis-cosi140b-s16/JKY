I love Taco Bell, yes I said it, but this is the worst one ever. I don't know what they are doing to make it taste so bad. We have even thrown our food away. I keep trying it again, because it's close to home, but it hasn't gotten any better. I'll try again in 6 months until then I'll take the extra drive.
