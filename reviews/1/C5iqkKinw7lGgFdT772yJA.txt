I pulled up to the drive thru speaker at 10:40. Nobody answered so I pulled up to the window. The cashier that opened the window said that they closed early. The sign for their business hours said they close at 11. The cashier said that they closed 30 minutes early because they didn't meet their sales goal so they couldn't pay their employees. I've worked in management positions in the past, and at a fast food restaurant. The correct thing to do to say hours on labor is to send employees home early. By closing the doors early you're chasing customers away, therefore losing money. Horrible management. I was very disappointed. I was hungry and really wanted their chicken enchiladas.
