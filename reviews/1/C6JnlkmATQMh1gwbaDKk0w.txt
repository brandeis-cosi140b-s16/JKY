We went there New years day for some Menudo, cheese crisp. The menudo came before the cheese crisp which came as we were halfway thru our meal. Chips and salsas were fantasticThe staff was friendly, but very sloooow (it was not very busy).  They took a long time to recognize we were there, the food was ok, not something I would recommend. Maybe it was a bad day??? we all have those
