I ordered a chorizo and eggs burrito through their drive-through. When I got home to eat my breakfast burrito there was almost NO CHORIZO in the burrito! I paid $5.00 for 99% egg and a little chorizo color and a few small bits. The last time I went there and ordered a breakfast burrito they left egg shell in the burrito. I will not go back to this place!!! Dirty dining and a rip off with the chorizo! DO NOT GO THERE... there are many better places in Scottsdale for a good quick breakfast. I will post a picture too of my burrito......
