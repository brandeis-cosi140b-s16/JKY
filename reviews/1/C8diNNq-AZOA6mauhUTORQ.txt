My boyfriend and I were in the area, wanted to try something new, scoped it out on YELP. Thought it would be good because the reviews were good. Only one menu off to the side in the whole place. One girl was working, no greeting, went up and asked her about a menu item and could have cared less. She didn't ask if it was our first time or try to help in any way, was tossing things around, must have hated her job. Could barely hear her when asking the type of bean or rice we wanted. Absolutely would not come here again. The impression from just the employee not having any sort of customer service skills was enough for me to not want to come back. The food was decent, had a salad and nothing to write home about. You can just go to Chipotle and get the customer service and good food.
