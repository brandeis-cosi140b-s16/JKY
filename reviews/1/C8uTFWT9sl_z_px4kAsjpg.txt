We came in about 1:00 on a Sunday and sat at a booth in the bar. After about 5 minutes of sitting there, we were greeted and ordered two waters to start with. After another 15 minutes we hadn't received our waters and still had no menus to look at. We decided to ask the hostess to seat us in the dining room instead. She said it would be a 5 minute wait. There were plenty of empty tables but they were all dirty with no bussers in sight. We decided to just go somewhere else at that point.
