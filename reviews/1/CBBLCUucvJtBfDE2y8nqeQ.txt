On September 6, 2014, a friend and I faced one of the worst meals of our lives.  The seafood enchiladas were soggy mushed fish in soggier tortillas, and they were repulsive.  Imagine putting canned tuna through a blender, and that's what our food looked like.  I counted only 2 whole shrimp, and I never saw a sign of crabmeat.  Don't waste your money and your time at SDC.  Far better food is available at a Rubio's that serves tasty fish tacos and other fish treats.  You'll pay far less at Rubio's, and you'll enjoy well-prepared food.
