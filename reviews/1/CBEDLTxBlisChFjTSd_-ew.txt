Nobody in the restaurant.   My wife ordered a chicken  salad and I ordered a #10.  They only made the chicken salad -- just disgusting.  You couldn't tell if it was actually chicken. I had to ask again for my #10. The chicken tacos were impossible to tell if they were chicken.  The lady that presented the order couldn't recall that there were two meals in the order.  She actually challenged me and I has to show her my receipt.  As I said -- nobody else in the restaurant!  Just inedible.  
  Looking at the signs outside, it appears that this used to be another restaurant.  The same fate awaits this place.  Just terrible.
