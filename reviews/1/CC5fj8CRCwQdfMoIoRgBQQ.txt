I wanted to try this place for awhile so I finally did and what a waste of time and money. Fun atmosphere but all looks and no substance. Well duh! Maybe I should have known. My drink was okay but the food had no flavor! I had the combination plate with a taco and an enchilada and it sure looked good but absolutely NO FLAVOR! I felt strongly enough to speak to the manager about it, I got the feeling that he just didn't care. It was the chef's fault and he would talk to him about it. My advice-save your money and get a much better meal at Taco Bell.
