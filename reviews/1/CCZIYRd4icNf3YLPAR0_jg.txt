Paid 10.49 for unedible 2 taco plate which i threw  away. complained to staff and was offered something else which i declined but no refund. meat tasted very bitter and left bad taste in my mouth. It was truly horrible tasting. Worst mexican food I ever had this place is going on my NEVER again list. Go taco bell its better. Also there was very loud construction jackhammering  going on in the back which ruined the visit as well.
