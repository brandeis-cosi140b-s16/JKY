I have been waiting on a to go order for about 45 minutes.,... Still waiting..

This is not my first experience at this rubios. Last time I was here and found a hair in my food so I stopped eating it. Later that night I found myself throwing up over the toilet for about 6 hours

NEVER COME TO THIS RESTAURANT
