I have been coming here for a few years. Their Culichi is the best I have had. The battered fish tacos are very good too.  Today as I stood at the register waiting for someone to seat me. I could hear two women talking behind the counter to the left, too busy to seat me, no biggy this isn't Red Lobster. I could see one cook preparing food as his back was to me cutting something. Another guy in the kitchen area opposite him was facing me. As he stuck his thumb in his nose to dig around I about shit myself. This was not a rub a tickle away. This was a 5 second dig. This guy was working in the kitchen! with an apron on.  I was sceebed out of my mind. I will eat food off the floor but a food preparer to pick their nose, no way.  It wasn't just the gross factor but as I drove to my next choice for dinner I became enraged. I reaaaally loved their shrimp Culichi. What I saw will keep me from ever risking eating here again. I know this may happen but this guy didn't even care that I was standing there. Sorry Sinaloa, you need to look into hiring people that care. If management reads this it was 6/13/13 at apx 5:15pm.


Update...3/11/15. I was in Mesa and tried their other location a week earlier. Marlin tacos were great but Mesa is too far for me. A week later I had to give the Phoenix location another chance. I was glad to see the people in the kitchen were wearing gloves now, thanks management.  I will keep coming to this location.
