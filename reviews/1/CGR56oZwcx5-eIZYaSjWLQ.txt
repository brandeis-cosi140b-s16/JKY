I've eaten at this place many times as my company has a manufacturing hub in Charlotte, so over the years I have eaten here often as I wait for my departing flight. It's not bad Mexican, just a little pricey. 

The reason for the one star review is that as I am completing my expense report realized someone added their own tip to my bill. My bill was $24.87, which I paid with my corporate card and left a $5 cash tip. As I am completing my expense report, what's shown as being charged to my CC card is $29.87, so clearly someone gave themselves another $5 tip on top of the cash I left. This is unacceptable and theft. Guess I won't be eating here again.
