Most times, I would say that poor service is due to the individual server lacking the knowledge and skills to work in a restaurant; however, with this particularly chain, the poor service is in large part due to management and the general lack of professionalism with AMP'D. In this particular chain, it seems that poor management and poor treatment of their workers leads to the obvious - poor service and quality.

When I visited the Steel Cactus location in Southside, they were still fairly new. New staff, new building, new decor. The only positive thing I can comment on is the decor. The drinks were... mediocre at best in comparison to the one in Shadyside, and multiple drinks of mine and my friends' had to be remade, mostly due to the fact that we watched the bartender clumsily make them incorrectly, creating a horrible tasting beverage. 

Even worse, the bartender we initially ordered our drinks from was very snippy about how he made the drinks and everything but called us liars when we told him the drinks did not taste as they were supposed to. 

All in all, I could not recommend this restaurant to anyone given their staff, quality, and especially the managers. So unless you want to have a bad time, save yourself the time, headache, and money and avoid this restaurant/bar at all costs.
