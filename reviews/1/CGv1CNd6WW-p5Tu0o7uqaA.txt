Okay, first trip here but have been driving past and couldn't wait to try it- we were finally able to since we came in Sunday, as we have tried going there Mondays and they are closed (inconvenient). My house marg was decent, the chips ok, salsa was fair but the hotter of the two tasted like canned tomato paste with some spice added haphazardly. 

Unfortunately, the service was awful. Side plates and silverware and napkins are nice to have... Refilling iced teas, the waitress asked if my fellow patrons would like more ice, since it had been so long all the ice melted. The obvious answer is yes please more ice, this being *iced tea and all. The pollo fundido was too smothered and too soggy, the rice and beans were decent. My boyfriend's chimi didn't have much meat There was a mix up with our check which topped off the Poor Service Cherry and the waitress didn't seem too concerned or bothered by overcharging us by $20 when we brought it to her attention. 
Also, for being brand new I was surprised to find the bathroom smelled like sewage, come on, that's gross. 
With all the mexican food restaurants in the area, La Fonda falls short.
