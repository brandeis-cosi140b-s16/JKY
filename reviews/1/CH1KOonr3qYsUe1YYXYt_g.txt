The item you pick for your dinner can quite literally make or break the experience here.  That is, your cheesy, Americanized Mexican food experience.  I tried the vegetarian tamale and it was nothing less than awful.  No cheese anywhere, no flavor, just HOT.  Ok yes, the menu indicates this a "spicy" dish, but it didn't indicate its high degree of suck.  

Unfortunately on this particular visit we didn't get a hot waitress.  Instead we got a disenchanted guy who apparently didn't want a very big tip.  His heavy sighs, eye rolls, and general lack of even being around 99% of the time led me to believe he was channeling his inner emo and couldn't be bothered.  

We were sat next to a group of teenage girls, which by automatic default says "we hate you and want you to die."  They talked very loudly about their sexual escapades and did that annoying screech laughing.  I get it, I was a teenager once too, but if I could go back in time I'd kick my own teenaged ass.  

The food, service, and ambiance was like the time I fell off my motorcycle and got really bad road rash.  I hope I won't be doing that again any time soon.
