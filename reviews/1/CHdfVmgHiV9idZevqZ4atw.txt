What a dump! So you walk in and it smells like an assisted living facility. Staff were really nice, food was fine; nothing special, but the clientele are GHETTO! Obese black people and white trash, then it's music night so of course the POLICE have to be there to make sure nobody gets out of hand! Stay away from this place unless you are one of the aforementioned. Also, this isn't Mexican food, it's Tex-Mex.
