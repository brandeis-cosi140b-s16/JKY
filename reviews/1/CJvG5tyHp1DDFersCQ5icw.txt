Terrible Terrible service !!! Don't go there!  Drinks were weak. Even the manager couldn't help us with better service. Half of our party didn't get their check and some of our party got their food an hour after the rest of us did and we all ordered at the same time.  Instead of the waitress apologizing she just disappeared!!  I will not go back!
