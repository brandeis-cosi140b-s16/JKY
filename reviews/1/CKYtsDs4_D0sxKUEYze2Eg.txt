Filibertos used to be good food but twice now at this newer location  we have been so turned off by the foods taste. The refrieds are just awful, Is it they are not using original recipes with lard. Just tasteless. I had the beef enchiladas and the meat was again was without any flavor and watered down. They must keep the meat hot in a water bath. UGH. Lastly, the red sauce was so weak too one should use taco bells sauce packs. 
It used to be long lines at Filibertos and I have yet to see them there. I am upset as they used to have real good food and now they appear to be stretching their dollar at the expense of losing customers.Me included. Guess I drive all the way to Central to an old favorite. Didn't want to drive far.
