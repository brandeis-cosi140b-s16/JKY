Omg this was one of the worst experiences I ever had in a restaurant,  to start the lady at the front desk kept repeating her self that the restaurant was closing in 45 minutes , she turn around 2 Mexican families away, and then at 746 a White family shows up and guess what? They get an option of get there meals to go, unbelievable!  Its all about them apparently ...there is clear tables in the back of the restaurant but there are not longer available because is closing Time.  This manager in Duty is not in control,  the employees are... hahaha I'm a facility manager my self and this crew should be ashamed of there selfs .. one of the server's comes out and screams NO MoRE! ..I don't want nothing free I'm just gonna use my Christmas gift card and let my customers and friends know about the service on this place.
