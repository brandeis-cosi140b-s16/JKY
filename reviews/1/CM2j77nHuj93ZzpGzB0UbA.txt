I really hate giving bad reviews, but the seafood was terrible here.  You could tell we were eating old shrimp. The salmon was also old and had a super strong, fish odor.  Cost was too expensive. We paid $50 for two dinners one pop and one margarita.  The salsa was just ok.  The only thing that was good was the margarita, but I went there for seafood. Very disappointing.
