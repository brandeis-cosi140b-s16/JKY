First of all, let me preface this review by saying I love Roberto's. I mean shit, you're hearing from a guy who once ate it 18 days in a row when I first moved here from Phoenix. Dead serious, check 4 square I think I'm still the mayor? 

However, this specific location is amateur hour. ESPECIALLY, the Friday late night crew. I've often made my order crystal fuckin' clear only to get home and open up a complete disaster. Not only is the order a muff job but the shit is either burnt or raw. Maybe it's because multiple people take my order or maybe it's because the lead cashier was busy buying weed from a customer in back. 

Whatever the issue is I hope it gets fixed because while I'll never eat at this location again, I hope to have the confidence I once had in the Roberto's name restored so that I may be allowed to quench my carne asada fries thirst without the fuckery of non professionals. 

P.S. I ALWAYS tip these mother fuckers. Can you believe that shit? WTF is my problem?
