After waiting in line in the drive through for over 20 minutes, I was told that they had ran out of chicken, beef, beans, and rice. This was the night of the 4th of July so you would think they would have expected to be busy. After waiting for so long, I thought they should have at least had someone come out and tell the cars waiting in the drive through, that they had run out of everything besides steak and desserts so that everyone did not waste their time waiting in a very long and slow line. I'm very disappointed by this taco bell.
