We were in town for a few days and wanted a quick bite. 

What a mistake - the staff was rude and seemed like asking questions about the various items was an insult to them. They seemed more interested in their cell phones than the customers.

When the food finally came, it was disappointing, and believe it or not Taco Bell would have been a better choice, and a Chipotle would blow their doors off. 

Never again!
