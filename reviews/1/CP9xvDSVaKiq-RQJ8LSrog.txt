I would give this restaurant no stars! It was awful! The owner was mean and didn't believe my husband and I that there was a fruit fly that flew out of his rice. The owner insisted he didn't have flys or Mosquitos in his kitchen. He was rude and showed no customer service. I read several reviews on here on the lemons and mine had black spots on them as well. When I ordered my food it was very bland and cold! We had to wait to eat our food because the waitress didn't give us forks right away and we had to continue to wait for everything. The forks, the check, the drinks, etc. I would never eat here again. Customer service goes along way. Oh, and the sign outside says authentic mexican food but there is nothing authentic about it. It taste like Taco Bell. I order a beef chulupa and got some kind of mystery meat.
