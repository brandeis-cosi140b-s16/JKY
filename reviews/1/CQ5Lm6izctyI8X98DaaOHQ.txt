This location is the worst!  The 1st time i went through the drive thru and saw some girl making my food without gloves.  And after that she ran behind the corner and started Eatting.  It was fucking nasty.  Then i figured i would try n go one more time to see if they changed and they didnt.  I got my burrito made wrong.  With the wrong  sauce. And in the nacho's there was a hair!  I tryed calling to complain but there phone dont even work!?  What kind of place  is this.  They dont even deserve one star.
