If I could give them less i would. However I guess the one star goes to the guy that was trying his best to not be embarrassed by the cook that was so obnoxiously rude and loud complaining about doing her job. And of course I got exactly what I didn't order after having to wait around to listen to all her crap. She's not really meant to be cooking in public. Poor representation of this establishment if they could even call it that. Worst experience ever in a service based place - will never go to another, yuck
