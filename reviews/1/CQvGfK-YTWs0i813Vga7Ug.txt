Wow! 
Absolutely the worst taco bell food I've ever had.

The employees were nice.. but that's all I can really say that's positive about this location.

My order was taken correctly, but when I got home half of it was missing.

When my daughter and I actually bit into the tacos, it was like eating slimy dust.  I immediately spit it back out.
She did the same..

Ultimately, it ended up in the rubish bin. 
A complete waste of time and money.
We won't be going back..
