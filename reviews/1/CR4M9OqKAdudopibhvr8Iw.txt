My mom is a Mexican Chef and took her to Cantina in 2012 and she absolutely loved it! We went there a couple of times, but then I stopped going for a few months. Apparently they changed ownership and I visited the restaurant with my husband again a couple of weeks ago. It was a waste of our time and calories. The only good thing was the service. The chips tasted old and their red salsa tasted like everyone else's, straight out of the bottle. I read that their green salsa was incredible, so I ordered it, and it was a shame! It tasted straight out of the bottle too. I am Mexican, I would know! I ordered a burrito and it was okay, nothing out of the ordinary as it used to be. Definitely not worth my trip to this place, when I can most likely find fresher food with more taste at some spot down central avenue. I wasn't looking for authentic, I know that is hard to find, but I was looking for quality food that is unique in taste and savory. Not coming back again!
