well what can I say, we decided to give it a shot, we were seated very quickly since the place was pretty empty. After we were seated we looked at our menus for a good ten minutes or more and still had not gotten any service not even our drink order was taken. 

Still minutes later more people began to arrive three more tables were filled up just around us and as I kept glancing from the menu to the tables I realized two tables that were there after us already had drinks, one had chips and drinks and our table was still empty.

Its not real Mexican food and we wanted to try and it but since we got no service, not even acknowledged we got up and took our asses elsewhere. If your in Planet Hollywood I recommend heading to the Sandwich Of Earl and Chef Ramsay Burgr.
