I went there for lunch. 6/24/14  1:35 PM

The counter girl, Liz, was charming young lady, smiling, polite and a great example of customer service.

I had a the three piece combo, two breasts and a wing, mashed potatoes and corn on cob for sides, it comes with a small drink. $8.49. 

The service, at the counter, was great. If it was based on this, 4 stars.

The food was good. If it was based on this, 3 stars.

The restaurant was a mess. The ice dispenser on the soda machine had dumped all it's ice into the tray and onto the floor (it took awhile for that much ice to be dispensed). Since it's around a blind corner, I'm surprised no one was injured rounding the corner and slipping on the ice. It was a slip and fall suit, waiting to happen.  Every napkin dispenser in the place was empty. And there wasn't a clean table in the place, looked for the least dirty one. Did I mention it wasn't busy here?

What's the manager doing? Milling about smartly, behind the counter, basically accomplishing nothing, oblivious to everything going on around him. He's standing two feet away from two empty napkin dispensers, that were already open, with a new package of napkins next to them, did he fill them, no. Did he go into the restaurant to see the ice everywhere or the dirty tables, no. Whereas Liz was the epitamy of customer service, the manager was the antithesis of customer service. When a manager reaches the point they feel they are above their crew, no longer a part of the team, too good to assist with the work, disinterested in the condition of their store, they are no longer effective.

This is an unusual situation for me, where I would have given two more stars, had I used the drive-thru, instead of going into the store. My work truck is too big for the drive-thru, so that's not an option.

Okay, I'm done ranting. I just expect a place I'm eating at, to be clean. Possible exception a picnic, but even then I bring a clean blanket, if there's no table.
