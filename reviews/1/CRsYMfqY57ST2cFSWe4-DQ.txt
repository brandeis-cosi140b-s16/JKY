Walked in to a confusing layout / order system, and rude staff. After the ordeal of ordering and waiting completely too long for a burrito bowl. I ate, the food was average, not note worthy at all. The kicker to this all is the average, overpriced, and long waited food made me sick. 

In short if you want good food, good health, and a nice experience DO NOT EAT AT TACO Y TACO!
