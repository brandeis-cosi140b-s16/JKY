This used to be my favorite breakfast burrito place. Would make a long drive just to get these yummy burritos. They just changed to stop serving breakfast burritos & all breakfast at 10:30 am and are now closed on Sunday's & increased all their prices. People should at least know the new details before making the trek out here. Sad to see it go but I'll find another place. Maybe if they go back people will come back but these changes are not good.
