As far as the food goes, it's mediocre, fairly bland, odd textures at times, overcooked, and what is this red stuff? Where is the queso? 

But the big issue, SERVICE..

We walked in early one friday afternoon, only one other table besides ours was occupied. There were 3 waitresses on staff that day yet we waited to be seated. We ordered one beer each and finished it before our meal came. Someone from the kitchen brought it, and our waitress was over at the bar wiping the same spot for 15 minutes and zoning out. Never came to check on us or get us refills until I flagged her down about 10 minutes after we finished to ask for our bill. THEN she asks if we would like a refill. But let's not forget the stink eye she gave when she saw her tip. Sorry sweetie, maybe you should have tried earning it. You're lucky you got anything at all.
