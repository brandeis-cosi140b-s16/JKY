If I have to give a star I guess I will.

I believe you have to try to find at least one positive aspect out of every dining experience.  So lets start on a positive note. The staff at 32nd Cafe are very friendly and accommodating. They truly like to make their guests feel welcomed.  However, I think the server was thrown when she took our plates and there was very little food eaten.

Now for the not so pleseant aspects. The food at 32nd Cafe is very disappointing.  If it was possible to give no stars  I would however, that's not an option, so if  I have to give a star I guess I will give one.

The food at 32nd Cafe is poorly excuted and to be honest just has a bad taste. The salsa tastes like ketchup, and every entrée is smothered in the same bland-tasting sauce and covered in cheese. Covering entrées in cheese does not make the entree taste better. Bad tasting food is worse then food that lacks taste. There's nothing authentic or delicious on the menu.  It just wasn't good.
