This was the number one worst food I have ever had. he only thing we ordered that was edible was the queso. The waitress had virtually no personality. When she asked how the food was and we told her the chimi was horrible, her response was "are you ready for your check?" 

The chimi was to be shredded beef, but they brought me ground beef. I thought that since the waitress had completely vanished during our meal, I would try it. It had absolutely no seasoning. It was a flavorless tortilla wrapped around unseasoned ground beef. There was nothing else in it, including any hint of seasoning. I tried adding the rice, salsa, and queso, but nothing helped. My husband who can eat anything, could not eat this!

My son got a cheeseburger. It was dry and had no condiments. Of course we would have asked for some mayo if the waitress had ever come back. Since our drinks were empty, there was nothing with which he could choke the dry burger down. 

The men in my home are big eaters. Nobody finished anything, There was more food left than eaten. The waitress's complete indifference to the fact we were unsatisfied topped off the worst food experience we have ever had. We will never come back and will let everyone we know it is not worth the drive, let alone the money they would have to spend on over-priced food prepared and served by the most worthless staff I have ever encountered.
