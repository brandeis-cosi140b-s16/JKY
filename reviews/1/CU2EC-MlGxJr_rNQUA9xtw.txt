I ordered crane asda fries, they where so nasty , almost no meat and the meat that was on them was likes rocks very old and nasty dried up meat, I had to wait 20 min for the drive thru, so I came back today and spoke with the manager and she said since I thru away the fries there's nothing she can do for me I asked when the restaurant general manager would be in and she said she was, and that she can't stand cheap people like me trying to get free food! I asked for her franchise office number she kept my receipt and said she can't give it out and wrote down my info and said someone will call me, worse service ever! They need new management
