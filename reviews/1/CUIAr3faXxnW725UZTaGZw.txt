As a regular at the original Americas's Taco Shops on 7th ave and 7th St. I was excited about this location opening up in my neighborhood. However, I was really disappointed. 

First the menu is really confusing, unlike the original they have different sizes of chips and salsa...really??? 

The chips were also very stale and cold, along with the carne asada vampiro that had very little carne asada. 

Do yourself a favor and stick to the original locations!!! Either go to the one on 7 th street or 7th ave it worth the drive...Do NOT GO TO THIS location it was really bad!!
