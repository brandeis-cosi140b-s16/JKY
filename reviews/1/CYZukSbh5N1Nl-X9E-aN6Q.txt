Got an iced coffee here and it had a big bug in it. Left feedback and manager called me back saying there's no way it was from their store, basically called me a liar. Offered me a free iced coffee but told her I would never be drinking one again and that was that. So glad they r fine with losing a customer. Guess it's Starbucks across the street for now on, u get what u pay for
