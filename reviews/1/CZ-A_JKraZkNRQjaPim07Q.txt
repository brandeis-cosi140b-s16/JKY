I'm from out of town and I love Mexican food, so this place was a big disappointment. The employees were friendly but the food was sub par. The so called Mexican beans tasted like they came out of a Campbell s can and sorry to say the Mexican rice was dry and the worst I have ever tasted. Maybe I caught them on a bad day. Won't be back.
