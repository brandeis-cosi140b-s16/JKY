little confused on the outstanding reviews. went there over a year ago (got enchilada's) and our second time there today. i will say warm cozy atmosphere and no overhead harsh lighting was the absolute best and one of the reasons i wanted to go back. it stopped there. service was just ok. house margarita just okay and considering the cuisine it should be outstanding and trademark to the venue. food served on plates so hot (tamale's) that eating your meal is a job versus enjoyment because you have to let every bite cool on your fork before you actually consume it. my husband ordered brisket tacos and i had one of them. every bite was chock full of fat. after the third bite and swallowing it all i was ill and had to spit it out in my hand and put it on my plate. i was chewing on more fat than i cared for in every bite. i'm fully aware it can have some fat but this was beyond horrible.  and lastly, i ordered the tamale's and i can handle spicy food but this is ridiculous. the food is sooo spicy that it takes away from what could be totally wonderful and hearty flavors. again, it was our second time and i think this is the theme to all their dishes. very spicy and temperature hot beyond so beware. i don't know how a food critic would commend this. the spice in the enchilada and tamale dishes is so hot that you can't appreciate the natural flavors that are there to begin with.
