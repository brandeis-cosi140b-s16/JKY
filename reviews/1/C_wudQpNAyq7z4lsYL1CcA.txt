Carne Asade fries...HORRIBLE! Some fries were undercooked and some were burnt. The carne asada had NO FLAVOR! Beef tacos...meat was super duper dry and the shells were stale. Chicken was bland with, again, NO FLAVOR! Speaking of no flavor, the salsas, green and red, as well as the guacamole, needs some EXTRA ATTENTION!
