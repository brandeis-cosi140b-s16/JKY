I wish I could give my opinion on the food but unfortunately we never made it past the chips. It was a slow Tuesday night and there were only a few people in the restaurant. We never had a server come to our table. Waited 15 mins and nothing??? We did get chips, which were from a bag and not fresh. The salsa was also not very stellar. We walked out without an acknowledgement from anyone  Never going back
