The absolute worst burrito I've had in my life. Ordered the veggie option assuming it would actually contain veggies but instead it was full of refried beans and raw zucchini. A meat option was also ordered and there again no meat was to be had, but yet again a pile of canned - tasting refried beans.  If I could give 0 stars I would!
