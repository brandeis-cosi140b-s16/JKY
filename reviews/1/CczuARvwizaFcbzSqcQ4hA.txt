Great concept, but it was poorly executed. I was really unimpressed, especially since The Cosmopolitan houses so many amazing restaurants.

I had dinner here with a party of 8. With the prices they had, I thought I'd be in for some amazing fusion cuisine...

Queso Fundido - $10 literally just melted, buttery cheese. I can't believe we paid 10 bucks for this!
Papas Fritas w/ Mole - $7 Was interesting at first, but then no one wanted to finish it.
Setas (Wild Mushroom Guacamole Tacos) - $4.50/taco I got two. I didn't even want to finish my 2nd one, so I gave it to my boyfriend.
Cochinita (Yucatan-style BBQ Pork Tacos) - $5.50/taco My friends said it was okay. Nothing special.

We didn't feel satisfied after our meal.
Small portions. Super overpriced. Lousy flavors. AVOID!
