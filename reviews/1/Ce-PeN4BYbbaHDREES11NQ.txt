Disappointing  food was very horrible !!! Rice hard n dry , beans tasted rotten,  red sauce was sweet !!! Taco not crispy saggy over all food was disgusting in general !!! Then " Anita " became mad when I told her the food wasn't good . will never  ever ever return to this wanna be Mexican restaurant again !!!!!! Try Sylvia's La Canasta
