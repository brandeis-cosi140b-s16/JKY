We were happy to find a Mexican cantina so close to home. We enjoy good Mexican food.
As we found the right door and entered, we were impressed with atmosphere. Big mistake, don't judge the book by the cover.  It was a Friday about 5pm, so it was not at all busy. We were seated at a table and waited for service, and I do mean waited , about 15 minutes before they came with chips and salsa.  Again may I say there were very few people dining at this early evening. When we did order the service again very slow. When the food came it was very dry and over cooked. We needed water to wash the food down. We did not feel the food was acceptable . The food was very expensive, I don't mind paying for good food, but this was NOT good. Our friend order the dry chicken and that night she went to ER with food poisoning, go figure. We won't be back.
