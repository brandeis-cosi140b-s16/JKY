Garbage! Don't waste your time or money. Went on a week night with out 4 year old daughter and got sat right by the bar, drunks were everywhere, 2 at the bar and 2 tables near us. Staff was rude and not helpful. Spoke to the manager who was even worse, apparently our bad experience was our fault.  Food was the worst I've ever had, check took forever to come, my husband was in the service industry and I manage a retail store and I realize that people have off/bad days but this was the entire establishment. We have over the years lived off of tips and NEVER have not left a tip. Our server did not get a tip, I tried to explain the reason to the manager who could care less. Buy a frozen meal at Winco and save your sanity
