Villa's, i'm not sure what the hell happened, I use to enjoy your food, it use to be clean, and you use to actually have a value. well not anymore. sadly I went in for some thrifty ice cream today. for what ever reason thrifty has the bast mint chip to me, i wanted 3 scoops, what I god was a pathetic excuse for 1 maybe 1.5 scoops if you stretched it. I don't know whats going on here but it needs to change its getting ran into the ground. not sure if its a management problem or owner problem but i'm not coming back.
