I've been to the other barrio location on 16th street and Thomas quite recently and I was blown away. I wish I could say that about this place. I ordered the chile relleno, which was highly recommended by the waiter as being delicious. When my food arrived i was quite disappointed by the lack of flavor and extremely small portion. I would think for 23$ it would come with a side. :(
