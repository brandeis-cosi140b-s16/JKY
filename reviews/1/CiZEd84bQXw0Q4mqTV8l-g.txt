Chipotle is my favorite restaurant and I have never had a problem. However this location was incredibly rude to me. I ordered from the app. It was due at 2 pm and I arrived at 1:52. I informed the female cashier I was here, knowing I was early, but just in case they had it ready already. She checked my order and rudely said "you're 15 minutes early, so you're going to have to wait". Yes, I was fully aware I had to wait, but I was not "15 minutes early" as she so rudely tried to tell me. I usually pay ahead of time at all other locations so I figured I'd pay and wait. The woman fixing the burrito rolled her eyes and told me she'd start the order.  Also, the restaurant wasn't even busy, and I in no way made it seem like I was in that much of a rush. When I have to sit and wait for my order to be completed, while I know the whole prep line is annoyed at their customer, it doesn't make for nearly a pleasant experience. I won't be coming back to this location and will gladly take my business to another location.
