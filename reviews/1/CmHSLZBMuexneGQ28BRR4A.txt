What happened here????   I've been coming here for many years - though not so much recently.  I've never had to look on yelp at macayo's because I've always been happy.   Holy guacamole this place has taken a turn for the worse.   The fajitas were soggy- how you do that is beyond me.   I like to get the build your own nachos and they just disappointed me.  Not a lot of flavor.  I used to love this place.  We'll never come back.  This place is turning into old yeller.   Guacamole not good at all.   Everything we ordered from the kitchen should have stayed in the kitchen.  We ask our server for an manager who was busy and sent another waiter over to us. 

Yeah that solved the problem.  Our flour tortillas were kfc extra crispy.   We asked the dude if the cook was drunk and his reply was no - he's very sober.   I'm glad the server was the cook's AA sponsor and knew that specific information.   Ladies and gentlemen the food is terrible but our cook is sober.   I kind of like him better when he was drinking.  

I'm humming a queen song right now.   Dum dum dum another one bites the dust.
