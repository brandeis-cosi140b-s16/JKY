Update: Management called to appologize for all th RATS running around and said he'd send me a coupon for our next visit. It never came. Surprised? Not really.
    
RATS!!! The wife and I stopped for quatro de Mayo and were halfway through our Quesadilla when I looked to my left and a BIG rat was sitting under the table next to us. As soon as i made a gesture towards him he ran back into the outdoor stainless bar/storage or whatever it is. OK, she was freaked out but I said, "hey, we're on the patio so &%#$ happens and told the waitress when she came back who was also a bit freaked out especially when I told her how big it was. This was no freakin' mouse. A few minutes later our food came out and as we were engaged in the act of eating... here came another big freaking rat who ran right under our table and out hole in the wall. I once again told the server who was a bit freaked out and started looking around as she went back to wherever she came from. Never did any management staff come out to apologize or maybe offer to move us or something so we finished most of our meal and hit the road. I've been frequenting Macayo's for years but this and the fact that the food quality isn't consistent has ensured we won't frequent this establishment any time soon. We also planm to let everyone we know about this. I've lived here all my life so that's quite a few people
