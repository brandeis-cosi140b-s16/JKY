I ate on this location the other night.  I have eaten at various chipotles across the country for years.  Anyhow I order the normal salad with brown rice extra steak guac, salas with lots of peppers and onions.  After a few minutes I began to feel a burning and numbing sensation on my tongue as if the food was extra spicy which it wasn't because they only used the mild salsa.  I then noticed the steak tasted very tinny.  I stopped eating the food immediately.  All night my mouth felt tinny and bizarre.  Unfortunately worse things started happening which I won't describe.  Not sure if the meat was undercooked or spoiled but it tasted very weird.  I will never eat at this location again.
