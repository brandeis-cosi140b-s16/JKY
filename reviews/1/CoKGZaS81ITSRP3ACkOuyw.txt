Want food poisoning several times over? Then this is the place to gamble! With the last few times my family and I have been here over this past year, we've won the sickness almost every time.

When this location first started, it was great. I've been a fan of Filibertos for years, and when this opened, I was grateful. But recently, things have gone awry and we no longer go here because of the horrible problems we receive after we've eaten. Along with that, they've also gotten our orders wrong a few times. We once received a lengua (cow tongue) taco instead of our ordered beef taco. I'm disappointed in this establishment.
