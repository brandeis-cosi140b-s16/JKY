Boring menu. I've come here quite a few times and have been disappointed each time. First of all, what Mexican restaurant thinks it's OK to charge for chips and salsa? Second of all, who puts 7 chips around a bowl full of salad and calls that a taco salad? Small portions, not much to choose from, slow service. But, the guacamole and lime margaritas are both really good. I'll give them that. I could continue with my review but you get the idea. Hopefully.
