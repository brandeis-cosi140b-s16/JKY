Just stopped in for dinner with a party of eight. While waiting, we asked to have a table cleaned from the last party. They came and cleaned the table, but missed cleaning the seats, which were loaded with rice, beans, and other gunk. When we let the guy at the counter know we were still waiting to sit down because he had forgotten to clean the seats, he replied "my manager won't let us clean the seats". I asked if he was kidding and he confirmed that he wasn't. He told me that if we wanted it cleaned, we'd have to clean it ourselves. We were so glad we hadn't ordered yet! We walked out and will never even consider eating there again. If I could I would give them a negative star rating...but I have to give 1 star just for it to post.
