Looks promising on the outside, and the food looks appetizing but BEWARE - they are SLOW as molasses.

We sat down around 1pm thinking we could easily eat a meal before our flight at 2pm. The food hit the table at 10 minute to 2pm. We had to shovel it into take out containers and run to the terminal. You would think that an airport restaurant would understand time constraints... 

The food was okay, nothing spectacular - but not bad. The veggies & fruits were fresh. The nachos were nothing to write home about. As mentioned by others, the music is horrendous.
