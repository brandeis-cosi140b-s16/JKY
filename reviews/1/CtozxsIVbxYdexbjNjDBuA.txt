Sadly, I have nothing good to say.  I have been to places with much better food, service and value in Charlotte.  The tacos you receive are about the size of a large cookie and they are $3-$4 EACH...and that does not include any sides.  No beans, no rice.  Nothing.  They are more along the lines of what you get on a dollar taco night somewhere.  They were cold - not that tacos are ever served extremely warm, but these were cold in a not good way.  Unlike any other mexican themed restaurant I have been to, you pay for the chips and salsa.  What I find more confusing, rather than frustrating, is that they GIVE you two bottles of salsa.  But when the chips come to the table, they contain two dishes of the same salsa.  It makes no sense.  Let me get on to the presentation....what you order is served family style.  6 of ordered tacos, some with special requests.  Instead of being served individually, the server points out what is what on the giant pizza tray of tacos.  The special order ones had toothpicks in them.  So there were were, sliding our tacos off the tray and onto our plates.  I could go on, but I just won't go back.  I had a sweet tea and 3 tacos and my total with tip was $18.  THAT IS RIDICULOUS.  Good luck Bakersfield.  You are a rip off in every way.
