This place is closed, has been for a while now, supposed to be opening back up next month as a greek restaurant, yet they are still offering the $10 for $20 deal, and it comes up as a special deal on Groupon too.  Something stinks here.  Methinks the owner is getting some cash for this deal, maybe to pay for his new restaurant?  If you don't believe me, call the number listed on the address, it even tell you this.
