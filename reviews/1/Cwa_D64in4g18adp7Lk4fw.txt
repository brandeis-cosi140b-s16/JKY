I have been going to this location for years. Today was a bad one. My wife ordered a bean and cheese enchilada style with extra cheese and extra sauce that we paid extra for, and they didn't put extra nothing on there. When i asked for a little cup of enchilada sauce he said he put it on there, but there was barely any. I asked for a little extra he said he will charge me. I said you you already charged me. He said he wouldn't give me any extra sauce unless i paid for it. I said i come in here allot and i will take nut business elsewhere if he didn't give me sauce. He told me go ahead he didn't care. Wtf really. I will never eat at this location again, i will just go to RIO MIRAGE CAFE INSTEAD.  Screw these unprofessional assholes.
