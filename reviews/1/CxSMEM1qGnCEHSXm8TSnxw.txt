This is the single worst Mexican restaurant I have ever been to in my life.  

I ate here 2-3 years ago and I still tell people how freaking terrible it was.  

I was staying at the hotel (great hotel and resort in general) and my friend was starving.  Instead of grabbing a cab and heading out to Tempe I was shanghaied into eating at this abomination.  My other friend who is the nicest most mellow person I have ever met who never complains about anything, pushed his plate away after a single bite agreeing with me that this was by far the worst Mexican food he had ever tasted.

The service was tolerable but nothing special and you are seated on a nice patio, but outside of those minor triumphs this place was an unmitigated disaster of a meal.  

I swear on my deathbed I might remember how horrible my enchilada taco combo plate was and think it may have been the one regret I had in my life.
