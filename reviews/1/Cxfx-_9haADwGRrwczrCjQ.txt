While the service was fast... My meal reminded me of  a school lunch's "Taco Day" where the food is made with the the least amount of flavor and uses the cheapest possible ingredients. The beans tasted tinny like they just came out of a #10 can, and the rice tasted like instant. My tacos were generously filled, and they served a LOT of food for the money, but when it has no flavor, and I find the majority of my meal inedible - it's not worth it.

Like another reviewer mentioned, it didn't even smell like Mexican food inside. With so many local, authentic , less expensive Mexican Taquerias, I can't imagine ever going back. I was really hoping for better,  since I drive past it nearly everyday.
