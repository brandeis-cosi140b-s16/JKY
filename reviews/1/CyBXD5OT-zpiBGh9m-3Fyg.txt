I love del taco but why is this one different?The people are courteous but it doesn't make up for the food.Every time I go I have to wait about 5 mins in front after I go through the drive thru line.Every time I get a quesadilla it is old and cold and is more like a cheese crisp.Oh well I could take it home and give it to my dog as a rubber toy....at least it smells like cheese so for that I give it at least a star.
