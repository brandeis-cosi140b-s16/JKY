Never again will I go. I believe I went 3 times over 4 years. Each time got worse. The food is over priced, zero flavor. Boiled chicken in the enchiladas with a sprinkle of cheese. Their salsa and chips is the best thing they offer. Complained about horrible greasy nasty ground beef enchilada (inedible) and was not comped! Go to Cilantros!
