We were just at Gallo Blanco a month ago and, as always, enjoyed the food. My husband and I went in today and did not realize that this place was a different restaurant. There had been ongoing construction for a while to revamp the place so I figured that's why is was slightly different when we walked in. It wasn't until our snooty waiter told us it was now Cafe Tranquilo and looked flustered when we were caught off guard. Our beers took forever to get to our table and when my husband's burrito arrived it was tiny! My pork belly taco was dry, the fish taco was yummy. I left feeling sad because we absolutely loved Gallo Blanco. It was our go to spot when we wanted tasty carne asada. We will not be going back. Gallo Blanco RIP :,(
