I've been here twice and both times I was very disappointed. I ordered the Cobb salad (vegetarian) and I emphasized that I couldn't eat meat. When my salad arrived at the table there was meat on it and she didn't even notice! I had to tell her and she didn't even seem sympathetic. The waitress brought me a new salad and the lettuce seemed wet and there was water in my salad dish. To start, the chips were cold and didn't taste fresh. The wait to get the food took extremely long and the waitress seemed like she hated her job. After giving it a second try I will definitely not be going back.
