I belive the reason for poor reviews is simple,  poor quality of ingredients. The only decent thing on my plate was the chicken taco. I didn't realize they were charging me $3.99 for the bland guacamole. My server was on her cell phone when she delivered my salsa. I can see why thethe want a soul in the place
