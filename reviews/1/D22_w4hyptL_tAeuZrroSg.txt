This one is from a 100% Mexican.
So I seen this place, and I thought I would give it a try. My honey order the carne asada tacos, and I order the carne asada burrito, the carne was dry, like it was cooked and set apart, they don't cook it right when you ordered, is cook before. I had the "hot" salsa, it was just water, the burrito was flavorless. Just stick to what you know. I wish I had gone to Taco Bell. Believe me, I'm not going back to this place.
