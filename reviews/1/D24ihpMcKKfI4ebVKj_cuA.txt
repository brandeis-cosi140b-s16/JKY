We went to the Renaissance Festival and didn't want to stop and get fast food so we googled local restaurants and there weren't many choices.  We stopped here and that was a huge mistake.  The place wasn't very busy but it took almost an hour to get our food.  When it finally arrived, one plate was wrong and my son never received his.  The waitress blamed the slow service on the diabetic cook.  The lady who rung us up said the ktichen wasn't slow and proceeded to tell us our waitress didn't even put our entire order in after all.  We heard other tables complaining about the service too, many of them appeared to be locals.  Sad that in a local, small place like this the team cannot even get along and shifts the blame back and forth.  Besides the service, I tasted nothing special about the food and would never return.
