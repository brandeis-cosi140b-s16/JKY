This Chipotle leaves a lot to be desired!  The service is horrible because they will get the order wrong 3 out of 4 
times!  Today was the best though I ordered a bowl and said no lettuce and they put it on.  I told them again no lettuce and they put it on again!  3 times they got it wrong till I finally gave up and took it.  I complained to the girl at checkout and she said I'm not the manager!   Really!!
