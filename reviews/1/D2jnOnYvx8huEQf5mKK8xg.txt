Took a long time to be greeted, chips and salsa took forever. Sever was polite but forgot to bring lemons I asked for and the food was just okay. App was good, but tacos were not what I expected from a "Mexican" rest. refried beans have a different taste as well as rice. Not the most horrible experience but is definitely pick some where else.
