Was looking forward to eating here while in Vegas as it had good reviews and we love michoacan style food. This was way different. I didn't eat my food and my husband was disappointed too. I ordered carnitas a la coca cola and it was like BBQ pulled pork to me. Hubby had chile Colorado and didn't like the chile they had on it. We were bummed thought we found a gem in Vegas but turned out not to be out style
