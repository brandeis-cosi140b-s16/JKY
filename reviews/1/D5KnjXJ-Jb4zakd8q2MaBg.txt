Incredibly slow service (25 minutes to get 3 basic tacos) and tacos are average at best.  My batch was very salty, but seeing the wait and the relative absence of attention to customers, I didn't bother to do anything about it. The menu is very short and routine extras like added cheese or salsa require added payment. Maybe the other yelpers had an exceptional experience with the burritos, but this is my review based on what I sampled.  There is just nothing redeeming to explain the level of loyalty this location garners.  There is no indoor seating;  you cant eat outdoors on the provided plastic picnic table on a sunny day without risking a skin burn!.  On the inside you face a server who takes your order from behind a grill; there are at most 4-5 plastic chairs to sit on while you wait.  Reminds me of a traditional western jailhouse except someone is actually taking food orders.
