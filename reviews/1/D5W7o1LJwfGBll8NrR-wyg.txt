Went through the drive through for lunch a few weeks back. Had been craving a carne asada burrito. 

It took longer then I expected for a drive through, no big deal.

Tasted pretty good, I was impressed. Always glad to find a quick burrito place for those occasional cravings.

Later that day went to dinner with some friends. Before I ate anything at dinner something in the belly wasn't feeling right. Started feeling bloated and slightly nauseated. Left early and went home.

Arrived home, ran to the bathroom. Didn't leave for 6 hours. Not going to go into detail but I was sick as hell for the next 36 hours. Both ends.

Never again.

Unless you're 8lbs from your ideal weight and don't care how you get there, avoid this place at all costs.

Food poisoning is awful.
