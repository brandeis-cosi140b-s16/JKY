No Bueno. Our service was terrible for a multitude of reasons. It took way too long to be greeted. When we were, we got our drinks quickly. Fast forward to an hour later when we still did NOT have our food we ordered!! Yes I said an hour!! We were told that the ticket machine ran out of paper and our order didn't print. Strangely, our table was the only table this happened to. Everyone seated around us came and ate and left. Part of our party actually got up and left too because the wait and the excuses were so bad. Two of us stayed and tried to see it through. Well....the food came out after the manager apologized and to make things worse, an order was wrong. The manager offered nothing but an apology. Never, never, never going back!! Adios cinco de mayo!
