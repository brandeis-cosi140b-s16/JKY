This was my worse experience ever   I like to eat out frequently and thought I would try this new restaurant.  They don't know what real Mexican food is.  I could buy the same cans at the store for less.  Even the margaritas were nasty. Service slow for as many as seem to be there.  I want Mexican food I will go somewhere else.  Sorry don't think I will ever come back.
