I went to Moe's today for lunch with some co-workers, the people working behind the counter were very unfriendly and almost downright snippy, totally not the kind of people you want interacting with your customers. Food was decent, overpriced for what you get, in my opinion. We work nearby but unfortunately we will not be back, there are many other places where you'll be greeted with a smile.
