I was excited for a new taco shop in town, WAS. We ate there a couple times when they first opened and it was just OK, both other spots in town were better. When I saw they had expanded, I figured they found there stride. BOY WAS I WRONG. Tacos, how do mess up tacos? Gross fat chunks for one, weird flavor like it had gone sideways.

Don't even bother.
