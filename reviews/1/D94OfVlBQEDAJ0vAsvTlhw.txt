We avoid this location as a rule, frequently traveling 15 minutes out of the way because we know that any other location in the valley can make up the difference just by serving at their normal rate. They seem clueless and lackadaisical and rarely even mention the obvious lengthy delay that is included with every visit. 

It absolutely boggles my mind that these reviews continue to mount and nothing changes. There have been no responses from the company nor the management. Something needs to give, but sadly for us, sometimes it's the only TB option on short notice. I guess it's time to yelp corporate. 

What a bad example they set.
