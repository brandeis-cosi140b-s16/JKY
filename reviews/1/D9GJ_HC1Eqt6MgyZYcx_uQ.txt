Oh how I wish I didn't have to give them a star. It was so loud we left without ordering. The echo just maximized the hysterical shrieking from the hyena in the front. There was no place to escape that terrible screaming that actually frightened my son and made him cry. I wouldn't go there again if someone offered to buy my drinks all night. This place says bar and grill out front, it would be better served to just say bar. It is a dive! We stopped because it looks like a restaurant, it's not. The manager was no use, the place was not clean and we didn't stay even long enough to get our drinks. I will never go there again.
