The sign on the door says they close at 9 pm. The hours posted on Yelp says they close at 9 pm and we get there at 8:30 and the doors are not locked. We go inside and the the lady mopping the floor tells us they are closed. This was extremely disappointing since we had driven from Glendale to eat there. Unfortunately we will not be returning and we will not recommend this restaurant to anyone ever again. Because they chose to waste my time I will go out of my way to share my experience with anyone willing to listen.
