I love chipotle but just had the WORST experience. The line out the door is normal but is it normal to have two Chipotle employees try to cut you in line?!? Then the chicken was almost out so my chicken tacos barely got any while she scooped a ton of what was left on the employee behind me then proceeded to finally finish putting some on mine. She literally stopped putting meat on mine to put some on the girls behind me and then finished mine...and I ended up with barely any so I asked for more and they got annoyed. So I said forget it and vowed not to return to that location. Sucks because I love it but horrible customer service is a deal breaker for me...
