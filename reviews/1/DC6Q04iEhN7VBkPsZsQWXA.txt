I  went to Chipotle this past Saturday 11/15/14. I ordered the bowl with brown rice, black beans and steak. The steak was as tough as leather and my teeth couldn't break it down. The steak was also bland in taste and overall my food was warm, not hot. I did not  have a good food experience at this Chipotle and I will not be back.
