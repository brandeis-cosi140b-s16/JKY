We've given this place a solid try. The few times we've gone the food was good but the service is really bad! Mgmt needs to hire and get the staff some help! 3 people working (2 up front and 1 cook) a lunch rush is totally unacceptable and they were out of everything! Not fair to the 3 people working and for the line of people that had to wait way too long. Get it together CT!
