Some of the people have real bad attitudes. Especially one of their cooks. They hay the al pastor burritos on special but the meat looked old and dry. I saw the cook take some fresh out of the grill and i told the cashier i wanted the fresh one. The cook with a cocky bad attitude said that the special price was for the one out in the counter. WHAT!!!!!! I questioned them and said that made no sense. At the end the cashier said to mot worry i would get the fresh meat...i get home and it seemed like the cook had the guts to and pull out all the old gross tastung meat. True dissapointment, dont go here yelpers.
