WARNING!!! 
  This place has completely changed. The only buffet they have now is the hot dog buffet with frys and drink that's it. The all you can eat sandwiches are not included for any price. You now have to pay for each individual sandwich. Also, the crab and prime rib is gone completely. Of course, before I came tonight I checked there website and nothing has changed there. That is misleading as hell in my opinion. This is my first time here and I won't be coming back. The hot dogs are all cold and the buns are kinda hard. Not good. I will say the frys are very good and the guy behind the counter definitely felt bad about the changes. The service has been excellent. He gave me a free piece of chicken to try and make up for the changes. 
    It was explained that they were bought out recently and the new owners were going to bring back some of the buffets but he didn't know which ones. I recommend calling ahead before you come to find out.
