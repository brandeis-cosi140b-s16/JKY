I for one do not understand how this place has 4 stars. Very slow service bland tasteless food served cold and that was every dish we received. 
Street tacos with chicken let me tell you what you do to make these go to Costco buy the cold drilled chicken and a bag of tortillas cut them into 2 inch circles throw the cold chicken and some brown shredded lettuce at it and you hVe Manuela chicken street tacos don't hear them up that would be to easy,  now the soup, take all the leftovers of everyone's plates throw them in a bowl with meatballs and water but remember no heat.
Again no clue why the high ratings this is close to the worst Mexican restaurant I have ever been to skip it
