I sigh as a write this....we went for food. It wasn't very good. It wasn't bad, just boring, overpriced, and salty. I suppose the name of the restaurant should've been an indicator.

The pina colada was meh.

I wished I was either at a dive Mexican restaurant or somewhere like El Zocalo. Anywhere would've been better really.

It was irritating paying over forty dollars for two people for such a disappointing meal.  Next time I'll check Yelp first.
