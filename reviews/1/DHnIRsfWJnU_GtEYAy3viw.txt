I came here recently, hoping the experience would be similar to previous dinners when the space was owned by Tia Rosas, however I left extremely disappointed. The service was terrible, waiting over 30 minutes for water or any type of acknowledgement from a waiter, the food was of average quality when it finally arrived, and then when attempting to pay we were told it was impossible to split the check in half on our bill. We attempted to straighten out these issues but our waitress had the worst attitude and the manager was not very accommodating. We definitely won't be returning.
