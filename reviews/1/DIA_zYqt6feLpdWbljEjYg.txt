The food WAS great - But suddenly they decided to update the menu.  Happy hour went from Best in Vegas to AWFUL food and BAD drink specials. What the HECK happened?  The turkey chopped salad was amazing, NOW the turkey is completely different and the entire menu has been tweaked.  Dinner was bad and I went to Happy Hour and it was WORSE.  Bartender told me that I could complain to the manager, but Hard Rock really follows up on emails and YELP.  THe entire hotel is dying a slow death - no need to take the restaurant with you!
