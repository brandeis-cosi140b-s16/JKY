All the reviews for this place (positive ones, at least) involve copious amounts of alcohol.  If I have to be intoxicated to enjoy a food, it just must not be very good.  Sorry, but Roberto's beef tastes like horse meat when you're sober.  It's all gray and hard... kinda reminds me of that scene from the movie Animal House when they scared that horse to death and had to chop it up to fit it through the door.  Now I know where the poor creature ended up!  The place was also really filthy.
