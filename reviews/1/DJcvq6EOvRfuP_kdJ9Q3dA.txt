Rude staff! I would have this place shut down if I could have my way! I was there last night with my partner of 3 years. We are both beautiful women and I do not believe my vanity should cripple me! So when a bar tender proceeded to video tape my partner and I exchanging a loving kiss like any other couple would.I asked him to stop taping us and ofcourse I was angry!!!! How dare anyone have the audacity to do that in my face. The following event is even more disturbing. My partner and I were then forcefully removed from the venue by 6 bouncers. 6! Ridiculous.
