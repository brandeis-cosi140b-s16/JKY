The green corn tamales are hands down the most delicious things I have ever eaten. Mind Blowing!

But that is the one and only good thing I can say about this place. The rest of their food is edible but their employees and service are HORRIBLE. 

My co-workers and I ordered $70 worth of food from El Molino and noticed one Item was missing. Upon calling the restaurant, I got argued with, yelled at, and accused of stealing by the delivery driver who stated he was also the owner. Who steals a taco salad?! 

El Molino - You have lost a loyal client. I will miss the tamales.
