Saturday 12-19-15, reservation's for 20 people. Rehearsal Dinner, made 30 days earlier and confirmed day of the reservation. Beyond epic fail. Sat down at 9:15pm while watching Management allowing there Friends and Family members. What a joke. ZERO Management Skills. Owners should look into management on shift that night. What a bunch of jokers. Doubt we will be back. Food has always been great and is why we choose this establishment. What a shame. Please correct your management issues with not following protocol. Shame Shame Shame
