I was a frequent costumer here at least once a week. I can't believe how downhill this place has gone. Tacos are fried a head of time and sit for who knows how long. Chile rea√±os don't exist anymore apearently and everything I get is cold by the time I'm home..... I live on durango and blue diamond. I will never be going back to this sorry excuse for a restaurant. There is a place in the Sinclair gas station on rainbow that is amazing for anyone reading this and the Mexican food is 10000x better that here. I will highly suggest you drive the extra 5 mins for a better meal. Hopefully this review will make the lazy cooks get there stuff together in don tortaco
