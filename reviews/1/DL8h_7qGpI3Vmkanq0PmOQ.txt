I can't imagine coming back. I have been a couple of times and really don't get the good reviews. There is so much better and for less! But today helped me decide to review. I called ahead to see what was on things. I asked about the nachos and the fajitas. I was told that the fajitas came with guac and sour cream so I ordered them. I go pick them up and not one person smiled at me. There was one other customer and she got no smiles either. When I paid I did get a thank you but still no smile. I paid and waited for my food. There were no straws so I asked nicely for one and was given a look of hate and finally got my straw. how dare I ask for a straw for the $2+ 20oz sprite I ordered. Anywho I go back to work with my food from the angry place and open it up. I figure maybe this will be awesome! Yea no. First of all no salsa, guac, or sour cream to season the lackluster fajitas. And on top of it they give you one tortilla. for fajitas! 

So I call. The girl was not that friendly, not that apologetic, and says I will get 20% off my next visit. I work in a huge call center and will make sure that nobody I know goes there so yea probably not going to be using that 20% off coupon. What I want is my $11 bucks back for this unseasoned pile of beans, rice, and chicken.  But thanks anyway...
