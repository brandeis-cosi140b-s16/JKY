Had a pretty bad experience, and we didn't even get to eat there! 

We checked in: two adults and a not-yet-walking toddler. I specifically said 2 and a high chair. I saw the hostess write "3" in her sheet. We chose first available seating. We were told the wait is 25 minutes. 

A few minutes later, our pager started buzzing, and I hope it's a fair assumption that we were next to be seated. So we made our way to the host's desk and we were told we'll be in a booth with no high chair. We said we need a high chair, so the hostesses put us back on the list. 

We waited I think at least 20 more minutes, baby started fussing and we're very hungry at this point. When I asked how much longer it would take for us to be seated, I was told there were 6 other parties in front of us! But wait I thought when our pager buzzed the first time that we were next at that point, and we were waiting for the next available table! I guess they can argue that all available tables at the time were booths, but I don't comprehend why we were told there were 6 parties ahead of us. Did they put us back at the end of the line? So we left, we are not putting up with this BS.
