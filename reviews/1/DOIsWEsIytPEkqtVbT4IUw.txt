The biggest waste of money.   Had been hearing about this place for a while and finally gave it a try on this past Friday (9/4).   We got the buffalo chicken nachos.   Mostly covered in ranch or blue cheese dressing, we are not sure which.   Service was slow, atmosphere was nothing to brag about and food was awful.    They state they make the chips, they must make them weeks before.  Ours were incredibly stale.      Won't got back any time soon, the pear margarita was ok.   However, there are plenty of other bars to drink at with much better food for the price.    I can't even give this place one star, however it made me in order to post this
