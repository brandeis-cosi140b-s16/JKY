What happened! I haven't been here in a year or so.  I saw a coupon on restaurant.com, so I decided to revisit. There were no Mexicans in the kitchen, but I decided to give the Indian guy the benefit of the doubt (hoping that maybe somebody taught him well). I paid for my order using a credit card.  He handled my money with the same gloved hands that he used to make someone's order. I got my card back with enchilada sauce on it.  I observed him as he made my order. Nothing went on the grill. Everything was put in the microwave. I was scared to eat my burrito because the people sitting at the table behind me barely ate their food.  They left with plates that were darn near full of food...looked like dry shredded beef tacos (that was a sign). The potatoes in my breakfast burrito had the skin on them, which made the burrito gritty, and it was bland. I was so hungry when I got there, and it just messed up everything for me. Yuck!
