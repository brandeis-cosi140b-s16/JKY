Today I ate here and the beans were way too salty to eat and the rice was almost the same, but a little more tolerable. Wanted to send it back, but my husband insisted that I let it go. 

Also, one of the worker's had a child running around the restaurant ( about 5 years old), and he was touching everything ( silverware, napkins, toothpicks) it was horrible!! The child was climbing on the front counter and running back and forth and sliding on the floor. 

I may give the place another try in the future because I have had good food here in the past. Sorry Filiberto's :(
