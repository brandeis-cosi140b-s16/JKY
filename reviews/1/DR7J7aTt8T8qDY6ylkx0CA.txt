I got a deal on travelzoo.com for my recent trip to Las Vegas. I thought it was a good deal...2 entrees and 2 margaritas plus this restaurant was on the strip at the Forum Shops at Caesars Palace. When we were seated and greeted by our server, we mentioned that we had the travelzoo deal. Once we said that, I think our service went downhill... 

--He asked if we wanted our margaritas on rocks or frozen...we asked for frozen. What did we get??? Margaritas on rocks! 

--I ordered the carne fajita platter. What did I get??? A chicken plate! 

I mean c'mon! Every other table got salsa and chips, it took us a good 5 min to flag down our server to ask for it and to tell him he got our orders wrong. What worried me the most was that it only took them a few minutes to bring out my carne asada platter. I would think that my meat would take longer to cook...I guess not!!! 

It frustrates me when restaurants offer travelzoo deals, groupons, etc and their service changes once you mention it! Just because you pay for a fraction of the meal doesn't mean I should get a fraction of the service. It's ridiculous. No matter what kind of deal I get, I always tip to the full price--so I don't understand why these businesses freak out and think they don't need to provide good service.
