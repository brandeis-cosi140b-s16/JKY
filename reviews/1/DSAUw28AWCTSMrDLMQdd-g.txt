Well, I've just watched this particular El Pollo Loco (#6043) run right through the Restaurant Life-Cycle (TM).  A little over two years ago (I think), when this location opened, I was in hog heaven.  I loved the place:  convenient, fast, clean, and good.  Fast forward to today, and I'm not going to eat at this particular location any more.  The last three times I've been here, the chicken has been over-cooked (dry), the service has been slow, and the store has been dirty.  This last time, the place was so dirty I had to go up to the counter and ask for a wet cloth to clean off the tables.  It took a while to get the attention of the manager, and when I did, she said she'd send someone out to clean the tables in a bit.  When that person did come out, I asked her to clean the table and watched as she sullenly made some half-hearted swipes with the cloth.  Sigh.  If they had just given me the cloth, I would have rather cleaned the place myself and done a better and faster job without the attitude.  If the management and staff of a restaurant can't be bothered to keep the place clean for their customers, then I can't be bothered to eat there.  I'm switching to another location which, though further away and more crowded, I've never had a problem with.
