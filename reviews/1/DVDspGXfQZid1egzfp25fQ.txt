Just don't go here. Beans were from a can and horribly salty - I mean real salty, unbearably so. All my friends were disappointed, and even joked how you know somethings wrong when they won't eat beans (since they're Mexican). 

I ordered the taco salad which was tiny - more like a large tostada. it was mediocre at best.

There soda machine was out of most things, and the horchata tasted like it had sitting all day, was luke warm and was wanted down.

If I could give this place -5 stars I would. Absolutely worst food and slow service.
