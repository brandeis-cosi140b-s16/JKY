BAD! Went here with my girlfriend assuming this was going to be the same as the ORIGINAL one on 7th st... Could not have been more wrong. Totally franchised and the people working there were completely un aware of what was going on with their menu. 

First off we ordered "unlimited" chips and salsa and at this location there are a Small or Large size.. Well we ordered the large, when I go up to get a refill the guy tells me that "only the Large is unlimited" (which is already rediculous and annoying) and when I tell him "we did get the large" he says "oh that's not the large though.." In which I reply with "well this is what I was given I paid for a large" and he replied with "oh whatever then" and then gives me half a basket of chips and throws it towards me. 

Then we ordered two bean and cheese burritos (we don't eat meat) low and behold two fat pieces of RED meat in the burrito.

When the food was brought they gave us no napkins or anything. 

Atmosphere is exact of Baja Fresh there is pretty much no different even the tables and chairs are the same it's so franchised its rediculous they are all wearing shirts and hats.

Do yourself a favor and stick to the REAL one on 7th, friendly KNOWLEDGEABLE staff, great service, great food and ONE size UNLIMITED chips and salsa!
