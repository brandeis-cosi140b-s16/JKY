Taco Bell is more authentic and tastes better than this place and is right down the road(and by the way, we hate Taco Bell) Save your money and time. Service was sloooooow, the meat in the taco salad tasted like it was microwaved, the shell bowl that it was in was stale, the quesadilla was not a quesadilla at all. It had no cheese inside of it, was covered in enchilada sauce and never touched a grill. The only positive thing we can say is that the draft beer was cold. The decor is very outdated, the triple seat cushions gave me the heebee Jeebees, and did I mention how awful the food is?
