You have got to be kidding me. I went to this restaurant based on Phoenix Magazine's calling it one of the city's 10 best new restaurants. If that's the case, then Phoenix is in much more trouble then we knew. When we arrived, the place was a complete disaster - several tables hadn't been cleared, there wasn't a host or hostess in sight and other customers were visibly irritated. After waiting 10 minutes for someone to speak to us, we sat and waited another 10 mins for someone to serve us water. It only went downhill from there. I'll spare you all the details, of which there are many. Bottom line - this place is a total mess. And I'm fine with messes as long as the food is good. The food was decidedly NOT good at this place. It was predictable, mass-produced and bland. I never do "Yelp" reviews, but I really do think I'm doing people a favor by warning them away from this place. Do yourself a favor - avoid Barrio Urbana at all costs.
