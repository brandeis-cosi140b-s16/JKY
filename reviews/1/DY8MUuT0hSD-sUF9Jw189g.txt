The absolute worst. Everything we ordered had something wrong with it   My husbands chimichanga was a burrito and wasn't enchilada style as ordered, daughters chimi was enchilada style and was supposed to be on the side. Anejo Don Julio was silver and when we said this isn't anejo he said no its silver and kept putting it on the table and walked away. The food was not good!  They took 10 minutes to recognize people coming in the door. We had to ask for refills on water and at one point there were 7 staff members just standing around. Very disappointing on our daughters 1st wedding anniversary!  I would highly recommend eating someplace else. Roberto's would have been better or Taco Bell.
