This was first (and last) time eating here  My husband stopped in tonight to pick up some food and brought it home. I ordered the 3 rolled tacos with cheese and guacamole and he ordered the machaca burrito and a side of chips, cheese, and guacamole. the guacamole was WAY too salty. It was like eating straight salt. Since the chips and cheese were covered in the guacamole we had to throw it away. I had to scrape the guacamole off of my rolled tacos. When my husband unwrapped his machaca burrito the tortilla was practically dripping with grease. He took of the tortilla and put the contents on a plate. There was hardly any beef and it was so greasy. He took two bites and threw it away.  Maybe it was so bad since he stopped in right before they closed, but we will never step foot in there again. Horrible.
