Very very very very disappointed.  I'm a big fan of Carlos O'Brien's and was excited to see them come out here.  We finally made a visit last week, and I wish I hadn't.  

First we should have left when we walked in, the atmosphere feels more like a school cafeteria then a restaurant.  Chips were alright, salsa was straight from the Pace Picante jar.  I ordered the spinach enchiladas which I was told came with black beans (arrived with refried beans that were overcooked around the edges from sitting under a heat lamp.  Not that I planned to eat them anyway, I wanted the black beans but the sight was disgusting. It was enough to distract me momentary from the dirty plate though.  And about the enchilada, I couldn't actually locate them on my plate there was a large pile of what appeared to be spinach queso but no tortillas (a key part of enchiladas for those unclear).   The rest of my party had chimichangas, one chicken fajita and one green chili, I was told both were "alright" neither were finished. 

I complained to the waitress about mine, the manager was sent over and barely spoke English and seemed to have no idea how to handle an unhappy customer (something I think he should get used to) the item was removed. As it should be since it wasn't eaten.  

We won't go back, between bad service,bad food, and bad ambiance it's lucky it gets the star.
