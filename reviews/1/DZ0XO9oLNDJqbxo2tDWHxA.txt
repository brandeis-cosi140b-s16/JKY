Cannot speak for normal operating hours, but not a good choice if you wish to dine late night. 

Small, over priced menu. 
Blaring and crappy club music. 
Seated at the outdoor bar. (A little cold)
Bartender did not seem to want me there. 

I left. And I'm hungry. Do not recommend, at least for late night eating.
