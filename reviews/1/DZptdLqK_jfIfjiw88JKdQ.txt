This really isn't a restaurant. More of a frozen food aisle. If you want to stop by and re-heat your dinner, I guess its ok but quite over-priced (prices online are not the same as in the store). If I have to take something home, re-heat it and make my own sauce, its not worth it. 

And, the staff is pretty much dis-functional (actually rude) as they're confused on what items cost and really aren't very helpful (since you're going home to re-heat) regarding eating-in vs. taking-out. 

There were a couple of people in the "restaurant" but I'd avoid this if you can. Del Taco is just up the road.
