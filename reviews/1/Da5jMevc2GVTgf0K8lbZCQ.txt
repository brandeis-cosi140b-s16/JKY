We found glass on the lemons that were brought for our water. That's bad enough, but when I pointed it out to the manager he just told me that they threw the lemon slices away. No compensation...no offer for dessert. Nothing else! Glass??? The food was so-so and overpriced, no rice or beans with the fajitas, chips and salsa are extra... Who's ever heard of that with Mexican restaurant? I think they just take advantage of people that come to the Boulders or are in the area vacationing. I would look elsewhere for Mexican restaurant!  (I thought the waitress was nice, however.)
