If I could give no stars I would! The new owners are so oblivious on how their time management is. Not only do you get dirty looks as soon as you walk in from a chick with a noise piercing but you get three people helping you so you don't know who your server really is. They do not offer a kids menu or kid sizes drinks, we waited over 40 minutes for our food and the place wasn't even busy and when we got our food it was cold and burnt. This place was amazing before loved it great vibe but the new owners have made this hole in the wall gone down hill I would never come back for the crappy service and cold food just ridiculous!
