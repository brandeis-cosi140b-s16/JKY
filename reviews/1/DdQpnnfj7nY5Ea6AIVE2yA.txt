This place was very good just 5 years ago!  NOW, Worst in the valley.  Chips are bad - they came to our table and looked double fried... just full of grease. We asked the server for fresh ones. He said that they only fry chips in the morning.  He said he should warm these up.....   He took the chips that we were picking at and put them into the fryer again....  gross and yuk! .. salsa is old and was setting on the table when we got there... as it was on every other table with no one there.  Ours had started fermenting. Over all just a real lack of caring here anymore.  Very sad... OH very sad!!   Won't every be back!
