This is the first time in my life--and I lived in Houston for 22 years with tons of Mexican foods eaten--that I have EVER seen a restaurant put tons of white rice in your burrito to make it go farther.  This place is in trouble if they are cheating the customers that way.  The meat was fresh (what there was of it) and the ingredients were fresh, but what a rip.
I can find better all over.  Period.
