I always get the giant margaritas and steak nachos every time in Vegas, but this time the nachos were bad. They used a different cheese now and as soon as the food cooled down (which only took a few minutes) the flavor changed and it wasn't for the better. I was completely dissatisfied and disappointed in the nachos to the point that I won't order that again. Sad disappointment diablos
