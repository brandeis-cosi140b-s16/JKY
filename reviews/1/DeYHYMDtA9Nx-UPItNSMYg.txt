I don't understand why this place is so highly rated.

When I was 5 months pregnant my husband and I got food poisoning from some of their bacon hot dogs. I feel like in general you should make sure the food you're serving is fully cooked or not too old but I think when someone's pregnant you REALLY should. Because of that I spent the next two days in the bathroom puking my guts out and in a hospital with an IV in my arm. I'm sure when everything is cooked well it tastes great, my problem was that it wasn't. There are so many other hot dog places in Arizona save your money and go somewhere worth it.
