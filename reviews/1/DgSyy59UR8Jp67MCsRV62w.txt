Ordered lunch from them through a service They offer through GrubHub and Eat24 for delivery. Asked for it to be delivered at 11:40. By 12 , it still was not here. When I called, they told me they were having troubles reviewing orders through those services and hadn't relieved my order. The lady I spoke to pulled up their email and saw my order, then proceeded to tell me they could make my order then and get it me. My lunch time was already over and I wanted a refund. I explained that if they knew they were having troubles receiving orders, they should be checking the email to ensure those customers don't get forgotten. She then told me to get a refund I have to call the company I ordered through and that there was nothing she could do. She then passed my on to the manager who was just at rude about the situation and did nothing to try to keep my service. Needless to say, my staff and I did not have lunch today and will never be eating here again. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE EVER RECEIVED!!!! If you don't want to help customers and keep your clients, this is how to do it.
