***No bueno.

The spinach enchiladas I didnt 'peso' much for, came out looking like Enchiladas  Benedict. I dont know what was on top, but it appeared to be poached eggs. 

My friend paid for the meal and I was trying to be courtesy and eat some of it. 
Little did I know I would be vomiting chunky spinach 3 hours later. 

I ate corn nuts, carmel corn and even pasta with Alfredo sauce AFTER I ate at Caramba but none of that came out when I spewed. How does that occur?

Only the spinach and cheese from yummy Caramba was left floating in the porcelain bowl.
