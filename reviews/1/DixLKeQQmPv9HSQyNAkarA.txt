Woooooorrrrssstttttttt robertos ever  I promise u. I come down here for drive thru and these bastards about 98% of the time never give me what I asked for!!!I always have to check the food and drive back because of missing items. The bathroom is untidy and unkept and they don't really care about messing up your order. I have been to some messed up robertos but the consistency with this one is what kills me. Consistent at messing my order up without fail,no apology just like o well. This is the last time!!! They don't deserve even one star!!!
