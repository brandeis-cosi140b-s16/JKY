This Taco Bell looks new, and appears nice, but STAY AWAY!!  This is the slowest drive through I have ever been stuck in.  I pulled into the line 4 cars from the speaker at 6:05 pm, the line doesn't move an inch until 6:08.  I know this is a bad sign, and decide to leave, but unfortunately I have been blocked in by another car.  You cant even decide what you want to order while you wait, the menu board is a full car length in front of the speaker box making it hard to read from the box, and impossible from a car or two back.  I eventually reach the speaker box at 6:21, and immediately place my order, there are 3 cars between me and the pickup window at this time.  Then it gets painful... I do not reach the window until 6:42.  That's 21 Minutes after placing my order.  I have my card ready, pay, and have to wait a further 3 minutes before I am handed my food with an excuse about the slow service.  It took 40 minutes stuck in the drive thru to get food!!  Not exactly fast food.
