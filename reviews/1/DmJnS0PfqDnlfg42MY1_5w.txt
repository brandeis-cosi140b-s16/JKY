Extremely disappointed in this location.  The manager Tiffany Rodriguez treats her employees horrid.  She runs the entire staff through FEAR. I thought Chipotle was a forwarding thinking company by having free ranged meats ect.  But, what I have found out is the manager is incompetent, mean, intolerant and plays with the employees lives using Fear and Manipulation. Tiffany should be fired from this company and my next step is to write a letter to corporate office and include all documentation of the events that have accrued to many of the employees working at this location.  I used to love Chipotle and used to love the taste of the food.  NOW - Chipotle has left a BAD taste in my mouth.  "Food with Integrity" is their mission.  Integrity is honoring the "Whole" meaning the animals who give theirs lives to feed us and more importantly the employees who serve this food.  Tiffany Rodriguez is a very, very, very bad example of integrity. As a business owner myself I would clean house at this location and the first one to be removed would be the fear based, manipulative abusive manager named Tiffany Rodriguez. 

Word of Mouth is your best advertisement and I will no longer support this company until I know this manager is retrained or fired.  More importantly, if this is how all Chipotle managers operate then Chipotle is a fraud =  Food and service is a fraud.  
Beware consumers...these employees at 16th and Camelback in Phoenix are working out of fear of loosing their jobs.  Sad, Sad, Sad - Chipotle should be ashamed.  Tiffany, my suggestion to you is go get some help, my dear. Karma is a bitch.
