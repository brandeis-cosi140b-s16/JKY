My husband went there today and ordered some food for our kids and  the chicken bowl for me. It tasted good, but once I got to the last bite I was utterly disgusted..there were eyes looking back at me-it was the head or part of the body of some type of big insect. We called and after being placed on hold several times, the manager got on the line and asked what happened. My husband explained to him and the manager asked if we got lettuce...we said yes. Don't know why that would make a difference. Regardless, my husband asked him for a refund. Went to the store, and when he got there the girl at the cashier register was being rude to another man that asked her for more forks and had an attitude with my husband. Finally, the manager came out and gave him a refund. We are not giving this establishment our business again. One, due to the rude customer service and two, the obvious little critter in my food.
