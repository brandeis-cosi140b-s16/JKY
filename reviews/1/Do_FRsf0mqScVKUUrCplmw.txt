Crap in a tortilla, if that's what you're looking for then you found your place!  It's sad that crappy attitudes and rude comments of the Kitchen staff have to take away from a place that has a bit of character and a home town local spot feel.  That home town feeling is when you walk to the window and the lady taking your order says hey I should of known your name, how are you?

Sorry but today was my last visit!
