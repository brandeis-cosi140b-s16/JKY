Came on a Friday night around 7pm and there was no wait. Which should have tipped me off that something was wrong. My boyfriend and I had the slowest service we've had in a while. We also ordered the Philly appetizer which was decent at best, but a little chewy. I ordered
Fish tacos which were bland. And the frozen margarita didn't seem to have hardly any tequila. Not worth the $$ at all.
