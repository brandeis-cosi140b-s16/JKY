The food was very bland, we ordered ribeye medium and it was well done we also got the vein cut parts you could not chew it, portions very small for the price. The bar had no blender for margaritas, no mint leaves for mojitos, no mexican sprite,Very disappointed. Don't waste your time or money here !
