I used to go to the one in Tempe on University a lot but it closed down unfortunately. Id go to the one of 7th st if it wasn't further away because this particular America's taco shop is terrible. 


I've always gotten the same thing, literally every time. A regular size bean and cheese burrito Terry's way. The way the Tempe location used to make it and the way the 7th st location made it perfectly. I've still yet order a halfway decent burrito of this kind at this location. Most of the time they over douse the burrito with tapatio, at least unlike how they do it at other locations. I think that almost anybody wouldn't be able to enjoy it much either when all you can taste is a mouthful of tapatio. What's the issue this time I ordered the same burrito? Not enough beans. Most of the time it's brimming with the beans, as there is no lard in them it's usually a little runny. But this is one of the saddest deflated burritos I've ever gotten from here. I could fit the total amount of beans in the burrito into two of their tiny sauce cups. Not cool. 

Consistency and a well made product made the right way is something this business is severely slacking on. All recipes should be consistent so I get some what of the same burrito I got last time. Haven't had that happen yet at this location. Other locations seem to get it right. 

One thing I can say for the one star is the service has always been generally pleasant and satisfactory. Only once did I get a little bit of flack, and that was when I returned my burrito for a new one because it contained like half a cup of tapatio i couldn't enjoy it one bit. Other than that, good service. 

I guess I will venture to the 7th st location from now on because Americas bean and cheese is my favorite and one of the only burritos I get from anywhere.
