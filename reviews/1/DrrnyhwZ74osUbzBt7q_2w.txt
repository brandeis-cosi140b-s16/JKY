Was not impressed at all.. My girlfriend had what they call carne asada, and the meat tasted like it had a generic off the self fajita rub I only know that because I have that spice rub in my spice cabinet..  The meat should of been marinated in orange, lime and lemon juice with some spices... the salsa has no flavor at all.. i had the chilaquiles ( which is not on the menu) and it was drenched in off the shelf tomatillo sauce.. save your money and go somewhere else. You are better off going to taco bell.
