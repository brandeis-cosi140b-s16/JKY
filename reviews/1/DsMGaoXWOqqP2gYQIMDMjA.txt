Very underwhelmed with this place. 

When my friend and I walked in on a wed evening, the place was just about empty. We sat at the bar, and something just felt off about the place. It could have been cause the presidential debate was on...I dunno. Anyhow, service could def be better. The bartender greeted us and asked for our drinks. As we were going to give the selection, another worker (possible manager) started talking to her. So we just sat there, waiting for him to finish before we could order.  She brought chips and salsa. The chips were warm, but the salsa left a lot to be desired.  The manager dude kept talking to her, so we had to wait for drinks. 
Again...there really wasn't anyone in there, and we had to wait. 
So finally we get to order food. I got the taco salad, he got a quesadilla. Food comes out, and we don't have silverware which she acknowledges. She went to get it, but again the manager dude starts talking, so again were waiting. 5 min later, and after asking another waiter for it, she finally delivers. 
Taco salad was bland. Meat barely had any flavor, and the taco shell was somewhat stale. Prices weren't all that great either, and both meals were not worth what we paid for. 

Will not be going back and I don't recommend you even waste your time here.
