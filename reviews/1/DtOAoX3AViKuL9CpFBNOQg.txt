I'm having a hard time coming up with anything good to say about this faux Mexican-food joint. 

The meat is shredded and then cooked so much that it turns dry, chewy, and clumped together. It was virtually inedible and I had a very difficult time managing to get three of my eight taco's down. Wait, these should not be called tacos. Tacos do NOT feature deep fried shells, hand-fulls of cheese, half-a-head of lettuce, and meat products resembling dog droppings. Needless to say, I didn't finish my food.

It has "Taco" in the name but what they make are not tacos, rather something resembling food i would only reserve for my worst enemy. 

You couldn't pay me to return. I can't fathom how this place is part of a chain. Then again it's open late and probably gets most of its business from the drunk crowd. Steer clear if you're looking for a descent meal.
