My Giant Caramba Burro was a giant disappointment. I'll usually finish a subpar meal because I hate being wasteful, but this went straight in the garbage after a few bites. 

They didn't skimp on the meat, there was a LOT of bland watery beef. The tortillas were doughy and the red "chile" sauce didn't seem to contribute anything but more sogginess. 

We also ordered a chicken burrito that could have been pork, but it was way too pink to be fully cooked whichever animal it came from. 

I think the next time I have dog food dressed up as Mexican food I'll save a few bucks and go to Taco Bell.
