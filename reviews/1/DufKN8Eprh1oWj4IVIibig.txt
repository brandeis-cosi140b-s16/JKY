Since my first review several months ago...this place has not gotten any better, and the service issues have insured that I will not be back.  I have been back here I think 3 times since then, and its still the same, the SERVICE BLOWS. Out of those 3 times, only once was the service half way descent. 

The staff seems overwhelmed and under motivated, like they are not happy to be there, you have to literally go out of your way to track down a server if you need a drink refill which is pretty sad considering most things on the menu have some sort of spice to them. 

The only reason this place gets a review or any stars is because the only saving grace is the Chips and Salsa are pretty damn good, but even this last time the salsa seemed a bit watered down. 

The rest of the food is just OK, and I have tried several items. It's good but nothing to write home about, I think the poor service just ruins it. I went in the other night and asked to sit in the back section past the bar area since I had never been seated back there before. The girl told me it was already closed for the evening but as we were seated, I noticed that there were  no less then 4 tables in that area being sat at, and 1 large party. So this miffed me right off the bat, everything else was down hill from here. 

Next time I  am craving Mexican food I am more apt to go to Julioberto's down the street and get it to go then sit in this place and get treated like a second class citizen by the staff. Hey Owner...here's a clue, have a manager on the floor, walking around helping out and meeting your customers before you lose them all.
