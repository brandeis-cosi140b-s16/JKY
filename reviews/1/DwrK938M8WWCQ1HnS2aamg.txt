I have reviewed this place before and felt bad for giving it such a low score even though I had tried it over and over. I should have listened to all the people that told me to stay away from this place. 

Well I tried it again and found it to be even worse than the last time I visited. The wait staff was slow, they seem under staffed and stressed out.

The place looks dirty, and the bathrooms are reminders of what a gas station bathroom looks and smells like. 

The food, again, NO TASTE! Very very bland. I ordered a beef taco. Picking it up, the whole bottom fell out of it, the shell was soggy. Cut into a cheese enchilada, the cheese was not even melted. 

So needless to say, there will be no further visits.
