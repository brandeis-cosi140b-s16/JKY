So this is gonna be one of 'those' reviews. 
Yes, Iam a hater. 

Granted, The Sandbar isn't a true Scottsdale club, at least to me, but what would I know, I likes the dive bars. 

So, here's the story. 
I have a habit of becoming good friends with people who like these places. How this happens, I don't know. I guess Iam just that awesome. 

Been dragged here twice, Iam not gonna count the 3rd time because that was more of a 'walked in thru the kitchens back door to get to the restrooms' type of visit. 

The other 2 times I went there were not planned, but same basic experience each time. 

The sandy beach out front is a hassle and I got tired of hearing those girls complaining about how difficult it is to walk thru, duh, its freakin' sand! 
It took a while for the bartender to make the drinks, since she was the only one in the outside area. 


As for inside, lots of MMA inspired shirts and camisoles with no bras, AKA super classy! 
I suppose I chose a bad night, since whenever a UFC fight is on, its super packed with big strong guys watching big strong guys fight on TV, so my fault there. 

In the end, I was bored out of my mind, but highly entertained with the group who was doing the "Lean Like A Cholo" dance while sitting in a booth. 

So, 1 star, and that's being generous.
