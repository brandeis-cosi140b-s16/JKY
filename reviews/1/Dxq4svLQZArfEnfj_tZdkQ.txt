Decided to eat here late at night because the LVH has (questionably) no other food options beyond 8pm. The "restaurant" is tucked away into a small corner of the hotel next to the Paradise Cafe, and arguably it exists within a corner of what was once part of the Paradise Cafe. It appears as though someone went on Storage Wars, won a locker full of pictures of Vince Neil and figured that opening this "Cantina" was the only way to recoup their fifteen dollars. If you've eaten at the Paradise Cafe, imagine if the walls were painted orange, adorned only with dozens of pictures of Vince Neil, as Motley Crue music videos played in an endless loop, and you have Vince Neil's Cantina. The menu is more or less the menu from Paradise Cafe with random Motley Crue song titles assigned to random dishes. The staff was friendly but the food was not good. The fries we got were not seasoned and were undercooked drastically, and the chicken tenders were also not seasoned. Do not waste your time or money here, you can see pictures of Vince Neil for free on Google.
