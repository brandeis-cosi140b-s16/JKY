I was semi-hungry that I decided to go somewhere nearby and get a snack/nibble. I rarely get fast food for many reasons and this confirmed never to do this again. I haven't had del taco for more than 6 years or so. I got the simplest thing on the menu. A breakfast burrito (eggs and cheese). I took a bite of it and I didn't like it. The eggs were really mushy, almost undercooked or just too watery or something. If I can't figure it out, I'm not eating it. I felt like if I ate the whole thing, it was going to come out the way it looked, mushy and watery... Bleh. I can't complain, it was under a buck, so I get what I paid for.
