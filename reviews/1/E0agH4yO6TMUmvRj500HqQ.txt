Sorry but just cannot find the positives with this one . Walked in, no one to greet us, entire wait staff eating & watched us roam around without a simple hello, dead silence.
Food was terrible, fries over cooked, burgers came out a scary gray color, grilled cheese uneventful with simple white bread at $8, fruit salad oversaturated an infamous Prickly Pear gelato pretty bland. I don't think our server even cracked a smile. It was a strangely awkward & overpriced experience.
