I was not a fan, I ordered the taco plate with different meats and they were all very dried out and tasteless. The rice tasted old and the refried beans were eh. My friend raves about this place and its not one I would go back to. Not sure if it was an off day or what, the resturant was not busy... our server never came back after the food came out... we had to go find somebody to give us the check.
