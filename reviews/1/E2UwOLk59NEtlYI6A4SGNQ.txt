We were at the Chandler location.  It was terrible all the way around.  After waiting for 1/2 hour we were told it would be a bit longer because they had a table of 15. Thing is, we counted tables and looked around but didn't see what appeared a party of 15.  15 minutes later, we and others that came in around the same time as us and after us all got our food. We got burgers.   The bun was the cheapest kind you could get at any grocery store  it fell apart after a bite or two.  We asked for mayo on the side.  When we got our food, the server told us they may be out, however she managed to pull through for us.  The food was nothing better than you would receive from a fast food restaurant, but priced much higher.   As far as the salsa and chips we munched on before the food arrived, the chips had a bad after taste, however, the salsa was not bad.  The server truly did her best, but she really had very little to work with.  The tables and floor and even chairs were filthy.  This truly was the worst experience we've had in years in any restaurant.
