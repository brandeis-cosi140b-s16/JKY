Worst customer service I have ever received. Very rude. You know there's a problem when the cashier argues with you about your order. "You're clairvoyant and know what I'm hungry for?" I argued with the drive-thru employee for 10 minutes about what I wanted and he pretended to go to the back and change my order, come to find out when I got home he changed nothing on the order. I drove back to the store and the new woman working the drive-thru tried to tell me she took my order and didn't make a mistake. Instead of wasting anymore time arguing, I asked for a refund and left.  Definitely don't plan on returning!
