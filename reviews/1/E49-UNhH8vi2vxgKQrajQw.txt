Wow! OMG! Make it end! These are phrases I utter to myself whilst camping in the line at this particular Cafe Rio. I have no idea what transpired at this location but I would literally drive to the other side of town to get my Cafe Rio fix. I have been here a total of 3 times, each visit more disastrous than the last. One evening, like a Monday, they literally had no protein other than shredded chicken left. I also had to wait for lettuce. That's right kids, lettuce. Not sure if this is a franchise situation but owning the name and storefront doesn't excuse under staffing and poor inventory planning. Get it together!
