Terrible! My daughter,her husband and their infant and I came during a break from the Coyotes practice.We were the only table  that was being waited on.The waiter arrived with food on his face and after  what was to long of a wait our food arrived.My enchiladas were a joke,greasey tri folded tortillas with nothing inside with a drizzle of what looked like velveeta on top.The refried beans were bad and the rice also the same.The waiter pretty much argued with me ,trying to explain what an enchilada was.I told him to take it away because it was unexceptable and I was no longer hungry after also seeing the grime on the tiles on the table which I showed him as I scraped it with my thumbnail.The waiter later comes back with another plate and tells me the cook added more cheese.I told him again to take it away and that I had lost my appetite.Most of the other people in Calico Jacks were sitting down  filling out applications to work there.Hello.
