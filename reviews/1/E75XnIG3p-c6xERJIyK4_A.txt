I tried this place twice before the remodel and the food was not good.  I tried the bar twice after the remodel because of the atmosphere potential and the service was lame with no mexican beer on tap.  

There is also a creepy-ness factor with this place, something is not quite right at this business.  I can't quite put my finger on it but its definitely there.  I won't be going back.  Two good Mexican food places within walking distance of this place anyway.
