Ordered Take Out from their online menu which apparently isn't updated with what they currently offer. Their chicken chopped salad was extremely bland and the Avocado Green Goddess dressing was bland as well as not nearly enough for the size of the salad. I had ordered this same salad in the past with a delicious Chipotle Ranch which is now no longer offered. They were kind enough to offer a Chipotle salsa to try instead but upon tasting a speck it was insanely spicy to the point of almost being inedible. Being pregnant at this time I should say that the salad is a decent size and plenty of food but would not eat it again considering the flavor was terrible. That being said, I had ordered a salad for my sister-in-law and it turned out her chicken wasn't even fully cooked with spots of dark pink chicken throughout. As I mentioned being currently pregnant this worries me considering under cooked chicken (or any meat) is a big no-no. This place has changed so much from when I used to eat there that I'm highly disappointed and will not be returning.
