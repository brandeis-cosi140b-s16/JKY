I have never left a review before but this place was so horrible that it's worth a review.  I ordered 3 bean & cheese burritos (added rice in one) for pick up and it was horrible.  Everything was cold and everything literally tasted like it came straight  out of a can. How do you mess up bean & cheese burritos? My husband took one bite and threw it in the trash. I called to let the manager know how bad the food was and she didn't seem the least bit concerned in what I was saying. She even questioned what time I came to pick up the food implying it may have been cold because it was sitting a long time. Left hungry and out $16.00 for 3 crappy bean & cheese burritos.  Won't ever go  back...so disappointed. I would give zero stars if I could.
