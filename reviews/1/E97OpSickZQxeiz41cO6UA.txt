I recently bought a house in Dormont and I was so excited to see that Mexi Casa had reopened. I've never been more disappointed in my food somewhere. I am really not picky and I wasn't expecting the best Mexican out of a Pittsburgh bar. But Mexi Casa used to be half decent and I enjoyed going there on dates or with friends. I have eaten there twice since they reopened just to make sure it wasn't a fluke or a bad day for the cook. Everything my fianc√© and I got was completely tasteless, no spice, and overpriced. The chicken and vegetables in the burritos appeared to be from frozen veggies or cans. The rice was dry. There was no sauce or seasoning. The wings didn't even have sauce or spices. The tacos were flavorless beef with a couple pieces of iceberg lettuce. Most appalling was that the guacamole was TEN dollars, and it was basically just smashed avocado with nothing else in it. I have never paid that much for guacamole, even for the best or large quantities of fresh made guacamole on the Tex-Mex border. It was honestly baffling. Most Pittsburgh bars have cheap food. And the nicer restaurants have good overpriced food. This was horrible food horribly overpriced. Someone needs to consult with them. Hire a chef, I don't know who's cooking now but I made better food as a teenager after school... And price your food according to your demographic. You are not an upscale restaurant in San Francisco. Your guacamole should be 5 dollars. The drinks are also overpriced and not strong at all. This is the harshest review I've ever written, but I do it because I want so badly for it to be good. It's so sad it's so close to me and inedible! They are currently repainting the building, but I wish they would put that money into making real food.
