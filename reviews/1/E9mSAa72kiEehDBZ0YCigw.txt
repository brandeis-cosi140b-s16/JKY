The happy hour prices were decent, but I'd be willing to pay much more for better service. Waitress was not very friendly, and our drink orders were few and far in between. You can't really screw up chips and salsa, but this place had greasy stale tortilla chips and very mild and somewhat "old" tasting salsa. You could probably find better food at a school cafeteria.
