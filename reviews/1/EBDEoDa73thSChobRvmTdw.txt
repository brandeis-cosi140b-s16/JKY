Only because I had to give it a star.. So first issue was chips and salsa.. Obviously salsa was made from canned chili or it sat for a long time.. Mushy and lacking in flavor. Chips were freezing cold, and greasy.. Not the good greasy, but more saturated..

I ordered the green chili.. Horrible, it was old meat, plate was cold, sauce was split.. Hardly consumable. Ate two bites and moved on.

Carne Asada mini tacos, meh.. Meat was again old and very dry.. Like eating sand. Yikes.. Limes were old, table wobbly, service was decent, wait was too long and I won't be back.

Overall not a good experience.
