One of our party members ended up biting into a thin metal wire found in a bowl of their soup. They punctured their gum. Police and medical had to come out. Responding first responders were concerned about infections. After all that, restaurant management still made us pay the full bill. Food was not that great to begin with and after biting into a metal wire causing a potential infection? Comp the bill, restaurant night manager - especially since the rest of our party's food was cold because it sat there while medics did their job.
