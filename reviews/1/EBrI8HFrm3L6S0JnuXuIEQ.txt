Just got home from dinner at Macayo's depot and as soon as I get done yelping I'm going to try and find something to wash the foul taste out of my mouth.  Unbelievable!  Wife and I have been here for happy hour at least a dozen times since we moved to downtown tempe and the appetizers are good and the drink specials great also.  Had Mom in from out of town and figured we would walk down there for dinner.  Bad decision.  I had the chicken pablano special with rice and beans.  Chicken had a sour taste, rice was salty and bland at the same time (?) and beans were taco bellish at best.  Wife had smothered chile relleno dinner and thought the enchilada sauce was one of the worst ever.  Note to Macayo's: enchilada sauce should be red not ORANGE.   The only dinner that was edible was Mom's appetizer sampler plate. Go figure.   I'm thinking the reason we could eat the happy hour food was maybe they serve frozen appetizers and the rest of the menu was made by someone who has absolutely no idea what mexican food should taste like.  My advice, have all the food shipped in frozen and you might be OK with the great location and friendly servers and bartenders.
