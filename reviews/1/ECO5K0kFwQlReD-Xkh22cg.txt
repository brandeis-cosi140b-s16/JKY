Normally I have not had a problem with Salsarita's. However this time I ordered two beef soft shell tacos and apparently I ordered them with two helpings of grease! The amount of grease that came out of my first taco was more than enough to slick back Danny Zuko's hair from the movie Grease! It was so bad that I couldn't even eat my 2nd taco. Very disappointed and still hungry!
