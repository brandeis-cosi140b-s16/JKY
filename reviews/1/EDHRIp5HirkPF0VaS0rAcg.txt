Let me preface this by I LOVE FILIBERTOS- the location on Indian School & 30th St and 7th St & Thunderbird and I have fond memories of one in Tempe on University. This one on 32nd St & Greenway is bad. Just bad. I've only used their drive through so the wait time was fine, but they consistently get my order wrong (no pico de gallo) and have even not been given my credit card back leading to the typical credit card replacement drama.
