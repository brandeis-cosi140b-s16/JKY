Decent food, TERRIBLE SERVICE! I sat in my car waiting on drive thru for 30 min and never received my food. I was second in line and so myself and the 6 other cars behind me all left. Also, be aware of possibly getting the stomach flu or food poisoning...it happened to myself and a buddy of mine. Not sure if it was an ingredient in the food or improperly cooked. Who knows? Eat at your own risk. But will I come back? Ehh Maybe.
