Mexican food should not be served buffet style, it just doesn't do it service.
This place isn't even traditional buffet, you don't serve yourself, per say.

That said, this is not Mexican food. Imagine Taco Bell trying to open a sit down Mexican restaurant and then doing a worse job than you would expect. That place would still be better than Pancho's. The only thing I even kind of liked there were the sopapias (or is it sopapillas?).

If you like canned nacho cheese, frozen tamales and diabetes, eat at Pancho's.
