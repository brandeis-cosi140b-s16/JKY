Seriously this place is awful I haven't been here in years and it's just gotten worse.  Everything was cold and awful. No salt, no garlic, it sucked according to the husband. The meat had a weird flavor like canned meat so there was nothing fresh about this place and the none of the salsa was fresh or had even a little heat to it. So disappointed.
