If I could give zero stars I would.  The parking lot is horrendous and the people there do not know how to park or drive because my car was backed into! When I asked to talk to the manager to see the tapes because there was a camera right where my car was, they said there was no managers there! How on earth does a new place have no managers on site! Told us to come back in the morning so we did. We ordered two Sonora hot dogs to go just to try them out when we got home we got a whole different order! So when we went back to them in the morning to talk to a "manager" it was the same girl that told us there was no managers and supposably now she is one? Anyways told us she couldn't show us the tape because we need a police report. I told her the cops don't come on private property. She got my info and said she was going to call me never did so I go back and talk to a guy manager and he tells me they called the cops and said there is nothing they can do and they can't show me the tapes because of privacy because they could get sued! Over someone doing a hit and run that's more illegal! Anyways when told him how the night went and how we got home with a wrong order and asked him to replace it he said they only replace food from that night. Which is Bologna! Not only is my car ruined this place has NO customer service and I myself work in a food industry! I'll never go back.
