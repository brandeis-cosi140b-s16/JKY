This place is the dirtiest, fealthiest place Ive seen.  There is an inch of grease in the
back, probably never cleaned. A chicken carcass was laying out on the floor in the back.
  I brought it to the attention of the manager "Jesus" and he laughed and rolled his 
eyes.  
I would never eat here again, I would be afraid of getting sick. The people that work
there dont seem to care how gross and nasty it is .
They have wild animals eating out of the trash in the back because it is a never
cleaned mess with food all over the ground.
Code enforcement will close these guys down soon, you can smell the fealth
in the surrounding neighborhood when the wind blows the wrong way.
