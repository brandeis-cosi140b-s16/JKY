First, service was great but the cheeseburgers weren't good. It's a shame because I can throw together a decent burger at home with some fresh ground beef and fresh buns. It's not rocket science! Not sure why these local places can't put a tiny more effort into their food to get repeat costumers. 
Also, don't sit near the kitchen because they have a noisy machine (ice, maybe?) and it's impossible to have a conversation.
