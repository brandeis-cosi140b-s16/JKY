Came to Rosarita's for the wonderful reviews but was deeply disappointed.  Ordered a carne asada chimichanga and my boyfriend ordered the bean and cheese burrito- simple right?  The food was so terrible.  My boyfriend's bean and cheese burrito tasted like it had old beans and my chimichanga had more flour tortillas then actual filling.  The meat was old and had fat if I even had any.  How can you really screw up a burrito and chimichanga?  I am only giving this place a 1 star because the rice was decent.
