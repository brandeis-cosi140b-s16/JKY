Had a very poor experience at this place. The food was bland without any spice even in the salsa. The service was slow, but the kicker was the drinks. For a ordinary Jose Cuervo Gold marguarita they charged $2.50 for the mix and $8.50 for a shot totaling $11.00 for each.  The waitress was asked why and she said that was the cheapest way to go for that type of tequila. We were not told ahead of time that gold was a premium tequila in this place. It is not, if you have lived here in the valley awhile you know that. 
So that was our first and last trip to this place. Back to Tee Pee we go!
