Embarrassing service. 

When you have food runners and bus-persons handling your tables... There is no excuse for you to be hard to reach. 

We came in last night, party of 11. Our server took forever to take a drink order. Our food order. Forgot about certain questions we needed answers to. And just down right looked like she didn't give a crap about her job. No personality... Not even a smile from this girl. 

She came over only once to see if our food was ok. And not to the entire table either... She came up behind one end of the table and asked with a low voice if we needed anything. Any other time.. We had to stop her from avoiding us to call her over. 

Didn't seem like she was busy either. I watched her the entire time. No rush. No pep. The only table she bothered to table touch was the party of 2 in front of us!

The basic job requirement: drink refills, wasn't even done! I purposely waited to see if she would come by and offer me another iced tea. (Because I had a water to get me by) Not once. That cup had bare ice all throughout my meal. 

To management: We stiffed Kimberly on a $340 tab... because she didn't deserve the tip that was suggested. She's lucky she got anything at all. I'll tell you who did earn it though, and did get it. Manuela. The bus woman who made sure we had extra small plates. Brought us limes/lemons. Refilled our drinks. Asked how we were doing on more than one occasion. You know. Things our SERVER should have been doing. Things that an ex-server like myself will notice and be annoyed. Annoyed that employees nowadays show no pride in their work. 

To everyone else: there are way better restaurants in this town to go to. With better food.
