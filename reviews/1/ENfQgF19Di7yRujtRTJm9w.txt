My fiance and I just moved here from So Cal and had a Mexican food craving. I searched El Picante on Yelp and read to the reviews. I thought for sure this place was going to hit the spot. I thought wrong. Big time. This place gives Mexican food a bad name. We could have had a more authentic meal at Del Taco. First off the food is not fresh. I ordered one chicken and one beef taco. While the white man (i guess the owner) started making mine, my Fiance peeked in the back of the kitchen and noticed bags of meat. After we were unable to hear the cleaver and the knifes cutting up the meat in the back or no meat on a skillet or BBQ , He told us there is a new batch of beef coming up . We looked at the meat and was horrified. It was all packaged pre-seasoned meat. This meat wasn't even touched by this restaurant. came right out of a bag into the tray.  Probably from Cisco or Costco. Very shameful to call them selves a Mexican restaurant! even worse the two "chefs" in the kitchen were Latino and serving this stuff! what would their parents or grand parents think. I think the owner needs to toss the packaged ingredients and take a trip to So cal and see how its really done. Places like this give Mexican food such a bad influence. I will keep looking for a real authentic Mexican restaurant !
