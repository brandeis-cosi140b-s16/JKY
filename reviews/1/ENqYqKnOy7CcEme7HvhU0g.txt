I don't know how all these people gave this place more than 2 stars. I ate there at least 4 times and when they first opened it was good but I'm guessing that was because they were trying to make a good impression. The other times and especially the last time I ate there the tables were all nasty, the menus had salsa spilled all over them and the waitress and waiters were wearing  dirty aprons. The food was gross and my wife's food was soooo salty you couldn't even eat it.
      I would not eat there for fear of getting sick.
