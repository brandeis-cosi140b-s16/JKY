Tried several tables, they were all sticky.  Server was chatting with a customer at the bar and did not bring menus or take our drink order for 10 minutes. Another 10 minutes to bring our drinks. Iced tea tasted old.  Server did not seem all that interested in taking our food order. We asked for the check and left.
