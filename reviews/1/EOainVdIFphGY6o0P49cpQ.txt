My husband and I went here a few weeks back. Really wanted to like the new place in Spanish Village because we're local and loved Carefree Station that was there before.  The pork belly tacos were basically pieces of fat.  The black beans were just a watery bowl of black beans.  We got an appetizer portion of the tamale pie and it was so uninspiring that we didn't finish it.  My husband had the white enchiladas and said they were bland.  Service was good and friendly but food does not warrant a repeat visit, sorry to say.
