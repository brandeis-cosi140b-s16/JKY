Won't go back again.

It been over a year since I visited Macayo's.  I use to go to Macayo's often but stopped when the service and quality of food started to decline.  However, today, I thought I would give Macayo's another chance. 

The quality of food and service is worse then I remembered.  Macayo's has competitive pricing for a typical Mexican restaurant in the area, however, the food just isn't good and the service borders on teribble.

So, lets start with the service. The service at this Macayo's location  has always been ridiculously slow.  Today, I anticipated slow service due to large crowds on Valentines Day.  What I did not expect was having to wait 20 minutes for a refill on soda, then having a to ask a bus person for a refill, and once I received the refill finding something floating on top, and waiting another 10 minutes for a drink. I waited once again over 10 minutes, for a to go box, and another 20 minutes after our server took my credit card for payment.   

Let's move onto the food.  The entrees themselves are not good.  It seems that I have always had an issue with one thing or another on my past few visits.  Today, we had a cheese crisp, which was served on a stale tortilla with very little cheese.  In fact the cheese peeled off from the tortilla.  My nephew had the kids taco plate, which he did not like.  He mentioned the meat tasted "funny". I tried one of tacos and agreed the taco meat was greasy and tasteless. I had the tamale bites with Baja Sauce and although the tamale bites were good the Baja sauce tasted old and had a thick "skim" layer on top that I discarded. Once again our server was no where to be found. 

All in all a horrible dining experience.  We were at Macayo's for over an hour forty minutes because we waited for chips, waited for drink, waited for bill, waited for to go containers, waited for server to return my credit card.
