So I have been here before and thought all was well so I'd try it again. Big Mistake. BIG. The boiled meat was way to chewy and guacamole was almost sour. It was particularly the fly infestation that grossed us out. Flies everywhere and this was inside not the patio! Beyond gross and the tables were disgusting. Won't be back again. Ever. Ever.
