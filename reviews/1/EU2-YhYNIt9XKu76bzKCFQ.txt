Stopped here late one night after a softball game and was not impressed. I guess I just went in with my expectations high from a friend who raved about the rolled tacos and red chile. I had the carnita taco.. Carnitas were super salty and dry. Also tried the fish rolled tacos and couldn't figure out where the fish went BUT the white sauce and cheese were good. I should've just ordered a shell with white sauce and cheese.

My daughter loved her red chile burrito. I thought it tasted watery. 

I stole a couple of carne asada fries from her friend (I was snacky that night) and they weren't too bad.  I think I'll stick to my fave late night mexi spot that is closer to my house. I won't drop names, but it rocks.
