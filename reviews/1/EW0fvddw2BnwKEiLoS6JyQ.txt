We have a new winner for the toughest cut of meat I have ever had in a restaurant. The carne asada I was just served is a dentist's dream. I had to stop after one bite or lose some teeth. This was horrible but when they asked about it and I described it as terrible they brought me the full bill. Run from this place, not good!
