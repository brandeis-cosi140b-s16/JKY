We went through the drive thru last night we got there at 11:15, whomever was working the window served the car in front of us, ( mind you all the lights in the drive thru were on and the board was all lite up. We pull up to place our order and waited...and waited for 5 minutes and no one came on to take our order. Finally we pulled up to the window and we see the employees all in the back , looks like they were having a good old time. Needless to say they lost a customer last night. Kind of sad for a Taco Bell, that shows on here they are open until midnight.
