Such a disappointment!!!Order was wrong.Staff was rude and seemed like they didn't want to be there.Rubios is one of my favorite places to eat.Although this one never lives up to its name.There standards and preparation of the food is below par.I get better food at 24hr Mexican drive thru.What I ordered was cold  and smelled bad.They over cooked the rice to mush and my steak tacos were tougher than the oldest piece of beef jerky.After 10 years of enjoying Rubios this place makes me never want to return.
