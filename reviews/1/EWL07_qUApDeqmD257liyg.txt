Chipotle WAS my favorite restaurant as it was affordable and delicious, I would go there multiple times PER WEEK. 

Just stopped by Chipotle on the way home from school for my boyfriend and I. The lady making my bowl seemed so out of it as if she had no clue what she was doing. Arrived home and began eating my bowl. I turned and said to my boyfriend that the rice didn't taste very well it was smushy and cold. As I continued eating I stuck my fork in and saw a HUGE BLACK HAIR. I have blonde hair and I literally just opened it as I got home. I began to cry because it's just so disgusting and I visit the restaurant all the time. 

I called and spoke with the manager who was not sympathetic to the situation whatsoever. I am so upset and disappointed by this service I do not think I will ever return to this chipotle again. The quality of service and food has been steadily declining. I am in disbelief by this situation. I do not recommend the UNCC Chipotle restaurant to anyone. I would rather drive 30 min to South Park and have the true Chipotle experience.
