I've eaten here a few times (see my tip, burritos were good ) but after seeing the customer service issues on the news you better believe I won't be back.   If you forgot my food I'd  probably call and be mad too.  If that's the way you treat your customers,  I'll pass.   The place is pretty much a s*** hole inside too.
