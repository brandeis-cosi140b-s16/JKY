I can only review the lite menu, because that is all we ordered: 

Lettuce Wraps with Chicken
Shredded dark meat chicken and leafs of lettuce. That is it. The chicken wasn't that bad but it definitely wasn't healthy. The lettuce was old and wilted, I had to throw it out.

Whole Wheat Quesadilla with Chicken
Whole wheat tortilla with shredded chicken and low fat cheese. It didn't taste healthy, but it didn't taste good either. Really greasy. Probably the best out of what we ordered.

2 Low Carb Tacos-1 Chicken and 1 Beef
Same chicken as before. The tortilla was supposedly low carb, it was hard to tell how it tasted because it was soaked in grease.
The beef was inedible! Mushy, super salty, I couldn't put my finger on the taste, but I almost threw up. We threw it away. 

The lettuce wraps and taco combo came with a side of veggies of mushrooms, onions, and zucchini. The onions were pretty good, like they were pickled in vinegar. We didn't eat the other veggies because they had been cooked in either oil or butter.

We ended up with something that looked like a tostada, we didn't order it. The chicken on it was chunks of white breast meat, it tasted pretty good. That chicken seemed healthier than the shredded.

There is no way we would go back.
