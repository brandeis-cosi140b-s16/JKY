Went in because I wanted a couple tortillas to go with dinner, figured a Mexican hole in the wall restaurant would be a good place for tasty tortillas..... WRONG!  Took 5 min before anyone acknowledged I was there, I should of just left.  The staff looked totally disorganized. I asked for two tortillas to-go. She looked at me like I asked for her to knit me a sweater with dental floss, she had to ask 3 people if she could sell tortillas. 10 minutes and  $3 poorer, I was the not so proud owner of two of the nastiest tortillas I have ever had! They were gummy & hard at the same time, how is that even possible?!? They had a disgusting aftertaste, didn't even want to throw them out to the birds. Gross!
