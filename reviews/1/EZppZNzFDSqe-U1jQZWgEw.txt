This is by far the worst Roberto's I have ever been to! The management here is absolutely atrocious ! My friends who accompany me for meal at this restaurant   are constantly harassed and bothered by the staff, I myself am Hispanic and have no personal problems with the staff yet whenever my friends are accompanying me ( who are Caucasian and asain) are treated completely different. They are mocked and rushed when ordering , they are yelled at for laughing , rushed out of the restaurant after eating, ignored at time and recently my friend had the POLICE CALLED on him by the manager for setting a food tray on the ground! Doing nothing wrong my friends waited for the police to show up and Henderson police informed them that the woman accused them of damaging property and stealing a cup for a drink ! My friend provided the recipe and no charges were made! The food here itself isn't that good , very oily if your not ordering a burrito the rest of the food is bland, dry and sub par. I am absolutely done with this restaurant and it's terrible staff and management! My friends are not the only victims of their harassment , it's extends to a majority of there customers ! DONT EAT HERE !
