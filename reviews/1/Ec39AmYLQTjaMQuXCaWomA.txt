I am a big fan of Chipotle, but this location consistently servs you about 2/3 the potion in their bowls than any other store. I complained to the manager and he looked at me as if I were a crackpot.  I just went through the line now to see if there was any change in the last two months. Exactly the same. I mentioned it to the cashier who said, "Just ask for more."  I don't think one should have to ask for more.  Never coming back.
