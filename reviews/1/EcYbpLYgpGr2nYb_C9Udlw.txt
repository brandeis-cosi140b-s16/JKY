Went to Don Lencho's last night with husband, and I must say I was not impressed. First we walk in and we were not greeted by the person who is operating the register, I assume it was  the owner. We then were greeted by a waitress she sat us, took a while before she offered drinks, their salsa is pretty much watered down and it tastes bad, in would of much rather have canned or tapatio than theirs. She brought our food we had no silver ware we asked twice for it while our food was already in our table. I had to ask for a refill and what they were out we had to wait for it, really it's understandable but please be prepared. We then proceeded to pay the lady did not say a word yeah not a good way to make business heck she did not even thank us. And. It to forget how uncomfortable she made me feel. right above where I was sitting was a tv she was staring at it constantly. I ordered fajitas and they were defenetly not what I was expecting. Needles to say we won't be back.
