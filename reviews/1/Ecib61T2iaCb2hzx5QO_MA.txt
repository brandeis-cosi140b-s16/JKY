Back in the day, this place had really good food. Unfortunately, now it's all different. But it's still open 24 hours. 

I came in this past Saturday, and the food has definitely changed from what I remember. Burritos are plain and full of grease. The cheese enchiladas are gross. And the red and green sauce are blah. 

I wonder if they changed owners, but I want the old way back!
