I have known a homeless man for 4 years. He is an expert on the Fremont Street area. As an excuse to buy him a taco for the holidays, I ask him to give me a tour of container park. Very cool by the way.

We ordered 3 steak, street tacos and two soft drinks. We each took a bite of the tacos an sort of looked at each other funny. I ask him what he thought and we both wrinkled our noses. They had a funny taste like the meat might have been prepared for a long while before we ate it. The meat was also slightly tough to chew. For the $16.00+- that we paid, we did finish. However, when a hungry homeless guy has to force  down the food. You do the math.

He ask me to give him cash to play KENO next year!
