I drive by this plaza all the time and I was really looking forward to eating at this place when it finally opened. All I have to say is, a big disappointment. I understand that it's going to be busy because it just opened and that's natural. Everything seemed very unorganized. The menu is very hard to understand and doesn't give a lot of detail about their food. As we waited in line, one of the gals that worked there was passing out samples of their chicken taquitos. It just tasted like boiled chicken wrapped in a deep fried corn tortilla. Had absolutely no flavor. I ordered the bowl- rito, the rice was not even cooked all the way and I was spitting out hard bits and I was eating. My boyfriend ordered the California burrito. His order took 5 min longer to prepare because it was sent to the back for prep. He obviously was not happy about that. It was also a total disaster to eat, very messy. 
So, I'm just going to pas this place up and go to chipotle instead.
