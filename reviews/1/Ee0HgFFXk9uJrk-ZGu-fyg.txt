This was the most bizarre Del Taco experience I've ever had. I love love love Del Taco, as referenced in previous reviews  . But a single employee ruined what should have been a nice quick lunch for me today.

As I sat down at the other end of the seating area, I immediately heard someone talking very loudly about homeless people. Random. I turned to look and it was an employee, presumably on break, talking across two tables to an elderly customer. I started to eat, and quickly realized this wasn't going to get any better.

The employee talked LOUDLY for the next 20 minutes about how homeless people deserve to be homeless because of their choices, and she doesn't give them money because she has her own family to feed, and how tax payers pay for the homeless.

Everyone's entitled to their opinions, but having a crazy employee yelling across a restaurant was so unprofessional and rude. I ate as quickly as I could and left.
