They are understaffed and the service was terrible. Went on a Saturday night. The teenage kid running the register had way too much on his plate and did not know how to handle the fast paced volume of the restaurant. They seemed very understaffed. After 15 mins, I finally got my food. I went to get salsa and the spicy guacamole and cilantro was completely gone. The salsa bar had not been cleaned in a very long time as there were spills all over. I asked the kid to replace the salsa which was never done or cleaned the entire time I ate. The kid needed help however no manager assisted him even though the line was very long. The people in line after me still had not been served by the time I left and several people were served the wrong food. Not sure how the service is any other night but do not go on a Saturday night, the food was good but the service was terrible. Save your money.
