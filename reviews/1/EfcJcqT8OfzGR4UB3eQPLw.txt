My girlfriend went to pick us up lunch while I was still in class and there were two girls who were making fun of her and laughing at her for no reason. When she asked for hot sauce they gave her ketchup and they made fun of her for not noticing then decided to finally give her the right sauce.  About after 2 hours after we ate we both have been throwing up since going on almost fours now of on and off vomiting this place sucked for customer service and this place gave us both food poising avoid at all costs.
