Horrible and fake! This is by far the WORST Mexican food that I have ever experienced.
At first glance I was disappointed by the menu, then the chips and salsa came. Chips, bland but texturally good. Salsa, canned, fake and simply unacceptable. This is the point where I should have ran for the exit.
I reluctantly ordered an asada taco only to be asked "you mean a steak taco?" My second cue to run for the door. 
Then the food came. The beans are either freeze dried or frozen and oddly nutty. I perceive this at their very poor attempt to shine up a ball of fecal matter. The rice, meh, but edible. The asada or "steak" at this MEXICAN restaurant, a saucy mess.
I'll spare you all the rest of this mess of a meal. 
Oh, my official Tip for this restaurant:
If you must eat here, come for happy hour, have 8-10 of their margaritas then order something. Hopefully by this time you'll be too inebriated to know what you're eating.
