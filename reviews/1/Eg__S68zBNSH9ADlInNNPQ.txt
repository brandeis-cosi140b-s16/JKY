I went there on May 6, 2010. I had a $25 gift certificate for food and am always open to a new place.  It was bike night but the place wasn't packed.  Service was very very slow and the food, once we finally got our order, was only ok.  The drinks were watered down as by the time we got them the had plainly been sitting for awhile  and were warm.  I don't mind paying for good food, service and drinks but this place had none of the above and my (warm) martini was $13 during happy hour.  Won't go back.
