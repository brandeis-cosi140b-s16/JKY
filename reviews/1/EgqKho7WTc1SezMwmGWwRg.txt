Figured I would give this place a try and I figure I probably won't give it a try again. The kid at the window had a really big, extremely noticeable hickey on his neck, just unprofessional. Didn't have a very professional attitude as well, he didn't do anything but just seemed like he could care less. I ordered their chorizo burrito and added sour cream and bacon and it came to almost $8. Yikes! It was not $8 worth of size or taste that's for sure. There was a lot of salt and griddle taste and that was pretty much the sum of it.
