Horrible food as we had the bistec tacos, nachos and a chicken burrito. All of the above were disgusting, complete waste of money. Make sure to use the open air salsa bar (family tasting with fingers) or stare at the jalape√±os that have clearly been out since yesterday. Caesars is much better than this, this place was a scary health hazard. Check it out for yourself, but don't waste your cash.
