Just got my lunch. 3 cheese enchiladas with maybe one teaspoon of cheese total. Served luke warm with very little sauce. A huge disappointment. Had to ask for ice in my beverage and the attendant / cashier acted insulted that I wanted ice. She then proceeded to take my cup and dunk it in the ice machine to scoop some ice. This place is a disaster. Run when you see the "open" sign.
