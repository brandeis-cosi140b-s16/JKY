If I could give this place a negative number I would. After reading the other reviews on Yelp, I was excited to try this place while in Las Vegas. The ordering process is confusing at best. One of the people in our party was so frustrated they  actually walked out the door  and did not order anything,I wish I had gone with them !!!  I wanted my tacos on flour tortillas but instead I got corn tortillas.  One was the pork taco and the other was beef. I took one bite from the beef taco and I swear this was not beef but the most disgusting taste I have ever had. I promptly spit it out.  Daughter got a overpriced quesadilla which amounted  to a small piece of queso fried on a grill and slapped between two extremely small tortillas.  Even the toppings were lame and were nothing, really.  If you want the worst , overpriced tacos on the planet- go here.
