The theme for our meal was bland and soggy. Ordered the carne asada burrito and the cochinita pibil torta. Food city and Sprouts both have better, more flavorful carne asada and the tortilla was mushy and flavorless. The cochinita pibil was also lacking any flavor and the bun was soggy, even when it first arrived at the table. The fries with the torta were undercooked and soggy. We piled up our soggy torta and tortilla on a separate plate and our server said the sogginess was from the juices. Nothing was that juicy though. The skinny chola, however, was a pretty tasty margarita. We won't be back.
