This was the worst chipotle I have ever been to. It was so bad I created a yelp account to review it. 

I went there twice this weekend and each time was awful. On Friday they were severely understaffed and I waited in line for 35 minutes. Then on Sunday they were well staffed with incompetent workers. This time the line was much shorter but somehow managed to take 15 minutes. They forgot the lettuce on my boyfriends tacos so they opened the tin foil and just threw it on top. They also forgot my side tortilla and I didn't realize until I got home. 

It's worth the drive to a better chipotle. Won't be returning to this one.
