This store is the worst store in the company. I have visted filibertos stores all over the valley and have always been pleased with the food and the service. However when it comes to this location i am really taken back on how the guest are treated. I treat my dog better then they treat there guests. The sad thing is there are multiple times i have visted this location as i am a new resident to laveen and have been treated the same. They are very forgetful when u go thru the drive thru and when u bring it to there attention they are rude and will require u to provide them with the receipt even if they just charged u!? They forgot my drink and i had to get off my car and when i went in they asked me for my receipt. I walked back to my car and provided them with the receipt. She saw she did charge me rolled her eyes and walked to get it. She then handed it to me and gave to apologizes or anything . She was also no wearing a uniform. She was a heavy set lady. With a sweater  no name tag. she looked like the manager or franchise owner. I hope shes neither. There are three fast food mexican resurants in the same plaza & i will make sure to never vist this location again. I am writing this letter to not get anything free, but to make the corporate office aware on how there great name is being shamed by there terrible employees. The worst part is i reported the incident to corporate and they did not respond to my complaint. Oh well ill take my money else where.
