Oh my goodness. Avoid Moe's at all cost! 

Staff were friendly, albeit they don't keep the place clean. I also have doubts the way they handle my food.

I ordered the bowl with rice, chicken, mild salsa, corn and chicken. My food tasted horrible :( everything was stale. The flavors made me nauseated. Gross!
