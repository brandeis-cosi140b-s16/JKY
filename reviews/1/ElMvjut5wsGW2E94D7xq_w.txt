Like I said before - this place lacks everything... Ambiance is a zero, cleanliness is a zero, margaritas are a negative 1, food is inedible... The food for lunch is not fresh and it was confirmed by the owner- he said it's been working for 16 years... He confirmed it wasn't fresh.... Get your act together.
