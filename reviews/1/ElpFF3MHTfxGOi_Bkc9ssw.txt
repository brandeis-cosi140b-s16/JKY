QDOBA on Central, Park Central Mall - 9/24/13, Tues @ 11:30 am... I was waiting in line for over 10 mins, when I finally got to the girl, she told we they we out of chicken! I don't eat meat or pork, so I ONLY wanted chicken. I flat out said, "Good-Bye!" to her & walked out,  as I was walking out, I made sure that I told everyone in line that they were out of chicken. I was very upset!  NO restaurant should ever run out of something like chicken! I would think that a restaurant would be or even should be embarrassed to be running out of a 'staple' such as chicken, don't you think? and the girl was so nonchalant about it, too.
