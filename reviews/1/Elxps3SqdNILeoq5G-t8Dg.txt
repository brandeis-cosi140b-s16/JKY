I would love to rate their food, but we never got to try any.  My mother and I decided to try this place since we had a restaurant.com certificate and the reviews were pretty good. However, after about 20 minutes of waiting AND calling them from our table (yes, seriously) we never got any service, not even a glass of water! Maybe if we had brought a friend of Hispanic decent things would have been different....
Highly disappointed and offended.
