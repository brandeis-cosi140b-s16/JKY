Went here for Sunday for brunch with the man. We're regulars at Tex Tubb's and thought this was worth a try. Big mistake. 

For at least the first 20 minutes we were the only people in the restaurant, but it still took the waitress 15 minutes to get us soda and water, which she then failed to refill for a good 30 minutes. Food arrived cold and was sent back. My chorizo burrito was good, but very low on actual chorizo. The man's pancakes were excellent. Tacos were bland and greasy. 

Their menu looks like it's got potential, but for the higher prices I'd expect a waitress that's actually attentive and food that's well done. Sticking to Atwood from now on.
