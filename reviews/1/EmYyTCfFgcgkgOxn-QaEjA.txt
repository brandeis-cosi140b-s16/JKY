Heard good things about this place & been told they line up to get in (don't know why).
Checked it out today for a Margarita (had better Koolaid many years ago). Gave the bartender a $5 bill to pay for a $4 Margarita & never saw her again with my change. Her loss since I normally tip $2 per drink. Maybe food is good, but won't go back to try it.
