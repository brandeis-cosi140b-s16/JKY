Called in about 10:00 am for a breakfast burrito, and now at 5:00pm, I am still regretting it! It was the worst burrito ever!  I also got one for my son, and he agreed it was awful, he said it best, "the best part of the burrito, was the end of it!  Since I was not able to finish my mine, because it was so bad,. I never did get to the best part!  WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT.  SAVE YOUR $$ AND YOUR STOMACH THE PAIN .
