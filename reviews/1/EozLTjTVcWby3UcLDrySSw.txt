The food was ok.. I ordered enchiladas and they were not Cooked like  restaurant style. We waited 30 mins for our food to come after we ordered. And we felt awkward and supervised the entire time. No music, and every 3 mins the waitress came over and looked nervous. There was no personality in any workers. It was just completely awkward. I'd rather go to in n out for normal service. Wouldn't go back here.
