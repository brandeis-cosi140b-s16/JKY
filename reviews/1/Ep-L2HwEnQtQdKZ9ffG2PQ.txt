You can hear this owner talking karma to anyone who will listen.  Well, I've got karma for you: Revo Burrito, over by Zen 32.  They seemed to have stolen the whole Two Hippies menu, right down to the flavored lemonades but-and get this-Revo Burrito had the inisght to include AIR CONDITIONING!

Why would Two Hippies expect business to grow when its 115 degrees out?  Answer: it didn't and now they've got some real competition.  And I saw American Burrito gonna open up on 7th Ave.
Two Hippies was overrated to begin with and now they've gotta slug it out with people doing the same thing, the same menu...only better!

Stay away from this dump.
