I like Del Taco for a quick bite to eat, I usually go to the drive thru at the one by my work on Maryland/Tropicana which there is friendly and competent staff. This one is on my way home so thought I would grab a quick burrito, the woman at the window was so bad I just left, but I gave it one more try yesterday on my way home, I specifically asked for an item when I got home it was left out, so I will not be back. They need to hire competent people, maybe high school students, I'm sure they would do a better job. I will not return even if they say the 3rd time is a charm NOT when it comes to what I'm going to eat :/
