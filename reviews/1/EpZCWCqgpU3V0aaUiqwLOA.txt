Although I also REALLY enjoy Mi Familia (just down the road, literally), I really hope BOTH restaurants succeed. This Roberto's have a drive thru and is open 24hrs which is always nice when looking for something at any hour.

Service here was good, food was yummy as always!
Restaurant was clean inside and out (always a big deal for me, after all-they ARE preparing our food) 

The only reason it is 3 stars and not 4 is their phone service: i've called 3 different times now (we've been eating out a lot lately) and one time the phone was answered in Spanish, so I hung up. The next time was ok and the last (3rd) time was 'Hello?'-phone skills are every bit as important as anything else. If you're rude to me (as they were) then i'm going to go somewhere else (as i said, Mi Familia is just down the road). Please, Thank You, You're Welcome: theseshould be standard on every phone call. 

Don't act like i'm inconveniencing you when ordering...

Update (down grade from 3 stars): I went to pickup my order ("Ready in 10 minutes", then she hung up) 15 minutes later and it wasn't even started. Today my neighbor and I both have food poisoning-stay away from the chicken AND do yourself a favor- go down the road to Mi Familia. Nicer people, family owned, and quality food.
