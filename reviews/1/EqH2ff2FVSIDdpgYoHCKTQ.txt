Ok. I've been here for a quick at-work breakfast before and it was decent. But lunch is lacking in quality greatly. The person joining me for lunch ordered Flautas, the "cook" took a frozen package from the freezer identical to what I purchase at SAMs club! So, for $7.99 you get 5 Flautas fresh from the freezer section at SAMs. I ordered chicken tacos. Shell options were hard shell (pre-made/ packaged, not deep fried), flour, or soft corn. I chose soft corn shells, thinking that would taste the most authentic. What I got was double layered La Victoria shells, completely RAW. Not prepped on the grill long enough to have any elasticity. So they ripped apart the moment I picked one up for my 1st bite. Across the way is Sultans Grill, NEVER a disappointment...better choice by far!
