Nice people.  Probably good tacos etc. salsa and other sauces were not hot.  Nothing special.  Really horrid fake sushi.  Greasy and old stinky shrimp.  Had to try it just for fun.  Not fun.  Small portions.  Quesadilla with chicken just usual.  Overall not worth it.  Better places for Americanized Mexican food.  Sorry.
