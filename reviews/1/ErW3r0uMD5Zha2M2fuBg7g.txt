Walked in at about 7:30, were seated immediately... But walked out at 7:43 after the group behind us who had just been sat down was being waited on, when had not been acknowledged in the least. No drink order, no "I'll be right with you", nothing.  

This was after walking into the ladies room, and noticing what I believe was a homeless woman in the small restroom with her clothing spread across the baby changing table, taking care of her hygiene needs.
