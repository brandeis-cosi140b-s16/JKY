This was the worst!  I took my daughter here last Saturday to get 3 rolled tacos with cheese and guacamole.  She really wanted that and this was on our way to where we were going.  Pulled up to the microphone and a young gal asked me to come to the window.  We had to wait for a vehicle in front of us to order, wait for their food to be made and pay before we could even order.  It was soooo slow!  It took us 25 minutes from the time we pulled in until we pulled out.  For drive through that is CRAZY.  I would never go here again.  Ever!
