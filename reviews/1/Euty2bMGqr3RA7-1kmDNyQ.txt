My family and I came here for some comfort food. It had been years since we had been there. The decor, still looks like they are stuck in the 80's. 

Sadly, we will not be returning ever again. The food was horrible! And not just one dish, all 4 dishes! 

The green and red chile tasted as if they used an obsessive amount of flour to thicken it. The meat in the machaca burrito was crispy and burnt. I felt so bad for my cousin who tried to eat through it thinking it would get better, he finally gave up. 

Their rice, tastes like instant rice in the microwave smothered in tomato sauce. Sadly, we had really been looking forward to this visit.
