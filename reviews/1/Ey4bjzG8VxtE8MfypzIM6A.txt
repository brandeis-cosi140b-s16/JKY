My family and I have been going to the Taco Bell at 1909 W. Deer Valley for years. Last Thursday night my Dad went through the drive through, we got our usual, they messed up the order and did not give him a mexican pizza and got mine and my Mom's order right. While eating the taco salad, I looked down to find a bug about the size of an ant crawling out of my salad. I promptly stopped eating my salad and told my Mom I was going to call Taco Bell to see if I could get my money back. All the manager said was "that he could give me another salad (why would I want another salad) and a free drink." I said no thank you. I think you should check the rest of your food for bugs.
My advice for people when they go to this place, check your food before you start eating it.
