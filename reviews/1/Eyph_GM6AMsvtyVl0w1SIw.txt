Worst taco bell ever. Found mold on my tortilla and went back to complain and get my money back. So I go there and ask for my money back and they say they don't give money back. I show the manager the food and tells me its not mold. I'm lookin at her crazy rite, and she tells me I did it. I damn near hit the floor. She starts telling her co-workers its not mold. I just couldn't believe it.she gave me back my money for the one taco not the whole order. I'm just very disappointed on how they handle complaints over there. They lost a customer and friends and family I know. Beware of bad quality food they just don't care.
