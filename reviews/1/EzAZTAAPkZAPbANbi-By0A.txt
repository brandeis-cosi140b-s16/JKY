Just got back from picking up the food. Horrible customer service. An employee pretty much forcing me to buy a drink after I said 'no' twice. Always rude service, this time my order was wrong n I called the first time and they said that I had the correct order and they no mistakes and put on hold for 10 min for the manager. I hung up and dialed again this time I sounded annoyed and got the manager quick. I was very disappointed more than usual. I DO NOT RECOMMENDED THIS PLACE UNLESS U WANT TO BE TREATED RUDE AND BE WRONG ON WHAT YOU ORDER.
