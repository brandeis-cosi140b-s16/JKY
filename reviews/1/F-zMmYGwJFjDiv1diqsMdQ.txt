This is strictly a "produce as much as possible" for the masses.  The food used to be good.  it is now made with cheap ingredients and tastes like oil.  It is pretty bad and the salsa has taken a real dive too.  It used to be fun and enjoyable.  Now it seems like an overpriced fast food place.  Don't go!
