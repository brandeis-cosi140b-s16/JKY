Started out good. New owner came over to welcome us when we sat down. When asked if we'd been there before, we replied it had been quite awhile. Unfortunately it went downhill after that, he was not seen at our table again despite problems with our meal. My daughter ordered a plain cheese crisp. It came out spicy and had jalape√±os. They remade it and she was happy. I had a shredded beef taco that had over cooked meat. It was not only dry, but rock hard. At first, I thought I bit a bone. It was very unpleasant and I didn't eat it. When the waitress came to clear the plates, I told her about the taco & showed her all the crunchy beef. She said she'd let the manager know. Several minutes later, she returned with the check. No visit from the owner and no adjustment for the uneaten taco. When she came back to pick up the payment, I told her that I felt the taco should be removed from the bill. This wouldn't have been an issue if someone at the restaurant showed the tiniest bit of interest in customer service. A $4.50 credit was taken off the bill for the taco. Still, no interest showed from the management, we payed the bill and left. We will not be back.
