My friends wanted to try this place for the first time on his birthday and it ended up being a horrible experience. After two drinks they cut everyone off! So we decided to leave of course and the staff over heard where we were going and called that bar to tell them not to serve us! Unbelievable! We did nothing wrong, were very calm and polite and I can tell you, no one was near drunk off of two drinks! We will never go there again.
