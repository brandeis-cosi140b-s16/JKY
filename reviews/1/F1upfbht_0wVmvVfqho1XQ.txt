I wish you could give a place zero stars. We ate there last night because an old friend was in town and wanted to take us to this place because he used to love it years ago. I warned him that things change... but no, we went.
This was the worst Mexican food - let alone any food - I have ever eaten in Phoenix. The chips were cheap, the salsa "fresca" bland and warm, the hot sauce right out of a can...yuck. I ordered a cheese enchilada and a tostada thinking that they would be the easiest to not screw up.  Oh man, the enchilada was flaccid, hardly any cheese and the red sauce bitter, again, right out of a can. In fact, I think it was the same sauce they serve with the chips, only cold. The beans on the tostada had no flavor.  They serve no salsa with any entree. My husband had a tamale that did not even look like a tamale. Someone else had the fajita salad which was not edible because of all the refried beans on top. Don't even get me started on the frozen margaritas served in a water glass...
The service was slow, but we were a large group. The worst part was that when they were clearing dishes they were piling them on a chair in the room.  Classy.  Also, the fan right over us was blowing gale force and could not be turned down, so even if you wanted to eat the food, it would be cold.
People, do not waste your money! If you think this is good, you had better branch out and try some other places.
