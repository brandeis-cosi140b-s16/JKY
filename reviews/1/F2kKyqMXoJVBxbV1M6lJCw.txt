This place has really gone down hill over the years.  Every now and then I will give them a chance to redeem themselves and every time they have shit the bed.  Super Nachos and Carne Asada Fries, simple enough, right?  Wrong.  Both looked disgusting and had only a few crumbles of carne.  Their Green Chili Burrito?  I don't even know what to call the concoction they created, but it certainly was not a Green Chili burrito.  It seemed as though they simply slapped some beans in a tortilla, tossed in a few crumbles of carne from the previously mentioned fries and nachos, and topped it off with some of their mediocre salsa.  Wait... that's  exactly what they did.

If they get another chance from me it will be because someone else is buying, and when it sucks again I will not be surprised.
