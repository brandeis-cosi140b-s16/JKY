First and last visit this evening.  I ordered one chicken enchilada and one cheese.  I choose the blackened chicken, as I was told that it had more seasoning.  Both were cold and bland.  No flavor whatsoever  The meal came with tortilla chips.  They lacked crunch as well as flavor.  Definitely not what I expect for Tex-Mex .  There was a hot sauce bar, but it was all bottled hot sauce, no fresh choices or salsa. There were TINY paper cups that held about a teaspoon of the sauce, definitely not user friendly for dipping.  After a few bites of cold flavorless food I left and headed over to Chipolte.  For 0.10 cents more I soon was enjoying a fresh flavorful warm steak burrito.
The store was very clean and the employees were all very friendly.
