The food here is decent. Not the best but not the worst either. The service however has been decreasing throughout the past years and today was no exception. I always try to give them another try, I've been coming there since high school. I brought my children today as a treat for lunch since it was a half day, should have been a quick meal. However, while we were sat right away  we then sat for a very long time. Chips came after 5 minutes, which is fine, another ten before anyone asked about drinks and then another 10 before a they showed up. Refills, check ups etc didn't happen. Finally my server appeared and I asked for the manager, what a disappointment to find she too was the manager. When I explained to her all the things I was missing and the problem I was having she said "well I'm busy, I'll get your check". Yes I understand you're busy, you apparently chose not to schedule anyone else for this shift... However, an apology would have been nice, maybe asking how to rectify the situation, offering a dessert or perhaps a free appetizer on my next visit, etc. I work in a restaurant I know the drill, telling me you're busy so too bad isn't the way it should be done. It's disappointing but I see this restaurant is no where near what it used to be. Management definitely needs people skills for sure.
