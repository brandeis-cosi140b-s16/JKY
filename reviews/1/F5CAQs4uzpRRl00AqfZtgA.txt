Hahahahhahhahah.  
What a joke. First we ask the counter girl what's in this new thing they had and she didn't know so she asked a fellow employee/cook and he didn't know either. Anyway we ordered and had to wait @ 15 minuets for my change. I handed here a $20 bill and they act like it was a $100 bill. Also I recommend not to use the rest rooms. Filthy filthy filthy. Looked one a jailhouse bathroom.  When I spoke with the manager I asked her if she gave a sh** and I don't believe so.
