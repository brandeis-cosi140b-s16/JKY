If I could give this place zero stars, I would, unfortunately I'm not able too. I love cafe rio but seriously, COME ON. The staff sucks, the entire consumer service part is extremely lacking, everytime I go which has been about 5 times, my order is incorrect, made wrong, or just plain tastes crappy. I've tried contacting a manger but none seem to be around! This business has got to have the most incompetent employees I've ever seen. When you have other Cafe Rio's that are doing amazing and so much better, and then you have this place, I'm what's the problem? Corporate or management really needs to step their game up! I will more than likely not be coming back to this location and that's sad considering its right down the street from my house and work.
