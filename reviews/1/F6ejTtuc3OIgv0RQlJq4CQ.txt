First time here with my manager & we drove up into an empty drive thru, no one greeted on the speaker, and then we heard "Hey" and that was it. Waited 5 minutes, still nothing. She said "Hello?" Into the speaker and no one answered and we waited again for someone to respond. Still no one greeted us and then I leaned over and said, "Hello?" And finally they said, "Hi can you wait a minute?" No greeting, no manners. Drove up to the window to pay, no smile, didn't seem genuinely happy or at least give off a happy demeanor. We shall see if the food is just as tasteless as the people that work here.
