The first few times I called I was bounced around from employee to employee because nobody can speak English. I decided to come in person and ordered two lunch specials, one was a steak quesadilla and the other was for a friend who wanted chicken tacos. Both items came with rice and beans. I brought the food back to work and ate...and was disgusted. The meat in my quesadilla was mostly fatty and barely any cheese. The rice reminded me of knock off Asian rice because it had corn and carrots, which was all bland. The beans were watery and runny as well. My co worker refused to eat hers based on presentation. Her chicken tacos looked like cat food. This place just isn't good at all...not recommended.
