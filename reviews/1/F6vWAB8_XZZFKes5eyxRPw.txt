Thanks, a-holes, who gave this place 5 stars.

I just drove out to the sticks and wasted $14.00 for one of the worst burritos I have ever had (took one bite and gave it away), greasy, unsalted cheese fries, and bland, watered-down horchata.

I can sum up Gordas Baja Taco in three words:

Awful, awful, awful.

This restaurant is actually worse than Taco Bell.

I cut the burrito in half and it fell apart, because it only consisted of dry rice and undercooked pink chicken.

I am forcing myself to eat these disgusting French fries, because I am hungry and didn't feel like getting food poisoning from the gross burrito they gave me.  The only thing I have to wash the horrible taste out of my mouth is their water-horchata.  Blech.

This must be what they serve people in Hell.

If you are smart and actually like GOOD food, stay away from this place.
