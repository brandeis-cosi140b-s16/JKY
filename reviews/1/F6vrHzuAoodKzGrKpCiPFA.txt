First off, we were robbed. Apart from the way overpriced food, I was surprised to see that someone forged a generous and undeserved 30% tip on my credit card bill, when I clearly left 15% on the receipt. Second, the food was mediocre at best. We started out with a couple of their signature cocktails which were fun and creative but not worth refilling our glasses with. The waiter was kind and willing, however his recommendations all fell flat on the palate. While the food was beautifully presented the taste was not impressive at all. We started with the Carnitas tacos which were bland and extremely oily. Next came the Lamb potstickers. The lamb filling was also not seasoned. Lastly we ordered the food network recommended 20 vegetable dish and added shrimp. Again the protein was bland and unseasoned. While the rice was somewhat tasty, it was not something to rave about. At the conclusion of our meal, we were somewhat shocked to see an $85 bill for the amount and quality of food that was ordered for 2 people. Despite the disappointing food, our waiter was nice and returned to our table multiple times to check on us. I believe this was mainly due to the fact that our order took a long time to arrive. Nevertheless I tipped 15% and clearly wrote the total of $100 on the receipt. Well, when I checked my bank, I noticed the 30% charge instead. I will be calling the restaurant today to dispute the issue. China Poblano is overrated and overpriced. Coupled with the billing issue, the overall experience was very disappointing. Needless to say we will not be giving it a second try.
