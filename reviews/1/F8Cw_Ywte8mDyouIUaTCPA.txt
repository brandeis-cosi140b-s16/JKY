I can't even give this place ONE star.  We visited there one evening and their trash can blew through the parking lot and hit two vehicles that belonged to people in our party.  We took pictures and left our contact information for the owner to contact us regarding the damages.  I called the store and never could reach him because NO ONE knew his email???  The other lady in the party took her estimate and pictures there and dropped them off.  He contacted me after three weeks and never contacted the other lady.  He told me he was aware of the damages on one vehicle but not both.  He then told me that he would like us to pay for the damages and then he would reimburse us.  I told him that the damages on my car were over $600.00 (Mercedes) so he asked that I send over an estimate for the repair and pictures which I did.  Two more weeks go by with no contact from him and I have emailed him twice.  Today I get an email and he has the nerve to tell me to go through Waste Management for my claim. REALLY....you lease the trash can and should have had it secured.  Be careful...they were shut down for hiring illegals and now probably don't even have insurance to cover damages on their property!!!
