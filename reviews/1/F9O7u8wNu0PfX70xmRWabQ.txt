GROSS AND DISGUSTING- what happened? I used to live in area and the food was really good. 
Now it smells in there like damp and sewer and the furniture and carpet are dated.
The food is nasty! Tortilla chips are over cooked. POLLO FUNDIDO is supposed to be shredded chicken crispy tortilla and cream cheese. 
we got greasy stewed chicken meat, soggy tortilla, a smear of cream cheese. I asked the server why my fundido wasn't crispy and she told me that the cheese makes it soggy! Obviously she's never had a decent fundido - only the garbage they serv there. and when I asked for more cream cheese they charged me for it. Next time I want pollo fundido ill go to carlos obrians. But ill never go back to valle luna on cave creek, so disappointing and not worth the $32 we spent on 2 lunch entrees.
