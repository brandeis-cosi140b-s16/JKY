One star because this place, during summer and during happy hour, could be tolerable for a very short time, other than that ----- Run Away!!!

The have the worst music mix on a Friday night.  It's ghetto-fabulous rap and crappy Bon Jovi (the entire place raised their fists and mouthed the lyrics to Living on a Prayer I swear).  

$9 mixed drinks taste sooooooo much better, I feel like such a winner paying 3 x regular price of a regular drink.  $ 4 Coronas.

I saw a drunk chick fall into the little pool thingy, nice. 

One out of two had fake breasts.   Seriously, I counted.

I entertained myself by watching the ladies in 3-4" heels sink into the sand, and their dates never never offered an arm to steady themselves they just watched them sink. Classy.

What Scottsdale stereotype's? ----------Yeah right.
