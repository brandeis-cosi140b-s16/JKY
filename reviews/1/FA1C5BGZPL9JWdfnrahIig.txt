Witnessed manager refuse to take back an order that was messed up. Was an absolute jerk to a very nice lady who just wanted to exchange it for what she ordered. Can not believe a manager could be so unprofessional! Corporate, if you see this, have a talk with the manager on duty on 6-30-11 @ 6pm. I can say that his attitude turned many people away that were in line. Not good for your business!
