Absolutely disappointing.

Me and my father used to frequent this location after discovering that their food was fairly good compared to our local ramiros, but boy has it ever gone down hill!

First things first, my order was completely wrong. I ordered one red chilli burrito, two shredded beef tacos, 5 rolled chicken tacos and 8 cheese mini chimis.

1. The red chilli burrito:
--First I'd like to mention that we did in fact NOT receive the red chilli burrito, but instead we were given the chicken burrito with green chilli sauce. It had a spiciness to it, but eventually we stopped half way and decided it wasn't worth it after looking at the rest of the meal.

2. The shredded beef tacos.
--The beef didn't taste bad, but the tacos weren't even crispy! not to mention the box was FULL of grease at the bottom. YUCK!

3. The rolled chicken tacos.
--Obviously they had been double fried. Most likely a wrong item from a previous order or was cooked by accident and then pulled out again when the item was ordered. Full of grease, overcooked, tasteless meat... not to mention the guacamole that came with it was already slightly turning brown.

4. Mini chimis
--I ordered cheese and got a mixture of half cheese and half some sort of mystery meat that I couldn't determine what it was. I ended up cutting these up and feeding them to our dog, to which I discovered that these were also most likely double-fried and also seemed to be getting old as the meat was appearing to change color.

All in all, we are EXTREMELY disappointed! The food used to be so much better... so what happened?!!?! Food is clearly going bad and food is being double-fried to give off the impression that it was fresh!

We will NOT be returning here. I'm sad I spent 17 good dollars here on shitty food.

AVOID AT ALL COSTS!
