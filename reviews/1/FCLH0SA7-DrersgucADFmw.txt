My wife and 3 children ate here last night for the first time and really wanted to like it because it is so close to our house and we love Mexican food. The table was so sticky that we had to use our baby wipes to clean the table for our kids to not have their placemats and crayons sticking to the table. We ordered a number of different plates to get a feel for the menu, and the feel that we got was terrible. We watched 2 tables come in and order after us, get their food, eat, pay and leave before we recieved ours. This normally wouldn't bother us that much but we have 3 kids ages 5 and younger and sitting at a table in one place for well over an hour to get the food that we ordered is not pleasant. The food was not very tasty, the restaurant lacks the basic cleanliness that you would hope some place that serves food would have, and the service was very much so lacking any personality or kindness that you would expect. Overall, we were at this restaurant for almost 2 hours to eat very mediocre food. Not worth the $60 and we will drive further next time to find a place, any place, that will want to have us back again.
