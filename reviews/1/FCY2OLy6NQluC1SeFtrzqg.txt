I came here one wed night for the 99 cent tacos and the night crew was way too lax. They were unfriendly and unsanitary. This guy comes from the back washes his hands for 2.5 and proceeds to make my tacos. I looked past that. He gets an order for six carne asada tacos, this is where it gets interesting. He reaches in a metal drawer, pulls out a scoop full of raw carne asada, drops it on the grill, drops the scoop back in the drawer and lastly proceeds to put lettuce and cheese on my tacos. Gross, que no? So I address him about it and he looks at me like I am crazy. The cashier approaches me asking what's the problem, I tell him what's up. They have words, of course in Spanish. He then tries to convince me that the tacos are OK because he used a scoop not his hands. (the same scoop that was already in the meat and he dropped back into the meat) I told him that was unacceptable. He looks at me and say's, "so you want your money back?"... Actually no I wanted some clean dang tacos. But whatever. I took back my money and got outta there. I have yet to return there are too many Roberto's out here to have to deal with negligence.
