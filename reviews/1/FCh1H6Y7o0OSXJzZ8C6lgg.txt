Being delayed in any airport sucks. Being stuck in the Charlotte, NC airport? Downright torturous. 

They have zero decent food options. Unless you like fried, greasy, flavorless  processed "food."  Between Bojangles Chicken and Biscuits and the Nascar Cafe, the pickings are slim. 

I thought going to Jose Cuervo Tequileria would be a safe bet. Not that I thought a mediocre at best Tequila brand could provide good "Mexican" food, but I figured I could at least order a salad or munch on some nachos and get a decent margarita. 

All three of which they managed to completely butcher. The "margarita" tasted more like overly sweet, melted freeze pop and they serve you the shaker as if you'd want more. Not sure why they even bother carding, my margarita barely had tequila fumes.
