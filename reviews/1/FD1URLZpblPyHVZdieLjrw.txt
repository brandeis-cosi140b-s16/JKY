Ambiance: It was Sunday afternoon. We had about 20 min. wait so they texted us when the table was ready (better than having to wait outside or carry a buzzer). There were 2 trans-gender bathrooms & 1 women's bathroom. The bar was pretty full with people drinking cocktails in the middle of the afternoon. There were 2 flat screen TVs hanging in the bar area, one showing golf & the other showing baseball. The sound level was pretty noisy due to the number of customers in the dining room. It was very bright due to the sun shining in through all the windows. There was outdoor seating & a fireplace for cooler weather.  
Food: Great chicken burritos if you like mushroom & mango. Finding a piece of chicken was like finding a needle in a haystack. 
The complimentary salsa on the table was too hot so we had to pay $2 for a small bowl of pico de gallo which arrived warm (much to my husband's chagrin). 
The complimentary chips were the best thing I had. They were thin & salty.
There was complimentary cold water on the table for us which was great since it was very hot outside.
The carne asada taco with cilantro & cabbage had a spicy sauce that made it inedible for me, after one bite I was drinking my water trying to rescue my tongue. I ended up having to give it to my husband who said it was great.
My daughters split a chicken burrito which we specified they only wanted chicken. However, it is either cooked in a spicy sauce or they added something spicy because one of my daughters couldn't eat it. 
Cheese was non-existent in any of our meals. 
Waitstaff: The waitstaff was attentive & happily explained the menu since we told them it was our first visit. 
Prices: $3.50 for a street taco served with a flour tortilla. $10.50 for a quesailla. $8.00 for a chicken burrito. They have taco Tuesday with $2 tacos & margaritas are $5 before 5pm.
Overall, I would say it is not a place to go if you don't enjoy spicy food.
