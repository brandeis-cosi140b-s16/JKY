Horrible service!  I took my family here on a Friday night and we were seated right away.  We were brought chips and salsa within a few minutes, salsa was not good.  After about 10 minutes the waiter took our drink and appetizer order.  Another 10 minutes went by after we went through one basket of chips and a server brought us another.  We asked about our drinks, and they came along a few minutes later.  I am ok with the wait so far, just wished the salsas were better.  We waited another 30 to 40 minutes and we asked about our food and they said we were next.  We still did not get our appetizer, so I told the waiter to cancel it and we will just have our main dishes.  My wife had enough after seeing other guest receive their food already, when we had already been there long before them.  We told the waiter just to cancel our orders and we will just pay for our drinks and be on our way.  He begged us to stay and said they were making it now, so we waited.  Not even five minutes later, our food arrived, including our appetizer that we cancelled.  We ended up taking it home in doggy bags, because it was late, been there almost 11/2 hours.  The waiter apologized and took 50% off our main dishes, but still charged us full price for the appetizer we told him to cancel.  Food wasn't that great either for the price.
Also, my wife asked the waiter what he would suggest on the menu and that she liked spicy.  His response was said exactly "nothing on our menu is spicy".  
I wouldn't take my family back there again, better mexican restaurants in the area for less.
