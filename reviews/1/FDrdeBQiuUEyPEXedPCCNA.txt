I went here on a Tuesday night about 7:00 pm. When we walked in there was about 6-8 people waiting to be sat. After about 5 minutes someone finally came and sat the people waiting in front of us. We stood there for 5 more minutes with people lining up behind us. Finally someone (maybe the manager) yelled over and said it would be at least 10 more minutes before anyone could seat us. We asked why and he said the outside area was full. 
We left and went to Hickory Tavern instead. As we walked by we only noticed two or three tables sat inside and 8 outside... Not sure if they were very short staffed or what.
