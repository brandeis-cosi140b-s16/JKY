On its best day this place is mediocre. The food is what you'd expect from a Mexican food joint. Nothing exciting here. The thing that sets this place apart is the service. I'm kind of surprised its still in business. I went there most recently for Sunday football ticket with 5 friends. It may have been 40 minutes between rounds despite us being just one of two tables. We had to ask a number of times before anyone brought us anything. Terrible experience from a bunch of unmotivated college students. Our server had a Cardinals Rodgers-Cromartie jersey on. If he waits on you, be prepared to WAIT on him. Lazy as hell. 
Bottom line is there are a number of better places nearby, pick one of them instead.
