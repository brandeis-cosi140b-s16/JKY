Never again in this place ! Omg I actually counted the cubes of chicken the lady put in my burrito and its 9 tiny chicken cubes and a tablespoon of rice. Whoa! When I pointed it out it was over the glass ( which is my fault didn't know I can't do that) she angrily said you can't put your hand pass that glass. I apologized. But seriously that long face on that girl is terrible. I ask her nicely if she can just add more chicken and rice and the additional charge is no problem. My point is this employees are not properly trained. Portion control is important and I'm all about it, but........common play at least a little fair. I wish undercover boss hits up this location and watch the employees, after all mist of the complain in this store is how slow everyone moves to finish a long waiting line. Someone owe to train this guys some mass production serving to get it moving. Lol. Is this a franchise? Oh well can't win it all.
