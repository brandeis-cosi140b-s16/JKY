I was so excited to have some yummy Mexican for the lunch. So disappointed to have average Mexican for lunch. 

Average Mexican Food can still be OK but what turned me off was the sanitary conditions. The cooks would handle food, money and packaging items and never washed their hands once. Unless you count wiping their hands on their jeans washing! 

I was waiting for my food which gave me time to look closely at the restaurant. I always say if the floors, bathrooms and corners of the restaurant are dirty, so is the food handling. I did not go into the bathroom but I did notice a filthy dirty high chair sitting in the corner. 

The guy at the counter was not the friendliest but he got the job done. Going back for more? No thanks!
