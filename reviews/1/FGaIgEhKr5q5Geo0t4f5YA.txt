This restaurant is so bad that I felt compelled to create an account just to post this review! My wife had the house salad as an appetizer and much of the mixed greens was starting to rot. On top of that the balsamic dressing had the same consistency of butter.

The guacamole tastes like its out of a plastic bag....definitely not fresh. The chicken and steak tastes like rubber, straight out of the cheap Cisco truck and onto my plate

This has to be the worst Mexican food in all of the Phoenix area
