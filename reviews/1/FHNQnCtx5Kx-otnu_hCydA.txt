Decided to try this place on a whim and oh what a mistake it was. Just about the worst Mexican food I've ever had. My chicken tacos were bland and I almost needed a magnifying glass to see them. My boyfriend's chicken enchilada tasted like something my mom would have punished me with when I was little. Service was horrible (they forgot my drink and got my boyfriend's order wrong).  All I got out of my trip there was some leftovers for my dog and a whole lot of gas.
