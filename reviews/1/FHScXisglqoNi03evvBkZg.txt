So, a stingy portioned, bland tasting $12 burrito is NOT what I had in mind for my first & LAST experience at Zaba's.  I wouldn't call the customer service bad, but it was very impersonal.  I also had to repeat myself several times to get a burrito that was somewhat similar to what I was attempting to order from the aloof employee.  Not cool.  I'm glad everyone else likes it, but I guess I strolled into Zaba's on the wrong day.
