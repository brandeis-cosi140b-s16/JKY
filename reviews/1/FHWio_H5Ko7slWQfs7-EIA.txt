I don't usually use a one star, but man, this was just bad.  So sitting down, they tell you they arent "fusion", probably do to all the reviews here, so great, we didnt want fusion anyways (cant a girl want an egg roll and cheese dip??) However place isnt Chinese nor Mexican!! To start, I just wanted a coke to drink. All they had was "Mexican coke" whats the difference other than regular coke is 2 bucks, nope this coke was 6 bucks!!! For a small little glass bottle. Just because it was imported from Mexico. So that got me off to a bad start. 
The food was anything but tasty. We ordered the cheese dip. It came in a piping hot cast iron skillet, and it was just a block of cheap cheese. You know the kind you buy that refuses to melt. So you could even dip your bread in it without literally pulling the entire thing out! The other dishes we had were pretty tasteless too. We ended up going out for pizza after we spent our 80 bucks here (this place isn't cheap!). We were totally unsatisfied customers! Would not recommend this place at all.
