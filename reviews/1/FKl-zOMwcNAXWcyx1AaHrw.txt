bad service, so far not impressed  with the food, had to ask for everything from straws to chips.  The enchiladas were some kind of red sauce the tacos suck, tripitas learn to cook them people.  The chips at least are fresh.  Come on now if you have a family restaurant cook like you want to keep customers.
