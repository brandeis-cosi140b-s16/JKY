idiots behind the counter a manager and a young girl @ 9:30 pm on Monday nite. Way way too expensive for poor people living downtown,Still steep for even the tourists staying there , dont fall for the Freemont Street tacos, they are 2inchs tiny. paid $2.50 for hard stale chips, ate one almost broke a tooth; returned the full bag and asked for an exchange for rice or a refund, she gave me the weiderest look and said I have to consort with the manager. You mean you cant empower your stupid ass employees to exchange a food item? Manager was no where to be found. Bad really bad bland americanized over-priced slop.
