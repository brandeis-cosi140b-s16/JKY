Wow, the food here is pretty bad. It tasted like they got it from the freezer section at the grocery store. The service? What service? Our waiter only came to check on us once while we were there, leaving us with empty drinks for a long time. And this was at 3:00 pm, so not like it was busy or anything. There are definitely better choices in this part of town, so this place won't be getting any more of our money.
