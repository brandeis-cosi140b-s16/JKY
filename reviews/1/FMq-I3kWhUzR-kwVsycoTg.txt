Great chips! Pure and simple FRESH salsa. Salsa flavor explodeds in your mouth....great start to the meal. 

I ordered a Cadillac Margarita. Their version is supposed have Patron Citronge. The drink was made in front of me and the Patron wasn't used...the bartender made it wrong! I don't think the correct recipe would have mattered as the proportions were wrong and the margarita mix was awful. I ordered a premium Long island Iced Tea next. The bartender didn't understand cocktails are about proper proportions. He seemed to think more booze made a better drink...it doesn't. Cocktails should be smooth and well balanced...his were not.

I ordered 2 shredded beef tacos with rice and beans. The bean were good. They had good flavor and good consistency. The rice tasted instant. The rice was good....just poor quality. The tacos had VERY LITTLE beef. Tacos have little beef to begin with. When you skimp on the meat, it's noticeable. 

I will not go back to this restaurant. Surprise has better Mexican restaurants with better bartenders.
