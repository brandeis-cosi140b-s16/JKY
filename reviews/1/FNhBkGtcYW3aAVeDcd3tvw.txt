I came one day and bought 4 tacos and a michelada and it was all good, I decided to come for the second time, I am 21, I did have my ID but all of a sudden they decided not to serve me a beer because "I looked to young" I had my ID! Then they questioned that it was fake?! That was insulting. So they decided that because I look to young, even though I'm 21, I can't have a beer. Never coming here again. That's insulting and discriminating!
