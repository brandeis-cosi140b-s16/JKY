I would not recommend this place at all. I've driven by this place going to work. I picked up food for some co-workers and the chili rellenos had a piece of chewed gum in it. That is the most gross un-hygenic thing a restaurant could possibly do. We were so disgusted that we didn't call and complain. There is no excuse for this! I will never recommend anyone to go here.
