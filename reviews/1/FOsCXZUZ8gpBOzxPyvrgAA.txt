Spent a while walking around trying to decide where to eat, and ended up stopping here.

The food was fine.  I liked my dish, but it wasn;t spectacular.

The service was really terrible.  We were sitting outside and saw our waitress three times.  When the order was taken and when the food was ready and when she brought the check.  There was no asking if we wanted more booze (even though she had already upsold us on the original margarita), and getting her attention when she was walking by to service the other table was impossible.  After she left the check we waited about 20 minutes for her to come and run the card, but that never happened.  Had to ask the hostess to take care of it.  She gave it to the server who, annoyed, returned it with a simple "there you go".

Hopefully she was just having a bad night but that wasn't the impression that I got.
