All you can taco's  sounds good..except after the first two I never got the second order..so after paying for two drinks and playing $20 worth of video poker I ended up paying almost $12 per taco, which were nothing to write home about..of course I complained and security arrived to take a report...WTF? After much complaining and receipt presentation I managed to get a meal comped..which would be the only reason I would ever set foot back into this place.
