So this may in fact be the worst Chipotle in existence. Let me explain.

Every time I show up craving a burrito bowl, there's a huge line to the door. Each person in line is wondering why they're there. You can tell. They're wondering why they put up with the low quality, the terrible service, the indifferent management, the unacceptable price of guacamole, the attitudes of the guy asking you what you want -- or more often, telling you to hold on. The only time I've come here and not had to wait in line, this troll still told me I had to wait because they were making an order for a  family (not in attendance).

I've checked in to this place a few times, and I've been to the Chipotle by Fashion Square a few thousand. For some reason, that place is bomb and this place sucks. At this location, you have to stand in line among dine-in patrons and witness the slop that you're about to ingest and the looks of disappointment on their faces after each unfulfilling bite.

If you've already decided to eat at Chipotle, you've probably had Chipotle before. If you're like me, you go to get a burrito bowl with no rice because you're a Slow Carb or 4 Hour Body fanatic. You know that you can get what you need (not necessarily what you want). If you want a delicious authentic Mexican meal, go across the street to Julio's. If you want to hate yourself and write a whiny Yelp review about it, come here.
