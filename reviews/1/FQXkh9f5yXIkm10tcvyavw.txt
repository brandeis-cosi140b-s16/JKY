This is BY FAR the worst Chipotle I have ever been to. It is slow & inefficient. The manager is more clueless than the staff. On multiple occasions I have arrived at the checkout and there is no one there to help me. 
On my most recent visit the lady who wrapped my burrito tore the tortilla (not a big deal), and when she went to re-wrap it, threw out half of the contents with the old tortilla. Not cool.
I have given this location more than a fair shake. I will not be back, mark my words. If you are in the mood for Chipotle, I would suggest going to the one on Shea & the 101 or the location on Scottsdale Rd.
