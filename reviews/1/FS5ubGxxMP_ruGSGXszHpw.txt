Ask for a certain drink and got told they didn't have it until my husband went to the bar and asked to be told of course they have the drink I wanted! The server forgot the water and when my husbands margarita arrived, no salt and couldn't get the servers attention so had to go to the bar himself to get it sorted. For a Mexican place, the margarita was sub standard at best. At this point we wanted to walk out but as we'd ordered decided not to. When our meal arrived and our server had put the wrong order in for us it was time to leave and never return!
