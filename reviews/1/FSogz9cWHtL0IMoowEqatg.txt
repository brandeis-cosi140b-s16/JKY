Mercifully this business is closed, the owners left a large announcement on the front door blaming local customers for not supporting the restaurant.  This was predictable from the beginning when virtually everyone, myself included, panned what can only be described as wretched food.  Rather then heed the reviews on websites like this one, the owners responded by blaming customers for not knowing good food.  There are many very successful Mexican restaurants in the valley that serve excellent Mexican food, Asado Mexican Kitchen was not one of them.  The message on the door promised a different concept restaurant in the future, but what was needed was a good Mexican food place and baring that it is difficult to imagine what else would even work in that area. Eager to see the next effort.
