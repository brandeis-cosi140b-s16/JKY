Poor customer service. Sat at our table for an hour waiting for our order. Ended up getting up and leaving. The manager didnt even apologize when I told him we were leaving. I handed him a $5 bill for the softdrinks I had ordered... I was surprised he actually took the money! It was an opportunity for him to make it up to an unsatisfied customer and he dropped the ball. Too bad because I really like their shrimp fajitas! I definitely will not go back and will make sure everyone I know does not go there!
