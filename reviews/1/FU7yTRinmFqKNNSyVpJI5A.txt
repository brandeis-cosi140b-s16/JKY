Do not go here.  My buddies and I went to get a quick bite after the Ohio State/Northwestern game.  We were sat down pretty quickly.  That was it for positive interaction with the staff.  We tried several times to flag down staff to just get drinks and order food.  After waiting for almost 15 minutes, we just walked out. Brutal experience.
