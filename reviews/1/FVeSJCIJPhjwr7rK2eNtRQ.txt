Absolutely terrible. Menu is selective, not to mention the bad service I had received. The waitress forgot multiple times to give us silverware after our food had come out (which took almost an hour), and the bartender had to find us silverware. Asked for boxes and it took another 20 minutes. Waitress didn't even bring water over after we had asked several times. Not to mention I got food poisoning and was ill for the next few days. Don't recommend it and I will NOT be returning ever again.
