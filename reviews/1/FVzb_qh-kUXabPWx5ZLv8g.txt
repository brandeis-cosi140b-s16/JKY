Just don't eat here.  I didn't know that Heinz made salsa.  Just can't seem to find anything positive to say about this place.  This is a town with a plethora of Mexican Restaurants, so you would think that competition alone would have closed this place.  Just drive over to Sylvia's La Canasta.  Its close, and very good.
