My eight year old vegetarian son wanted a cheese quesadilla. What he got for his $3.25 was a super-thin and greasy object the size of a CD folded in half. He was quite upset, so I suggested he write Chipotle Corporate. What he received back from Chipotle, was a very terse note telling him he should have ordered something bigger, if he left hungry. We will not visit such an aloof, uncaring place like Chipotle again. Disappointed with your food? Too bad!!!. You have no recourse.
