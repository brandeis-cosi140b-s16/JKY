I have been going to this Rubio's for the past few years and it use to be good; however, last night my husband and I decided to stop by before our drive back to Utah and WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!  It was the first time we have ever experienced such terrible food at a Rubio's ... we were very surprised.  The food was not hot and not fresh.  Typically Rubio's has a fresh menu but this one was so bad we will never go back... we will drive to a different, less convenient location, but get something edible for $24
