Had the worst experience ever with their food i new at the time it tasted funny but i should've followed my gut now im going on to my second day with stomach problems. The waitress was good but the manager cut us off at 3 beers in. We asked for the manager but he never came to talk to us. After we asked for him it seemed like the staff became rude towards us. We had a birthday party there but never will again. This place used to be a regular place for me and 6-8 others but this Diminished Any Chance Of Returning. You Would Think Spending $400 or so per visit with my triends and family would be worth respect from the Manager. So To Say The Least Worst Experience Ever.
