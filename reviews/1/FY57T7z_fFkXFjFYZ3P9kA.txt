Ordered the #3, The carne asada burrito plate. They must've accidentally spilled a container of salt in thier rice? Because my food was too salty to eat. There was no way I could even finish my dinner. Also, besides the main entree- the portion for your sides are small too. Ive had better..Guess this will be my first & last time here!
