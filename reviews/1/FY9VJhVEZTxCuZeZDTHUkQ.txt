There's no easy way to put this, after going here I feel violated.  I ordered the grilled pork loin and my wife ordered the vegetable picadillo enchiladas.  I was served two crispy burned pork loins floating in a bland "peanut" sauce that tasted like it belonged more on a Thai menu.  The plate was over sauced, the "queso mashed potatoes" were bland and as hard as a rock...  Then there were the slightly burned, out of season asparagus, no crisp to them, just limpy old food.

To make matters worse, my wife's dish was inedible.  She was served, no joke, instant rice with dried peas and carrots.  They at least squeezed some lime juice on it.  The vegetables in the soggy tortillas were over cooked to the point that they were little rubber bits of bitter tasting vegetables.

We're not picky eaters, but this honestly was an insult served to us on a plate.

I would have sent it all back but our server quickly grabbed our plates and bagged it up for us after she saw we weren't eating.  This was honestly the worst meal I have ever been served that came out of a professional kitchen.

Take my advice, drive five more minutes down the road and go to Senor Tequila.
