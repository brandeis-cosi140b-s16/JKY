This place deserves no stars. I've been there a few times. You must be wondering why did I keep going, I asked myself the same question.... #1 forgot why I told myself never to go there again!!!  There expensive $7 a burrito!! Like you go to a food truck or taco stand to pay less than a Restaurant. And just bad service!! There was only 1 man today working which he was upset that I ordered mulitas!!! And bitched because I wanted cilantro and unions, said oh man what are you doing to me!!!! Ugh!!!! Just left there got mulitas for $5 and hardly had any meat!!! Like what did I pay for!!! Sooo pissed!!! there chile had NO FLAVOR!!!  And to top it all off got my daughter 2 tacos asada, they were so nasty she couldn't finish them... I tasted the meat and it was rancid!!!!!! NOTE TO SELF WHY I WILL NOT EAT THERE AGAIN!!!
