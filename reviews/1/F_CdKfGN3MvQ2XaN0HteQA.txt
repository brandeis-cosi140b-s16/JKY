I must have gone on a bad day, because my husband and I both thought that this place was terrible.  I actually made my husband take me here to try something new, based on the Yelp reviews.  It was awful!  I had rolled tacos, which tasted like the Delimex frozen rolled tacos available at the grocery store.  My husband had a burrito that no amount of salsa could help.  The condiments (e.g., the sliced carrots) seemed old.  

I've heard that the other location in Henderson is tons better, and maybe one day (HUGE maybe), I'll try the other location.  In the meantime, I have to give this place a big two thumbs down.
