We were warned by some friends who had been here several times and were disappointed but wanted to keep an open mind and give it a try. It looked like a great atmosphere from the outside. The bartender was unbelievably rude as he passed out group up several times while he cleaned glasses and put dish ware away trying to finish his shift. He then acted insulted when we asked for a pitcher of margaritas to which he said they didn't offer anymore. Despite having blenders in the background that were being cleaned off he also said they wouldn't blend the margaritas and looked at us like we were requesting something outrageous. We didn't care too much at this point as the margs were good and we were just waiting for a table. We then got escorted to our table and while walking through the restaurant we noticed cockroaches on the wall. Our group was a little uneasy about seeing these things run around and mentioned it to the waitress. Her response was that the door was open and there was nothing they could do about it! Sorry but I sit on a lot of patios in old town and other places don't have them running around and if they did it would be an issue they would address not just say sorry nothing we can do! She talked down to us at the table and said it was just something we had to deal with. After discussion we decided this was just infuriating and the manager came over to which we expressed our concerns. He apologized but still didn't seem too concerned with roaches in the restaurant. He offered us a gift card to come back and try it again which we will on a different day but it is disappointing we were told all this before and then it all actually happened.
