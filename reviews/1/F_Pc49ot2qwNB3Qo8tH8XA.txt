It's difficult to even write this review because it's a memory I would rather delete. This restaurant is an eyesore from the door and the food was just as tragic. On a positive note the warm chips and salsa gave me initial hope but that was quickly lost when the main food arrived. Frozen food quickly cooked has a distinct taste that I can easily replace at home. The bonus was being charged $.75 for extra ranch dressing. Nice 1000% mark-up there. Que Lamo?
