Would give it a zero if I could. seated ourselves at a dirty table. Took 10 mins to get it cleaned. Took 10 MORE mins to get a drink order in, and when we said we were ready to order the waitress said we'll have to wait because they take drink and food orders separately...10 more mins, we complain TO the manager and he seems irritated at us, but still takes our order...another 20 mins...food comes out.

Chips- look good but were stale. disappointing. Salsa was decent.

Tacos- not amazing...def NOT worth the trouble we went thru. 

Ud figure they'd try to accommodate us or just even be NICE to us as apology for their poor service...nothing but attitude and ignorance. Horrible staff, they need new management. Never returning.
