Every chipotle has the same food but it's just the service that distinguishes them. This one had terrible service and horrible wait time. I waited 20 mins for a bowl when the line wasn't even long. The food was made haphazardly and they constantly ran out of things so it took forever. Worst chipotle I've ever been to.

Worst part, the corn was frozen in my bowl -___-
