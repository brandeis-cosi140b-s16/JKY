Seriously? 

Three pesos is about what I would actually pay for a meal here.
This is not Mexican Food. This is not even American food categorized as Mexican food. This is pure crap.

The salsa came in 2 flavors: water and chunky water.
Shame on you. If you poured Food Lion brand salsa straight out of a jar it would taste better. Sorry guys, V8 is not technically salsa.

OK I'm done..not even worth writing about my burrito which looked like a turd and tasted close to one.
