Our food was dropped coming up the stairs, only the fajita meat survived, so they brought that all by itself to the table.  About 15 minutes later everything else came.  They didn't seem to understand why we asked for fresh meat.  Really bad experience all around.  Disappointing since we had heard a lot of good things about the DC Ranch location...at least they compd the fajitas.
