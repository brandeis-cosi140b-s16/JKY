Dudes. I spent half an hour at 1804 E Southern Ave looking for Taco del Mar and could not find it. supposedly it is in the same complex as the yoga studio and nutrition center, both of which i did find. I was totally jonesing for a taco but alas, left the Basha's strip mall quite unfulfilled. 

Perhaps Taco del Mar is one of those 'members only' places, or an old timey speakeasy but with tacos. Or was there simply an invisibility cloak thrown over it yesterday? I don't know, but I am still craving a good taco.
