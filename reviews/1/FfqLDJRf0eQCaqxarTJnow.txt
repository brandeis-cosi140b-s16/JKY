I had a bad experience here, so I don't think I will be returning to a Caramba restaurant again.

When I went my food was alright. It wasn't very good, but I didn't think it was too bad either. What really turned me off was that one of my friends that went along with me found a bee in her meal. When she took it to the worker he told her it wasn't a bee, but an olive. He finally gave her a new one after trying to unsuccessfully convince her that it was an olive. It was definitely an insect. It bugged me that he didn't even take responsibility for it. After that I didn't really finish my meal, because all I could think about was the bee in my friend's dinner.
