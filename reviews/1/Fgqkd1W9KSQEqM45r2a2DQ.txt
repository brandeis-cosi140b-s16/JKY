Worst Mexican food I ever had. Taco Bell is better. Worst tortillas I ever put in my mouth, the kids wouldn't even eat them, just the filling. $28 for 4 tacos, a burrito, 2 bottled sodas and a fountain sofa. Never getting my money again. Anyone of the bertos are better. Salsa bar was good but that's all!
