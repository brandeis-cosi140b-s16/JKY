Don't eat the breakfast...utter shit. Wish I had eaten the less healthy McDonald's a few hundred feet away at half the price.

The wife and I only at the breakfast here where I'm assuming is not where they excel based on the other reviews.  Either that or nobody in the area knows what Mexican food is supposed to taste like.

Will not be coming back.
