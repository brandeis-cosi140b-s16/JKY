I took my elderly parents to Michoacan Mexican Restaurant on 7870 W. Tropical Pkwy, Las Vegas for a Mothers Day Lunch. Instead it was a huge disappointment. After waiting 40 minutes for our food my Mother received the incorrect dish. We had to ask multiple times to have our waiter come back and he picked up the dish, no apologies for the error. About 25 minutes later after the rest of us had finished our food my Mother did finally receive the correct dish but was sloppily put together. We asked for the Manager several times, which we later found out was the owner, Mark Berry. FInally after a bit the Owner came over and asked what was wrong without introducing himself. My Father asked if he was the Manager and he arrogantly said, "I can be." We explained the situation and his response was, "What do you want me to do about it?" My Father told him to fix the problem and the Owners response was, "You were unhappy the minute you walked in." We were mortified by the arrogance and condescending attitude from Mark Berry the Owner!  It ruined the lunch and we left. I went to Mark after my parents walked out and told him his behavior was unacceptable and he should not have spoken to my elderly parents that way especially on Mothers Day. Mark's response, "Well I am only human, what do you want me to do?" 

Poor service, arrogant and unaccomodating Owner and marginal food. That is what you get at this restaurant. There are so many other wonderful Mexican restaurant choices in town that know how to treat a customer, avoid this place.
