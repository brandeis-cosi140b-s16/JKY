This place used to be good. I came here last night and ordered the asada burrito and it was all fatty, chewy pieces! By the time I finished I had a pile of meat on my plate that I had to throw away! I was so disappointed. My boyfriend on the other hand had the carnitas burrito which was fine. Never coming here again!!
