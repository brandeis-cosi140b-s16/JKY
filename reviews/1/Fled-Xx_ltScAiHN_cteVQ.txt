If zero was an option this place would get -4 stars. It is typically slow but tolerable cause it's pretty tasty but no more!! I just returned home after having left a drive thru for the first time ever without my food. I waited 13 minutes and 1 car had gotten food and there were 4 cars ahead of me...4 ahead of me!!! I know they wouldn't claim to be fast food but nobody has time to wait 40 minutes in a drive thru. Go down to 35th Ave.
