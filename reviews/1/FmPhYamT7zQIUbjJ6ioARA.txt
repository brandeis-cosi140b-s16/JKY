Oh where to begin... Food was cold, service was terrible, forgot items I ordered... Called to complain and the lady who answered the phone had this like "whatever" attitude... She did offer me a free meal and the chips if I wanted to go back in tonight... I told her I can't... So she took my name and phone number... Which I probably won't be going back to redeem...
