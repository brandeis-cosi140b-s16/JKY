While I love the Tostada Chicken Salad and the salsa bar, the service is terrible. I listened to a gentleman in front of me order a chicken salad and the cashier couldn't get it right after about 30 times of explaining it to him. He didn't look special, but I've seen people with actual downs syndrome be more intelligent than the staff at this place. A Salad shouldn't be that difficult. 
When it was finally my turn to ask for a Chicken Tostada salad with chicken breast only (no dark meat) and no sour cream, it was like I just asked the cashier to turn water into wine... He called the manager over and I explained what I ordered. He said yes that is what is the computer. I responded with how am I suppose to know because I can't see the computer screen and the cashier kept asking what's white meat only... Then the manager starts speaking spanish about me, Like I won't understand, but guess what just because I am white doesn't mean I don't understand spanish. So for 2 of us to order it took a total of 15 minutes, which to me is a very long time at a fast food restaurant.

While the food always comes through, Especially the avocado salsa, the service is HORRIBLE at this particular location. I will find a different EPL to dine at in the future.

***just a side note - they got rid of the liquid queso for the nachos - so the nachos are now pretty disappointing.
