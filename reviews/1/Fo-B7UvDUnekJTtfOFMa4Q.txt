I went here before it closed and when I went it was so disgusting. I ordered tortilla soup and the soup tasted bad. On top of that they put a scoop of sour cream in my soup. How gross is that? I don't remember what I ordered becuase it was so long ago but whatever it was, it was dry and tasteless. Im shocked that they re opened. I bet the food is still shitty. Honestly, I hope they close down again but this time for good. I will never go back.
