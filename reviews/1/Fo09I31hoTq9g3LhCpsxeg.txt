I've worked in food service before and I feel that I am very fair and generous when it comes to reviewing an establishment. That is not the case for this place. First off the only reason I gave it one star was for the chips and salsa ( particularly the tomatillo). We didn't get to try the food we ordered because after waiting 15 min to be greeted by our server, waiting just as long to receive our drinks...my house salad came to me with a hair on it. Needless to say we were out of there! Don't waste your time here...not only was this place horrible but The Aliante in general has gone down hill since being sold. Air quality has changed to smokey, smokey, smokey!!! No handsoap in the restroom. What a huge disappointment all around.
