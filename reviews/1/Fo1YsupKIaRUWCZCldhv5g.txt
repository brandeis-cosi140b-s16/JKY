Absolutely awful!  Terrible food!  The worst Mexican food I've had in years.  

My wife and I ate here last Friday night.  There weren't many patrons inside when we got there.  (should have  tipped us off)  

I ordered two beef enchiladas with a beef  taco, rice and beans.  Flavorless rice, beans were salty, the enchiladas had some kind of dense, stringy, beef-like, dry substance inside, with canned enchilada sauce.  Barely edible.  The taco was something I've only seen prepared similarly at  "Jack-in-the box".  They had deep fried a corn tortilla with a lump of dense, dry, meat-like substance inside.  (the same material as in the  enchiladas, apparently)  There was no cheese, lettuce or sauce in the taco.  No seasoning to the material inside, just a dry lump of meat-like substance inside a deep fried tough taco shell!  Horrible! 

I don't know how they can serve food like this without knowing how bad it is! Doesn't the staff eat any of this?!   Unbelievable!  

The one bright spot was our waitress, who was friendly and did a good job.  Our grandson got the hamburger, which was pretty good, so he was okay.

Pretty sad, when the only food we had that was decent for dinner, was a hamburger at a MEXICAN restaurant.

Do yourself a favor and skip this place.  The food is seriously that BAD!
