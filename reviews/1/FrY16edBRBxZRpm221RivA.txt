The first time I ate here the food was really a disappointment.  Because the restaurant was busy, I gave them a little slack.  But after going there two additional times (a friends idea to return not mine) I have decided that the only good thing about this place is the atmosphere.  The food on each occasion was subpar and not worth the money.  This is really sad to say because I really want to like this place.  It has a great atmosphere that could make this place the best (if only the kitchen could match the atmosphere).

Utterly disappointed
