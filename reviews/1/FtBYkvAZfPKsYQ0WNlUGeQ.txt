This place is so overrated!!  I'm concerned that some are actually delusional enough to consume this food. Friends of mine raved about how delicious everything on this menu was, so I walked in with such high hopes, only to be compeltey let down. All was bland and needed salt, and flavor all together. If I could give a half star, I would.
