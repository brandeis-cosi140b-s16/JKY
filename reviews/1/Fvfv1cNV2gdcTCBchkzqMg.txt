7/29/14 @ 2:30pm Well we tried going back today for the carne asada taco special and no one was there!! The light were very low almost out, no one was at tables, and no one greeted us! We waited 20 min and no one came out! Dont know what happened! Pretty sad!!

7/28/14 Thanks to the Yelpers for reviews on this place! We would never have known about this place. It shares a space with Doc Hollidays in the Target shopping center near Discount Tires and Michaels. 
When u go in you just find a table and sit they will bring the menus to you. It is very small but the food is SOOOO worth it. The staff is very nice and personable as well. Its Clean too.
They do have daily specials with a drink for $5.00. Today was monday so I got the Chicken Enchiladas(2) with rice and beans. Very filling and Good!! My husband got Bean &Cheese burrito and 2 Carne Asada tacos. He had no complaints and wanting to come back again!! Oh they also give you chips and salsa. Awesome!!
We will b back
