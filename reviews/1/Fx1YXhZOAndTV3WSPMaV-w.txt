First and only stop here. Prep line was slow.  Carne Asada was dry.  Charged over $6 for a chesse quesadilla.  No Coke or Dr. Pepper products in the fancy drink machine.  All indoor tables dirty, trash cans full to over flowing.  Too many other good places to get tacos in this town to put up with this.
