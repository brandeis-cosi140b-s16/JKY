The food isn't awful but I got charged 2x for one meal and they wouldn't just reimburse me or take it off our next meal. They wanted bank statements and kept saying it was pending after like 11 days. Said it happened to other people and if treated the same way I'm sure they lost more customers. Would rather go to the Taco Bell in the same parking lot for same food, less money and not paying twice.
