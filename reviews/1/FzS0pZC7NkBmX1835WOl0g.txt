There is nothing "authentic" about the food that this restaurant is serving. I would like to know what region of Mexico that the previous reviewers have traveled to in order to make their statements valid. 
Let's start with the chips' salsa. Theirs is nothing more than commercially canned generic sauce that has had cilantro and onions added. Other reviewers say it is fresh meaning made from scratch, which it is not. If you have ever had homemade, you would know the difference.
I ordered the "Mix-itas", which is supposed to be equal parts shrimp, beef, and chicken fajitas. The shrimp was rubbery from overcooking, the chicken minimal, and it contained about three pieces of beef, which I had to dig through a pound of tasteless previously frozen onions and peppers to find. They serve it with canned beans and just-add-water bland rice. It did not come with sour cream or guac...just two slices of avocado.
I did not have any issues with service, however, I was there after lunch and there was only one other table. That factor makes me question the kitchens' attention to their cooking.
My iron-stomach gassed and churned the rest of the day and evening, which makes me wonder about the freshness of the ingredients...especially the rubber shrimp.
They can not offer enough coupons to make this a worthwhile dining experience.
