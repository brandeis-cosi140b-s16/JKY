I just went to Taco Bell and when I ordered my tacos, I was informed of their new policy to not serve a cup of water.  I could buy a bottle of water or pay for a soda, but they will no longer provide a free cup for water, even with a paid meal.  Taco Bell, you have lost me and my co-workers as customers.  Goodbye.
