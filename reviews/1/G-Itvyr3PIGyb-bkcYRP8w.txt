We love Rubios generally and the service is always exceptional. Tonight at exactly 9pm, we attempted to pick up some food after a long day. All the chairs outside the restaurant were on top the tables and the two high school aged employees inside seemed to be on a date more than at work. When my husband approached the door to make sure they were still open, the girl looked at her partner and quite obviously rolled her eyes as my husband entered. We asked if they were still open, since they did not appear to be, and she responded that they were open until 9:30pm. 
Needless to say, we opted not to have dinner there and are extremely disappointed with this Rubios experience.
