Went for lunch with coworkers on 1-14-15, extremely slow service. Food was delicious, but within 30 minutes of eating I had regretted every bite. I've been sick for 2 days now and that delicious meal is to blame. I eat Mexican quite regular and know I'm not allergic to anything they have, this is a case of food poisoning people. It's not worth the $10 you'll spend on a meal to miss a day of work. On top of that, the waitress didn't give me the correct change after I paid. Needless to say, I am very disappointed.
