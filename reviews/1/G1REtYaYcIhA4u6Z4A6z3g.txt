If you could leave the stars empty I would. Cut to the chase. They ran out of fajita veggies for my wife's vegetable burrito bowl and said it would take one min. After standing there with her awkwardly in line while people passed in front and behind 10 mins and about 15 customers went by. Then my wife spots the girl in the kitchen area grab raw chicken and put it on the grill and then touch the vegetables without cleaning or removing her gloves. Yeah, hope no one eats those vegetables!! Never going here again.
