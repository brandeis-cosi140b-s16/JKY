Disgusting!!! Worst place ever! It was dirty, loud, obnoxious and just plain gross. My tortilla soup was not even real tortilla soup it came with cabbage, celery and beef broth which is so weird. The fajitas came with green chilies instead of green peppers...maybe they ran out or something but that was bizarre. The lettuce was brown, tomatoes were old, my avocado and guacamole were brown too. So so so terrible. I can't believe we paid to eat there and I really don't know why we stayed. As soon as I walked in and saw the cheesy decor and the balloon man pestering patrons for tips, we should have ran for the door! 

Risa if this is an Arizona standard then I'm never eating Mexican in AZ again :)
