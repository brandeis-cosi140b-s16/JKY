Honestly, worst Taco Bell ever.

I love Taco Bell.  Its delightfully campy and delicious in a $3 way.  The wait  at this specific location is outrageous.  Sometime 30 min + in the drive thru with 4 cars.  No trays inside so you have to put your food directly on the table, and then they want to talk to me about my hair. I don't want to chat with you about my hair, I want you to clean all the trays people have used so I don't have to eat off the table tops which I'm assuming have also not been cleaned properly.
