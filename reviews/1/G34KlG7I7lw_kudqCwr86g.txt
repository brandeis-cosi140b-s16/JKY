This was my first time eating at Tijuana Flats and it will probably be my last. I asked for a burrito bowl and the waiter said they do not have that, but they have nurrito bowls. That's fine, I get building your brand, but maybe without an attitude. I got my order to go. I asked for no beans since I'm allergic and I still got beans. I gave my food to my roommate when I got home.. At least she approved!
