I won't come here again. 

To me, Chipotle has become my own Fredo. 

"I know it was you, Fredo. You broke my heart. You broke my heart!"

How dare you use SYSCO! How dare you! 

I know you are using SYSCO. I know it, Chipotle! Don't lie to me.  

You said that you were better than others. You said you wouldn't do this. 

"Chipotle's mission statement is called 'Food with Integrity' which states they source organic and local produce whenever possible [...]"

Bullshit! 

Is the meat also SYSCO-meat? Is it Frankenmeat! You lied. Liar! 

You have no integrity. No ethics. No shame. 

One star.
