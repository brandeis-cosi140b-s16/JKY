This was the worst service I have ever had anywhere.  My family should have just walked out it took over 1 hr to get our food out ( a family of 5) we  complained to manager and she said I'm sorry I only have two cooks tonight.  When the food came one meal was not even there.  one meal  was the wrong meal.  The third meal was messed up.    But to be nice the gave us 10% off that was a whole $4.86 off  what a joke. I will be never eating there again.  We spent over 50 dollars.  The only good part was the waiter was very nice and you could tell he felt really bad.
