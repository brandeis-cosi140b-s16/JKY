Waited 40 minutes for a $22 glass of wine.  By the time it came, the plane was boarding. Unfortunately, the one great server in the place was not ours but tried to help - manager and our server were not only incompetent and EXTREMELY rude, but ultimately accused us of not leaving enough money.  We gave the tip to our "non server" who tried to help us. Enter at your own risk!
