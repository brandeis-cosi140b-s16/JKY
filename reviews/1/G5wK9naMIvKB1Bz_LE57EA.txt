I'm very disappointed with my Robertos experience recently. I called at 7:15AM as I was leaving my house. The Robertos staff person told me my 2 bacon breakfast burritos would be ready in 15 minutes. I arrived Robertos parking lot at 7:30PM. I walked to Starbucks for a cup of coffee then arrived Robertos at 7:35AM. I paid for the food and the young lady helping me could only speek broken english. I asked her if my order was ready, she replyed by shaking her head yes. She walked away and walked over and spoke with the cook. She then walked to the back of the kitchen and started chopping up onions. After several minutes of waiting I asked about my food but the clerk just stared at me with a smile on her face. Because I had an 8:00AM appointment at 7:50AM, I asked for my money back. I left Robertos very disappointed. My recommendation is that you don't call in an order if you expect it to be ready when you arrive.
