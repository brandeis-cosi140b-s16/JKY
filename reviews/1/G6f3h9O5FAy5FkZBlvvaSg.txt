The breakfast burrito was not a good start to the day. If you order the bacon version be prepared for an avalanche of fatty bacon pieces with hardly any eggs or potatoes. It was a bad experience trying to salvage this item, but if I would have eaten it all with all that bacon, then a heart attack was not far behind. Would not recommend that item at all.
