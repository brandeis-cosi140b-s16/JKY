Bad. Very bad. Ordered a combo: sour cream enchilada, taco and tostada. The shredded beef in the taco was harder than jerky, the enchilada was an oily mess and the tostada was soggy. 

You can tell a lot about the type of food you are going to have by the salsa. True to form, the red sauce tasted like canned tomato sauce and the chunky sauce was about 80% jalapeno and no flavor.

There was a strange smell in the restaurant and I couldn't wait to leave.

I will not be back
