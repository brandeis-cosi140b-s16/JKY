So I walk into this place for dinner, sold solely by the name. I mean Nacho Mama's? Clever right? That was the highlight of my visit. The place is a bit of a dive, which I enjoy. Good number of TVs, decent number of beers on tap, and decent beer prices. However the food is nightmarish. It is absolutely inedible and straight up disgusting. I went with two friends. Between the three of us we had carne asada enchiladas, chicken enchiladas, and mini chicken burritos. The chicken was the worst I have ever experienced. It is very likely it had gone bad. It tasted of old fish. The rice had no taste at all, which was a substantial upgrade. The green sauce on the enchiladas tasted like salt and had no other real flavor. To make matters worse, the server was completely inattentive despite the fact we were the only people there. She was actually baby sitting her child in the corner of the bar rather than paying us any attention. I couldn't get out of there fast enough. It say the place is under new management but if my visit was any indication take your hunger and your money anywhere else. Worst dinning experience in memory and it's not close.
