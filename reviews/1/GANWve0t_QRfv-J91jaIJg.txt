If I could give no stars I would. The service was terrible, we were told it would be 15 minutes before we could be sat and there were 6 tables open. After we sat they took our order and after 40 minutes it came to the table slightly warm. The food was bland and I could have done better at home. I would go to Denny's over this. The  seats are uncomfortable and need repair and the loud music was a bit much. I couldn't enjoy a nice breakfast in some quiet.
