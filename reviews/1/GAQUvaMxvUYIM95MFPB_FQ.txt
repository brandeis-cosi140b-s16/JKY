This was a very disappointing restaurant to say the least.  The Host staff was very unfriendly and our Waiter was on his I-pad the whole time he was speaking to us and looked at us 2X - what a terrible way to start off the evening.  I should of ran than.  I ate the HOT red salsa and the HOTTER Green Salsa - only reason why I gave it 1 star- love the heat.  I ordered the bean burrito and my better half ordered the cheese enchiladas.  Poor to the taste and would of rather of gone to Macyo's and that is bad- I know!!!!  Stay away from Los Dos Molinos.
