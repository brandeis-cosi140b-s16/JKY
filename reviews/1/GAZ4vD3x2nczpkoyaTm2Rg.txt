This place was an all around disappointment.  
We were greeted with an empty lobby got to stand and wait for a couple minutes til someone came up and said "two?" No personality.  
The interior decor is very loud and old school, it 
just has a cheap feeling to it.  
The menu is the same way, loud, hard to read and jumbled.    
Server was extremely bland and really didn't have much knowledge of the menu or Mexican cuisine for that matter.  
We had hopes that the food would make up for the downfall in other areas, no such luck 
The chips were very bland and cold, the salsa was 
freshly made but bland and way over-onioned.  
We ordered fajitas, if a restaurant can do great fajitas, we figure the rest of the menu will be great.   
No dice, minimal amount of meat, small chunks of overcooked and bland meat made it a huge disappointment.   Can't believe I'm saying this but I'd head to Garcias before I went here.   
Quite a disappointment to say the least.
