I've been coming to this Del Taco for a few years now and, aside from a sluggish drive-thru and the occasional green/red sauce mix up, haven't had issues. Just went there on a "quick" lunchtime run. Had 5-6 cars ahead of me in the drive-thru and somehow ended up waiting 15 minutes to order and another 5+ minutes to get to the window to pay. I watched people who had been behind me in the drive-thru (but weren't trapped by the actual drive-thru like I was) back up, go inside, eat their food, and leave before I'd even paid. 

Gal running the drive-thru totally butchered my order. Different number of tacos, wrong sauces on burritos, etc. Went inside to talk to the manager. Cashier told me they "weren't there." After I refused to simply accept them remaking an already wrong order (was charged for more tacos than I wanted), they grabbed the manager from the front of the food line. Manager was a total *****. Didn't care that their drive-thru was moving so slowly, didn't comprehend that I was charged for things I didn't even want, etc. Simply left it at I could A) Have my order remade or B) Get a cash refund. Told her I used a card and would prefer that to be re-credited. She clearly didn't understand that either, so I begrudgingly took the cash refund just to get out of there. She then threw the food into the garbage and tried to take my receipt. I told her she was leaving me something with a customer satisfaction number, she tried to make excuses, and eventually just handed me somebody else's old receipt.

Will be very surprised if I go back.
