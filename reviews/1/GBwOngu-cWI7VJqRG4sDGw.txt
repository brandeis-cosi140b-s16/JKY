Now I love El Pollo Loco. But this location  is not a good representation of the brand. They close early whenever they want and shut the grills down early. I came on a Sunday around 9, lights on but no one in sight or came to the speaker. Then yesterday they shut the grills down early. I mean come on!!! 2 times in a row and a couple weeks apart?!!! No bueno! Bad business. Operations manager is slacking big time
