I have been a big supporter of this restaurant and concept and recommended it to many people but after my experience today that is no longer the case.  

I typically come in for a drink and order food to go and the service and food has always been above average.  I always order the same thing with an extra side of Habanero Salsa and a Side of Fresh Habanero Peppers.  Today when I placed my order the bartender came back and told me the chef told her that I could not get the habaneros because they don't give sides of those.  He (Lorenzo) was behind the bar fixing the POS station and I assumed he was just out of the peppers but then what he said next was the last thing I would expect to hear.  He told me that they have plenty but that they have never given sides of the peppers.  When I told him that I have had the same order for the last 10 plus visits he proceeded to tell me that he didn't know where I got them and if someone gave them to me at the restaurant they must have gone to the grocery store and bought them because they did not come out of the kitchen.  If that is the new policy there is certainly a better way to handle it.  There was no need to insult my intelligence and imply that I was lying.  The bartender even came and apologized for him and suggested that he should not be out in the front of the house.

To make matters worse when I got home with my order I had one small plastic container with habanero salsa when there was actually a charge for the side on my bill even though I ordered my meal without guacamole and sour cream.  While I have no problem paying for the extra salsa (and peppers) I would expect a large side like I have received every other visit.

While I have enjoyed this restaurant in the past I am not sure I will be back and will certainly not recommend the restaurant to others going forward.
