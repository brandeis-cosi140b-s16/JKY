God this Filibertos is one of the worst I've ever had. My tacos tasted nothing like beef and the shell itself was sweet for some reason....my boyfriends Carne asada burrito tasted like beef soup in a tortilla not anything close to mexican foods. If you fed this to me while I was blindfolded I could not have guessed what it was. Beans and rice were very bland.
