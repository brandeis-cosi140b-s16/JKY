Service was terrible. The entire building smelled like sewer and no one flushed the toilet in days. The service was slow and the lady that took the order was not friendly and didn't greet or accommodate me in any way. I won't be returning to this location. When you run a business with so many other locations that you can easily go to a different one. You need to do something that makes you stick out and the experience enjoyable. This location did not do that
