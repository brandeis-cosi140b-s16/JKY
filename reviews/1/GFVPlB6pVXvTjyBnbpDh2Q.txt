If I could give this place 1/2 a star I would. 

Sat down (had to wait like 2 minutes for a hostess to even come to her stand) then after we were seated it look at least 5 minutes for anyone to come over. After someone did, I asked for a happy hour menu which the server said we could only have at the bar which was like 6 feet away from where we were sitting. 

Once sat at the bar, it took at least another 5 minutes for someone to come by and ask us for a drink order (although there were 3 people behind the bar already). Once we ordered our drinks, the server asked if we wanted a refill on chips for a small charge. A CHARGE FOR A REFILL ON CHIPS?!? What fucking Mexican restaurant forces you to pay for a refill on chips and salsa?!?! 

Food from the HAPPY HOUR MENU took 45 minutes to get as the assistant GM talked to the table behind us for 20 minutes (about where they were from) totally disregarding if we needed anything. Oh side note, she comped them guacamole just because and didn't bother to check on any of the other patrons. 

Food was very good, compliments to the chef, but service was below disappointing. For $50 I could have gotten Robertos, a bottle of Patron and just stayed home.
