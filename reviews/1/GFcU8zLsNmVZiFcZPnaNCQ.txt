Went to this establishment for the first time and I have to say it was a let down. I ordered a salad with a side of rice with 3 corn tortillas(1.17 for 3) and I received 2 corn tortillas and a salad with the end of a bag of tortilla chips. Also when they bring you your food they scream your name and look for you. Then you raise your hand and if they don't see you you have to chase after them before they give your food to the wrong person. My boyfriend ordered a burrito and a taco for $12 it was a rip off. The only cool thing about this place is the hot sauce bat but that's all this place has going for it. Woman who took my order was flustered and rushed through my ordering process as though there was a line(there was no one behind us) .Will not be returning & will not recommend this.
