It hurts me to have to give any Chipolte a single star but I am afraid that I have to.  Yesterday while enjoying a salad at this location I noticed a little black bug laying on its back in the bottom of my bowl with its feet kicking up in the air.  Gross, YUCK, and seriously were my initial thoughts as I held down my stomach flipping.  When I brought this bug to a workers attention I was told that they "Try" to wash the lettuce but sometimes this happens.  Sorry to say that this does not help me forgive the experience because I cannot help but think of all the bugs I may have eaten and not have known it.
