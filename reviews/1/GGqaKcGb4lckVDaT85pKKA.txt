Cleary a one star Mexican restaurant.  Wow, food is very blah.  That may explain why this place is not very busy on a Sunday evening while other places you have to wait 30 minutes.   Very disappointed in the quality of the food.  It's been about 3 years since I tried this place again and now I remember why I don't come here even though we live in the neighborhood.
