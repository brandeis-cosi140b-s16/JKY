I ordered the chicken quesadilla and taco combo.  Consistently the order is of various quality.  Usually I just chalk it up to "typical fast food".   This morning it was horrible.  The taco had almost no meat, a few shreds of lettuce and cheese was almost nonexistent.  I guess it's typical fast food.  Of coarse I went through the drive through and didn't find this out till I got home.  And you know what Leo Gets said in the movie Lethal Weapon about going through the drive through!
