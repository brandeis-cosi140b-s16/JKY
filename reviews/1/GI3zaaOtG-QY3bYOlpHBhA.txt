This was one of the worst Mexican restaurants I've been to in Vegas.  The chips were super cheap and salty.  I ordered chicken tamales which were so dry I could hardly swallow them.  Vegas doesn't have very good Mexican restaurants to begin with, but this was pretty bad.  The service was not very good for a Mexican restaurant, usually they are super fast and efficient.  I will definitely never come here again!
