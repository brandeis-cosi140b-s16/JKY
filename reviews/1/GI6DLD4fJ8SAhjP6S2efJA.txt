If I could give 0 stars I would. Bouncers there are a straight up joke. Waited in like for a solid 20 min only to get close to the front and have this arrogant prick of a bouncer walk up and tell me I couldn't get in cuz I had high top shoes that barely I mean barely covered my ankles. I was a lil peaved so I start looking around I see a handful of other ppl with even higher tops and this kid says "we got it don't worry about it" I sit there outside the line while I watch this kid and another tall bouncer look over at me n laugh as they don't go up to these ppl. I go back to them like what the hell, and they said get out out of here and don't worry about it. Fn joke of a crew this owner has running his or hers bar. Sounds like I got singled out and discriminated against. Love stuck up bars that think they're the shit and can do whatever the Fck they want to do. That's why Gringo Star was legit and will get my business over you hands down.
