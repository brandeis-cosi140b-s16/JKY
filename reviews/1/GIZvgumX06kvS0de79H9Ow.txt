Up to about a year ago, this was a good late night joint to fill your stomach on.

Unfortunately, the prices have gone up to such a point where I can no longer recommend eating here. Are you kidding me? 8.69 for the #3? This used to be 6.59! What on Earth caused the prices to skyrocket?
*Edit* HEY! The menu prices they have here on YELP are not the correct ones! These people are dishonestly advertising cheaper prices here than they actually have at their restaurant! Do not support these chiselers!

Asada burrito combo used to be 8 bucks and some change... now it's twelve bucks! What, is there a beef scarcity I am not aware of? 

The quality, being low rent late night fill your belly fare does NOT justify the exorbitant price change. If you want good Mexican, just go to an actual sit down restaurant, as they now cost the same. As for late night diners such as myself, there are much cheaper alternatives. Time to eat burgers instead.

Skip this place, it's only gonna rip you off these days.
