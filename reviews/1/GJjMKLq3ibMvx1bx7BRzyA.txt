Terrible, unfriendly service. Seemed like I was inconveniencing her so I walked out.

Revised review; I gave just place another chance. I went in this morning for breakfast and got the usual bad service. Not only that, I was short changed because she said she didn't have the change in the register to give to me. Are you kidding me!! If I'm short one penny, I have to break the bill and walk around with a pocket full of change. The lady behind me heard that and walked out. Then I get my food which was to stay, go to sit down and I can't because every single table in the restaurant was filthy so I ate outside. What kind of operation is this!? who runs this place!?who's the owner!!?? True, honest review this place just sucks!! Never again
