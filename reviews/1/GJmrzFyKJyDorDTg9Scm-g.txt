I work close by so go for occasional lunch. Lunch special price is good. The service can be hit or miss depending on your server. Food is good. But this week we were totally ignored by our waiter. My buddy complained to the manager (excuse us for being thirsty and wanting more tea) and got yelled at in return. I'm not making this up. Manager got super defensive and yelled at him. This is now the second friend of mine who has now declared to never return to this La Canasta location. Coincidentally, they are both named "James". Maybe La Canasta doesn't like guys named James. This last episode may be it for me too. I'm super easy to please with service personnel, but the manager's response was ridiculous, no way to treat customers.
