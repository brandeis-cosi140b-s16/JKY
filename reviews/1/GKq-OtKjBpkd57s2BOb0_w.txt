There was a rather large female employee sitting on the curb by the dumpster smoking a cigarette, no big deal. Then I parked and walked in to order. Listen, I'm a bit over weight too. I was approached by a very heavy male cashier, who kept touching his mouth and greasy face. It grossed me out so I left. You would think that being in the restaurant business you would train your staff proper hygiene. Won't be back!
