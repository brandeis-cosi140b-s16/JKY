Unfortunately my first impression of this restaurant is horrible and thus will not be back. On a Tuesday afternoon with no customers in the restaurant I had to order 3 times because the first 2 items they were out of. How does a Mexican food restaurant run out of Pollo Fundido?! I will not be back as the food AND service were not good.
