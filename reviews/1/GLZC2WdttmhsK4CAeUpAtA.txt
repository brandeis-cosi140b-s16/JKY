Had dinner tonight and ordered the mango salad. It came with out mangos and a couple other ingredients listed on the menu so I sent it back. The waiter said he was going to take the cost of the salad off my bill, forgot to do so and then deducted the full amount from my gift card. 

This experience, mixed with overall slow service is why I give them one star.
