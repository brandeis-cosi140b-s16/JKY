Obviously I am not alone in stating this is the WORST KFC ***POOR MANAGEMENT*** - If they do get your order correct the chicken is usually dried out - Employees are unprofessional and act as if you are an inconvenience to their day.  I have given this place 4 attempts and have always been disappointed.  I will not be going back!  I know they just remodeled however when they removed the debris they forgot the management.
