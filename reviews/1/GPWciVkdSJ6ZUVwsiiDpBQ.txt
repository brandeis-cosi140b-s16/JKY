I was so excited when they opened this new location!  The food was good the first few times I ate here and no complaints except for my last visit.  I ordered my usual egg and bacon burrito that is usually delicious but this time it reeked of fish! It was as if they cooked it with really old grease that was used for seafood...I was grossed out for days.  I ate a partial of it and regretted it big time. I won't be returning, very disappointed! :(
