Before you go to this restaurant be sure that you can handle very spicy food. We had asked our waitress how spicy the food was that we were ordering and she told us that it was mild. When we got our food we could not even eat it it burned our mouths and throats so badly. The waitress was very good at playing dumb. We will never go back here
