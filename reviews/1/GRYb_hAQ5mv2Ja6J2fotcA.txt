I have had decent experiences at most El Pollo Loco locations, however this was not one of them.  The chicken I was served was clearly from the day before.  In addition the portions were tiny.  Shriveled, dry and small for $9.  I will not return.  I would recommend not showing up until late lunch or after lunch time to ensure the meat is from today.
