Don't waste your time or a dime!! Pass the "ambiance" and keep driving! Horrible service. We sat outside for 20 min w/o any acknowledgement.  Had to move tables because ROACHES  were crawling all over the wall and seat cushion. Should of been a good to sign to leave . Food came and was the WORST ever. We ended up not even takin a second bite. Took the left over to go and headed downtown a s gave them to a homeless person!! To finally get my taco fix I drove to the strip for a hole in the way real taco spot !! I've NEVER been so dissatisfied!! Enough to sign up for yelp just to leave this review
