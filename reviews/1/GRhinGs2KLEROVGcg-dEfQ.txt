Awful! Customer service was terrible! The General Mgr with the red hair and beard was a douche! Our daughters friend had a finger nail in her food. My husband had a bug in his tea. And our son had a mosquito in his chips! The manager all but accused us of putting the nail in the food. Horrible! Never ever will we return!
