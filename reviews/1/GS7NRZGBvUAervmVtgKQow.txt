Today our dinner was not very good nor was the service. Waitress was not frindly at all more or seemed very put out when she was asked for anything. We got 2 cheese crisps well they were crisp alright burnt, the red chile burrito the meat was tough and 3rd the fish tacos also were very well done. They were not very busy not the best night to take my daughter out for her High School graduation dinner. I think we all would of enjoyed taco bell more. The last time we went 2 weeks ago it was only okay I did not update my rev8then as I don't like righting negative things and was hoping it was just a off night. Guess not seems like it's going down hill. To bad guess we will be going to Popoo's on Indian School for now on. Even if the parking sucks.
