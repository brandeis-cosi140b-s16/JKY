I've heard so much about this place and was happy to see try opened a location in the SW. Too bad I didn't get to try anything because after waiting inside for 10 minutes, nobody was there to assist. Sad that the place was empty and I could have easily walked behind the counter to make it myself. Hope I can try again when someone is able to take my order.
