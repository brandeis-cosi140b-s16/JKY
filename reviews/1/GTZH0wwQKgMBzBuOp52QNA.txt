The service was absolutely horrible. There were 7 of us gathering for a friend's birthday on a Tuesday night and from the beginning the service was less than impressive. We had to continuously ask for waters, our margaritas took forever to come and when our order finally arrived the food was all wrong.  The waitress was extremely rude and unfriendly; obviously had no intentions of trying to be a helpful server. We ordered a second round of drinks but never received them, instead our checks were brought to us, which were all wrong. When we inquired about the drinks the server told us we could not have them because it was simply "too busy" in the restaurant. I've never in my life experienced such poor customer service. The food wasn't even good enough to make up for the lousy server. Step your game up La Unica...never should you tell your customers you're too busy to bring them their drinks!! PS: the restaurant was half empty. Definitely would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. After reading other reviews it seems as tho this feeling is mutual.
