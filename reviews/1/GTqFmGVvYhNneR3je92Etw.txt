Worst exerpience I have ever had at a fast food place. Not only was it almost a 10 min wait to order in the drive thru with only 2 cars ahead of me but then they have me park the car out front and say they will bring it to me. I can understand if there is other cars behind me that have small orders so they can keep the flow going, but there wasn't any. I had to wait for 25 mins for them to bring out my food. I will never come back here again unless I bring a book with me to read while I wait for thus food to come out
