The food here was not good I ordered the chicken fajitas, tres leches cake  and the chicken was dry and had no flavor and the tres leches was super dry and disgusting . Now usually in mexican restaurants they give you chips and salsa or pico de gallo . I literally waited 15mins for them to come out before having to ask her about them .The windows were super foggy and dirty and the servers were literally standing around texting and not tending to the only 2 tables that were in there I had a resturant.com gift certificate for 10$ and they didnt even take off the full $10 !! the server said something was wrong with the system which was ridiculously a lie . i left my server a tip bc thats what i do but it took me so much to not want to bc the service was so rude. smh ! i will never step foot in this place again !
