Thumbs down for this place.  I was craving mexican food.  I always see alot of cars here each time.  I ate a combination plate tostada and taco with beans and fideo. The salsa had a weird taste then they brought us hot sauce that one was alright.  Chicken taco tasted like it came out of the can. Avacado tostada tasted from the bag not fresh. I'm originally from El Paso, Texas. Used to eating all sorts of mexican food. Even crossing the border to Juarez to get our fix on tacos, seafood and flautas...was very disappointed :(
