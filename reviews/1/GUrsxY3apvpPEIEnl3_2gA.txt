This place needs serious help.  We should've known better than to roll the dice considering the restaurant appeared abandoned around 6:00 on a Sunday evening, but I was really craving Mexican food.

The margaritas are a joke.  A splash of alcohol at best.  The rice and beans are inedible.  I'm positive the rice was made from a box, and poorly at that.  The food lacked any flavor or any thought whatsoever.  It really felt like food was nuked and thrown on a plate.  The tortilla chips are probably what gave this place its name; they were salty beyond comprehension.  

Worst 50 bucks ever spent.  Shudder.
