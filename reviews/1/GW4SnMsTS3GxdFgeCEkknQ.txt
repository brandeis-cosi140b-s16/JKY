Do not order delivery. I ordered my food at 6:15 and by the time 8:10 rolled around I decided to give the restaurant a call and they had my address wrong and apparently the delivery driver has been driving around for the past hour. They had the correct phone number and didnt even call to get the correct address. Then the guy over the phone at the restaurant, started arguing with me about how long ao i placed the order. Heard the food was good here, too bad I never even got the chance to try it.
