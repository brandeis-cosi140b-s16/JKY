Not sure why everyone is raving about this place.  My husband and I just moved into the area and we were looking for a good place to enjoy good breakfast burritos that had a drive thru. We read the reviews about this place and assume we couldn't go wrong.  Boy was that a mistake.  I got the potato, egg and cheese and it was so dry the only thing that made it edible was my homemade salsa.  My husbands chorizo burrito was so overcooked that it was inedible.  Why was shocking because I have never seen him put food aside no matter how bad.  We couldn't believe that they would put out food that was such poor quality.  He works in the food industry and commented that if one of his employees ever served food that bad he would fire them.  Instead of going back and giving the manager an earful we decided we would never go back.  We just realized that we read all the great reviews and were burned so we decided to write an honest one in case there are any people with standards looking forward to a great meal, so they aren't greatly disappointed.  That is the least we can do for fellow foodies.
