Against my better judgment, I gave Vida Vida another shot. The service could not have been worse; I should have walked out. To start, our server never introduced herself, just a snappy "what do you want to drink?" Right then would have been a good time to leave. After completing the order sheets we put them in the holder to signal we were ready. Server just ran by and grabbed them without saying a word; that would be the last time she stopped at our table. Our server's poor mood made us feel very uncomfortable. There was a lot of employee drama going on; plenty of heated looks and discussions between servers. I felt like I was in a terrible reality show.  

20 minutes waiting for our check and we were out of there. I may have been running with how uncomfortable the whole experience was. 

On a positive note, the food has improved slightly and the bartenders appeared friendly.
