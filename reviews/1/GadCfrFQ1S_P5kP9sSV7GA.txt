Well This week is my birthday and after a friend pushed me to let her take me to lunch at her fav Chinese food here!I never ate here before and gave it the EggRoll test What the H don't people know how to make an Egg rolls anymore?cause This place it wasn't hand made it was a frozen one you get at a supermarket horrible. Only a yellow shredded cabbage, nothing else but it was Soggy in center raw! And I asked Waitress for hot Tea? Was told we don't have that? I live in San Diego and they brought a pot of hot tea before you ordered! I long for those places here.! Well my friend ordered I forgo'd it & checkout said to cashier That was the worst EggRoll ! She said" sometimes you have good days & bad days? Never again!
