I just idled for SEVENTEEN minutes in the drive thru window at Senor Taco II location on Fountain Hills Blvd for ONE fish taco to be prepared to serve with the already cooked beans and rice to complete my dinner. The drive thru order taker Jonathan offered me nothing more than the smart ass smirk on his face  and the lame excuse that the order BEHIND me was "really big". When I asked for the manager on duty I was told it was Marlene, but she wasn't available. Must have been at Saguaro Lake catching the next fish for the order BEHIND me. Very, Very, Very good food at both Fountain Hills locations but why can't your management team work on the VERY, VERY, VERY poor service.  Train your personnel in customer service. Train Jonathan to save his smirk for someone who would appreciate his lack of charm and learn the words "I apologize for your wait. I apologize my manager doesn't deem you as a value enough to speak with you about our lack of service." And then wonder why the pizza place next store to you will be your demise because they can service people ten fold to your pathetic pace.
