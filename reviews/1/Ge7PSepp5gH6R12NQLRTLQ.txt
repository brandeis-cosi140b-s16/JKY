I went to Cozymel's this afternoon and it was horrendous. I've been to this location 2 times prior, and had mixed feelings.  I've had one good experience, but the last two have been terrible. I just figured it was a fluke last time, but alas nothing changed. The bartender that worked today made the worst margarita I have ever had. It was poorly made, too sour, and it was served with a piece of lime that looked like it had been sitting in the fruit tray for 3 days. My server was attentive and excellent, but that does not excuse the food and drink. My margarita was replaced by  a vodka and cranberry with no garnish that was too strong for me to drink without gagging. I squeezed the lemon from my water into the drink and it was marginally better.  Maybe they were trying to get me drunk to make up for that margarita, but apparently the bartender doesn't understand that if there's too much liquor and it isn't balanced, it throws off the drink. The food was so-so. Nothing to brag about, nothing to compliment. Largely bland and tasteless. I could of gotten better food at Roberto's. The only upside is the ambiance, which is fun and they have a great outdoor patio. It's close to UNLV and some of the off-the-strip hotels which makes it convenient. Regardless of the ambiance, conveniency, and good service you go to a restaurant to eat, not just for the pretty things outside and the courteous service.
