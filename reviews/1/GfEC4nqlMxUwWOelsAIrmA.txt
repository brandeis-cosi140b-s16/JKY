I love Chipotle I really do. I don't always come to this particular location but this is my first time at this store and my experience was horrible. The staff did not greet me, I felt rushed when I was adding my ingredients to my burrito and the young lady at the cash register was very rude when she took my payment. I understand that Chipotle is a growing company but I'm pretty sure that this corporation would not be please of they knew that customers were treated like this.
