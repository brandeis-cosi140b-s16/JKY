Last time I'm going to Saltys. It used to be great, the menu had a lot of super options and the service was great. Just found out the menu changed. The servers were all standing around doing nothing but chatting. The nacho meat choices on the menu said chicken ,pork or beef even though they no longer have pork. I had to get up at least 4 times to find our waitress...1st time was after sitting for 10 minutes waiting for a menu. I should have known what I was in for and just left. I used to love you Saltys but I'm afraid we're forever over.
