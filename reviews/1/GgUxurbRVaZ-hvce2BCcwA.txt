HORRIBLE SERVICE! Waited 20 min or so and that's because my boyfriend finally went up to someone to take our order. Which the server took forever to come to us and took forever to punch in our order! Mind you it was not busy at all. There were people who came after us who was helped first. Unbelievable.
