In and out. No, not the burger joint, that's how my experience went. Came in for lunch on a weekday with my parents and the first thing I noticed was the dead silence. No music - just the sound of clanking plates. There were only four tables and one of which was taking all of the attention of the two employees on shift. There seemed to be some issue with the bill with these folks so no one bothered to stop what they were doing to greet us or bring any water. Oh wait we did get a greeting, awkwardly on the way out as I told the owner we were leaving because it was too hot. He just stood there dumbfounded, as if he couldn't tell the temperature inside the restaurant was about 85 degrees. 

I used to come to this place all the time when I lived in queen creek a couple years ago. Man has it gone downhill. Must be new ownership or something, because I've never had an experience like this here. And I'd also like to note that this is a prime location right on the corner - no reason for this restaurant to be empty. There's obviously something wrong going on here.
