We ended up at Cabo Wabo because it was around midnight Sunday night and several other places we tried were closed or had long waits.  Cabo Wabo did not, and that should have sent a red flag immediately.  There was a pretty terrible karaoke band playing, and they were far too loud for a small place.  The waitress took awhile to take our order, and when asked what was good or recommended we were met with a blank stare.  She did not want to be there.  We ordered a couple margaritas and they were OK, but far too expensive.  When our food finally came, it was a little cold and just so-so.  I had the nacho plate thing (forgot what it was called) with the 12 chips, and it barely had any fajita meat on it.  Once we finished eating I waited a good 30 minutes to get my check, all while my ear drums were bleeding from the awful music.  My wife ended up going back to the hotel because the check took forever.  Overall, it was pretty bad food, bad environment, overpriced, and OK drinks.  You can do a lot better on the strip.  Heck, you can do better at a truck stop in the middle of Iowa.
