If you want great tasting food and warm, attentive servers, don't go here.  This was by far one of the worse dining experiences we've had in some time.  We dined on a Tuesday night, with only a few other diners there.  We were pretty much ignored for quite a while.  Chips & salsa?  Try 15 minutes after we were seated.  Food was abysmal.  The meat On my wife's nacho's were cold, they had to take them back to get nuked.  My machaca?  Dry, dry, dry.  Flavor?  Think cardboard.  Asked for corn tortillas, got flour.  On top of all this, kids were supposed to eat free as advertised on Tuesdays.  We were charged for both kids, they only removed one of the kids meals.  We finally spoke to the manager on duty, it didn't really seem that she cared about our concerns.
