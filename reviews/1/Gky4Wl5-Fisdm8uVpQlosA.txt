I searched on Yelp for Seafood and this place came up with great reviews so we decided to try it.  Besides, I love Mexican and my husband loves Seafood so we were excited to try it and get the best of both worlds.  I wish I had the opportunity to review their food, but we never received what we ordered.  Their service is HORRIBLE.  My hubby and I went here on a Saturday night and yes, the place was crowded.  But when you see others arriving later than you and getting their orders before you = not right!  I ordered a simple taco and enchilada and my better half ordered the fried, whole tilapia.  We waited over 45 minutes and yet nothing came.  And the waitress only came by once during this time to ask us my husband if he wanted another beer.  No, we want our FOOD!  Completely ridiculous!  Now, I'm not one to play the prejudice card but I can't help but wonder if this was because we were practically the only non-hispanic people in the place.  Since the waitress never came by again, we had to go up to the counter and ask for our check to pay for the drinks and leave.  They even tried to charge us for the entire meal we didn't even get and were surprised that we refused to pay for it!  What?!?!  They never commented at all why our food never came out.  If you are not hispanic, save yourself from bad service and stay clear away from this place.
