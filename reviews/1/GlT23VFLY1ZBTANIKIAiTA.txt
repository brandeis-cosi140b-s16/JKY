DO NOT EAT AT THIS LOCATION!!!
The food was only average
The restaurant was dirty
It was 85 degrees in the dining room and the woman at the restaurant said she couldn't turn it down :-(
To top it all off...I called the manager the next day to report that someone had fraudulently used my credit card the day after I used it at his restaurant.  I wanted him to know, just in case there was a pattern.  He was argumentative, not helpful or concerned at all. I have no reason to go back here.
