This place always looks packed at night time, and someone in my party used to love the restaurant's food. Decided to go for a late lunch, & received mediocre service in an obviously slow time for the servers- we were one of maybe three parties in the whole restaurant. Our food came out after what seemed like a long wait for the amount of business they had at the time, & appeared to have been sitting under a hot lamp for longer than it should have.. The beans & rice were bone dry & crispy. The enchilada sauce was half dried up, with it's accompanying enchiladas stuck to the plate. Overall, the food was terrible, especially for the price! I've had really great tex mex before, and Richardson's flopped in comparison. And with barely there service, I would not recommend this restaurant for tex mex. You can definitely do MUCH better.
