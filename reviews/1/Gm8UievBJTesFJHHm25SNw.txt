I've lived on this side of town since 2006. This place has to be a front for illegal activities.  There are never any cars parked there that it is amazing it stays in business. I get that this city was built on and flourished through corruption but I'm in awe how the police look the other way in the face of blatant crime. So sad. The food must be terrible if they serve any.
