Absolutely the worst experience we've ever had, and I love chipotle, ordered online and gave me a time to pick up my meal, I arrived a few min late and they haven't even started it yet in facet at that time there was only 1 person in line waiting for their food, I paid and waited and the line filled up they still didn't even start making my order until helping 2 or 3 groups of people  I waited about 20 min for my food, why offer an online "convenience" if really it's not, weren't even really apologetic either. My family goes out to eat 3 or 4 times a week, and love chipotle like I said, but we probably won't be going back to this one.
