Second time here, we sat in the bar, it wasn't very crowded.  It took an hour to get our food, 3 other tables around us got here food first after they sat down after us.  I had to go to the bar twice for drinks, my drink was made wrong the first time, and our waitress never came back.  We had to ask for water 4 times and they didn't bring it, finally the bartender brought us some.  When our waitress finally brought our food it was the wrong order.  Finally got our food and it wasn't great or outstanding.  We won't be back very disappointing, and we live close by and had hoped we finally found a good Mexican restaurant close to us.
