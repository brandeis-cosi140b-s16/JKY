Horrible service, mediocre food. When you have to flag down the waitresses to get a drink 10 minutes after you are seated, then flag another one down to get chips. 

Then you are not done eating and they clean around you and bring the bill right after. Then they sit right there and wait for you to sign your bill, you gotta be kidding me!! Never again!!
