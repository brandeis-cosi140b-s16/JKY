So let me start by saying the food is amazing. However, I received the worst service I've ever had in my life tonight (I go out to eat often). The first waitress came over and when we ordered our margaritas, she took our margarita order and proceeded to tell us that "there were a lot of fake IDs lately" and looked at us suspiciously. Then she brought us our drink and took our order. Mid order, she screamed at another waitress and said that she would take our order instead. The second waitress was pleasant. While we were waiting, our initial waitress came over as asked us what we ordered and then stormed away. When the food finally came out they didn't bring us everything we had ordered but we couldn't tell them because no one checked on us for the entirety of our meal. When we finally went to pay and get the things taken off of our bill that we didn't receive, our initial waitress was taking a personal phone call while ringing is out. I payed our bill and told her politely that I thought the service was very inappropriate. She was like "I'm sorry to hear that" in a very defensive manner. I gave her a funny look and she told her friend on the phone to hold on, and then said "what do you want me to be a bitch" and I said "no I just would appreciate a sincere apology and for you to address my concern and not take personal calls on the job." And all she did was scream at me "goodbye!!goodbye!! I don't care I'm gonna keep on with my personal call!! Goodbye!!" Needless to say I am calling management tomorrow and expressing my concerns that she made such a bad face for this establishment.
