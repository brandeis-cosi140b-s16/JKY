So tonight was a different experience than in the past. Tonight, we had our meal as usual. When the server brought us the check, she said "the credit card machine quit working so you have to pay cash", I said, "I have no cash, can you run it manually?". She said "Sylvia, the manager, said to go to Food City across the street, they have an ATM". 
So I had to get in my car and drive in the middle of a crazy rain storm to get cash. 
Had I known this when I first went in, I wouldn't have stayed OR I would have gone to the bank, get cash and come back. 
I know my business means little (or nothing) to them, after all, I've only been coming here for only 11 years. I've seen some bad reviews for Poncho's on here because of poor service. 
I get it now. 
Sylvia, is this your idea of a back up plan? A good manager would come up with a solution that is good for both the business AND the consumer..If there was only a way to process credit cards manually.. hhhmmmm!
