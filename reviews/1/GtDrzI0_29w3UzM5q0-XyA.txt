I went in knowing what I wanted to order, as I've visited Los Favoritos' other locations several times. It was a bean burrito with potatoes added to it but instead, she rung me up for a breakfast burrito without the eggs. The cashier overcharged me and was very uncourteous about it, saying it was the way they did things at her store. I don't plan on coming back and would recommend the other location on Ellsworth and Main instead. The building is very shabby too and you can't even stand or look at the menu without feeling claustrophobic.
