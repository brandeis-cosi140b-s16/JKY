The food is over priced. The restaurant has no place to sit indoors.  The exteror tables aren't even covered by a shade structure to protect you during the middle of the day when they are open.  They have limited hours. The food its self its okay, but I could get the same thing for a lesser price else where. they charge you per item, even the salsa 15cents for 1oz and 50 cents for 4oz.  No way!  Never returning here.
