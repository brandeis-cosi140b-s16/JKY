went here the 1st time we came through looking to buy a home.  The worst service and the food was NOT Good!!  We ordered tea and cheese enchiladas....how can you mess that up?  well try it and you'll find out.  the tea the waitress brought barely had any ice in it.  he asked for more ice, she brought a glass with ice and proceeded to dump the ice into his tea glass???!!!!! ugh....  the enchiladas took forever (about 20 minutes and were cold and hard.... again....don't waste your time, this is the worst restaurant and worst service we've ever had anywhere!!!!
