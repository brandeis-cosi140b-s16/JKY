My boyfriend and I went to this Filiberto's yesterday, my food was alright at best though one of my carne asada tacos felt as though I was trying to chew through an old boot. Unfortunately my boyfried, who ordered a grilled chicken burrito, was unable to eat his burrito. No more than 2 bites in he came across a 1.5" bone in his burrito. When we returned to inform them of this, the manager stared at us with a blank and uncaring expression even as we informed him that it could have been very dangerous if a small child had been served this burrito. We didn't even receive an apology, so we're definitely not going there again. I'd advise anyone with small children or if you just don't chew your food well not to come here, cause if you choke to death, they won't care.
