Let me just say I was highly disappointed.  3:00 on a Friday (no Happy Hour btw) and the place was empty besides two strange people practically doing it in the bar.  The waiter/bartender, WOW.  He's one of those guys who looks like he just rolled out of bed, superficially overly-nice but really doesn't give a crap.  After seating us, he decided it would be a good time to bus some tables instead of getting us a drink.  Then he decided it would be a good idea to mess around with the television, again, BEFORE asking us if we wanted a drink or even water. Finally we got a Corona with an old lime and ordered. We asked for a side of sour cream to go with the HOT salsa that they are so proud of, BEFORE our late lunch arrival.  He takes our order and poof, disappears for about ten minutes (I suspect he might have also been the cook) He comes sauntering out with our plates in a snap and exclaims "Oh, isn't this plate beautiful?!?" and then gives us the side of sour cream that was supposed to come out first. My girlfriend had a bean burrito enchilada style and said it was pretty good, I have one more good thing to say before I shred this place to bits.  The sour cream is the star of everything.  It really is wonderful.  I don't know what they do to it (probably piss in it) but it is tasty.  I had the most god-aweful taco salad (ground beef).  Not only was the plating lacking, so was the lettuce and vegetables, practically non-existent.  The meat was very salty and that's all you get on a little pile of pinto beans. Disgusting. DO NOT SUPPORT OVER-RATED PLACES WHO DO NOT GIVE A #$%^! !
