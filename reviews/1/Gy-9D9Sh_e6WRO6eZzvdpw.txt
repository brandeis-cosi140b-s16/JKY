I had the enchiladas which were absolutely disgusting. The sauce tasted like tomato paste with absolutely no flavor. The cheese was not melted on the inside and then they piled on the Oaxaca cheese which all combined was horrible. I had to go have them microwave my plate to melt it and still no good. Boyfriend ordered carnitas tacos which were ok and we ordered shredded beef taquitos which were covered in a cilantro sauce. The sauce just tasted like pulverized cilantro yuck! Will not be returning to this place again!
