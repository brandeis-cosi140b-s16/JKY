My family went to eat at El Conquistador on Friday 1/23 at about 7p.m.  It took us 10 minutes to even get menus. 10 minutes after that, we still had no water, chips and salsa or place settings and there were many other tables in the same situation.  It looked like the two owners were trying to wait on all of the tables themselves so there was no end to our wait in sight. We ended up walking out never to return which is unfortunate since we are Moon Valley locals and try to patronize nearby businesses first.
