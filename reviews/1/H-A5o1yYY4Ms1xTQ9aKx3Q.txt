My best friend and i used to go here after school when we were in high school. We got kicked out because we were laughing loud (wasn't busy at 3-330p) and because i left a 50 cent tip because of poor service. i agree with the reviews their service isn't great and the waitress got the gall to tell us you can't pay a waiter a tip like that we live off on %5.15/hr i said that is not our problem tell your managers to pay you more plus anybody can leave you a good tip, poor tip, or no tip at all!

we were asked to leave because of that and the blonde manager was such a you know what! last time we went there, they got new people but the blonde manager was still there eyeing me and my friend all the time lol. back in 05 or 06, i got some money to take my boyfriend there to try it out. he liked the food as we both did but haven't been back in a long time.

the restaurant needs more training on manners and good service! it was the service that was bad more than anything else. it's not the customers' fault that you are getting paid on tips and a low wage if you thought it's scottsdale that you'd be getting 11/hr think again!
