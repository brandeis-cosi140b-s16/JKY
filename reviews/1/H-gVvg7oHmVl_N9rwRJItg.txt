Good food,when the lazy douches decide to work. Oh ya...we are open sundown-3am  WED-SUN. BIATCH PLEASE!!! You are never open Sunday night any I went there THURSDAY night ay 9pm and guess what.....the owners were too sleepy to be open. I starved all night so I could get your food at 8pm, when you were supposed to open,and I went but again at 9pm and NOT OPEN! So now I am starving because you  are LAZY! This is war. Enjoy your FB and Yelp because I will make you feel the pain I feel in my stomach right now, you lazy border jumpers!!!
