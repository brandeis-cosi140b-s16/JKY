Ok so far poor service.  Finally saw the cook bring our food. Waitresses were wrapping silver ware, while the food sat on top , waiting to be served to customers. 
My eggs cold (scrambled) & my husband's were good. All in all very disappointed this time.
Cost for the special & my "deuces wild,  1 coffee & 1 milk was $23.
