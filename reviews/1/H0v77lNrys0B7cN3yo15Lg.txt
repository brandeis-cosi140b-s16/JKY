I've  been to many robertos locations and this is by far the worst of them all. I ordered a carne asada burrito which I didn't  get til 25 minutes later and that's being the only person there. It took them 20 minutes to cook up a batch of meat of at least 20 pounds. Why didn't they cook up the small amount to get me going verses cook up the whole cow and make me wait during my lunch hour. 

Secondly, I was served a burrito with flavorless meat. They didn't  even bother sprinking any salt in the meat let alone seasoning. Overall the worst burrito ever!
