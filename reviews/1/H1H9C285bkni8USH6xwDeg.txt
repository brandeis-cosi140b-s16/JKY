This was our favorite neighborhood spot. 

Was. The last two times our service has been so terrible it is unbearable. Over thirty minutes to have our order taken. Longer for drinks to be delivered. And a very annoyed condescending server when we asked questions. 

There are many places nearby that would be better. We will not be back. So sad to see this place slide into decline.
