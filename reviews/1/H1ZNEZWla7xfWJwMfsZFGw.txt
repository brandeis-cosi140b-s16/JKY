If I could leave zero stars I would. This place is disgusting and has terrible service. While there I saw three bugs, one that was crawling on our table. It took forever for them to take our order and also to bring the food out. Ordered the red chili burrito & it was the worst thing I've ever had. Not sure how people think this is authentic mexican food. It tasted like crap. Not to mention how overly priced it was. I will not be going back there. 

Thanks for ruining my night!!!!
