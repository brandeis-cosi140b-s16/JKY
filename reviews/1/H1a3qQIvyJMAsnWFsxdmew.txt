Food was pretty disappointing but since I don't have high standards for airport food I'd be willing to let that go to except....the service was awful...absolutely no customer service, rude, staff checking their phones right in front of customers, dropping things not picking them up. They had no diet soda...because they ran out and even though beer/wine are on the menu you can't have any because "we aren't allowed to serve it cause we are underage" . Note to managers if you have alcohol on your menu have some staff that can serve it and find some employees that show a little respect for having their jobs!
