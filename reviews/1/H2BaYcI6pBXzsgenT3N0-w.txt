We ordered 2 different tacos, the bang bang shrimp and the shrimp with avocado. Neither had much flavor. Both were overrun with cabbage. The shrimp with avocado had numerous pieces of chicken mixed in. The sauce drenched the taco shells leaving them soggy. The avocado was sparse. The bang bang shrimp had zero bang. I was really excited about this place and waited in line a long time to be completely disappointed. Do to the fact that I would not go back, I will rate 1/5 stars.
