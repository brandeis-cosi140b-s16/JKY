Worst food ever...they should be ashamed to call those things fish tacos..since when do you make fish tacos with frozen fish sticks??? The shrimp cocktail was even worst and we order a guacamole with shrimp and the guacamole was bad. Our waitress disappeared and no one else came to help us. And please someone tell those guys playing music the suck and to at least put the volume down. Its a shame and a waste of space, you need to get a real Mexican seafood cook and get rid of the music...
