I was in the mood for Mexican and immediately when I saw this place, my boyfriend and I decided to check it out.  We both were disappointed.  First, our waitress took awhile to ask us what we wanted to drink.  Then, we stated we needed additional time to look at the menu and I kid you not, she gave us 30 second (no joke) and came back to see if we were ready.  We stated no, we needed a few minutes, and she came back 1 minute later, and we just kinda looked at her confused, why was she rushing us to order?

Then, we made our decision, closed our menus and waited over 15 minutes for her to take our order (and the restaurant was not business).

You have to pay for Chips and Salsa - which was so-so.  I ended up ordering a Steak Burrito and it came with Rice/Beans.  The rice and beans were not tasty and the burrito was stuffed with the same rice and beans and barely any meat.  Did not enjoy.  Also, our waitress never came to the table to ask us for refills or even for the bill.  After finishing our meal, we probably waited 15-20 minutes before flagging her down asking for the bill.  Mind you it still was not busy.  I will definitely not be back to this restaurant.
