we have been here twice since we wanted to give it a chance, we love the same restaurant in cave creek... Sorry to say this is a 2 time looser! The food is horrible and I mean horrible. I had fish tacos that were a joke.. tell me somebody where you hid the fish?? the flavor was not there and the carne asada my husband had was cooked like shoe leather even after he asked for it medium. There was no flavor at all and the side of rice was old and dried out. The black beans I had were so salty I only needed one bite to tell me these were heading to the garbage. It is worth the drive to cave creek to enjoy the atmosphere, delicious food, drinks and wait staff that made this restaurant popular "the original El Encanto!!
