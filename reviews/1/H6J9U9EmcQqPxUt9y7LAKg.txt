My wife and I went there this past Saturday for lunch and sat on the patio.  Our server Angela completely blew us off the whole time.  My wife never received a refill on her soda, there was never a checkback on our meal, and when we sent our appetizer back because it came after the meals were delivered we were shunned upon.  We watched one table get up completely after waiting twenty minutes to be served, another group next to our table had to go to the bar to order their drinks, and it just went downhill from there.  Never in my life have I had such horrible service that I tipped zero, but for this meal I did.  When I went to leave I asked for the manager, the girl said he is over there, and then I had to hunt him down.  When I explained to him, there was absolutely no apology, and the manager just asked who our server was.  

The only bright side of the visit were the tacos which were amazing.
