I am so bummed to be writing this, but I truly think that the owners need to keep a better eye on the patrons of their business. I came with a group of 10 people to watch Sunday football. We ordered food & beverages. The drinks and the prices were great. We even enjoyed (win or lose) talking to other complete strangers about how the football season was going. They had different games on several television screens which was great - UNTIL- mister obnoxious with the Dallas Cowboys jersey with Aiken on the back started mouthing off at the bar. He was by himself (1st clue) drinking a single beer & no food (2nd clue) drunk (3rd clue) but not a single staff member asked him to stop shouting across the bar and talking smack. Not a single person in the entire restaurant even mentioned the Dallas Cowboys but this idiot proceed to get in several peoples face about their teams, and even physically touched people provoking them. Three men sitting at the bar got up to go outside to avoid this jerk - and STILL not a single person working there told him to leave. What this means to me is that C.C.'s would rather not 86 a bad customer, but instead lose hundreds of dollars from good customers. This is a poor business decision because everyone- including children- who had to witness this behavior have lots of other options where to spend our money.
