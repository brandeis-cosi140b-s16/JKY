Me and my friends love this place but maybe everybody that worked there was having a bad day. I felt rushed and the girl that made my burrito keep saying that she "should've locked the doors" and "she was tired". I just didn't feel welcomed at all. Someone needs to do something about the night staff or we will not return. Also my chips were old and the rice was cold smh!!!
