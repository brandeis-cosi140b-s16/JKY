I decided to give this place a try because its literally a half block from my salon and the people at Mr.K start to remember my order since I eat there so much in one week.
I absolutely regretted it. I remember Chipotle burrito was alway so massive which make me over eat due to not wanting to waste food. But I swore there's an option for regular size or small size burrito. Well I was wrong. I ordered the steak burrito. The guy behind the counter suggested adding cheese to it since the steaks are a little spicy. Umm I don't do spicy so I listen to him and add cheese. 
What got me soo perturbed was that he was so busy flirting with me by asking me a ton of non related burrito questions that I feel like he man handle my food. He slap more than enough black beans on my burrito, throw very little cheese in, didn't distribute the ingredients evenly so when he tried to roll it, it tore apart. After he rolled it, saw the disgusted look on my face, ask if I refer a tortilla to be wrap OVER THE original burrito, meanwhile trying to tuck all the over flowing ingredients under the roll so I don't see it. Really??!!  Another employee saw my face, he tried to save the situation but its beyond saving. 
The burrito was ok. It is spicy and the little cheese that was in there didn't help. I will definitely try Chipotle again. However, I will not go back to this location. I truly believe food should look pretty. We eat with our eyes first. But this didn't happen here.
