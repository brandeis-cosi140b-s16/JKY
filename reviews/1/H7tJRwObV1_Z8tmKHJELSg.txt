We use to really like the Salted Lime. However each time we have gone the service and food have been a little worse. Last night will be my last time going. Not only did it take 1 hour to get out food, but once we did my first bite was rocks... Literally. The waitress  saw me spitting out my food and told me they have been having that problem with the beans... So it's been a problem they know about, however have not fixed it? Our food came out dry as if it had been sitting awhile. Keep in mind that the restaurant really wasn't very busy. When we received the check the waitress said our drinks were complimentary because of the rocks. I had a water and my husband had a beer. Really sad, I hope it turns around or they come up with something better.
