Slow service. Bland food. Very meh.  

My ground beef taco seemed to lack any mexican seasoning. Rice tasted like... not much of anything. You get the idea. The idea of the salsa bar was nice. I like getting a choice and there was one in particular I really liked. But that just can't make up for the slow service and bland food.
