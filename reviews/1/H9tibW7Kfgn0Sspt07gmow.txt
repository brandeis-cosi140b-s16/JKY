Honestly I wish I could do less than 1 star.  I have been in dozens of Chipotle as I travel a lot.  This is the worst I've ever been into.  Two orders in front of mine were messed up and had to be redone.  After ordering a salad and then waiting in line for over 15 minutes, I just gave up and left.  I had my food from Panera in minutes.
