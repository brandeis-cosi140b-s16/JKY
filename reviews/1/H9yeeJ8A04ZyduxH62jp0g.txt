I found a piece of metal like a bread twist tie in my nachos but with out the plastic coating. I have contacted the store and the Corporate office 5-6 times and nobody seems to care. I am fed up with this place! I seriously could have choked to death on it. When I went to the store to show them nobody even apologized.

Not a great way to run a business and keep your customers happy.
