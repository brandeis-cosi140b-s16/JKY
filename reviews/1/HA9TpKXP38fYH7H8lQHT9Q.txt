Take the meanest rodeo bull in history, 'Bodacious', carve him up into tiny chunks, and serve him in a green chile burrito and you'll come fairly close to one of La Canasta's delights.

The meat was like a dog's chew toy, save for the chirp when you bite down on it. 
They should discount anything containing chunks of beef due to their featuring DIY tenderizing. 
They should also have a conspicuous warning sign on the menu reading:

                                               !!   WARNING  !!
          
           OUR BEEF PRODUCTS REQUIRE CHEWING. LOTS AND LOTS 
           OF CHEWING. IF YOU POSSESS ALL 32 ADULT TEETH, PLEASE
           PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK!
           IMPROPERLY CHEWED CHUNKS OF OUR BEEF COULD RESULT
           IN A HIDEOUS, BYSTANDER REPULSING, DEATH FROM CHOKING
           SINCE ITS PRETTY MUCH A LOCK THAT NO-ONE HERE WILL KNOW,
           PRETEND TO KNOW, HEARD OF, OR CAN EVEN PRONOUNCE
           THE TERM  'HEIMLICH MANEUVER'. 
           ACCORDINGLY, MANAGEMENT STRONGLY RECOMMENDS A
           CHEWING REGIMEN TANTAMOUNT TO A RABID HYENA.
           MAULING, FOLLOWED BY GNAWING, AND EVENTUAL MASTICATION
           IS ENCOURAGED.
          
            THANK YOU.

Stopping here was NOT my idea. My spouse, who still lives in the eighties, will do anything to once again sample their green chile of yesteryear.
I keep telling her it doesn't exist, but she keeps sending me back every few months, hoping it was 'just a bad batch'.

Tonight's bad batch left her with five chunks of unchewed beef on her plate, followed by a bathroom clearing bout of diarrhea.
My bean burrito was pretty tasty, as usual. 

Five stars for their bean burritos.
I'm deducting four stars for their diarrhea inducing cuisine that cheated me out of my Friday night freak.
