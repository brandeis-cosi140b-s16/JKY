It's me again the girl with no picture but here comes the review anyway,,.I should have checked with my fellow yelpers but alas I did not. My hubby and I stopped in Pink Taco on Saturday thinking it was a great place to grab and appetizer and a margarita and sit on the patio. HUGE mistake...this place has to go down as having the absolute WORST service. Our waitress looked like she had a REALLY rough night the night before and while friendly definetly was not quick on her toes and those nails....anyway besides the service (had to go to the hostess to get silverware and napkins). We were served water...finally... in a really crusty glass....come on people how can you not notice these things....our margaritas tasted like coconut and I am pretty sure they left out the tequila but hey it was HH so you gotta save somewhere. The queso dip was the oddest queso ever....I think they just pile a bunch of leftover whatever in it and then never asked if we needed more chips to go with it....I will however give thumbs up to the chicken skewers which were tasty and worth the five dollars. It's too bad because the place has potential just lacking in the detail and execution.....
