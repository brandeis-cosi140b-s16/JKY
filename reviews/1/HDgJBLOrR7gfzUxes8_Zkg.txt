The fact of the matter is that I can't figure out how this place stays open.  We met several friends on Sunday, to catch a couple of games and generally speaking, it's a pretty good sports bar

In no time at all, virtually every chair in the place was taken which ought to be a good thing right?

However, waiting 20 minutes for a drink or 20 minutes to put in a food order is the kiss of death in my book.  They were so under staffed that our waitress said she was ready to walk out.

This has happened the last 6 times we were in there ...  Bad service combined with normal or average food.

Won't be going back ....  Don't knows who manages this place but firing that person would be a good start.
