Basically a dirty Chipotle rip-off.  Our family wandered in there on a Saturday afternoon a little after lunch time and the place was empty. The two staff members behind the Chipotle bar didn't say a word to us while we looked at the menu, just continuing their conversation.  The cheap tables and chairs were covered in food scraps and napkins, and it looked like the floor hadn't been swept all day. We took a look at the menu and the prices and asked ourselves, "Why don't we just go to Chipotle?" We turned around and left, and the workers still didn't bother to stop talking to each other.  

Can't comment on the food because the place clearly didn't deserve our money.  Maybe it's good enough to warrant such shoddy service and conditions, but by the empty status on a sunny, Fall, Saturday afternoon, I strongly doubt it.
