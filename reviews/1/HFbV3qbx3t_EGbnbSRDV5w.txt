Decided to give this place another try. Pulled into the drive-thru at approximately 11:30 PM and there was a line of cars waiting to place orders. Taco Bell.com said that the store was open until 12am. All of the lights were still on including the menu lights.  However nobody would answer the intercom. Finally the cars in front of me pulled ahead through the drive-thru. When I stopped at the window and got somebody's attention that was working inside the store I was told that the hours are messed up and that they have been closing at 11 PM. They had no clue that they had a line of cars clear out to the street. If you are not going to post correct hours please turn the lights off when you close up shop.
