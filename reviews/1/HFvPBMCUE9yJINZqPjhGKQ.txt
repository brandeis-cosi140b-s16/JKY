Not my choice to even come to Palace Station for any reason but my friend wanted to go to the Oyster Bar.  I actually heard really great things about it.  However, we were on a time crunch and the line was long and the only thing open in the casino was Cabo Mexican Restaurant.

The only reason they even get 1 star is because I got my chips and salsa in a timely manner, and the manager gave us a free round of drinks and 20% off our bill at the end.  They really should get zero stars though.  Our drinks took forever at the bar, my friend's steak was way over cooked,  the waitress was slow, the ambience was not great, I can go on forever.
