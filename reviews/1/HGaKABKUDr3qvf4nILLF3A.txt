I used to frequent Gallo Blanco until I moved away from Downtown. I was in the area and was so excited to come back and was disappointed when I walked in about realized it had changed. We stayed anyway and the disappointment never changed. I missed the old guac, the tacos were mediocre (some of the shrimp tacos had ONE shrimp) and the sangria was only ok. On a positive note the server was excellent. This place used to be packed, but this time it was pretty empty on a Friday night and I completely understand why.
