Just had dinner at this location with my boyfriend. The food was fine but we were really disappointed with the service. Worst waiter EVER! He looked very young and seemed like it was the first time he'd ever waited tables. We sat down, 10 mins later ordered drinks, 10 mins later got the drinks & ordered food, then about 15-20 mins later we got the food. The waiter dropped our tortillas on the floor. Everything was really shaky and drinks spilled over as they were served. It took about 10 mins to replace the dropped tortillas. The waiter kept apologizing to our table and all the tables around us. At one point we overheard him say to other guests "oops, I definitely just burned myself." In sum, it was a real shit show. I blame the restaurant management for employing that individual as a waiter without any training or experience.
