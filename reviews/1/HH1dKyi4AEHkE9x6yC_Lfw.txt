Just tried the "new" restaurant. Please note this is under new ownership, not Sirrines' restaurant.
What a major disappointment.  My wife and I ordered chimi's (shredded beef).  First the chips are greasy, the green tomatillo and red salsas are really poor.  Now to the entrees. First we really want to like this place because we love the location but unfortunately the food is absolutely abysmal. Beans-right out of rosaritas can, rice had zero taste, no seasoning, no flavor.  The guacamole is right out of the 2 dollar container, with all its terrible fake taste and the meat was dry as a bone, no moisture, no flavor or seasoning and this was at a $14.00 price per entr√©e.  Sorry but stay away from this place and remember its former glory, you won't find it anymore at this place. Service was attentive and friendly so this is all about the food. Obviously the owners who really raised the prices here, don't care about food quality.
