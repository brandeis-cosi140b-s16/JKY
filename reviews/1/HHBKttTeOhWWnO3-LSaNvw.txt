My husband and i went here because he was craving tacos and I however wanted something different than taco bell. It wasn't packed at all for a Sunday's lunch. We ordered taco asada and a side of taquitos. 

The food:
We only wanted tacos so that is what we got. The chips and salsa were good but the medium salsa didn't have that kick I was looking for but it was good. The taco asada was good. It had great flavor. While we were waiting for our food we got two beef tacos. We thought it was prt of the deal. It was good but the meat was a little watery. Anyway when we asked for our taquitos the waitress looked at us as if we had them. She says you had them earlier. My husband and I looked at each other and told her we didn't. Anyway they confused taquitos with tacos. Really how could you do that?  

The ppl there were great. They were really nice. They even held the door for my husband and I while we were carrying our triplets.
