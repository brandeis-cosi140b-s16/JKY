Don't waste your money here. Especially on a cabana. Once you hit the amount you have to spend ($300 minimum) they kick you out. It was our friends birthday and we planned on celebrating all night but instead service was horrible and we were asked to leave once we spent $300. When asked for a detailed transaction receipt, our server said "Seriously?". I will never go back and I'll make sure my friends never go there. I didn't even want to give them a star rating. Hate this place.
