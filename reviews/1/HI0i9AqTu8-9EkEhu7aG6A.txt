Terrible. We tried to eat here. Not even 8 pm and they were out of steak and chicken on a Saturday night then they proceeded to tell us they can start some steak "if we want" No it's cool don't inconvenience yourselves on our behalf, you're only a restaurant, guess having food for your paying customers isn't a priority. And we drove all the way here from surprise for this place.
