Worst El Pollo Loco I have been to in quite a while. Visited here on the 12 of September in the evening. The staff that night was very rude and not helpful at all. The service was terrible, when our food was ready our name wasn't even called. Not sure who the young lady is who may be a shift manager or manager of some sort, she is rude and had a group of friends or relatives in the restaurant getting free drinks and being very loud. Disappointed with this place and will never return to this location.
