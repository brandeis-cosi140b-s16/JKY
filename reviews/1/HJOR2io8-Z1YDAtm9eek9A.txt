We had made a purchase at this location through drive through. We had to remind the cashier that we had drinks she had forgotten to give them to us, I ordered 17 tacos and drove home. When I got home we were only given 12 tacos. My husband called and confirmed if it was okay we go back and get the rest of our order since we were not given the order complete the person on the phone said sure no problem come back. We drove back the cashier at the front window called me a liar once she said that to me I asked for her name and her managers name. She would not give me any information. She informed me that since she was not there during the transaction that I was not telling the truth. I was embarrassed and shocked with the attitude and customer service that I received at this location. I told her that is why we called before and now we don't get our complete order, we don't get our money back and we don't get an apology for driving back only to get treated horribly. The issue was not resolved I had to leave my name and number and was told someone would call me. The owner called me the next next and informed me that cameras showed otherwise and that I was cussing at his cashier Im appalled. Im reporting this to th BBB I have never been talked to or treated this way ever!!
