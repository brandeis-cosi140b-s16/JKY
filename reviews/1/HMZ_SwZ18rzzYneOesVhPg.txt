First time eating there. There were over 10 employees behind the counter and no one had any direction. there were only about 6 customers in the dining area and they were already eating. We were the only ones in line and they were rushing taking our order.

I stated that it was our first time here so we didn't know how things went for the order here. They still didn't be patient with us or change up the un needed speed and sloppiness. Didn't even ask if I wanted corn or flour tortillas for my tacos. after making my food the girl had to redo my order bc I wanted corn tortillas.

Upon check out the guy didn't even say "thank you, have a great day" just rushed through with my transaction with a confused look on his face as if I was a burden to him or something.

WORST fast food experience in a very long time..

I've experienced better customer service from A young boy at a Mc Donalds drive through by himself (literally taking, making, and ringing the orders) and a long line of cars were behind me and in front of me. he still was organized and had time to thank us and tell us to have a great day with a smile on his face. 

Ps, why have a "NOW HIRING" sign up if they o b v I o u s l y had the WHOLE staff behind the counter!? all bad. someone should definitly take some leadership In this location. Makes me think they are all like that.
