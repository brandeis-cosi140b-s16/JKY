I think they must have changed owners. The place looked completely different. The service was slow. I ordered a lunch plate of taco, enchilada, rice and beans. For the Mexican restaurant expert, the "Speedy Gonzelas" 

I think it was the worst Mexican food I've ever eaten. Even Taco Bell's tacos were better tasting than this one. I took a few bites and asked for my check. The beans seemed to contain more lard than beans. The rice was dry and the salsa seemed to come right of the can.

If you looking for decent Mexican in the neighborhood, head to Cantina in Stonecrest or Senor Tequila on Rea Rd. Worth driving a few extra miles.
