A wasted cab ride for mediocre food

The Barrio Cafe is horribly overrated.  Upon arriving at eleven for lunch, they tried to sit us in the very back, next to the bathroom, even though the place was empty.  The house margaritas were okay, but not even close to the ones from Sam's Cafe.  The chipotle chicken dip was a mess of cheese and slimy chicken, slimy spinach, and slimy mushrooms.  You sense a theme?  The smokey, sweet flavor was good for a bite or two, but it quickly became an unappetizing mess.  My husband's pork was supposed to be the special of the restaurant, but it was nothing special, and some of it was unbearably dry.  My enchiladas del mar were smothered with a horrendous quantity of cheese, and I had no idea how I was supposed to eat them, as there seemed to be mere scraps of blue tortilla amid the massive amounts of sauce and cheese.  The shrimp were decent sized, but undercooked (understandable since the tiny scallops and crab would cook a lot faster).  The churros were the highlight, but they couldn't save the meal.  Lunch ran over $100, plus cab fare.  I would rather have given the money to one of the homeless people by the Hyatt Regency.  

Another chef told me that the head chef of Barrio Cafe has left, so maybe that explains the divergent reviews.  All I know is that I would never go back to this restaurant.
