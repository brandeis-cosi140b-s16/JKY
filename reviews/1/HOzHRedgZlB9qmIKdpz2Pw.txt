I ordered there before and they forgot the sour cream and this time I ordered a chicken burrito and got a beef, when I went to return it they gave me a hard time and I explained that is not what I ordered and the worst part is I ordered chicken not beef and they looked at me clueless! just got my money back and went to Chipotle!
