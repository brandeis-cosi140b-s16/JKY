Ate there today, 3/8/15. Food came cold. Sent it back. Waited a long time. The salads and mini tacos were nothing great. The green chili is green enchilada sauce with something else green. Very unremarkable . The drinks were avetage. Check came ...we were charged doible. The waiter corrected the bill. Music was loud and obnoxious. We are in our 60s. But still. We wont be returning.
