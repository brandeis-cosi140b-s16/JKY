I honestly do not know why this hotel has such a difficult time finding a decent restaurant. The hotel is really a great boutique hotel. But definitely go off-premises for food. There's no need to regurgitate the other bad reviews, but if you chose to go and actually have a nice time (in my experience that would be a 1 in 4 chance), then good for you. But in an area where within a few mile radius you can eat infinitely better and for cheaper, you might just be a nickenpoop. And the restrooms have consistently been sub-par. Just think, if a restaurant can't keep a bathroom clean (which is very simple to do), what must their kitchen look like?

But if you're in this for the weird status symbol stuff, then go here and be seen. It's one of the "required" spots for that sort of thing -- at least once.
