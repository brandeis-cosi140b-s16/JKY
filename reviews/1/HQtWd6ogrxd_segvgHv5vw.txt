The food is edible, but the rudeness from Enrique was awful. He began to speak spanish while talking about me to another co worker. When I jumped in the conversation the shock on his face was priceless to know that I understood spanish. Needless to say I will never return to this establishment. I picked up a order with the total of $70.00 plus dollars, had it not been that I was picking up other people food as well I would have requested a refund and stuck them with the large order. Don't be rude you never know if a person will tolerate it.
But I guess when you enjoy being an ass nothing anyone can say or do about it.
