I heard a lot of positive things about this place, but I was thoroughly disappointed. I got food poisoning, and their food was bland. Their Chile Relleno was an over cooked chile omelet. It had no flavor. 
The service was great, but that's all thrown away when their food forces you to spend the rest of the day in the rest room. 
By far the worst Mexican food I've ever eaten...
