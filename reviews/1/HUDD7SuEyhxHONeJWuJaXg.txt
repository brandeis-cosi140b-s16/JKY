Zero stars. I came in on a Thursday night to enjoy ladies night with my girlfriends. Sarah refused to serve me after I did not tip. I was planning on tipping but she was too bitter and didn't bother coming back so I couldn't even ask for change. NEVER WILL RETURN. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE. I cannot believe management would be so classless and allow their employees to refuse service to someone who does not tip. I plan on letting everyone know not to go to such a rude place.
