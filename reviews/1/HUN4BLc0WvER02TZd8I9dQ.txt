I was completely unimpressed with this place.  The tacos were just so-so and the employees were even worse.   We weren't helped right away even though we were the only people in line and when I did order my quesadilla with fajita veggies on it the girl working there actually rolled her eyes like it was the most inconvenient thing in the world.  I will not ever go back here... the hot dogs in the theater are more appetizing than this place.
