I wish I could give less than one star. I ordered the taco combo with chicken. When I got my order both Tacos were heaped with lettuce but no chicken. When I brought them back they replaced them with one that had chicken and one that had just lettuce on it. the taco shells were greasy and cracked on the bottom making it impossible to eat. The staff were not very helpful and they acted like they could care less. I did not expect a gourmet meal but I did expect chicken in my chicken tacos. The only positive thing I can say was the place was clean.
