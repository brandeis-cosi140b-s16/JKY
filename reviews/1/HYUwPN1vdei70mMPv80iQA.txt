Second time eating here first time I had tacos they were okay second time I ordered a carnitas torta & IT GAVE ME FOOD POISONING!!!!!!! Idk if the meat was not cooked properly or if the meat was bad or stayed out too long but what ever it was I will NEVER go back! For someone to get food poisoning shows they are not cautious with their food. A big NO NO! Eat at your own risk!
