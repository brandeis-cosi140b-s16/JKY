Went to ths place after getting a groupon and looked like a good deal .  Atmosphere was nice, located in a rundown area. 

Food was ok, but there popular steak meat platter is full of dried out, overcooked steak, salsa was good and chips were average.

A big turnoff for me was the waiter trying to upsell everything and trying to get us to buy the most expensive dish. To me it felt like a used car salesmen but it came across fake rather then friendly.

My biggest complaint is we had a groupon for $30 and he would only let us use 27 of it!


The total bill was 33.96 , but he didn't like us using groupon so made up
An excuse for not taking it all. 

Overall, fair food, poor service, much better options out there.
