Don't get ranch chicken salad it's swimming in too much dressing, too many chips, too much salt on those chips, has a weird taste, literally almost no chicken, tiniest little pieces I have ever seen almost like they ran out of chicken and I got the scraps oh and wheres the lettuce??????  This place doesnt usually screw up.
