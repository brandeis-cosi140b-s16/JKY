I have eaten there in the past and the food was decent. I took mu wife there this weekend and ordered grilled fish tacos. They were terrible. Really no fish. Just a very small amount of this disgusting chopped up fish stuff. Not even sure it was fish. A weird color. Basically I paid 12.95 for lettuce and cheese tacos with beans and rice. I will never go back. Not one person asked me how my food was. Probably knew the answer.
