First let me start out by saying that the only reason I went here was that I got a free entree coupon and this particular Moe's was the closest to my office. 

Unfortunately this Moe's has the worst customer service and it's not the first time I've experienced it here. 

On this particular visit I came in with a free entree coupon for my birthday and walked up to the counter where the first employee just stared at me and said nothing. That's not that unusual, but maybe a 'Hi' or 'What will you have' would be a good ice breaker, I don't want to micromanage or anything. So I told her what I wanted and moved down the line. Then I get to the cash register to present my coupon. The lady working the register was about as welcoming as the guards at Gitmo. No smile no nothing. She's waited on me before and she has zero customer service skills. So I presented the coupon that clearly states at the top 'Happy Birthday' and of course a normal response from this lady would have been 'Happy birthday' or something similar, again I don't want to micromanage. She acted as if I walked into her house at 3am and asked her to make me lunch. 

Now let me say that I don't expect these people serving me to kiss my butt or anything but how about a little smile or something to let me know you have a pulse? It's not like the food is that great either or there aren't a million other Tex Mex places with the same business model. But lack luster food and rude employees is a recipe for disaster. And this is the same industry demanding $15 an hour?!! Are you kidding me? I remember working these jobs when I was younger and I at least made an effort especially when the customer is nice and says please and thank you. Maybe mirror the customer's attitude or if you're so miserable, find a job where the dead-eyed, no customer service, crappy attitude, zero personality is considered an asset...like the TSA.
