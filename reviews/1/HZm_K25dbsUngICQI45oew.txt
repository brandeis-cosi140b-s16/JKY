1 star in my mind is generous. I will say the staff was very nice, but that's about the end of my good review. From the minute we walked in I knew we should have walked out. 

Strike 1. Atmosphere isn't just lacking, it's downright awkward and uncomfortable. The old hibachi hoods are still over tables that no "exhibition cooking" happens at. Exhaust hoods, these ones at least, are not design elements and should not still be hanging here. The booths were so uncomfortably arranged we had to switch seats because the table was so far from the booth we could not comfortably reach the table. 

Then chips and salsa, the staple of all Mexican restaurants. Next strike. The salsa was generic like from a jar and the chips were the ultra thick kind with no flavor, yuck.  Speaking of no flavor, the food was bland, beyond bland and I felt over priced for what it was. Sadly even my diet Coke was gross.

Definitely will not be back. 

If you're heading here from Charlotte go the extra mile to Casa Rita's and if you came from Monroe or Matthews, turn around...a way better Mexican meal awaits you down the road.  By the way, I am in NO way associated with Casa Rita's, just a big fan of theirs.  

Oh and the sanitation score is from the old Korean restaurant, I thought that was a little weird.
