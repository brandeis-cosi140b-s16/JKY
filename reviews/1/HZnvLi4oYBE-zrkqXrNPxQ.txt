This was one of my favorite places to eat so we decided to have them cater my wedding. After several discussions regarding the menu selections and pricing, we had everything set to go. The day before our event the manager called my coordinator and told her they had made an error in the price quote of $600! The situation was handled in a very unprofessional matter but we had no choice but to move forward as my wedding was the next day and we had 150 guests to feed! After discussing the situation with the manager they agreed to give us a $100 refund which we never got! Although their food is great, the catering manager was very rude, unprofessional and didn't keep his word! We will never use the catering service again!
