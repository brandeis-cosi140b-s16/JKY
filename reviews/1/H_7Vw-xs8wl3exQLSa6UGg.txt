2pm Sat afternoon, running errands stop for lunch. Restaurant is half full. Tell hostess I want to sit in the bar to watch the football game and 
"Have lunch", one empty high top. Sit myself. After 5 minutes I go back to the hostess to ask her for a menu. She never bothered to bring me the menu. After 20-25 minutes with 4 different servers walking by, quickly making eye contact but not so much as offering a greeting, much less ask me if I'd like to order anything...I left. Yes the menu was in my hand the entire time, at a table by myself, in a half empty restaurant. 

On the way out told the hostess nobody bothered to wait on me, I'll go elsewhere. If you don't know the basics of the service business don't try to run restaurants. #fail
