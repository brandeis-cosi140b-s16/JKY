Wish I could give it zero stars. Sorry to bother your early evening couch straightening   Party you had going on. Only people in the restaurant and we didn't get checked on once. I would have kept drinking the margaritas all night if someone would have asked. I was so upset we walked out of the nugget completely. Oh well.
