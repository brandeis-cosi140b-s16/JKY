The food was terrible and very poor quality.  The "beef" enchiladas were disgusting with their horrible ground beef and chilly poured on top.  It was NO where close to authentic Mexican food.  The Mole was very bland.  The food did NOT justify the high prices. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.  I will Not eat here again!!
