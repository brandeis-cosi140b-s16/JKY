This is by far the worst Chipotle I've ever been to (I've been to a lot of them) and after 5 consistently terrible experiences I'm never going again. The quality of the food is noticeably way way lower than other Chipotle's in the area and the staff is genuinely miserable to deal with. A lot of them are clearly new hires, I get it, but the whole squad just straight up lacks the confidence to put together a solid product. I've never seen such timid scoops in my life and after asking for extra lettuce 4 times I finally realized that the girl behind the counter just didn't have it in her. I asked for double steak and maybe got half of what I would at any other Chipotle, the rest of the assembly line was equally as disappointing. 

I get to end of the line and I feel a small sense of relief knowing that this disappointing experience is almost over, only to have the girl at the cash register ask me if I really needed the top to my burrito bowl (after it was already attached). Yes I do, that's why I asked for it at the beginning of this whole debacle. Like seriously at this point what are you going to do? Are you going to take the time to pry off the tin lid and pour the contents of my poor excuse for a burrito bowl into a brown paper bag so I can go home and just pour it into my mouth? Or are you going to just dump it out onto the floor so we can both take turns stepping on it? Am I just supposed to hold it upright in my lap as I drive home? Like honestly what kind of question is that? Yes I need the lid. 

To add insult to injury, the steak was super chewy and I ended up chewing on big pieces of fat three different times. As I sit here writing this I'm genuinely pissed off that whatever the hell I just ate is in my stomach. I'm considering throwing it up just based on principle.
