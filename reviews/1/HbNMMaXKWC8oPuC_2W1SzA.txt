Don't eat here if there's a big event going on, like 4th of July. You wait in line for 10 min to get your name on the list with an hr wait. After an hr the hostess doesn't know how much longer of a wait it's going to be, just that there's an x amount of people in front of you. Hostess gives this place one star.
