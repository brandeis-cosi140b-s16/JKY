Went to lunch with my family had the enchilada style beef burrito, It was super salty also had the jalape√±o cream cheese it was also super salty. I believe the manager never tries the food before it is served to customers. Told the server she did not do a thing or fixed our meal. Very disappointed...not real mexican food and if you have high blood pressure please save your heart do not eat there...
