When I read the positive reviews of Tradiciones on Yelp and in the papers, I can't help but wonder why it is that my husband and I have had such different experiences. We've been twice; once the service was barely acceptable and once the service was the worst I have ever had in my life. God only knows why we gave it a second chance. The waitress barely acknowledged us and then completely disappeared midway through our meal. We tried in vain to get the attention of several others, including a manager, to get our check. We ended up waiting at least half an hour, and that was after my husband got up and convinced someone to give a &^%@#.  We both left with the distinct feeling that if we were Hispanic, this would not have happened. The food was average: decent chips, good spice level, greasy cheese.
