Typically, I love coming here. The sangria is amazing and the ropa vieja is to die for... However; it was 9:24 and the flashing "open" sign said they closed at 10 o'clock... So I walk in with people who also love the food and they tell me they are closed. It was over a half hour before closing time and they won't serve us. 
I do love the food, but without good service, there's no way I can give it a good review. All I wanted that night was a good dinner and good drinks so they kind of ruined my day... And I'm just visiting. 
As I said before... The food is amazing and I would have given it all 5 stars if it wasn't for tonight but I can't let a restaurant keep a 5 star status when they do something like that. I would never do something like that.
