I want this place to be good, since it's in the neighborhood - but it's falling short of the mark. 

During our first time in, we had "ok" food and good service - but an unexpected high bill (and minimum alcohol, so it was a surprise). But I didn't feel compelled either way to write a review ... I wasn't completely under- or overwhelmed.  

Tonight, it was a bad experience - and I'm not compelled to return to Asado Mexican Kitchen again. Here's the scoop:  we went in for drinks only, and it quickly became obvious that the bartender doesn't really enjoy her job (what a difference it makes when a bartender likes his/her job!). My fiancée ordered a Cosmo, and what we got was far from any Cosmo we've ever had. It tasted like there was lots of grapefruit juice in it. Is the bartender trained for her job?

Next, we figured we'd try the draft beer ... How can you go wrong with beer? The beer was good. However, on the 3rd beer, we were served a different beer than we ordered ... that's not really a big deal, but when the bartender treats you like it's your fault and she has no remorse whatsoever, one begins to wonder.

To finish the evening, my fiancée used the restroom and came back totally disgusted - it smelled pretty badly - we're talking sewer smell. We never had that experience back when it was Cocomo Joe's. Sigh. 

Bummer. We had high hopes for this place.
