Everything here is fantastic except the food. I like the fact that it is a small venue and there is a few seats for the patrons. The staff here is extremely friendly and kind. The service is fast when there isn't a long wait. The food is terrible. I ate here a few times last week and each time it was disappointing. The meat (steak) was flawed on many levels. It is a poor cut, not carne asada but something cheaper. The burrito here is small and there is very little meat to begin with. I also tried the tacos and they too were bland. The guacamole is alright and the sauces add some flavor. I am not sure why everyone thinks, writes highly of this place. The owner should do justice and actually use descent meat and not rubbish. You are not doing a service to anyone except your bank account. Sad. TBK would be put this place to shame.
