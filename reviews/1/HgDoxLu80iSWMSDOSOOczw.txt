The food was decent. But I was very disappointed when a member of the staff ran into my wife in the bathroom and made an unnecessary comment about her being in the bathroom.  I can only assume it's a lack of education or tolerance that would make someone so that to another human! Bottom line steer clear if you are gay or transgendered!
