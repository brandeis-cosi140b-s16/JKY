Went here like a month ago, last time I ever will. So after standing at the counter for 5-10 minutes being completely unacknowledged by the staff to the point I'm wondering if I've died and become a ghost, some guy takes my order and then gives me my card and turns right around and takes off before I've even put it back in my wallet without giving me my cup. 

The food comes out quickly and then as I'm double checking to see if they got the order right that person leaves without giving me my cup too, so I stand there a couple more minutes before I'm acknowledged, and finally get my cup and find they don't even have any lids for them.

It's not that they were even busy or anything, there were at least 3 staffers there and none of the 2 other people inside the restaurant at the time needed anything, so the only people they had to service other than myself were 2 cars at the drive through.

Some of the worst service I've ever seen. If you have to go to a Taco Bell, this one's not a good one to go to, unfortunately.
