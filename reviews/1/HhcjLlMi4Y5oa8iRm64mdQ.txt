Been here twice near closing time. Both times they were out of Carne Asada so I didn't get tacos. Tried the ceviche the second time they were out of carne and it practically came in a Dixie cup! Literally...it was probably 4 bites of ceviche for a ridiculous price. I miss the Baja Fresh that was here before this joke moved in. One star !!
