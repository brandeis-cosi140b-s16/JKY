The decor was nice, the service was ok.  the food was some of the worst mexican food i have ever had. i had the baja chicken burrito it was  bland and had no flavor. my mom had the enchilada combo and she said it was bland and had no taste also. i will not be back. and this horrible food was way overpriced
