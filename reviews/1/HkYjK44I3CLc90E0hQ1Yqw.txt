Awful. Not sure if it was an off night or what but it was seriously the worst Mexican food I've had. 

A group of four of us came in hoping to experience all the amazing food everyone else has raved about, however out of four of us one was satisfied and only mildly so- and he got a quesadilla which is pretty tough to make poorly. 

The rest of us order beef tacos, carnitas burrito and some sort of shrimp dish- which was in a puddle of butter and oil surrounded by over cooked beans and dry rice. Beef tacos had to be reorder since the first batch had a long dark hair in it. When a hairless plate of tacos was brought they were bland, little seasoning (the waitress laughed and apologized but didn't offer a discount or something for the violation of health codes). The carnitas burrito was a flour tortilla which tasted like one bought at frys filled with fried shredded pork with no seasoning besides oil. There was nothing else in the burrito besides the oily fried pork, which we had to drench in the table salsa to make it somewhat edible. Went home feeling quite gross after eating some of the burrito, like the feeling you have after eating a massive McDonald's meal.

Will not be be coming back which is really sad since All the other reviews make this place sound like a gem, also as a new person living in avondale I was hoping to find awesome locally owned restaurants, this isn't one of them.
