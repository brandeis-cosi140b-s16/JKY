Tried this place for the first time today! They were pretty slow, no big deal. But with as slow as it was you'd think you'd have lots of attention from your waitress. Not only was our drinks barely refilled. Our waitress was constantly chit chatting with one table in the room who seemed to be her good 'friend'. Customer service I could overlook. The food was ok. Not amazing for the prices charged. My one huge complaint, was that the blonde bartender was standing behind the wall behind me and very loudly was talking about "Fu**ing Mexicans". I was stunned, thought this was a mexican eatery and me being hispanic was incredibly offended. I would rethink the staff at this place and for the pricing probably wouldn't make a return visit.
