I hate to be the guy who does a review on Taco Bell, but I have no choice. I live in the area, and have a weird schedule, so sometimes I resort to them for a meal if I'm in a hurry. I have been here 3 times over the last year, and they have got my order correct 0% of the time. Today was absurd. I go through the drive through and go eat at home. The only thing they got right was the size of the drink. That's. It. Ask for soft taco, got crunchy. Cool ranch taco. Got nacho cheese. Baja blast? Nope. Regular Mountain Dew. Even got the hot sauce wrong. 

I know it's not a huge deal. In the grand scheme of things, I will find a way to move on. But come on. I ordered the quesarito box and got a breakfast crunch wrap. And you want $15 an hour? 

If you want your order to be right, save yourself the hassle and move on
