We went during spring break early, around 5:30 and be warned, you must have an upright picture license for the over 21 year old if you want to have a drink.  Even if you are over 21 but have an old license you acquired before you were 21, they WILL NOT accept these all up and down Mill Street.  Our daughter is over 21 but had an old license.  We came in the front (there is also a side patio entrance) that is just a gate door, but there was no hostess so we seated ourselves in the patio.  We had to move some plates and drinks from the previous patrons to another dirty table and waited a long time but finally we had a friendly server.  We had beers, and appetizers, it was happy hour and the appetizer were $1 off.  I had the fish tacos and my husband had the beef.  He was really sick for the next two days and he thought it was from the tacos.  My son had the chicken and he was fine.  The food was nothing special.  It has a nice patio where you can watch all the people (and homeless folks) but I would plan my meals somewhere else and just go here for a drink next time.
