Dont bother! Horrible customer service! I dont know how this place is still in business. I am sure they lose customers left and right because they never even acknowledge you when you walk through the door. They make it seem like it is busy when they only have three other tables. Also caught a glimpse of the kitchen and it certainly wasnt the cleanest..especially for an empty restaurant. We left and wont be back.
