Don't waste your time going! Beans and rice were the most unflavored I've ever had, the chips taste like they are from Food Lion, the salsa is watered down, the pico had NO taste, the sweet tea looked like water, the fajitas both steak and chicken had absolutely no seasoning and the meat was overcooked. On top of that the "manager/cook" was super rude when we told her about the quality of the food. Never again!
