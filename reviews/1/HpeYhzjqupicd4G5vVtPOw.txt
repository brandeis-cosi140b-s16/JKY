My family and I dined here recently, and we were disappointed to say the least. I ordered the Carne Asada medium rare, and it came out extremely well done. Plus, it tasted awful. The rest of my family was equally unhappy with their dishes. The only dish that was passable was the Carnitas platter. 

Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else; there are plenty of great Mexican joints in the Valley.
