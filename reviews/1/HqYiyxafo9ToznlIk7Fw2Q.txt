We decided to check this place out. We came on a Saturday afternoon and were the only customers. The place was clean and the staff was friendly.  My husband ordered the taco trio and I ordered the Carne Asada burrito.  Both dishes were delicious. My only complaint is that I would have preferred more salsa with my burrito. I easily could have asked, but didn't. 


Update: I got very sick about 40 minutes after eating here. WE WILL NOT RETURN!!
