I came here with a big group on a Friday for happy hour.  Our waitress was awful.  It took forever to get a drink, and I was only the third person to arrive and the place was still empty!

The food was okay, but I wish there was smaller options, especially for a happy hour.  The drinks too were just okay.

The real problem was with our bill.  For about 12 of us, it came out to be $800.00.  My friend and her mom split a meal.  When they brought it out on two plates, both of them started eating them.  After they were halfway done, the waitress informs them that one of those plates was actually for someone else.  Ok, fine, but that's not my friend's fault.  They should have either split up the one plate for them or not put two in front of them!  She asked the waitress to take it off the bill, and my friend was told to get out of her seat and go talk to the manager.  What?!  Then the manager told her that since she ate it, she should have to pay for it.  I have never heard someone act so rudely as a manager!  He should have easily taken the $15 off from our $800 bill!  I would never come here again.
