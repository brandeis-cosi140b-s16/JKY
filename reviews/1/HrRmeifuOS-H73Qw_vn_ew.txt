I've been here about 5 or 6 times in the past few years. Every time I stay at Luxor I look forward to coming here. 

Our visit yesterday ruined it all. We checked in using Yelp! and foursquare.  There was a check-in deal on foursquare for "Buy One get One Half Off" margaritas.   When we showed the offer to the server he was surprised and hadn't seen it before. He talked to the manager and was told that the offer was per person, meaning one person had to buy two margaritas for themselves to get the deal. Ok. Not a big deal -- it would only have saved me $6. The server asked if we wanted to see the manager for a better explanation. We agreed. 

The manager Danny came to our table. He was extremely rude and insulted us before we even spoke. He said that it was his decision about how to administer a deal and that he wasn't changing his mind. Again, before we even spoke or asked a question. Odd. Then, he said that it was a corporate decision and that he 'wasn't getting in trouble for anyone.'. 

When I showed Danny the actual offer on foursquare, which lacked special fine print or terms, he said, "Again. Sorry."

Danny was a complete jerk over $6. He lost the restaurant a repeat customer.
