I can't in good conscience recommend this restaurant to anyone with taste buds. The food here is utterly horrible. My first mistake of the evening was choosing this place for dinner. The second mistake of the evening was choosing the "Carnitas Plate" for my meal. I don't know about you, but my idea of carnitas is slow roasted pork cooked on a spit. What I got were hard chunks of pork that had been dredged in flour(or something) and then deep fried. I couldn't believe it was my meal when it arrived because it looked so far from carnitas I didn't recognize it. I tired to eat a piece of it but it was too horrible to eat. Instead i decided to make my third mistake of the evening which was to try a bite of my wife's food. Yuck! She ordered their signature dish which was called "Pollo Magnifico" and I assure you, it was far from magnifico. It consisted of pieces of dry hard chicken that had been wrapped in a flour tortilla, smothered in cream cheese and covered with melted cheddar cheese. Even with the cream cheese and cheddar cheese, the chicken was too dry to eat. The most surprising point of the evening was when the waiter came to take our check. He actually seemed surprised that neither one of us touched our food and didn't want a take home box. I find it hard to believe that we were the first people that found this food inedible. At any rate, don't go here. Ever! It is disgusting.
