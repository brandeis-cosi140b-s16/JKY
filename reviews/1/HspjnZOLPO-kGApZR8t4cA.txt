If you believe the 5 star reviews on this dive, you are "El Schmucko Supremo!" NOW I am truly convinced that yelpers in the Tempe area either have no taste buds or give 4 to 5 stars to immigrant restaurant owners out of patronizing liberal sympathy. What is wrong with you people??? This is a filthy little luncheonette serving up chicken that is too dry to swallow and beef that is so tough you can't even chew it! They give you a little salsa on your plate and charge you for tiny pre-filled cups if you want any extra. The woman behind the counter was utterly unfriendly and did nothing but jabber in Spanish with the cook, caring nothing about whether I was happy with my food or needed anything else. This place does NOT qualify as a restaurant, Mexican or otherwise. 

The lack of authentic non-chain Mexican food in Arizona, particularly Tempe, is shameful, tragic and  pathetic. What disappoints all newcomers to Arizona is finding out that the state's proximity to Mexico and its large Mexican-American population has NOT resulted in it being a place where one can find great Mexican food.
