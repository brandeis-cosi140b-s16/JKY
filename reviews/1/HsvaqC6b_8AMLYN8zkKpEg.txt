When you walk into a restaurant that has approximately 10 people sitting down eating, and the first thing your server says is "omg it's so crazy in here tonight!  We've been having some issues"...just leave.  Don't stay and try to get your server to understand the concept of veggie fajitas.  Don't wait THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF YOUR MEAL for a water refill (3 times we asked!!).  Don't order the fajitas, which come out as practically raw vegetables, some shredded velveeta cheese, and 3 tortillas to split between two people.  Don't pay $44 for some of the worst food and worst service you've ever experienced...just go to the bar and order a cheap but delicious margarita, have a laugh at the sad state of affairs this restaurant finds itself in, and leave.  The manager (owner?) couldn't even pick up on our disappointment, and didn't notice (or maybe didn't care) about our permanently empty water glasses.  Everyone makes mistakes, I understand...for instance, mine was eating here tonight.  NEVER AGAIN.
