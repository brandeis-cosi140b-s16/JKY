We got there at 6:06 PM on Thursday nightWhich is the slowest night of the week in downtown Gilbert. We got seated right away but didn't get our drinks until about 15 minutes later. We ordered our food when we got our drinks which took another 30 minutes to come to our table. During that time our drinks were empty or chips and salsa or empty. Our server although a very nice lady was not very attentive it all. The manager actually walked by and I think he saw me looking at yelp was the only reason he came up to me assess it we need anything. I food came out it was OK at best overpriced for what it was.  My wife had Carne Asada tacos I had the Carne Asada burrito and my son had chicken nuggets  off the kids menu. I don't see why it took over 30 minutes to get our food we will not be coming back anytime soon hopefully their service picks up.
