I like Baja Fresh, just not this location.  I was walking through the Excalibur hotel looking for something quick to take back to my room to eat when I came across this place. The guy taking my order was not paying attention when I was placing my order. Even though I was the only one in line, he was busy doing other things as I was telling him what I wanted. Not surprisingly he got my order completely wrong. I had ordered a Burrito Mexicano, Enchilado Style. He tried to give me a regular Baja Burrito. As I was explaining to him, and the lady at the counter, what I wanted he walked away again. I was then not surprised when he took that Baja Burrito and threw it in the oven with some salsa and chips to make it Enchilado Style. I flagged the guy down and let him know that it was not what I wanted. I wanted a Burrito Mexicano! He seemed annoyed by me, and I was definitely annoyed that he couldn't stand still for long enough to take my order correctly. It took awhile, but I was able to finally get my order right in the end. 

I should have known better than to go to a place like Baja Fresh in Las Vegas when there are so many other unique options available. Service can really kill an appetite, and my experience at this Baja Fresh made me lose mine.
