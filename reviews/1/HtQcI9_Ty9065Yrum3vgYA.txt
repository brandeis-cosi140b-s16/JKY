We went for dinner on a Friday night and were truly disappointed.  We had gone for appetizers and margaritas a couple of time, and those were OK, but we do not have much good to say about our most recent trip.  We were seated quickly, although that was easy as there was only one other couple in the restaurant.  Our order was taken, chips and salsa (OK, not great) and mediocre margaritas were delivered.  That's when things went bad!  We ordered Chili con queso as an appetizer, and what was brought to us was a watery mess (almost no cheese) with a couple of green chile pieces floating in the middle.  I called the waiter and said we did not want this as it was not edible.  She asked if we would like more cheese added (!!!) and we said no, so she took it away.  A couple of minutes later another person (maybe a manager, but she did not introduce herself) came to our table and told us that she had heard we did not want the Queso.  She then stated that all she could do was take 50% off the price, even thought all we had done was dip a couple of chips in the cheese.  When I questioned that, she then said she could offer us another appetizer, but could not just remove what we ordered.  Not wishing to cause too much of a scene over a couple of dollars, I just asked for some guacamole.  Our dinners were delivered in a few minutes, and my spouses carne asada was like paper-thin shoe leather and I was given refried beans instead of the whole beans I requested.  The guacamole that we were almost forced to accept was only average.

Needless to say, we will not be returning.
