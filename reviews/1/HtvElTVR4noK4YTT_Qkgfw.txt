If I could go for no stars - this place would be it!

Our order was for take out. Waited 15 minutes for our order, along with everyone else. Than once we received, I glanced in to the 3 bags - all looked good and we headed out.

Got home and we didn't have L2 or L3 and ended up with 2 ears of corn, dozen hush puppies, and not what we ordered. 

Returned waited again just for someone to help me - was given correct order, was never compensated or apologized to.

We were not the only one with an incorrect order. There were 3 other people around us that were given the wrong order. Only the man in the Postal out fit got comped his meal, amazing!

Not going back again - it's just too frustrating.
