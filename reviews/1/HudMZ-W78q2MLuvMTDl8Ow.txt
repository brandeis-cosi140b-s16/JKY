May I please have a breakfast burrito with a side of food poisoning! This would have be my second time visiting this place, and this will be my last. Here is a list of the food violations I saw. The cook wiped off the spatula he was using to cook my eggs with his dirty apron, grab a measuring cup out of the sink(obviously it had not been run through the dishwasher or sanitized in anyway shape or form) to measure the meat, high-five employees with his food handling gloves still on, fix his hair and pull up his pants with his gloves on, and then attempts to put my burrito together. At that point I requested a manager and she didn't seem bothered by the food safety violations that I saw. I guess it was the crews breakfast time because they were sitting down at one of the booths. When I asked for them to cancel my order and give me a refund, she was unapologetic and could care less that they were losing business. Filiberto's has better food handling qualities then this place. Lesson learned and I hope I save someone from cross-contamination or food poisoning. I work for a local company within the area and I posted on the internal intranet of my experience and will also be sending out an e-mail companywide to avoid this place.
