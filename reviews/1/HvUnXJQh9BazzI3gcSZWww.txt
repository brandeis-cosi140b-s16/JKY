If I could give it NO STARS I would...looks nice from the outside, the servers at the front are very inviting, but the service inside is horrible...our server offered us the specials, but when the food came out it was all incorrect! I guess the things we ordered were not part of the special even though she said they were...they did nothing for us and simply served us the food...Berenice (our waitress) was nice but she lacked basic knowledge of the menu which ultimately led to extreme dissapointment...over all the experience was mediocre to say the least, the food was not too bad but one could have over seen it if service (and knowledge of menu) was better...definetly NOT coming back and so should anyone reading this!
