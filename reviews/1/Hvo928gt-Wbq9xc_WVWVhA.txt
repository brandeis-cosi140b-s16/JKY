So so BAD! 
1st visit- Beans must have been a week old and the rice even older. How do you screw up rolled tacos?
2nd- 20 minutes in drive thru for 2 mini tacos and jr. bean burrito. They initially handed me the wrong order and then took it back.  They apologized and said they had a mix-up with a bunch of orders.  Glanced in the rearview mirror only to be confused that I was the ONLY car in the drive thru.  When I arrived home, I discovered that my order was again incorrect.  Even the incorrect food was terrible.  Never again.
Too bad nice building!
