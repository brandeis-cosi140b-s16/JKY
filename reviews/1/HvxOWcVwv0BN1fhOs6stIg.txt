I have been here three times and I'll never go here again. I went to the drive-thru and sat and waited and waited about five minutes. Finally, I pulled up the window and finally somebody poked their head out and asked what I was doing there. I explained that nobody had taken my order at the speaker. He looked at me like I just killed somebody. He took my order and I got it quickly. I came back another time through drive-thru and whoever it was had difficulty understanding so I pulled up to the window without being able to complete the order. At the window, the person who appeared to be a manager took my order and said with a sulky attitude that "it helps if you speak up." Clearly a speaker problem, not me. The third time I had to go inside and make change for the bus. This they could handle without a problem. It seems that that's all they're capable of doing.
