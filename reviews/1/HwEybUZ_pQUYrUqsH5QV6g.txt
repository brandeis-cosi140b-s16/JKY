Just ate at this shit box, Ajo Al's in Glendale. Very disappointed in our dinning experience. I wish I'd have read some of the reviews before going. The only positive I have is that the interior was aesthetically pleasing. Completely downhill from there. We ordered two margaritas, on the rocks, with two shots of Grand Marnier. It took at least 10 minutes to get our drinks and the shots of Grand Marnier were only a 1/2 oz. each. We had to request a full one oz. shot, and wait another 10 minutes for it to transpire. The food was nothing spectacular, if not overpriced. At the end of the meal we ordered two more margaritas, this time melon, and again a we waited. Our empty plates and glass wear were never cleared from the table. When we left, the remanence from everything we ordered was still on the table, and everything took exceedingly long... Do not waist your time and money if you are expecting any kind of good dining experience.
I've had better "generic brand salsa", and I doubt if they even know what a jalapeno is.
