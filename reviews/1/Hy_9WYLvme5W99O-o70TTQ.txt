ZERO STARS FOR CHIPOTLE!!!! know I said that I wouldn't come back to this location but I SOMEHOW got talked into coming again. Guess what?! They "ran out" of guacamole, again! After I asked if they were going to make more and one of the girls said "It takes too long to make and we ran out of avocados". -.- I looked into their kitchen and want to know what I saw? A huge bowl of avocados!! Really? You're really going to lie to my face. Two minutes later I walked over to get lemons and they "ran out" of those too. You need to pay attention to detail!!
