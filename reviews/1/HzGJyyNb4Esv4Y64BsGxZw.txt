Can I give this place -1 star? I've already left a review but I need to add more. I have called this location and taken the customer service survey 4 times. EVERY TIME I have requested someone call me. I HAVE NEVER RECEIVED A CALL. I lived in Utah for over ten years and used to eat at Cafe Rio in Provo, Salt Lake City, or Bountiul at least once a week. That adds up to about $520/ year for ten years. And that's assuming I was eating alone, which I usually was not. I would drive out out of my way to go there because it was worth it to me.
Since moving to Arizona where I live about 3 minutes from the Gilbert Cafe Rio, I have made fewer and fewer trips to this once-beloved establishment because the atmosphere, the service, and frankly the quality just isn't worth it. The prices keep going up though the food has not improved. Unless i am visiting Utah I will not go to this restaurant again. I'm sure the staff won't mind, I can tell they recognize me as a "problem customer" with my "complicated order." (beans on the side.... Impossible, right?) i went from an at least weekly customer to not remembering the last time I went there... i seriously can't believe I'm saying this but Gilbert Cafe Rio, you made me really loath a restaurant I've loved and frequented for over ten years. 
And I'm sure no management will contact me about this, either. Since they're obviously SO concerned with my "valued opinion."
