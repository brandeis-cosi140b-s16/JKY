I wasn't really bothered when the host that sat us, also turned out to be our server.  It really didn't phase me when our order came out at two different times, four minutes apart.  I can't say that it chapped my ass when I realized our server/host, hadn't introduced himself, nor seemed to concern himself with asking how our food was until, our dining experience was nearly complete.  My party and I, were hungry, and had waited a half an our for the joint to open at 4PM.  We had just finished having a great time, and lots of laughs at Jeff Civillico's Comedy in Action show.  So, we were all in a great mood.  The little stuff wasn't really bothering me, or my party.

However, after the food did arrive, and my taste buds were left wanting something that had some taste, I began to feel disappointed.  It was further excruciating when I had to wait an undo amount of time for a check.  Then once the check arrived, the rest of my party left the table to wait outside of Quesadilla's.  Meanwhile, five plus minutes later the server/host, who clearly had a nice smile, but zero service skills finally retrieved my credit card so I could finally put Quesadilla, and it's bland food behind me.

In retrospect, after mulling over the bland taste of my sizzling chicken fajitas, I can see why the host/server decided not to ask how our food was until it had passed our lips and found it's way toward our gullets.  I understand that places like Quesadilla's do not require the need to build a local base with excellent service or tasty food, but it would be nice to see an effort.  Tourists beware, if you want something much more delicious, you may want to Yelp around a bit before entering this particular joint!
