Came here with the family on a Friday night. First mistake. Loud, drunk obnoxious broads  dancing (read: screaming, jumping, arms flailing and WOOOOOOOOOO!). The lady who did the balloon animals was sweet, my toddler was happy with her balloon animal. 

Service not only sucked but blew at the same time. Took forever for the food to arrive and when it did, it was cold. 3 regular entrees and 2 specials off the menu (8.99 ea) total bill ran us about $100.
