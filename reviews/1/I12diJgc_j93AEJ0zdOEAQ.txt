I have been to Nando's twice. Nando's is beautiful inside and the staff is great but the food leaves much to be desired. We tried multiple dishes and all were either flavorless and/or sloppy looking. 

They also don't menton their signature Apple Burro has a terrible texture and is filled with apple filling from the can. I am not trying to be rude but they really need to improve the food.
