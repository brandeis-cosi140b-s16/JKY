I ordered a bean and cheese burrito with sour cream on the side. The bean and cheese burrito was just as good as a Mission tortilla filled with Rosarita refried beans. The chips and salsa were okay. It boggles my mind that so many people love this restaurant when there are better options in the area such as La Condesa, Gallo Blanco, or Macayo's. You couldn't pay me to eat here again.
