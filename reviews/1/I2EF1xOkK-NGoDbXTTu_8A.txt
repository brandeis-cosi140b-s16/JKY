A vegan shouldn't have to bite into his specially ordered, non-dairy, bean burrito to discover he has been fed cheese. 
And the manager should do a little more than offer a free coke to apologize for lacing lunch against a customers number 1 moral tenement.

Accidents happen.  We all understand.  It's the way you deal with accident that separates the good establishments from the bad ones.  

Thanks for the free coke... 

Great job making amends!!!
