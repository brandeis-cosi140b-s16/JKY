The food is absolutely disgusting! Extremely salty and horrible service. I took 2 bites of my food and told them I didn't want it. They didn't even offer if I wanted anything else or if the food was okay. I still had to pay, which was kinda disappointing since I barely even touched it. I ate there for lunch, but I hear their breakfast is good. Anyways, I will definitely never eat at this restaurant again. I am highly disappointed with the service and quality of the food.
