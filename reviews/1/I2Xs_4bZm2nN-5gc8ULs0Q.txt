The cashier was the only one who seemed to know anything! !!
Julio the general manager is a rude nasty person! 
They messed up my order. He gave me 24hrs to come back and get 15% off my next order. Really, I shouldn't be forced to come back 24hrs later!!! I called corporate today.  Hopefully they CLEAN HOUSE and bring in a new staff!!
