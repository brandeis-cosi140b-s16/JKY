I've only been here once, but thought I'd share after reading some other reviews. 

First off, this is NOT TexMex. I'm not sure what I would classify it as, maybe AmeriMex, but definitely NOT TexMex. 

Now that I have that out of the way, I'll say that I like El Cancun. 

I do not like this El Cancun. 

While it looks decent on the outside and the inside, the food and service were simply terrible. Chicken was very watered down, the salsa was flavorless, and the service make a fast food chain look really good. Just a poor, poor experience at this location overall. If this was the only El Cancun in Charlotte, I would feel the same way many posters do and just never come back. 

Luckily for me, I live in Rock Hill. There's an El Cancun here. And it's pretty awesome. I won't give it a full on review because this isn't really the place for it, but suffice it to say that if you're in RH and you see the El Cancun and you go "ugh, no way that place is terrible" don't put your experience with the really shitty location on to the one in Rock Hill and give the other one a chance.
