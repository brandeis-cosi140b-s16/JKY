I wanted to have a private party for 60 people with open bar here but found staff extremely difficult so am going elsewhere. I called a month ago and spoke to Justin- described what I was looking for- he said he'd talk to "Liz"- asst mgr?- and get back to me. No one did so I called a week later- spoke briefly to Liz- who said she was busy and would call me back. She didn't. I called a week later- spoke with Liz again- who said she was with a customer and would call me "right back". She didn't. I called the following day-now I'm getting ticked off- and spoke to Liz again. I had to explain everything again. She actually called me back but after giving me pricing said she'd have to tack on a $700 flat fee on top of my food and beverage tab. She said it's because we'd be there 2 hrs and she wouldn't be able to turn her tables over as often- claiming she turns tables 4- FOUR!!!- times in 2 hours. When I balked she cut the $700 to $600. I was done. Signed a contract for another restaurant with no bogus flat fee. Oh yes- my party was on a Thursday night- not even on a weekend.  Their loss.
