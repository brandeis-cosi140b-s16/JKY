Best waitstaff very polite and unrushed. BUT WAY WAY OVER-PRICED FOR THE AREA MOST EVERYTHING IS $ 16.95 and up...lowest priced item was the Cheeseburger @ $8.00...taco & enchelada beef was very poor mushy quality like taco bell with absolutely no taste or seasoning whatsoever. Tipped nice waitress $6.00 because of their pleasantness which made up for the expensive and dull food....sorry   wont be back, even if someone treats me...restaurant was totally empty...also    ummmm?????  ? You might have to go out of business like every single joint off the strip does....
