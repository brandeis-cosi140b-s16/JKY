It's not my first time going to chipotle but when I came to this location with my gf we ordered chicken bowls and my girlfriend found bones in her chicken. She totally lost her appetite!!! It was freaken disgusting. I'm not saying that if you come here you'll have chicken bones in your chicken but I'm saying be careful if you have little ones and check there chicken before they eat. Honestly you never know what you'll find. I've always like chipotle because they have very fresh food but this really turned me off. Because now I'm questioning how they're preparing the food or where they're buying it from. I'm not a Chipola hater. I like it a lot. But this experience really messed me up. Just a warning to everyone that normally goes to this location.
