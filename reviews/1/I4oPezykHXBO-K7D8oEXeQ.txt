I typically like the berto places but they certainly range from location to location.  This one is NOT a good one.

Try Filberto's a mile down the road on 30th street and Indian (newly remodeled and clean, they also give you chips while you wait) or Armando's on 36th and Thomas.

These rec's of course are limited only to Berto's type of places.  If your not in a hurry the list changes entirely.
