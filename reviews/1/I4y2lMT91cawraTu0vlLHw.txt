If you know anything about Mexican food, just skip it. This place is not so good. I had the Charlie's tacos. The meat was gross. The rice was okay. The taco fell apart after the first bite so I ate everything with a fork. My husband had a burrito which was so spicy he could hardly eat it, and he loves spicy food.  He also kept saying his drink Carlos margarita, tastes like toilet water.  It was outta of a slushy machine for certain. I have never left a restaurant leaving my plate pretty full and my drink half full. Waste of $
