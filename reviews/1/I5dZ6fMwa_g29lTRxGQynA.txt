I love Baja, but this particular time, I purchased a shrimp burrito from them, and ended up with food poison!!! I was in bed for 2 days, couldn't keep anything down! I think the shrimp or maybe the guacamole  was bad on this particular day! I wont condemn the entire eatery, but you know once you get sick off of some type of food or at an eating establishment you never want to go back again? Well that's my feeling!
