The manager was rude! He wouldn't honor his own coupon because he said the printing company messed up! Then he said I couldn't get the Thursday drink special because I didn't have two people in my party! I told him it was unacceptable and he said well leave then if you don't like it! Upon my exit he resorted to name calling! Unfortunately he lost our business forever! Take our advise go to Los Arcos! We did and loved it!
