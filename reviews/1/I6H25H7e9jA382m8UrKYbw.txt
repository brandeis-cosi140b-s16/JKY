A big disappointment.

Dined at Hacienda de Rosa's for the first time since it opened 5 weeks ago. My rating is more due to a comparison with the original Tia Rosa's Taqueria at the same location - where I dined regularly - than a true reflection of Hacienda de Rosa's food.

I ordered an enchilada with red sauce and, strike one - Hacienda de Rosa's is more expensive than Tia Rosa's (which wasn't particularly inexpensive); strike two - the food wasn't nearly as tasty as Tia Rosa's; strike three - they messed up my order, giving me green sauce instead or red sauce. 

While returning my order (which was graciously corrected, kudos), I noticed another customer also had a problem with his order. But my replacement enchilada had so little sauce - perhaps a tablespoonful - that I could barely tell there was any sauce on it under the melted cheese, so my enchilada tasted very dry - strike four. 

One of the many great things about Tia Rosa's food was their delicious enchilada sauce - it had a unique flavor, different from the typical "canned" enchilada sauce served at most Mexican restaurants. So while the food at Hacienda de Rosa's wasn't bad, per se, it just didn't live up to my expectations, and I don't plan on returning.
