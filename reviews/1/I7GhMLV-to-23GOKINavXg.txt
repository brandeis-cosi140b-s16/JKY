The concept seemed interesting, but than again, so do most gimmicks. This is the absolute worst eatery I set foot in, during 15  years of Vegas trips, and having been to most  Strip restaurants. 
Decor is awful, a drunken child could have done better. And the monitor display, with the picture of Mao just brings this place closer to a vomitorium than an eatery (cannot and will not call this a restaurant).
Service, I have not eaten at Denies in about 20 years, but I remember better service there. You wonder if the staff knows what a crappy place you are stepping into and feel nothing but contempt for your stupidity.
Food - well, that is ultimately the true disappointment. Never mind the unusual selection which  seems to be either done for shock value or lack of inspiration, a least get the damned things to taste good. Lamb pot stickers, so overpowered with herbs and cumin, that the meat could have been rat and you would not know it (...on a second thought, maybe...nah, they wouldn't do that. Wood they?). Pork belly taco...wow, just a piece of fat smothered in sauce. Barbacoa and Carnitas were, at least eatable. 
The hand made, fresh tortillas are good. So what you get is lousy crap wrapped in a good package, an you pay dearly.
If this lousy, overpriced joint would be anywhere other than the Strip, it would be out of business in a month. No return visit for me and I'll make sure none of my Vegas visiting friends get scammed here.
