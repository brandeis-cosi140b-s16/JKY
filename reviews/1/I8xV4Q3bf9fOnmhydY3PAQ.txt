One of the worst airport meals I've ever had. The beef in the burrito tasted like school cafeteria stew. The salsa has the flavor and consistency of ketchup. And you could have given me a hundred guesses in a blind tasting and I wouldn't have identified the green and white paste as guacamole. As i said in my quick tip, they must fly the food in from Iowa, because no one from Phoenix would think this was Mexican food. Eat anywhere else.
