I am a regular customer of Don Tortacos and I prefer the food here vs Robertos. Today I had an awful experience at the drive thru. The usual lady was not there today it was a different lady with a Mohawk and she was very rude. I was scared to ask her if she can give me cucumbers and I finally had the guts to ask and she gave me a negative facial expression. I was going to provide her direct feedback but I think this would be more effective.
