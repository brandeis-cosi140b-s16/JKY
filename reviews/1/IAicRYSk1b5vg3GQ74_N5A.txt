I really want to try this place based on all the reviews and pictures. 

Unfortunately there is a sign on the window that says they are closed due to family emergency and will reopen January 25th. 

Still not open and it's March.

I wish the best for their family and hope they get back to making delicious food soon. I'll update this review once they open back up. This is informational only.
