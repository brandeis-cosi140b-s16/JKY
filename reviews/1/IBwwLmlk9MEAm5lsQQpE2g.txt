Possibly the worst service I have ever experienced! 

While on a trip to Phoenix, I met friends at The Yard. We decided to eat at Barrio Urbano, and were very disappointed! To say that the server was inattentive is an understatement. We ordered 2 beers and after 20 minutes and 3 reminders, he finally brought them to the table. We waited over an hour (after the delivery of our beers) for our food. It is frustrating when you have to get up and find your server just to order another beer or ask for a cup of coffee! It is hard to imagine why this restaurant does not make changes in the way food is prepared and delivered.

The food was mediocre at best. I ordered the pork tacos and did enjoy the grilled pineapple with it, which was a nice flavor combination. But at $13.00 it seems like very little consolation. The rest of the dishes at the table were bland and uninteresting. The guacamole is tasty, especially with the pomegranate included, but the chunks are hard to eat with the chips. Can someone mash the avocado a bit? Please don't waste your time and money at this place!
