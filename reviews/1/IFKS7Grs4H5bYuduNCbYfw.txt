I should have waited till there was more reviews of this place. Sadly, I was misled by Missy B's description of the food. 

My favorite Mexican food is Casa Zapata's over in N. Las Vegas but it's a drive if I need a mexican fix. 

Let's use Roberto's as a benchmark. If you like Roberto's (which I think is a great value, and I think super-nacho's are a masterpiece at 5AM) then stay away from Jarorcho's. It is twice the price, and not even close to what you can get at Roberto's.

The restaurant was sparkling clean (Well, It is brand new...) and the order taker was nice.  

 I ordered a marinated pork burrito, and Gayla ordered the mole enchilada's. 

We were greeted with cold, overcooked unsalted chips, and homemade salsa which saved the chips. I won't go into the salsa because we expect it to be good in any Mexican establishment.  

The pork sits on a rotisserie, and I ordered it because it looked unique and might be delicious. What I got was flat top cooked bits of pork drowned in a sea of rice and beans. The ol' chipotle gimmick. 

I have been spoiled by Roberto's in the fact that they put nothing but meat in their burritos, and I like it that way. 

The taste was ok, but the hard bits of pork made me wonder where it came from.

Gayla's enchilada's were the size of taquito's and got lost in all the mole sauce they put there. It was really dry and tasteless. 

Total cost for 2 entree's and one soda, $22 bucks.

Very disappointing. Try if you like, but you will find more satisfaction if you just go to Roberto's.
