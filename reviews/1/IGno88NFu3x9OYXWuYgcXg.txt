I guess I don't know what I should have expected.  I had gone to a Chevy's once many many years ago, but couldn't remember how it was.  We were at the mall and decided to give it a shot.

When we walked in, the hostess was very nice and sat us.  After that, it was pretty much downhill.  The waiter wasn't very friendly and somewhat short with us.  He didn't seem like he wanted to be there.  The salsa that was brought out to us looked like it had been prepackaged, sitting around and was in the shape of some other bowl.  It didn't taste much better either.

I ordered the grilled chicken tacos.  The beans were alright, as was the rice.  The taco was dry and bland in some areas, except in the center, where the dab of sauce was.  It only made it taste like a chicken ranchero taco from Taco Bell.  Not something I'd want again.

It's not authentic at all, which is fine, but make it taste good.  I will not go back again.
