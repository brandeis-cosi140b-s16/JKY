If your looking to have authentic Mexican food then DONT bother coming to Elviras.  They serve you tortilla chips from a bag, not freshly made as you would expect.  It comes with bottled salsa again not freshly made as you would also expect.  The food is sub-par.  There were only 2 of us and they still got the order wrong.  The restaurant was less than half full but it took around 25 minutes to get our food.  SLOWWWW service.  Our waitress didn't check on us to refill our drinks so instead the bus boy did it for us.  First and last time going there.
