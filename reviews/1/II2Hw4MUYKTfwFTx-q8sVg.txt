Stopped in this location just a little bit ago to have a late lunch. There were a few parties in line in front of us so we were standing waiting for a few minutes. I then notice something that appalled me (see photo below). What you are seeing is a bucket filed with chemical solution for cleaning on the same counter that food is set at. Look a little closer at this photo you will see this bucket filled with chemicals (and also spilled on the side and on the same counter where the food is served) sitting right next to somebody's food that's waiting to get picked up. I was shocked that nobody noticed or thought this shouldn't be happening. Literally sitting plates of food down next to a bucket of liquid cleaning chemicals that's was splashed all over on the counter. How's chicken with cleaning chemicals splashed on it sound? Made complaints with both the southern Nevada health dept. and el pollo loco corporate.
