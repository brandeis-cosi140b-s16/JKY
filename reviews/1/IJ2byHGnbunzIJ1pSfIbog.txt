One of the worst Mexican restaurants I've eaten in. Ordered the Chile relleno but the breading on pepper had to much egg added, forming an omelette-like chile relleno. Disgusting. Service was awful as well. Waited 10 minutes just to have drink orders taken. Will never enter this establishment again.
