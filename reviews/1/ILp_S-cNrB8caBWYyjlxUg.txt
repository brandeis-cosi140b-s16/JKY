I have never in my life had such horrible customer service! I ate here tonight with my husband and two kids. When we got our order we noticed that we were missing a burrito. My husband approached the counter and kindly mentioned to them what we were missing and the woman behind the counter, Cynthia, was totally rude and snapped at my husband and argued that she put it on our tray. My husband explained that he did not see it and she rudely said that she would make us another one. A few minutes later she storms to our table and slams down our tray with the missing burrito and points at another burrito on our tray and yells, "See there it is right there!" She then stormed off and glared at us and gave us a dirty look. My husband and I were so upset we left without finishing our meal and went home and called the customer service number and left a message explaining what had happened. I have never ever had to call a customer service number to complain! Ever! I will never go back to this location again and "Cynthia" needs a new job!!
