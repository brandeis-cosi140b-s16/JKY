I like to eat here at least 4 times a week cause i don't like to eat crappy food and it is the closest place to my house, after tonight i am officially done. I go here way to often 2 hours ahead of closing and they have no chicken and refuse to cook more because they are lazy. What are you even getting paid for? Why even stay open that late then? 
Chipotle just gained a new customer ill just leave it at that!
