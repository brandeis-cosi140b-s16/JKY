Worst carne asada I've ever had in my life!  Being the first time visiting this restaurant, I figured I'd try something familiar to compare to other places we've eaten.  My first impression of the food was not favorable due to the stale chips they served us.  Then the service.  About 20 minutes after we arrived we finally ordered-not due to indecision but due to lack of attention from the server.  We waited about a half hour for our food to come, and it was lucky we only had two ordering because the family of four next to us ordered before us and still hadn't received their food by the time we left.  Once we recieved it, the food was bland, very underseasoned and as mentioned before, horrible carne asada.  The one shining point of the entire night was the guacamole dip, which was good but not worth $4.75.  Don't waste your time or money.
