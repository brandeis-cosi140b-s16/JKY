Went there for lunch with some friends. I joined them at their table and ordered a margarita. Big sign outside 2.95 margaritas. Got the bill and they were 5.95. It was hot in there, the AC must have been on 85. Service was ultra slow and food was mediocre and prices were high. Will never go there again!
