Went in on Saturday November 27 before a Coyotes game.   Sat at the bar for dinner and a Margarita.  I had the prickly pear Margarita which was the worst Margarita I have ever had and my friend ordered the Cadillac Margarita when we told the bartender that it was supposed to have Grand Marnier in it she snapped ar us and said no it doesn't.  The food was ok, nothing special but overall the place is overpriced.  There are many other places at Westgate I would go before I would go this place.
