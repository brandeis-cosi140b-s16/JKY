COCKROACHES IN FOOD! Do not eat here! We ordered take out and after I ate half of my meal, my boyfriend opened up his side order of rice and a live cockroach was walking around inside!!! I signed up for Yelp just to warn others! Must be a serious cockroach problem that a live cockroach was packed in a tight container without anyone noticing?! How does this even happen? I hope I don't have roaches in my house now! I have to go now and throw up....
