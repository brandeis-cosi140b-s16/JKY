Worst Mexican place ever!!!! Their chicken is horrible pink not fully cooked!!! Had the chicken enchilada 's and had horrible food poisoning out both ends. The bartender was rude! The servers were nice but the service sucked, I came in there when it was completely dead and waited hours for my food to arrive. You would think they would give good quality service when they don't have many costumers in there. The salsa dip and the beans were good but the rest of the food made me lose my hunger. It was very expensive for the shitty service and food for the same price go to the best Mexican restaurant Lindo michoacan!!!!
