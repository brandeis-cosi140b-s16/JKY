I never actually ate at this mobile dump, but I did make an attempt several months ago. When I rolled up, there were three people (two wearing aprons) sitting in the front patio puffing away on their Marlboro's. Is there anything more nasty than the guy about to make your overpriced taco sucking away on a cancer stick? Mmm come get the nicotine taco special folks!! I noticed a bunch of cooks and owners over the years acting similiar and I will walk away each time. I don't care if you wash your hands ten times either, first impressions count. Smoke in the back please. nasty. a waste  of a good trailer.
