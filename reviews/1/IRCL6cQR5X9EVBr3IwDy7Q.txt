Terrible customer service quality. The person taking orders was giggling as she started "welcome to Taco Bell". Then I tried to be clear with my order and asked that it be repeated back to me at the drive through because of past errors in what I received. The server forgot to turn off her microphone and as I drive forward I heard a loud and exasperated "argh"!!! Very rude.
