Words can't even express how disappointed in this restaurant I am. I hosted my sons baptism there and it was horrible. They spelled my name wrong on the menu, there were no servers to even take food or drink orders for twenty minutes. I had to complain several times to even get my guests served! My guests complained too... My brother in law owns a restaurant and was appalled by the service at this place. The person I planned the event with didn't even return my calls they day of the event and wasn't even at the restaurant until I complained! For a 1000 dollar tab Id expect better service! The food is good but the service is horrendous. Do not plan any type of event at this restaurant! Despite the fact I like the food I will never go back!
