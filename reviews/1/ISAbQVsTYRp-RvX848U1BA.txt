Ok.  So what can I say that all the other reviewers haven't said?  This place is pretty terrible.  We know that yelp never lets us down, so I'm not sure why we tried this terribly reviewed place.  We knew someone who went and said that it wasn't so bad.  Despite our reservations (we usually never eat at a poorly reviewed restaurant) we decided to give it a try.  The place was pretty busy on a Wednesday evening.  They were offering happy hour and $5 martinis.  I ordered the raspberry martini and it was really tasty.  However, thats where the positive ends.  They gave us corn bread muffins to snack on while we waited which were barely ok.  We ordered the barbacoa burrito and supreme nachos.  Kids had the been and cheese burrito and chicken fingers.  The barbacoa burrito was so awful, we could barely eat any of it.  The barbacoa was flavorless as was everything else they stuffed in.  The nachos were just ok.  Nothing I would ever need to go back for.  Plus, they were very expensive.  $10 for a small personal sized nacho?  $4 more to upsize it to an entree size.  The kids been and cheese burrito was pretty good, but my son couldn't even eat 2 bites of the chicken fingers.  Hubby tried a bite of them and couldn't blame our son for not eating more.  They were disgusting.  We don't feel the need to ever return.  I just wish it was still El Jefe's......
