I'm so bummed, but cafe rio finally let me down in a big way. I've always had good luck as person with a gluten allergy with the tostada salad. Never any reactions over the many occasions I've enjoyed this meal. Today, however, when I ordered for pickup I was not informed that they were out of tostadas and they took the courtesy of replacing it with a flour one without informing me. Needless to say, I'm extremely sick for the next few days. Plus the manager was a bitch when I called to complain. I'm very disappointed needless to say. :( And won't be trusting them to serve me what is asked for anymore.
