Door was locked at 8:00pm.. They close at 10.

One employee completely ignored the line while another spent about 12 minutes indulging an ADULT couple participating in KIDS eat free on Sunday, yes.. The man had a burrito & his woman got a kid bowl for free. He then made my food, ignored my children's menu questions & said they were both new & don't know anything... 

After the couple ahead of me got free food, I paid 26.00 for mine & then a dirty guy on a scooter comes in, after eating food out of the outside trash in front of us, and gets a burrito bowl & a soda for free... Guess I was the only one PAYING tonight.

I love Q'Doba in Tempe. It'll be nice when Ahwatukee finally gets it together with their staffing issues ... The food is always good. Service is always crap.
