I literally just went to Patron and was completely ignored.  I sat in a beautiful room aside the bar and several servers not only looked at me; but made eye contact then proceeded to ignore me.  I am not sure if I was ignored because I arrived just a few moments prior to their lunch menu ending or if this is just their typical service. I like the food at the other Patron restaurants; but when I can't even get a glass of water what is the point of continuing the meal.
