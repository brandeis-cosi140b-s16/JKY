Went here yesterday for my husband and I for lunch. The service was fast and the employees were polite. BUT the food had my husband and I nauseous, vomiting and sick for the rest of the day. I will never eat here again! This food is a too little expensive to be making people sick. I wish I could find my receipt to get my money back. 20 dollars down the drain and toilet.
