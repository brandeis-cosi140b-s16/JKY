Unbelievably rude service. The nice gentleman at the front who told us to sit anywhere was the only pleasant portion of this visit. It took the waitress 5 minutes to even bring us menus another 3 to get water. The waitress came over rudley asked if we were ready. I asked for a beer list she snapped at me that they dont have one. I asked what they had she snarled just tell me what you want. I think my disgusted look indicated I was not going to guess what they keep in their bar.  She finally snapped at me what my options were I ordered and we skipped dinner as I couldn't stomach being treated poorly an entire meal. My 2 minute interaction was enough.
