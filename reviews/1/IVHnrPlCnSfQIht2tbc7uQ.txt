Horrible horrible food. This is not Mexican food in any shape form or fashion. Even the rice isn't authentic. The tamale was edible, but not fantastic. The burrito I got was disgusting, bland, and slapped together. The enchilada my husband ordered was basically the same as my burrito but with a corn tortilla instead of flour. And the taco was more disgusting than taco bell. 

I can't believe this passes for Mexican food and I can't believe this has four stars.

We will never ever go here again. 

The salsa and chips were decent and the service was quick (although not good service; he didn't say a SINGLE thing or offer to do anything about it when I told him that my burrito was gross).
