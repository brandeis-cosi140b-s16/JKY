I don't understand how in the world this restaurant has such high reviews. We went in & were astonished at how dirty this place was. the menu was incredibly small. when the chips & salsa were brought to us, the salsa was in squirt bottles with crust built up all over it. the salsa was disgusting & they didn't even have queso dip! what kind of Mexican restaurant doesn't have queso? needless to say we walked out & didn't even order anything. AWFUL.
