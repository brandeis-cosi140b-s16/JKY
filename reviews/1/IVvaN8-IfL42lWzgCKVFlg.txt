This was my first and probably my last experience at Baja Fresh!... I was in downtown Tempe (ASU area) for a conference and thought I would try it out. I was hoping for a little upscale version of "Rubio's Mexican Grill" what I got was more like a very cramped overpriced version of "Taco Bell".  In spite of the disappointment stated I would have given this establishment 3 stars simply because the food wasn't terrible; however because the strong odor of rancid grease permeating the dining-room left me no choice but to eat outside with bee's that would not stop trying to share my lunch, I believe I must give this place just 1 star.
