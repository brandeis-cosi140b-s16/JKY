They had way too many servers and they were playing with each other and extremely clumsy as they were serving.  There was a lady in line with a special order and they started my order and then let it sit and get cold, while they fumbled around to serve the other lady.  The customer in front of me was agitated and they were rude to the both of us.  Rather than listen to me ask for fresh rice, the server literally scraped the bottom of the pan and that part of my order just sat for 7 minutes.  I got out of line and waited for my friend behind me and refused to continue.  The manager never even acknowledged my apparent discontent, never apologized but gave my friend a free drink and burrito coupon EXTREMELY SHITTY SERVICE.  WILL NEVER GO BACK.
