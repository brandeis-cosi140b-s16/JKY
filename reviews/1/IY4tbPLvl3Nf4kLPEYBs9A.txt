I was excited to get me one of them Cuban sandwiches. The bread was nothing to write home about, but it was ok.

They charged me $9 for a $5.95 Cuban sandwich. I asked the server if she charged me for 2 sandwiches cuz the menu indicates the price of $5.95. The lady then gave me $3. 

I asked my buddy's roommate about the place and he said, "F@#k that place. They charged me $20 for the food and drink. The actual price was $12. 

I recommend that you add the bill yourself before you get over charged. Check your bill before paying.

Mamacita, either learn to add or stop ripping off customers. Yelp is here to help.
