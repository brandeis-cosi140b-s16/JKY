I've really TRIED to like this place..simply for how cool it can be oh and that it's kid friendly and close to home if you've had a margarita!  For whatever reason I've tried the same menu item 2x now and just did not enjoy it at all.  Margaritas are good though!  Nice bar and patio area...I guess if you're just looking to have a drink...good little spot.  The END!
