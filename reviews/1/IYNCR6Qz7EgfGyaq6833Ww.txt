Ugg! We ate here these evening  only because We had a coupon Warning Sign 1 6pm and not busy The chips were good ,the salsa ok and they gave us bean dip. 

They are way over priced 13.99 for a SMALL chicken enchilada and a soggy taco Nothing had any flavor,Warning Sign 2  The waiter never came back to ask us about the food. My partner had the same thing and when the bill came it was almost25.00 with the coupon!

The worst was we had to wait 15 minutes for the bill and the waiter never came back to charge my card This is a neighborhood bar and restaurant and they must have a great happy hour cause it ain't the food or the service

Won't be back!
