Starting with the seating. In a place that had very little people we got pushed to a small corner which in theory is nice but for service was horrid. the food was lacking to say the least. I had more flavor in my dogs food than in my burrito. also the service was less than acceptable. Our food took almost a half hour to arrive and then no one came around to check on us. the best part of the meal? leaving the restaurant.
