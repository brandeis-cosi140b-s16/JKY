Danger Will Robinson! Avoid this place. Stale chips, Pace Picante salsa, microwaved food. I ordered a chimi and the middle was still frozen. Server was really slow and did not seem to know the menu. The dining area is extremely shabby: ripped cushions and dingy tables. I do not know why I stayed after the first five minutes.
