Very very bad service. In the drive thru fur 15minutes when I got to order was told that I can not have a four piece meal all thighs. 
Was told to come back in 20minutes ..I was already in line for 15 minutes. Was told that he needs the thighs for the big family meals people are ordering....ohh I am sorry that I don't have a family to feed... Avoid this location.
