Needs to Study Business Management.

Place looked great, I almost gave them another star for their Mezcal selection... Was not impressed with any of the food's presentation that I saw, but the salsa verde was very good (at a place called Verde, it better be!).

When we arrived the place was half full and I did not expect to get a table, but my friends wanted to eat, so we tried.  We received a 15 minute monologue about how busy they were and that there was no way they would be able to fit us in... that people were already waiting about an hour... yada yada yada.  So... after standing at the bar and drinking a pitcher of OK at best margaritas, the half empty restaurant was even more empty.

The server was very nice and knowledgeable about Tequila, but the general feel was of a place TRYING very hard to be posh and trendy.  Having been to BED in Miami when it was new and choking on want-to-be trendy places with each step in Chicago (when I lived there), I understand the desire.  However; BED, The WIT, The Bedford, Spybar, Mynt are all very cool places, and inside have cool staff.  If they have 10 empty tables, they will try to get you in one... because people want to go there and their food/club/drinks attract a crowd without fake pomp.

While the margaritas were disappointing and the food looked like it may leave you wanting to go to Mad Mex, I will go back and try their Mezcal.  If you go to places to look cool and have an understanding of quality that is so poor you will buy a volt because it is "green," this is your place.



I should add, all ended well on the south side after a few bottles of wine and a bunch of lobster!
