Worst Food eeevvvvvvveeeeerrrr
65 $ for 1 mojito, 1 Coke ( Never asked for a refill) , sliders, chicken fajitas

Pros: view, funny stuff, Chairs. 

Neg: Food Way overpriced & just gross. Slider patties Where all 3 Black burned like hell.returned them got Same Colored patties back. Weird. Ordered without onions got onions, ordered Medium got well i mean dead cow well meat. Not Good at all. Fries were ok. Not Crispy enough but ok. 
Chicken fajita burned. Same Problem like the patties here, guacamole salty. So salty that you Need a Soda Afterwards.but i Never got a refill
 The soft Tacos came 5 min After the fajita. Strange ? Yes very Strange. 
Because wie eat already 1/2 of the Chicken   

My Soda came Even After my sliders. 
Our Server dissapeared & i had to ASK the Bus Boys for everything i needed. They are very very nice & Helpful. I wish i would have gave him the tip instead of the Server. 

Funny nice atmospere inside. Good mood. 

Would i go back. No Not for the Food. Maybe for the Drinks at the Bar. The Chairs are so cute. ;-)))

I wish somebody would have asked US about the Food. 
But seems like Nobody Cared. For a Brand New Restaurant i wish the Manager would be present & ASK the guess about it.
