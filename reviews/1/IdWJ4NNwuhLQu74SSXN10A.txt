I don't normally write reviews but I just dined here for lunch with my mom and two children (5 and 7) and I don't understand why it's so busy. Don't waste your money, go somewhere else, especially if you have younger children with you.
We waited about 10 minutes once we were seated to get our drink order. Then we waited another 15 minutes for those drinks to come and for our order to be taken. Once our food arrived the waitress never came back to fill our drinks or ask how everything was.
Nothing special about the food itself. My mom and I both had bean burrito enchilada styles. Which I thought for $7 was kind of expensive because it was a large flour tortilla with a small amount of beans and bland sauce. I had to put a bunch of salsa on it to give it some flavor because all I taste was the tortilla. Also it was recommended by the waitress to wait to give my children milk until the food arrived so I thought okay, sure. However by that time they had drank water and didn't really drink the milk (which happened to be $2.50 for a children's milk!). With all of that being said we'll never go back. There are much better places around. Bad service, bland food, and expensive for what you get.
