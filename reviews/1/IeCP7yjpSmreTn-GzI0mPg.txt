The map is inaccurate.  This TB is on the corner of Rural & Ray, not Rural & Knox.  The people here are super friendly, the food is fresh.  That being said, it's a good TB as long as you don't have a "special" order. They've messed my order up the last 5 visits.   I like green sauce.  -red + green.  That's all.  Not difficult.  They just can't do it.   My today's visit, I was SO  pleasantly surprised that they gave me green sauce until I took another bite and discovered that they had forgotten the meat.  I  went back and had it redone.  They were very friendly- great service.  Got back home and had red sauce again.  Sheesh.
