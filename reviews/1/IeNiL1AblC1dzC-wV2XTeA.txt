Food - 1 star - Are you kidding me? How does a place like this stay in business? Maybe everyone goes there once, as we did, but never returns. We ordered carne asada, quesadilla, tacos, and margaritas. The drinks were actually really good. The food was significantly better at Taco Bell across the street and our bill was 10 times the price.

I guarantee Ketzal will be OUT OF BUSINESS in 1-2 years. 

2011 Update: Yup, I was correct. It took 1.5 years.
