Went there because we heard the food was great. If possible, the food was worse than the service. Sketchy looking building on the outside. Got seated right away. Ten minutes later out server came by. No mild salsa, actually nothing mild to dip your chips in.... If you get chips that is. Got our first batch and had to flag down a bus boy for some more. We had about 6 different people come to the table, none of which came by a second time. FINALLY got our food after what felt like 30 minutes. We were hopeful that the food would make up for the terrible service but we were sadly disappointed. Dry chicken, cold burritos, bland beans. Took seriously 20 minutes to get our check. The ONLY thing good this place has going for it is strong margaritas. SADLY SADLY disappointed and will NOT come back.
