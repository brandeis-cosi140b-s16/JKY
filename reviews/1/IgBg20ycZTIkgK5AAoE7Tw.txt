Terrible service, every time. I do keep going back to get bean burritos for my sister in law on lazy Sundays, and it's always an ordeal. The one star is for the competence of making my food correctly, and nothing else. Waited 20 minutes or so just to get the guy to take my order, which never actually happened. So I pulled up to the window and was received with a look like I was bothering the gentlemen on who was inside. I asked to make an order and he proceeded to tell me I needed to get back in line and order at the menu in the drive thru. I told him I had been waiting as he slammed the sliding window shut in my face. I left with a bad taste in my mouth, and no food.
