I haven't been to Rubio's in over a year, so I decided to stop in for lunch... I now see why I haven't been there in over a year. I walked in, to "not" be greeted by the 2 stone faced staffers, just staring at me very uncomfortably. All the dialogue I received was the total, and I asked if he'd tried the new lobster tacos he just says "yea". Really??? I won't be going back there anytime soon. Very unpleasant people working. However the Lobster tacos were just okay, but there fish tacos are still amazing!
