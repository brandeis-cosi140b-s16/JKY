How does this restaurant generate so many 4 and 5 star ratings? 

I know it was on the food channel, but honestly the food was sub-par. Maybe it was just an off day, but I have a feeling it wasn't. The prices were not outrageous, but it wasn't cheap either. The atmosphere was nice, if very cafeteria like.

But the food was way way too "greasy." And bland. And my stomach now aches after eating there....
