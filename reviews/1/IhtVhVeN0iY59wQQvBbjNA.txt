How does this place have a 4-star rating? 

I came here late one night since I was staying at the Monte Carlo and wanted a quick meal before returning to my room. I ordered the fish taco combo and was disapointed to find that the fish in the fish tacos were nothing but fried batter. After I peeled off all the batter, a chicken-nugget sized piece of fish remained. Not filling at all. Also, what comes in this "combo" you ask? Stale tortilla chips and a small ladle of refried beans.

Next time I'll be heading over to McDonalds for a Big Mac instead.
