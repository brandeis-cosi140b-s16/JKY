The breakfast burritos are not good at all. The ingredients are not quality, and you can get much better for your Money at a place like filibertos. The tortillas are paper thin and have zero flavor. It just really isn't good Mexican food. There's so many other good Mexican places to eat in the valley, don't choose this one.
