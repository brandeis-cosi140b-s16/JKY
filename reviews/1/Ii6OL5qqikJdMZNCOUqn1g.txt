The grilled ono burrito is now nearly $8.00. Thats like a 25 percent increase overnight! Want cheese? .95 cents more! I couldn't believe my eyes. As the guys rang me up, I realized that with tax, a lousy burrito from an average at best fast food mexican hut was going to be over $10.00!!  I looked at the clerked and said, " are you out of your mind?". He just shrugged, I mean, what the f&$@ does he care, anyway? Then I promptly said, " uh, bu bye." People, their food is marginal on a good day, and now everything is way too expensive. Chipotle anyone?.
