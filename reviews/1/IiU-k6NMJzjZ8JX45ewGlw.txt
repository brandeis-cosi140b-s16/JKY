I have passed by this place many times, and finally decided I wanted to eat a carne asada burrito. I'm used to eating burritos in California, where the standard carne asada comes with mexican rice inside. Yeah...I'm not a traditionalist. 

I found out here as well (for the second time) that you need to ask for rice and pay extra for it. That's fine and dandy, I can live with it. But, the carne asada meat itself was meh, and the burrito in general was an OK for me. I wasn't too impressed. I also thought it'd be a hole-in-the-wall, which is what I was hoping for, but it's actually set-up like a fast food chain store! That was unexpected. 

Prices are way too high for what they serve. The salsa bar was okay as well.
