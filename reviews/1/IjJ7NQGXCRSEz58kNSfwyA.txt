Ordered a mexican pizza and the shell had gone so bad it was rancid and left a bad after taste that my soda couldn't wash away. They swapped it out for me with two soft tacos and some free cinnamon twist. I finished the tacos and took a bit of the cinnamon twist and it tasted worse than the shells on the mexican pizza. After I told them that both the pizza shells and cinnamon twist had gone bad, they just looked me with blank faces and continued to use them...
