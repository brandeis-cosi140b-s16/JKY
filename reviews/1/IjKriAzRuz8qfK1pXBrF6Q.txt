Yes, the guacamole was very good, and the habanero salsa was excellent...even loved the fresh lime juice that came with my carta Blanca, but the entrees were awful.  I mean really bad.  I ordered carnitas tacos, usually a good choice for authentic Mexican fare, but it was bad.  The pork had a vinegar flavor that made me suspicious that something was wrong with the meat.  My son, who lives for chicken fajitas, could not eat his.  He said it was bland and odd, unlike any Mexican meal he had ever had.  We still loved seeing Ka at MGM, but we should have eaten anywhere else.  Oh, and when they took our plates away and commented that we did not eat much, we told them honestly that the food was not very good.  No response or any acknowledgement from our waiter.  I was shocked.  Go for the guacamole and drinks, but do not venture farther!
