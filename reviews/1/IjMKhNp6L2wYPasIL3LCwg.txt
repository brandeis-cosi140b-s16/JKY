Last night was the first terrible experience I had at this location. The host Julia could not handle my order correctly and did not even apologize. If you're going to work then do it with a positive attitude and if you can't do that then at least do it RIGHT. Yeah, you're working at a fast food joint as a cashier and your life sucks- I get it. That doesn't mean you treat customers like complete crap. I ended up talking to a shift manager who fixed my order and I was on my way. Every Del Taco member at this location has been great except for Julia. So not only does Julia have poor work ethics but is also a beached whale....gosh that really sucks. I have contacted corporate about this and really look forward to hearing back from them.
