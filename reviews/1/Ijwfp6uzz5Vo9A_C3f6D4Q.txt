The wife and I hit this place on a lark. We were at the Chandler Fashion Mall and saw that a new restaurant had opened up near the food court. When we got seated we noticed that the music was great. 70's music hits me right where I live and it was just the right volume. The staff was friendly and helpful. Things were going so well and then the train went off the tracks:

We ordered four tacos two for each of us. 45 minutes later we got our tacos. We were told that the kitchen was backed up with orders but this was around 1:00 in the afternoon and the place wasn't crowded at all. The tacos couldn't have been much larger than a silver dollar for $2.99 each. There were about three bites to each of these and there was more slaw than there was meat. They tasted okay but the size and the price really shocked me. We were also quite disappointed that our food was so late. We also noticed that many of the food items being served were kept on the counter for extended periods of time before being brought to the tables which might explain that our food wasn't exactly hot when we got it. (We were sitting at the bar so we got to observe the operation in great detail.)

I liked the people working there. Kind of an eclectic group if you know what I mean. 

The open air feel to the bar gave it a true Baja feel. The music was fantastic. The people were nice. However the slowness of the food and the skimpy portions will ensure that the wife and I won't be coming back. When we walked out we saw a Rubio's around the corner from them. The tacos were the exact same price but have much more to offer in the way of actual quantity and even taste than Rock Taco. 

If I were coming here to just hang out, drink and listen to music  I'd say it would be a good place to try. However if you're coming here expecting great food served in a timely manner I'd say try someplace else.
