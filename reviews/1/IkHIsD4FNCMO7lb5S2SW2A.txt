The food was cold. The beans looked like they were sitting in a pot all day. The rice was old, cold and dry. The Pollo Diablo was full of grease in the burrito. The ginger with green onions was cold and not very appetizing . The teriyaki chicken my kids got was cold and terriyaki sauce had no good flavor and the sauce looked like it came right out of the refrigerator. The only thing we enjoyed was the quesadilla .
