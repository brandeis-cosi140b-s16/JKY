Tonight I brought dinner home for my family from this El Pollo Loco. I had their chicken Cobb salad. It was not like a real cobb salad especially because I found TWO lettuce cores and one large very dirty piece of lettuce in it. Please see the pictures. There is no quality control at El Pollo Loco, I guess. I don't think I will be back to this restaurant again.
