I've been coming here for a long time. On this occasion. I wanted to eat popusas.  They advertise a special on the window for .99 cents. I place an order over the phone for twelve of them. I was charged 23.80 for the twelve. I noticed that I was being overcharged. I spoke to the girl about the major difference in price. Asking to honor the advertised price. She said that she had to call the owner to get approval for a refund. The bottom line is that the ducking owner did not want to leave the order for $13. I asked her to give me the difference back and she refused. These people have no clue how to give customer service. I will never come here again. Ever.
