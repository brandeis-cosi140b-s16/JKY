I went here late Sunday night around 945pm in search of done decent tacos. Found them on yelp as being open until 11pm. As I walk up from across the street there are still plenty of people sitting at the patio tables. But when I walk up the stairs to the hostess area I could tell the back of the restaurant is already shutting down. I try to get one if the waiters attention but they buzz right by me a few times. Finally I get an older guys attention and ask him if I can just sit anywhere. He tells me the restaurant is closed. Mind you, there are still about 30 people sitting at the patio tables and the sign outside says they close at 11pm on Sunday. Needless to say I won't be going back there.
