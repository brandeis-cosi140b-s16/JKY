If this is the best Mexican in Pittsburgh, go to an Italian place. I've eaten food from all over Mexico. There is almost nothing similar to real Mexican Food. Not only is this place "Americanized" Mexican food, it's also "Pittburghed" meaning very bland for those who like real Southern or Mexican food.
