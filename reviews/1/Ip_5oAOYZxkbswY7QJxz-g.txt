On 12/30/2014 I went to grab a bite at the Cantina at around 4 pm. Imagine my surprise when I saw that it was happy hour! Since it was happy hour, I decided to go with the flautas since they would only be $5. They were decent, but I don't care if they were phenomenal...when I went to pay, the rude girl Stephanie at the cash register refused to honor the happy hour price. Stephanie is a dick, as are several of the other workers there that I've had the displeasure of coming into contact with, and they all deserve to have their stank asses fired.
