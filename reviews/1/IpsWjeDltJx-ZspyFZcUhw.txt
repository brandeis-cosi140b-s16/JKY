This was the worst Mexican food I've ever had!! First off ordered a margarita came to the table looking very weak and it tasted even worse I had to send it back! I decided to just go with a draft beer which is very hard to screw up. They give you free chips with salsa the salsa was nothing special either no kick, then came the enchiladas I ordered one word Terrible too much cheese on top, shredded chicken with no flavor inside and not one decimal of spice! The service was slow and prices were way too high for this place! The only thing positive I have to say is the cervaza was cold
