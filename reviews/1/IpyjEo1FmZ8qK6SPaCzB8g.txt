Let's start at the wait. We were told 20 minutes and waited 55 minutes. Ok no problem it was really busy and lots of big parties. We ordered a cheese crisp and it was ok. Nothing spectacular. Anyway the fish Taco dinner is what I ordered and it was terrible. Fish was greasy, dark, and burned. Tasted bad like it was fried in old oil . Absolutely inedible.  Service was polite but super slow. Talked to the manager and she was polite but told me the chef said my food was fine. Really? The chef needs to rethink that for sure. It was a bad first experience and a last one for me.
