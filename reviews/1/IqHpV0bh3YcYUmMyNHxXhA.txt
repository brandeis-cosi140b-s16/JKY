I recently gave this place 3 stars for good food, great service, but not so awesome prices.  Reasonable review right?  Apparently, wrong. 

What I am reviewing with ONE star is the message I received back from the owner.  Not only did she accuse me of being a certain customer who used happy hour, restaurant.com and a yelp check in, she acted as though I had given her restaurant a horribly undeserved 1 star review instead of a more than half 3 star.  

As it is, I am NOT that certain customer.  Not only am I not that person, I, as a customer, am extremely put off to learn that the management looks down upon those that use the very coupons they put out to draw people in.  

I now realize why this place was completely dead the night we went in.  I do NOT appreciate being put down by ownership.  I thought my review was fair and honest.  Not only will I never be back, I will never recommend this place to anyone, ever.  Fresh food or not,  I don't like to be treated as such!
