Went here a few months ago and it wasn't too bad. Good enough to get me to go back again today. Wish it hadn't been though. Today I ordered the shrimp tacos and it was a 3 on a 10 scale. That was the good part. Everything else tasted BAD, EVERYTHING. My wife wasn't pleased with her Cheese enchilada either. The service was ok and the staff was pleasant but we definitely won't be back.
