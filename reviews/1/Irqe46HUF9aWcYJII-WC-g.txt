This place was great about 2 years ago but clearly things have changed. 

Yesterday on my lunch break I was craving Carne Fries. I ordered them with NO guacamole, ADD extra cheese. I was charged for the cheese too because the total was $10 something. 
I get back to my cube at work only to find that the fries were smothered in guacamole with a less than normal amount of cheese. The carne was flavorless and the fries were cold and mushy.
Not to mention the cashier was a tad bit cranky AND she never advised me of the fee to use my debit card. 

Sorry Vaqueros but I don't think I'll be coming back.
