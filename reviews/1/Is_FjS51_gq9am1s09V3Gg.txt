I use to come here all the time as it's literally down the street from my high rise. If you wanted to satisfy your Mexican cravings, Casa Don Juan was the place to be. However, lately the food has been gross and "un-authentic". As we sat, the chips were cold and stale, the salsa and refried beans also cold, lumpy and watery. Strike one. Next came out entrees. Within 10 minutes after place our order (literally 10 minutes), our food came. Here comes strike two: tacos looked as if some through a bunch of ingredients together in a tortilla, fried it with enough grease to take a shower with but yet also cold. Beans were flat and mushy, rice cold and stuck together. I mean, seriously? Complete half-ass food. How do you mess something like this up?

Clearly, just because you have traditional Mexican decor, have traditional Mexican music and your menu in Spanish, does not make you an "authentic" Mexican restaurant.

In the end, I will not be coming back here. I'd rather drive the extra mile or so to El Dorado Cantina.
