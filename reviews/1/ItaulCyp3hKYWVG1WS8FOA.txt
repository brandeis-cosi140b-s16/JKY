So I'm currently sitting at Ricky's for about an hour and a half. We sat unacknowledged for 20 minutes. We ordered about 30 minutes ago, we are now on our 4th basket of chips and salsa. We've had one round of drinks. Granted there's 6 people in our party, however we ordered all the same beverages, burritos and enchiladas. We've had not one bit of acknowledgement from the manager who I can clearly see is running his butt off to cover up some sort of mishap. Our server came to the table about 30 minutes ago to tell us our food was right out. Only to say 30 minutes later it would be another 10 minutes because they've been backed up. I'll also mention that I'm a manager at a resort in Scottsdale so I work in hospitality and am extremely understanding. I understand that things happen, however I've never been this disappointed to write a review on the spot, but this absolutely has to be the worst service I've ever received in my entire life.
