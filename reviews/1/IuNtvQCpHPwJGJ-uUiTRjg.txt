This place has gone downhill in cleanliness. Last week I was there with my kids and when we sat down, one of my kids noticed rice still stuck in her fork.  This happened a few months ago too and we pointed it out then.  I spoke to Bennie the manager about it and was assured they would look into it and fix the problem. Tonight we gave it another shot because if they were working on it, it would be fixed, right?  Nope. Silverware was crusted with food and Bennie didn't know what to say so he tried to suggest the caked on food was a water spot. Water spots are not 3 dimensional last I checked. Also, the ceramic plates had obvious chips which did not bode well.  We left without ordering. Health Department notified. That is all.
