We had Roberto's to go last night for dinner. I got a beef taco and a chicken taco. Easy enough. 

Mike ordered a beef chimichanga with no cheese or sour cream. The guy read the order back to him and everything was good to go. Mike got home and there was cheese inside of it. He went back and showed them and it took him multiple times saying he ordered no cheese for them to understand what he was talking about. They ended up making him a new one and he came back home to join me. 

This has probably been the 5th time that they have messed up an order. It's gotten to the point where I stand at the register like a crazy lady watching them make our food. Every time I catch them about to put cheese on something that shouldn't have it I yell, like a crazy lady. 

I don't know where the miscommunication is or where people's orders get lost in translation since its printed out for them to stare right at. Every time I go there I want to go back less and less.
