Very very slow drive through. Waited way too long at the speaker.  Maybe about 15 minutes then decided it didn't work so I proceeded to exit the drive through.  Once you enter this drive through there is no way out.  I was blocked by a truck at the window for another 5 or 10 minutes.  So basically I spent at least 20 minutes in this drive through and did not get any food.  Which is OK with me but I was getting the food for my Mom who had a procedure done at Carle and was starved!!
