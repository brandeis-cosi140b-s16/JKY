Decor is nice. Service was okay. Lots of room for improvement on the food though, this was THE most overpriced/bland Mexican food I've ever had, three of the people that came with me couldn't even finish their lunch, the only reason I finished mine was because of the tiny portion of my "camarones al mojo de ajo" with chicken. Honestly the rest of the food tasted like it came out of the microwave or  was sitting under the heat lamp for a while. We felt so unsatisfied that we bought a groupon during our time here to pay for our tab because we felt paying full price for less than mediocre food is not cool. Go to cafe rio which is down the street.
