I grew up with Manuel's. We used to go every Sunday after church growing up and that was back when it was still on 32nd St. Since I got older, the price has gone way up and the quality of the food seemed to go way down. Salsa isn't spicy anymore. Used to be that the plate was super hot when it was brought out to us, not anymore. One of the last times my family and I went there for dinner they charged us a 16% gratuity! 16% is way too high for any gratuity but we were only 4 people!
