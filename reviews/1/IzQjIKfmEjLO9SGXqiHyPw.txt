If I could give 0 stars I would. 
After making a reservation for 2:30 we were told they were busy and we would have to wait for a table. We were offered a table in the dining room but were told it would still be a small wait, we wanted to watch the playoffs so asked how much longer if we split into the two open booths. The general manager Allyson Howell then stepped in and said there would be a wait do to the big party just sat. I asked how long she said 10min, we said that's fine we would wait. We were sat about 10min later. The server came to one table but not our other. After waiting awhile we asked to talk to the manager which was Allyson Howell. We said we had been waiting and she said, I told her (pointing to me sitting at the other table) that there would be a wait. I replied yes a wait to be seated not to be served. That clearly made her upset and she said back I told you you would be waiting. I once again stated why did you seat us then. She then said if you like you can leave. Really? I'm being asked to leave because you are backed up? Mind you I am there with my sister and brother in law, our 3 kids, and my husband. My sister said to her is this really how you are treating your customers as the manager? She said all of you get up and leave now. So now I ask for a refund of a gift card I purchased for the prior week. She refused and said we must leave restaurant. At this point she left to the back of the restaurant. I had asked to speak to her again since our party had left. The server said she would not come back out or give us her managers name. My sister and I eat here every Monday. When I call to order to go the employees know my name by what I order, this is how often we come here and have never been treated this way!
