Man, what a night. I had about 8 friends in town and my son and I asked them to meet us at Maria Bonita's. We were seated right a way and within a few minutes our order was taken. There was only four tables seated when we arrived. My son and I ordered first and within a few minutes all orders were taken. I also ordered a drink from the bar. After about 20 minutes meals started coming to the table. Still no drink from bar. Half way through the meal, my son's and my dish still had not arrived. Still no drink. I tried to get the waiter but he was not out by tables. I finally flagged him down and he said it was coming that they were very busy. Again, only four tables filled. Now finally everyone had finished meal and some of the party had to leave because they had small kids, still no meal. I flagged the waiter again and walked to kitchen window. No one spoke English in kitchen so they did not know what I was saying. The waiter finally came up and said since we order last....really?...our dish was still being made. Long story short, never got me dish, never got an " I am sorry". the waiter was very rude, it was his fault I think he never turned in ticket for us. He would not tell me his name and kept saying he was the manager. We WILL NEVER go back. it was also very embarrassing for my son and I to have invite our quest and to be treated that way. AWFUL place. Left my name and number for the owners or REAL manager, never heard from anyone,,,,surprise surprise.
