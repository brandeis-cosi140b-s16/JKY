Thursday Night: Cabo not full at all, but wait staff was RUSHED - talking so fast as to be incomprehensible, not wanting to discuss menu items or offer suggestions. Terrible service.

Half the food was good - OK, but the fajita was crappy, no seasoning on the onions/peppers - BLAND - too little salsa, sour creme, guacamole. Waitress did not check back to see how we were doing.

Desert - FLAN - was shitty. It was like frozen jello with spry cool whip  scattered around the plate. The sauce was almost sugar water.

All in all, SHITTY, not going back!  Evidently there is no management to let things get this out of hand.

Meanwhile the Charcoal Room, next door, is always a 5-start experience. MANAGEMENT Santa FE, Management!
