I went there after work and asked if I could have a quart of beans and rice the girl behind the cash register said I needed to call in a order. For a quart of beans and rice?? It's not like I was asking for a party platter. Then I asked for three small containers and she asked the cook and he said there was not enough for the customers. If they are running out of food there is a problem!  This place has HORRIBLE customer service . They just lost a long time customer!
