Do not go to this Chipotle.  Love the food.  Horrible service.   Twice they've done a terrible job at making what we've asked.  Don't bother ordering online.  We placed our order and gave them 30 minutes to make it.  We got there 15 minutes after the time they said it would be ready and they hadn't even grabbed it off the printer yet.  We walked in and went to the cashier and paid.  Got our receipt.  At least 15 people got through the line when I asked where our food was.  They hadn't even started it.  The manager assured us he was making it right now.  After a ten minute wait we finally got our order hastily thrown together, ignoring our requests from the online order.    We would have been better off hopping in line when we walked in because they do not care about already paid customers.  I want my money back.
