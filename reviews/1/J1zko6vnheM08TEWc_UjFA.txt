If it was up to me I would give not even a star but unfortunately I have to. This is not the first time that I've had an issue with my order less than a week ago I had to drive back myself back to that location and deal with the cashier I would guesstimate he's in his 20s very disrespectful and it's like a total toe issue. I am a pain customer I'm not here to measure who is better / harder. If I order my food and it supposed to come with certain sides I shouldn't have to drive back or make phone calls to make sure my order is correct. If you ever happen to have to go to the spot please make sure that everything is in the bag I promise you this place is worse then a McDonald's drive-through... I am definitely going back just to complain to the manager myself to try to if it resolves the issue I'm not saying that they're intoxicated on some sort of methamphetamine but I would not be surprised... Please do yourself a favor and go to a different one and if you have to go to this certain establishment do yourself a favor and pull everything out in front of that kid so they can see how bad they messed the order is up constantly.
