I, and I'm sure many others in the Phoenix suburbs, would gladly pay a little extra for some standards.  Is pretentious overcompensating downtown Scottsdale the only place to find AZ night life that doesn't celebrate sub-par lifestyles?  Dos Gringos is certainly a dive.  I might rate them a 2star (as at least it's not a fight friendly 'unsafe' dive), but the background music is so ridiculously loud you can't hear the others at your own table over the off key guitar soloist with his amplifier maxed out.
