Well... Richard was very generous with his 3 stars. Truth is, this place ONLY stays in business because there is NOWHERE else to go in Historic Florence, Arizona.

Went here for a Groupon package deal... everyone in the restaurant was there for the same reason. I overheard the people next to us inquire as to where their food was since they had been waiting 30 minutes. The waiter replied, "Oh, I think it might still be FROZEN. Let me check, I'll have it right out."

FROZEN??!?! I guess its a decent solution for an empty restaurant to be able to serve a variety of foods- since it really would be expensive to prepare everything fresh everyday and have no one to service it to...

But don't admit this aloud. 

Advice to ALL restaurants: At least pretend like your food is fresh. :)
