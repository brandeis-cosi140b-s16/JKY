I live less than a 1 minute drive from this place so when my room mates and i want a late night snack we tend to come here because who loves mexican food more than 23 year olds?.. lemme just say, im not even going to put effort into this review, the crew is ALL rude, especially on the late shift, and that pisses me off since I work in Food and Bev as well and am always polite.... the crew here needs to work on their attitudes, they're slow, they're condescending, the food normally doesn't even come out correct and I'll DEFINITELY be going to another place from now on... AND IF I DO COME BACK, AND THIS CREW HAS AN ATTITUDE, IM GONNA REFLECT THEIR SHITTY ATTITUDE SINCE THE 40YR OLD CREW LIKES TO ARGUE LIKE CHILDREN.. :~)
