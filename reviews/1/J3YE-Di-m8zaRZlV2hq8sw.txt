I am a guy that loves to go out to dinner. Whether it's with my kids, by myself or the whole family.. I love a good restaurant. I also know when to spot a crappy one. Tonight, my son found a rock, yes I said a rock, in his refried beans! It was awful. I brought it to the attention of my server, who assured me that he would let his manager know. We waited and waited and the only thing that happened that server brought me a bill! No apology, no nothing????? It was the worst exhibition of restaurant management ever. When I spoke to the manager, he almost looked at me like I put the stone in my sons food. I have never been as angry as I was at that moment... Do yourself a favor and stay away... Don't risk your meal, enjoy any other restaurant. Obviously this place has front of the house issues as well as the back the house!
