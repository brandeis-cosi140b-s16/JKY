Terrible,terrible,terrible..... 
that's only way to describe this place,we stopped in for some take out on cinco de mayo it by far the worst meal EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
I ordered a chicken chimi and my GF got the rolled tacos platter,ughhhhh OMG 
it was terrible.I got so sick after eating here that we'll never go back.This is as bad as it gets,after my first bite i knew something was up,it just tasted off.I thought it was me but after my GF tried she too said something wasn't rite.I left it on the table for a bit cause i really thought that it was my taste buds messing with me and had a few more bites and had to stop.Not long after eating this meal i started to feel queasy and then outta no where i was off to hurl into the bowl.After hurling my insides out and chugging a bottle of pepto and 50 or so tumms i made it out alive.My GF tacos were flavorless but the rice and beans were good.I have made up my mind and that is i will no longer buy mexican food from a restaurant out here( except for Nandos Cantina inGilbert),i will make it @ home where i'm in control of everything that goes into my food and i know that it'll be awesome.Adios Amigos
