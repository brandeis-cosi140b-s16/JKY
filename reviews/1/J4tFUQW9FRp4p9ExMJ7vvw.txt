Stopped by for  soda after being at the hobby shop next door. It was late but the girl at the drive thru messed up the order for a soda twice. When I pulled up I gave her my debit card. She came back and said declined. I told her to run it again. She told me again declined. I gave her cash. Good thing I checked my bank Mobil app. Both charges went through. I went back in and demanded my money back and showed the head cashier and the drive thru clerk the charge on my phone. The head clerk asked me not to talk this way to the clerk. I asked for my change back again, strangely enough I had to repeat that they ran the card twice and she only was going to give me the first charge. I've been to drive thru windows that play games with charges before. Be warned at this location. Cash only! Don't give them a debit card!
