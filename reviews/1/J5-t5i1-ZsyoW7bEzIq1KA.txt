Not veggie friendly.. so I've always liked Qdoba better than Chipotle, which happens to be right next door to them, but I'll definitely go to Chipotle from now on! Normally I grab food on my way to work in the evening,  but today I stopped in around 3pm..what a difference. I ordered a vegetarian burrito and get this they charge for an extra scoop of lettuce! This extra charge is not listed on the menu and it's a vegetarian burrito, what else would you put in it? Chipotle has tofu, Qdoba does not. I did not get the grilled veggies on it because they are always salty and normally I just get a lot of lettuce on it beside the rice and beans. Now it is not like I wanted a bowl of lettuce just 1 extra scoop and yes there is a charge for that. I have never been  charged extra at any other Qdoba nor at this store in the evening for lettuce. What made it even more surprising is this extra charge is not listed on the menu.  So when asked for a customer service number to file a complaint she kept insisting I call the survey number on my receipt to speak to a live person....total lie no live person just a recording so I ask her for a store manager or a districts manager 's name and she claims there isn't one that they are between district managers..Finally I gave up and searched online,  found a customer service number where an actual personal answered, got a store and a district manager's name and a promise of a return call. Being charged extra for something  like lettuce bothers me, but being lied to is unacceptable.  I could've dealt with just filing a complaint about the lettuce charge and went on with my day, but being lied to is terrible customer service. Next time I will just go to Chipotle where they don't charge for lettuce and the employees are nicer.
