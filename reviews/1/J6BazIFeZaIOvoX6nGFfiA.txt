Absolutely horrible service and management. The night was beautiful,  patio and atmosphere... gorgeous!!! We were so excited to enjoy a night outside with friends. When we were quoted 30 minutes to wait.. we were happy. We sat outside and enjoyed a cocktail. After waiting 45 minutes, we checked in.... this is where the trouble started. Long and short..... we waited an hour, we asked approximate time and the host responded , " I don't know how long it takes for people to eat" ... another 15 passes and I speak to the manager. He is horrid!!!! Cares nothing for my feedback. We finally sit, hair in the salsa.. !! I could not make this up. We decided to leave and not continue the pain. Will not be back.
