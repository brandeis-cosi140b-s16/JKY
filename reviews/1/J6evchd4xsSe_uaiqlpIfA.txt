Absolutely terrible...the worst of both worlds.  In fact I'm looking at my package of peanut butter crackers and thinking that would have been more satisfying.  

Had the chili relleno, the chili inside was not even prepared properly because it was hard and stringy, then they stuffed it with processed american cheese and coated it with a flavorless breading.

I also had the chinese pork...blah.  Chicken fried rice...blak and cold.  refired beans and cheese...cold.
