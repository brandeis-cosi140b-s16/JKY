We stopped by for some breakfast tacos on Saturday morning, on a whim. The bacon, egg, potato, and cheese tacos sounded delicious! Hungry and anxious for food, we bit into our tacos only to experience raw bacon. Like get-you-sick raw bacon. Needless to say we left hungry and disappointed. Won't be going back.
