Wow. This was bad. I am all for local mom and pop places but when a place is bad no matter what you have to say it is bad. Not finish my food bad. My co workers didn't finish theirs either.
The place looks sketchy on the outside and even after you walk in. Now some times really good food comes from sketchy places but I'm sorry to say not this time. Now my co workers are not that adventurous so when meat options included head and tongue they were a little put off. I did try a sample of the tongue and it was ok but I got the Super Nachos with carne asada. The chips were tough and so was the meat. Just unappetizing overall. We got it to go or I would have asked for my money back. I don't do that so it must have been bad.
I'm sorry this place is not good and I will not return. The young girl behind the counter was very nice but very young looked around 14. Must be her summer job at her family's restaurant.
Now I going to go get something else to eat because I am still hungry.
