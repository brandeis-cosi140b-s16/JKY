I started this review sometime ago and forgot to finish it..... Figured I'd post it now.

We arrived early for brunch so we decided to go to the bar and have a drink until our table was ready.  The only good things I have to say are that the bartenders were nice and the Mimosas were free. 

Now for the bad.  It was Easter so I expected it to be busy, but it took over 20 minutes just to even get our orders placed.  It took another hour and 10 minutes to even get our food!   By this time we complained to the managers and they were defensive and dismissive of our complaints.  We observed what I have to assume was the management team standing at the hostess podium most of the day.  A server actually got an applause from one of the tables when the food finally came.  I would think the management team would be out on damage control instead of standing around. 

When we received the food it was mediocre at best.  I had an omelet, and it was bland and under cooked.  By this point I was starving so I ate just enough, and threw away more than half.

Eventually we received an apology from a manager and two free creme brûlées.  By this point I had already decided it would be my last time there. 

I agree with another reviewer,  the menu is horrible and Gordon Ramsey would yell at them for days.
