This place looked good from outside and walking in left i was transported to Jalisco and with the Ambience felt I was about to enjoy an authentic meal but quite the contrary.... Service was the worst and food completely sucked!!!! Absolutely no flavor I could have made better chilaquiles and better Barbacoa 

Only one guy working and it was the worst service waited 20 minutes for coffee and the place wasn't busy. 

It's a great concept and feels and looks like one will enjoy a great meal but false advertisement 

You've been warned!
