Always when I come to Vegas I try to stop by and get something to eat. This time the Lady at the counter was terrible.Didn't care about whether we were ordering food or not  she was busy watching the TV. When I was ordering I had to repeat my order a couple times because her focus was on the Hispanic news channel. Do you know how annoying that is? Tables were not  clean and there's food & paper on the floor. Foods gone south like the customer service. Sorry last time eating here for me and my family.
