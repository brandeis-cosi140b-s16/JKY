bad experience in this restaurant burrito was not to my order, had to ask them 3 times why there was no cheese. no refill on horchata at this location and they overcharge for a drink. thinking about making pepes my go to place for now on. also called corporate and they seem to not care. not recommended at all,  beware! !!
