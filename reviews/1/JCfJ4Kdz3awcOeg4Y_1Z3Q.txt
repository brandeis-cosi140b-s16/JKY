Looks are deceiving let me tell you! 

This is NOT REAL MEXICAN FOOD. The salsa had no flavor the chips were stale 
The coffee creamer was expired! Oh man our plates blaahhh!! We got huevos rancheros and chilaqueles it was horrible rice was nasty dry the salsa on top of the food was straight out of a can! Yuck! Never again..
