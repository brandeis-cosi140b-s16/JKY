UGH! Yesterday, I sent my boyfriend out to get us Roberto's because we just needed our rare fast food fix taken care of. I do not expect much of these places and I know it's not mamas home cooking, but this experience was dreadful, and we ordered to go!

I ordered the beef chimichanga. It looked good from the outside. My boyfriend started saying how his chicken tacos tasted bland and way too greasy. I thought he was just being jaded, but once I started digging in to my plate, I noticed I've been eating tortilla and cheese, I thought that was strange so I began to dig in deeper, and sure enough, NO MEAT just about five layers of tortilla and SOME cheese. I was beyond livid and starving. My boyfriend was just as mad because he said that the guy taking the order was giving him such an attitude and didn't give him what he asked for (green/red salsa or limes.) My boyfriend drove all the way back to this location to demand another one prepared properly and sure enough with these dead beats, they accused him of eating all the meat. I'm sorry but why would he order something, only eat some of it, waste gas to drive back, ask for another one if we just wanted the meat? I want the entire thing and it became about the principle by then! Of course more attitude followed. Once he arrived back home, I opened my box and saw a bug WALKING ACROSS my damn chimichanga! I totally lost my appetite and just said forget it. NEVER COMING BACK TO THIS OR ANY LOCATION AGAIN. What happened to you, Roberto? We used to be like THIS! *Crossed my fingers gesture*


Everyone who rated this place a four-five star, I hope you loved your nats as a garnish because I'm sure my plate wasn't the only one. YUM!
