May I please give NO stars??!! 

NOTE: This review concerns the Roberto's on Union Hills and 7th Ave. NOT the Roberto's in Anthem!

THE BEGINNING:  Saw this place on 'Diners, Drive-ins and Dives' about a year ago, so my GF and I went and ordered burritos to go. She did not want guacamole, so I asked the guy behind the counter if he would add it to mine. When we got home, hers had guac in it and mine looked like they might have waved guac over the burrito. The burritos were bland and had a TINY amount of meat in them.  

THE END: Went back about a week ago to give them a second chance (in case we had hit a bad day). The burrito filling tasted old and the burrito was warm at best!

THE LESSON: Muy malo!! Stay away! Don't go here! If you want a good, fresh burrito that kicks butt, go to the 'real' Roberto's (original owners) in the city of Anthem. Or Filberto's on 19 ave, north of Bell road. The Adobada (sp) or green chili burritos are great.
