Amigos Tacos is a complete disappointment.  I blame late-night alcohol for the fact that I have eaten here more than once.

It's a taqueria in the same vein as Roberto's (i.e. hole in the wall, "gas station" Mexican food restaurant).  But while Roberto's does a mediocre to decent job with fast food Mexican, Amigos Tacos fails.

The SW area around S Rainbow and 215 has an appalling lack of Mexican restaurants, so in my laziness, I have eaten here a fair amount.  And I can sum up the menu with the phrase " grease on top of grease".  The cheese is greasy as hell and the meat dishes magically combine lack of taste and grease.  Beyond that failure, there is very little fresh food is served at Amigos.  The guacamole always seems 1-2 days old and tomatoes are bland. 

And while I might have been expecting too much in wanting fresh ingredients, it's not too much to ask for a taqueria to use quality chicken and steak in their dishes.  Amigos uses shredded beef and chicken in their enchiladas and both are flavorless, tough and downright depressing.  And the go-to dish of carne asada?  The flank steak they use tastes like it's been sitting out for two days.

There's a reason that Chipotle and Qdoba are building more restaurants in Vegas.  Taquerias like Amigos Tacos make the corporate chains seem delicious.
