This is by far the worst mexican food I have ever had. The bacon in my burrito was raw for starters. There carne asada with more like dog food. The smothered chimichanga I ordered had no sauce what so ever and the side of sour cream was spoiled smelt like it had been sitting out on the counter for a week. This place need the health inspector called on them
