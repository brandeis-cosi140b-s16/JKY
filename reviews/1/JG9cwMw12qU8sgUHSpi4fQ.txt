Serrano's is one of the diviest restaurants around. The inside decor is awful and their food is totally bland and gross. They have restaurant tables that would be suitable for use at family reunions. They also serve drinks in these ghetto pitchers that they frequently leave on customer's tables. Going to Serrano's is definately not a fun or exciting dining experience, I think I actually felt a sense of despair after dining here.
