The lesson learned here... You can't always trust 4 stars! So I'm going to take it down a notch. We only tried the breakfast burrito (no meat diet at the moment) so my review of the food may be off as far as flavor but you can do a lot with beans, eggs, cheese & potatoes and they just didn't. Not to mention, we waited over 20 Minutes for our order of 2 burritos! They did apologize & offer free soft drinks, but come on people. Maybe they were dealing with the cockroach that had scurried across the floor? Or the obviously under-age worker who checked us out (10-11 year old boy) We won't be eating here again!
