Unfortunately my rancor at this visit prevents me from trying to put any humor into this review.  In short, my $2.75 ceviche tostada was overwhelmingly saturated with limes and ridiculously soggy.  When asked about their best soup, I was told to get their Caldo De Rez, which was a $7 admittedly large bowl filled cabbage, carrots, and literally 4 pieces of tough, thumbnail sized beef.  I tried to give the evil eye to the server as I left but he couldn't summon the courage and kept staring at his popcorn machine turned into chip dispenser.  Look me in the eye when you lie to me, damn you.  Ugh.  Hatred.  Fury, rage.
