Tried giving this Chipotle a second chance. Surprise, surprise, the manager was up front and gave me an attitude AGAIN. I had to ask 5x for guacamole on the side. first to someone on the line then her (she was also on the line). She's just a very unpleasant person to deal with. And this chipotle scrimps on the meat.
