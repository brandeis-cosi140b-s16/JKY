We have been here a long time ago, we were feeling nostalgic so stopped in for lunch. Mistake.
My mom and I shared this fish fillet dish. We assumed it was either cod or tilapia... you know what they say about assuming... 
I took one bite of this fish and it literally tasted like dirt. it was horrible. we asked the server what kind of fish it was we figured cat fish.  She assured us it was a "cleaner" tasting fish called a Basa.... ah well I tasted dirt so im not sure what "cleaner" means.

After looking this fish up, it is a cat fish. not just any cat fish! oh no, this Basa fish has been banned in THREE states! It is farmed in Vietnam, packed frozen and shipped in USA.
This fish is a discount product.

I will never be going back here again and utterly disappointed on the quality of food
