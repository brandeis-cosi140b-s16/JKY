I agree with one reviewer, skip it and hit Taco Bell or Del Taco. Those places are way more mexican than that this place (scary to say). The chips are Ok but the salsa is like Catsup. Had the fajitas, way to greasy!! Beans are dried out and paste like, seem to be from a can. Not great service either waited forever for drink refills and one meals was super late too. I love Mexican food and this place is far from even Americanized Mexican food like Serranos or Casa Blanca, it's way worse! I would skip this place and find something else to eat. Sorry....7 friends not so good.
