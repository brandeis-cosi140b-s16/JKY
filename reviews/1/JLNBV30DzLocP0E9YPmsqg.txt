Bad food, bad service. So dissapointed. Rude waiter who made us very uncomfortable & rushed us all the way through our meal. The quality of food was very poor. Enhilada dish did not resemble anything close to an enchilada. Chips were stale and dishes were dirty. I will never go here again nor recommend.
