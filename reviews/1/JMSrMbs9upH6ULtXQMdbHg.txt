Been going here for years and my order is wrong nearly every time. On top of that, they have been out of an item I want on numerous occasions. The credit card machines are always broken, the drive through box is broken as we speak, the lady asks me to order then stops me in the middle of my order because she's not ready. Lines take forever on drive through. Frustrating experience every time I come. Don't go here, take the extra five minutes and go to the taco bell on happy valley.
