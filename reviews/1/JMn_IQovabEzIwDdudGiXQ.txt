Horrible service.  We walked in and were told to sit wherever by the greeter.  We grabbed our own menus while one server proceeded to rearrange tables and not even acknowledge us.  The bartender brought food outside and told us someone would be with us.  He then went to the bar and continued serving drinks in a barely full place.  After another five minutes watching two employees standing around talking, we got up and left.  Service like this will get you no where and I'm afraid this restaurant won't make it unless they train their employees on customer service.
