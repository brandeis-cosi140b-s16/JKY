After reading so many 4 and 5 star reviews I was hesitant to post mine thinking I just had a bad experience. I decided to try my luck again and went to Ponchos for dinner last night. I now have been there a few times and my experience has been consistently horrible. First of the all the place used to be a house, now converted to a restaurant. Usually this is a great and charming idea, but it doesn't seem to work for me. The rooms are incredibly crowded and you are either screaming at your dining partner or (loudly) overhearing the table next to you. Imagine trying to fit 5 restraunt booths in to a small bedroom.. To close for comfort.

The food - I'm sorry my fellow yelpers but I honestly think it is horrible. The chips have always been to greasy, they only serve hot sauce and you have to pay for salsa. Lame. I have had many entrees (where's the pollo under all this fundido) (chimichanga greasemanga) but last night won the "most disgusting entree" award. I order the Steak Picado (I think that's what it was called) and it came out overcooked and cold. The rice and beans were barely edible, the cheese in my garnish and beans were melted stiff but there were also bits of cold (what appeared to be) sandwich cheese sprinkling the plate and hiding under the steak. It was supposed to come with tomatillo sauce but came with their normal salsa heated up..  My friend ordered the Huevos Rancheros and it was even worse, the eggs were rubbery and greasy at the same time. They were covered in a slimy sauce they passed off as ranchero but it seems like a watered down green sauce. It was so bad he didn't even eat it.
Don't get me wrong - I love Mexican, all types and usually the heavier the better, but Ponchos is a place I will not be returning. Yes it was really cheap, but you get what you pay for.. Picture attached.
