I am from Chicago where authentic Mexican restaurants are abundant. I would not consider what I ate yesterday at Matador Mexican food. 

The waiter brought chips & salsa to the table. The salsa was a spicy red sauce that I would pour over pasta....I'm dead serious! The fish taco entree arrived quickly. There was a ton of fish which was nice, but it came with a side of shredded "cheddar" cheese, shredded cabbage and chopped tomato. The rice & beans that came with were no better. I think the rice was Rice-O-Roni and the beans had a think layer of burnt "cheddar'" cheese on top. WTF am I suppose to do with that?

This was my first meal in AZ. It has to get better than that.
