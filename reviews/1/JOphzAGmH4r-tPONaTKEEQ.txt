Horrible! I was hungry for a green chili burro and remembered this place was right off the freeway. Pull up to the drive thru window and see a sign saying, " 50 cent charge for debit credit", no big deal as im hungry. The lady opens the window and i see flys creepin out. I counted at least a dozen, which prompted me to leave but again i was hungry so i decided to stick around. 

I get my burro and to my surprise its heavy! Im thinkin ahh yea bout to grub. First bite into it and all i get is rice!  Not good rice but rice thats bland as all hell. Who puts rice in a green chili burro?!?! I unwrap it and all there is is rice, beans and shredded beef... no green chili... how is this even called a green chili burro with no chili..

Im leaving one star for the fact that..
  Tons of Flys were present inside the building
 Rice was bland and overcooked
Meat was flavorless
 No green chili!

On a brighter note the beans and tortilla were pretty good.. but not $6.51 good.. Avoid this place and go hit up nicos by the little caesar. There food is actually good!
