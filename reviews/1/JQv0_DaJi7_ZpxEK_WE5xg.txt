We asked the waiter what their specialty was and he recommended carnitas, so we ordered 3 different carnitas dishes, and we were so disappointed. They were more like pork stew than carnitas we are used to at other Mexican restaurants. The Coca Cola one was really a pulled pork BBQ. Not to mention there was a lot of fat in all 3 dishes. We will not be going back.
