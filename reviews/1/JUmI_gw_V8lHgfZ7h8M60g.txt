I've been here about 3 times. I haven't left very satisfied but the last time I went (last week) was just plain disgusting. 
I ordered an all-meat carne asada burrito and the amount of grease it had was just terrible. DO NOT cook with that much grease: It's unhealthy and disgusting. I filled a few plates with grease because it was pouring down. Really, you don't have to cook with that much.
There are better Mexican places in town, this is one of the bad ones. I'm Mexican myself and I recommend to avoid this place.
