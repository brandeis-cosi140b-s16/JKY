Not a very friendly menu for a person with gluten intolerance but the chicken was *very* good although practically the only thing I can eat. The reason for the low rating was this location had horrible AC and bad AC in the dead of the Phoenix monsoon season is not a place to enjoy a good meal. The "atmosphere" was positiviely soupy between the kitchen and what seemed like a swamp cooler.
