Stopped here with my husband on our way back from Vegas with high hopes. The staff was friendly and we were seated right away. My husband ordered a bean burrito with cheese and I had the bean dip. The bean dip was a soupy mess and the taste was horrible. I sent it back and replaced it with the queso dip. The dip arrived and seemed to be just a bowl of melted Velveeta cheese with tomatoes added. Tasted ok but I could have made it at home. The salsa here is terrible as well. Seems to be canned stewed tomatoes that they try to spice up. Worst food I have ever had at a Mexican resturant. I would have gotten better food at filibertos fast food. However the staff is great.
