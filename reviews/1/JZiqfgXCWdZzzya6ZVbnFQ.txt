Felt disrespected by the staff as soon as I sat down. The rude girls that worked there, Christina and Merlin, ignored you and wouldn't approach you unless you were a male. They wouldn't even give you eye contact. Will never return. My beauty might have been a little intimidating ;) I tried to not even rate but I had to at least check one box.
