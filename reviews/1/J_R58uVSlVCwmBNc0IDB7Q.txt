In Terminal 3, it's this or Wendy's. That's why this place is packed, you wait for a table, and then you're elbow-to-elbow with the people at the next table. 

I ordered the shredded chicken tacos and asked for salsa verde. The tacos were lukewarm and bland and arrived with the standard red salsa in a little plastic cup with a lid on it, along with a set of plastic flatware, some black beans, and rice. The beans tasted like plain black beans out of a can. The rice was plain white rice. They desperately needed some flavor, so I tried the red salsa; all heat and no flavor, not good. I waited for the server to return and check on me so that I could get the green salsa I ordered.

And waited. And waited. And waited. She walked by twice to deal with other tables and I tried to catch her eye; no luck. I put down the utensils and sat there and stared at her: nothing. Waved. "Excuse me..." Nothing. 

Finally I gave up and marched up to the bar, where she was standing there chatting with the bartender, and asked if I could please get the salsa verde. 

A few minutes later she drops by my table and sets a little plastic cup of salsa verde on my plate. It's half full. There's no lid. Salsa is dripping over the edge. There are bits of green onion and queso blanco stuck to the sides. It's fairly obvious that she plucked it off the plate of some other diner who had finished their meal.

Terrible food and worse service.
