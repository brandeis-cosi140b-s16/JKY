I really want to like Moe's but I don't think I can. I've eaten here about four times. All in the late afternoon/evenings. There are never enough staff to make the food and they are always 'out' of something. Today was the final straw. They were out of the flour salad bowls, so I got a regular bowl. The rice was hard and crunchy, I skipped on the beans after the customer in front of me ordered them and they had a thick line of crust around the container from sitting so long, they were also out of grilled onions. They did offer to make new grilled onions, which they did and they placed them right back in the same dirty container.  The chicken that they had was the last of it, and she scooped it in and said "That's almost a full order of chicken". Then we got to the cold section, where they were basically out of sour cream. Now I'm sure they had more, the girl asked someone to get more, but it never came. So I accepted the fact that I got a half order of sour cream. When I got over to the salsa bar, the poor salsa suffered from the same issue as the beans. Just a large thick ring of dried up salsa on the sides. 

As we were eating, a small child, no more than 3 years old emerges from the double doors that are the kitchen and starts running around by where the sad food is peeped into whatever you order. His mother apparently worked there and he was with her at work. I watched him climb across a table and then go sit on the dirty floor under the same table to proudly get up and walk back to the food prep area. 

The rice was hard and crunchy, the chicken was DRY (and I like dry chicken, but I couldn't even stomach it), and everything was cold. 

Hopefully the health district comes and visits them so they serve some hot non crusted food.
