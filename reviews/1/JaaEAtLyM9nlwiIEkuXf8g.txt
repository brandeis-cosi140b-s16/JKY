I have never eaten worse food, even at this place in the past. The quantity is almost half of what it used to be and the fajita veggies were filled with salt !!! Extremely disappointing. We took 5 dishes and each and every one of them sucked big time. 

I came here after almost an year and can't believe how bad the food has become here.

I will never go to another Qdoba again...
