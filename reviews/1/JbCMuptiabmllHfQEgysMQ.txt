Granted it's been about 10 years since I came here last, sad to see that the food quality has depleted!  Charging for a second serving of chips or any salsa with entrees. Rice was dry as well as the tamale. Could've have just gotten some at the store and microwaved it myself. Apparently they also charge extra for water because they weren't refilled once during our meal. So disappointed that a landmark such as this has lot it's authentic value.
