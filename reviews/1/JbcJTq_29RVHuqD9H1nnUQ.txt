I love Chipotle. I drive by this location everyday, so you can imagine how excited I was when I saw the banner with "coming soon" sign. 

When they finally opened, I was there within the first week. I can say I've been there more than 10 times so far and there were few times (3 or 4 times) I just walked out of there because their food just did not look fresh. Chipotle is known for its fresh ingredients and meat, but not this location. I love barbacoa, but every time I go, they just look dry or too greasy. Same with pork as well. I got lucky and was able to get fresh steak right off the grill, but everything else looked so bad and their mild salsa (pico de gallo) ended up being too sour. Also the rice was not made right. One time I complained about portion as well. The girl at the counter was only putting half scoop. I was there yesterday around 5pm and walked out empty handed again. I wish they'd step up and pay more attention to their food quality because I love Chipotle and this is right around the corner from my house and to work. I will continue to try until their food is consistent and update my post when they do.
