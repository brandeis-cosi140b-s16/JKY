I LOVE MEXICAN FOOD, however I would be lying if I said that this place was worth recommending. I asked the girl at the counter what did she recommend since I have not ever been there "Oh, I don't eat here, so I don't know" maybe this should have been RED FLAG number one! 

I figured keep it simple, I ordered a chicken burrito and my boyfriend ordered 5 street tacos. We waited about 25 minutes, (there were 3 tables who already had their food) and when our food FINALLY came out my chicken burrito was burnt on the outside and when I opened it up the chicken inside was NASTY, well overcooked and HARD. I gave up quickly! The street tacos were greasy, I think he ate 3 of the five before he was DONE. Bottom line, save yourself the $20 bucks, there are plenty of FRESH and authentic Mexican food places around the valley, this is not one of them.
