Gross. I had a vegetarian burrito and to tell you the truth ive had better burritos at taco bell. I threw it away after 2 bites. Even the tortilla wasn't cooked all the way. My boyfriend had fish tacos and although edible we can make them better at home useing just the microwave.  It was horrible and I won't ever be back.
