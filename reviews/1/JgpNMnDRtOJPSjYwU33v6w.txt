Placed a $90 order for 9 people. Got home and two meals were missing. Called back and let them know what was missing. Showed up and they hadn't made it but instead argued with us about it then charged us for their mistake. Asked for a discount and they spoke back and forth in front of us in Spanish for about 30 seconds and then replied, "we don't give discounts." Very rude and disrespectful about the whole situation. Clearly Cafe Rio doesn't have customer service training.  Will never return and will never recommend.
