We went their based on the great YELP reviews......boy we must of picked an off day, cause it was really bad !

Walk in the front door (shared by  Lola's gaming) and the restaurant reeked of Cigarette smoke -- makes you want to gag before you even sit down.  We should of turned around and left right then and there.

There were 2 people running the restaurant and we were the only customers.  The gal that took our order didn't even speak english !    The chef in back came out to assist with the language barrier.  Both very nice -- but it took awhile to order, because she couldn't understand us?!?

Once we got our food, it was not good.  The chips and salsa are nasty old greesy tasting --- We really wanted to like this place --- but I have to give it an honest review and it was BAD !!!

Then we went to pay the bill it took 10 minutes for our waitress to figure out how to use the credit card machine to pay.....UGH !   Totally Horrible experience !!!
