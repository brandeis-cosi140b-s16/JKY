I am very disappointed in the food.
I order the carne asada quesadillas and they chopped up the carne so small about the size of a nail head a little cheese. They were so thin and it cost me over 8.00 for 3 wedges. I could have gotten more at Del Taco with chunks of meat for 3.00.
I won't go there again. Wasted money.
