THIS RESTAURANT USE TO BE GOOD. Not now. We ordered shrimp diablo and garlic shrimp. The diablo sauce was nothing but spicy enchiada sauce. The garlic shrimp sauce was a lemon sauce. Could not taste ANY butter or garlic. Salad used to be included. Now it's one of two sides to choose from. If you do choose the salad, they put a small handful of lettuce on the hot entree plate. Not too smart. Their "wonderful" bean dip that everyone seems to love is full of lard. Too many other good restaurants in Vegas.
