If I could give this place Zero stars or less I would. This is THE WORST SERVICE I have EVER had in my entire life. We did not get our drinks until we asked for them and then had to ask again for them several times the waitress didn't give us place settings we actually had to go over to one of the tables and get them. I specifically said that I was vegetarian and got a dish with pork fat in it and to top it all off my husband waited AN HOUR AND A HALF to get a bowl of black bean soup to which when he brought it to the attention of the staff they accused him of lying and then said it hadn't been that long and it took so long because they originally got him a small bowl and had to remake it. I was half way through my food when he hadn't even gotten ANY food yet. Asked to speak to a manager about our concerns manager doesn't speak English so it was pointless to which they offered a 20% discount I said make it 40% at least. We left EXACT change and are NEVER coming back again. If you want atrocious service this is your place. I'll find elsewhere. These people should really learn how to serve. Horrid!
