Came here for happy hour because we were stating at the HRH. I was excited to try happy hour, but only a few of the appetizer offerings were 50% off. The waiter said that margaritas were buy one get one, but when the check was presented it us later we had been charged for both margaritas to find out that it's only the HOUSE margarita that is buy one get one free. That wasn't explained to us at all and pretty much ruined the chances of my ever coming back here again. 

Ordered the tortilla soup (which was not a happy hour offering) which was pretty delicious and filling. We also got the appetizer platter and out of all the things on the platter I only like the sweet corn tamales. 

Overall I would never come back here again and would just walk out of the hotel to get my meal fix. One suggestion for Pink Taco would be to have a clearly designated menu for just Happy Hour drinks and food - a lot of people would get screwed over less this way.
