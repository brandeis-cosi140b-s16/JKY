One customer order ahead of me, I ordered 4 tacos, and waited for almost 20 minutes. The entire time, a young child - I'm guessing the owner's kid - ran back and forth through and hovered around the food prep area, licking and sucking his fingers. Even though I did not see him touch or eat the tortilla chips in front of him, it just grossed me out and seemed unsanitary.  The taco meat was dry and relatively flavorless. This restaurant will go the way of its previous tenants...
