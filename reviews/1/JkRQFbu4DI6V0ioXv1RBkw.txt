Quite frankly...the Alliante Station might be the worst hotel in Las Vegas when it comes to finding a decent meal.  With the exception of MRKT, the other outlets have no concept of fresh well prepared food.  Tonite I tried Cabo...Del Taco has a better chance of getting me back...cheap ingredients prepared poorly with no attention to detail is not a combination for success.
