I will definitely not be coming back here! Service was extremely grumpy. (Tip to restaurant management: PLEASE help your wait staff understand that most patrons expect FRIENDLY service. We are paying after all.) The food was average, at best. And our food came out on old, CHIPPED plates. Absolutely no excuse for that! And to make it a trifecta of negatives: the guacamole was mushy and slimey. There are far better Mexican restaurants in Charlotte. Frankly I don't know how this one stays in business.
