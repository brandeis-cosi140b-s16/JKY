Seen the reviews and decided check it out being I'm new to Vegas.  Food was ok not the greatest or the worst. We ordered shrimp tostadas and fish tacos,  beans tasted funky though.  The micheladas were ok,  we finished full.  But once we paid and we're about to leave my husband noticed a cockroach roaming through the place.  We were both disgusted!!! We let them know and they acted like it was a ant.  So just a little heads up people!!
