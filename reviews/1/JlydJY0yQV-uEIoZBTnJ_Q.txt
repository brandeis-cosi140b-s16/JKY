Horrible! I've been living in the neighborhood for 15 years and have unfortunately ordered at this KFC dozens of times. I can't think of a single time where something wasn't wrong with the orders. They manage to screw up anything! The employees are usually impolite and/or grumpy, and the chicken is rubbery and slimy. Mediocre at best.
