IF YOU LOVE CHIPOTLE LIKE I DO, DONT EAT AT THIS LOCATION. By far the worst chipotle location that I've ever visited. I ordered 3 Barbacoa tacos and the guy put a TINY bit of meat, when I asked for more he said "oh you want double meat?" No! I don't want double meat, I want enough meat to call it a damn taco. I asked for corn salsa, sour cream and cheese and I got sour cream and guacamole. Now,  I'm not complaining about the guac but I guess the cheese and corn salsa weren't important. The "double meat" sucked too. It didn't taste like other chipotle locations. The best part was the man scratching his crotch in the kitchen and then coming to "supervise" the good line.
