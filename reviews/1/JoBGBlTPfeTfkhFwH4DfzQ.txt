So, I decided to check out Qdoba because I got a buy one get one free coupon in the mail - I ate one for dinner last night and saved the other for lunch today. I love Chipotle, so I had high hopes, but man, the food was terrible. i got 2 Naked Burritos - the equivalent of a Chipotle Burrito Bol - one with steak and one with shredded beef. The rice was undercooked - practically crunchy, the shredded beef had a weird aftertaste like it had been stored in plastic, and the rest of it (mild salsa, "sauteed vegetables," cheese, sour cream) was just so, so bland. I ate them both because I'd paid for them, but the whole time I wished I'd just gone to Chipotle. Sigh.
