Went through the drive thru to order a double shrimp and oyster cocktail. Price on menu says "1100". Lady tells me my total is 15 and some change. I nicely question and she asks me to drive to the window. This is fine, as it was hard to hear her on the speaker as it was. I pull up and she informs me that it was incorrect on their menu. I asked why haven't they changed it... And of course she does not know. So she informs the owner/manager and he literally does that ah whatever hand gesture to shun me/it. I have no problem paying for cocktail from here, because I have had one before and they are amazing... I just despise rude costumer service.
