UGH.

Some of the two star reviews are being far too kind to this place. If you took the food they serve up here and stuck it in styrene clam-shell containers it would BE exactly the same as the slop served up by Roberto's.

Price was cheapish, but was very wet, under-seasoned and generally a nondescript mash of blah.

Chips and salsas weren't great either, with the salsas tasting like cheap pasta sauce.

One to avoid on the Vegas Mexican scene.
