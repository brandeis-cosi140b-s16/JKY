This chipotle seems to think it's okay to give you half a spoonful of meat. I had to ask three times for more meat and my burrito was still much smaller than any other burrito I've had at any other chipotle. This place is stingy with their food! Id give 0 stars if I could. Some employees are nice, but they need to give bigger than infant size portions.
