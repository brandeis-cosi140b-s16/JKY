I ordered at 6:24pm, food should have been at my place at 8, but didn't arrive until 8:24pm. I ordered a burrito, taco, fries, and wings. The fries were lukewarm and not all were edible cuz they were cold.. and anyone whose eaten cold fries knows they're disgusting. The burrito was ok, didn't have the cheese like I paid for. Now was gave it 1 star are the wings. THEY STILL HAVE FUCKING FEATHERS IN THEM!! ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?! Needless to say I trashed them and did not eat a single one. Idk how this place has 5 stars. I will NEVER order from here again and I'm GLAD I bought through grubhub so that I could get all my money back. 2 hours for this. Feathers... Luke warm food even though it's in a warming bag. Ridiculous. Disgusting.
