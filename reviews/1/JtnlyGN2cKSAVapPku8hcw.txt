Dear Maize, On planet earth, a torta is a crispy bolillo roll with various fillings, a kind of a sandwich that one holds in one's hands and sinks one's teeth into. It really doesn't matter if you can point to some group of earthlings who recognize a torta by any designation to be presented as a soppy, glue-like, waterlogged roll to be eaten out of a bowl with a spoon. There are exceptions to all good things, and your decision to serve a sandwich as a soggy concoction floating in broth makes your taqueria is one of them.
