I have been a very loyal customer of Charanda's for many years, of course starting at the Rock Hill location. I won't be returning to the Fort Mill location again. The last three times service has just been horrible. Don't get me wrong the food was good but the service is frustrating at best. Our bean and cheese dip never came until I reminded the waiter. This was after we were almost done with our meal. No drink refills. Not one until he asked me if I wanted my check. I said yes and I asked him if we could have refills on our drinks. The refills came and I was brought unsweetened tea. I was drinking sweet tea. Sorry but this location has lost a very loyal and repeat customer. If your going to go to Charanda's you might want to take the time and go to the Rock Hill location.
