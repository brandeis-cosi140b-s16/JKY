We thought we would try this location because it is close to our house. We walked in at 6:30 pm and was suprised it was not that busy. We stood in a short line of 10 people and it still took 30 minutes to get our meal. My wife ordered chicken nachos and they were out of chicken and we had to wait for Kevin to cook it. The staff were nice but you can tell they are uninspired and lack direction. Never coming to this location again.
