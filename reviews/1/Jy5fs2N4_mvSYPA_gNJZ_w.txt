Went inside to order 12 chicken tacos on taco night. Big mistake. 3 people before me and 3 people after me got their orders and the entire drive thru line was cleared up. When I asked about my order, they still managed to get it wrong. Their only saving grace is they are lucky I'm so cheap. I guess you get way you pay for.
