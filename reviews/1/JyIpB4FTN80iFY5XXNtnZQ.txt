Bad service the food was aweful and the workers need to be more educated about their food and menu and be more friendly and use common sense. I asked them which orders were what and they looked and said they didn't know don't you so they didn't mark the items at all so my family and I spent 15 minutes trying to figure out which was ours!  This restaurant need to take notes from the one on warm springs very perfessional!
