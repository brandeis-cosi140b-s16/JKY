Had 2, 2 tacos combos and 1coke, $18.94!!!! What are these people thinking? Are they joking? It's unreal how these restaurants keep ripping people off, 4 tacos for almost $20 dollars, unreal, this shouldn't be over $12 dollars, if you are unable to provide food at a reasonable price, close and do something else, bc the end will be the same
