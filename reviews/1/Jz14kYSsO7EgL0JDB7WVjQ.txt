My second visit and it will probably will be my last.  Had a Bueno Burger bueno style and a Bueno Dog bueno style.  The condiments were ok, but way to much it made my burger and dog colder than the condiments it really made me feel like the meat was not cooked and the burger tasted like they dumped a bottle of liquid smoke on it.  We will find out if I get a bueno case of Montezuma's Revenge later.
