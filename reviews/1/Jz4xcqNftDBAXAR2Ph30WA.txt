Terrible venue:

(-1) Bad drinks (they add water, confirmed by 3 people).

(-1) Bad Crowd (the guys upstairs playing beer pong went gangsta out front).

(-1) You cant drink and be on the dance floor at the same time, because it's 18+ on the dance floor, and the bar area is way too far away to enjoy a show with your drink.

(-1) Dingy (as in dirty, unclean).

(-1) BYOPS (Bring your own parking space); It's a really tiny parking lot for a ginormous venue.

----------------------------------
The only reason it deserves 1 star:
(+6)  FML will be there once a month on Fridays; so it will be the ONLY chance to see good electronic dance music in Tempe. If we can get 100 people to show up, we can pre-party with good drinks at home and then enjoy the space for FML dance purposes only.

Otherwise (at all other times in Tempe dance venues), expect top 40 B.S. with beats and lyrics that struggle to match a toddler's sophistication.
