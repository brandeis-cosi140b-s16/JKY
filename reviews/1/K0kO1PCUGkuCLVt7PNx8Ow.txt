Let's start at the top. The service was slow and the waitress could barely pronounce the name of the specials.  I know that not everyone needs to know Spanish to work at a restaurant that serves Mexican food, but if you can not pronounce the specials, please search for another place to work.  

The food was average maybe even below average, but I am too nice to say it.  I had the 5 plate bocadillo and the veggie enchiladas.  The 5 plate, was small, completely bland and unappetizing.  As for the veggie enchiladas, bland.  They are small portions and plain white rice.  It says that it was cilantro-lime rice, but honestly it was so bland. I left still hungry wondering what I just spent my money on. 

They are trying too hard to be an upscale restaurant. It took them an hour to serve my room temperature meal.

Do not go there. It is awful. I love food and I love Mexican food, but this place is a place I would never recommend.

Oh and those photos? Not helpful at all.

Sometimes I wish there was a no-star option.
