If I could give this place 0 stars I would. I ordered a chicken fajita and it was hands down the worse I ever had. The chicken was extremely dry flavorless and chopped up into teeny tiny pieces and was mixed with slivers of onions and peppers. The worst part was the warm goop that I assume was guacamole based on the dark green color. It had the same flavor and consistency of the sour cream. Last but not least, the horchata was watered down and gritty. This place is definitely no bueno
