This is the longest wait I've ever had at a Taco Bell. Six PM on a Sunday, two cars including myself and I've already been waiting in a drive through for 20 minutes.  This is the third time I've been to this location and its a strikingly similar occurrence each time. One time the guy behind the counter flat out told me it would be a 30 minute wait, the store was empty I was the only one there.

Whoever owns this particular store may want to consider making some staffing changes .
