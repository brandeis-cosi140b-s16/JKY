If an option to give 0 stars was available, I'd select it!!!! Horrible Horrible Horrible!! Ordered Carne Fries ($9 plate) and they gave me more cheese than Carne Asada!!! REALLY??? Also ordered a Arizona Burrito and they gave me a kid size portion! So upset!! Gave them a call and ask for a manager and this dude goes "How can i help you?" After explaining, he passes the phone to some lady that I can not understand at all whatsoever!!!! All i understood was her saying thats there portion size. I will be driving back to the store first thing tomorrow morning to get an address of where I can formally address my complaint and let them know how horrible they ended my night!! After this I think I will be sticking with Senor Taco and paying an extra $1 or $2 for an entree/burrito. "Don't be fooled, there is 1.. only 1!" What a joke!!! Save your money customers. Let this place close out!
