The food is good but every time my wife orders extra wet she never gets it! They also forgot her churro last time and when I returned the cook called me a liar and said we didn't order it. Cashier had pulled up my order receipt to prove it. We use to order twice a week. They no longer have our business. The cashier also put her arm up to her elbow in the horchata. Gross!!!!! No more Viva for us!
