So, I have been to more than a few Café Rios all over the valley and even out of state, and unfortunately this place doesn't do the name justice. You would think being a chain the food would all be the same, unfortunately this was much lower quality than any of the other establishments I have been to. The beans were undercooked, their assembly line was terrible, beans in the rice, cilantro in the cheese, a cup in the house dressing.. I didn't really want to complete the order, but my fiancé insisted. 

Aside from the mediocre food the service was horrible, they threw the salad together like taking my order was annoying to them. The worst part was the straws.. Not individually wrapped.. I don't know if this is the manager's doing or the owner's.. Either way, the Café Rio name will only take you so far. Hopefully you aren't failing on purpose.
