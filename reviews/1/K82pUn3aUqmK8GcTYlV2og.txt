I didn't even eat...asked one of the employees if there were any food choices that did not contain garlic powder.  After a thorough check, the employee indicated that every single food choice they offer has garlic powder in it.  This is a lazy way to cook and will result in all of the food tasting basically the same (garlic is such a potent flavor that it overpowers all the others).  Chipotle needs to widen their horizons and start using some variable spices (there are hundreds more to choose from).  Not everyone wants to return from lunch with offensive breath that lasts for days.
