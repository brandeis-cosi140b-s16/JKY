Salsa was ok but the eggs were awful how does this place stay open? Its disgusting food... They served us huevos rancheros with burnt fries dried up cheese. The best way to judge mexican food is by the beans...they were awful. The cocinero was horrible   ....I had to quit writing this because I was sick for a few hours ...
