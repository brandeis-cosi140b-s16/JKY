Service was absolutely terrible! It took close to 15 minutes for a waitress to take our order. The restaurant was no where near full. 

The manager was very unprofessional. He only greeted European guests. He walked past All customers of color at surrounding tables (Asian, Hispanic, African American). 

The food was overpriced, mediocre in quality. I would not recommend dining here if good service and flavorful food are high on your priority list.
