I live in the west valley but had to drive over here to pick up my son from summer camp and it was lunchtime so we stopped in. When I walked in, there was no hostess. I waited for a few minutes and a very friendly girl greeted/seated us. I asked where the restroom was and she pointed me in the direction.  When I was several feet from the door of the restroom the smell of poop emanated from the bathroom.  Unfortunately, it was an emergency so I had to use it.  I told the server of the smell and she said it was plumbing and "Sewage" which had I not already been nauseous would have made me so. The restaurant was extremely hot, my napkin was rolled and it looked like used at a previous table and reused because it had dried up salsa on it.  So, I already decided not to eat. The "salsa" was watered down tomato sauce with chunks of onion and cilantro.  I ordered an appetizer platter for my sons because it was 1 pm and we were already there.  The tacos and chimichangas were super greasy and unappetizing.  I will never eat here again. Gross.
