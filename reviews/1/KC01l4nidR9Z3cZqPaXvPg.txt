We stopped in for dinner last night after a long day of hiking in the Superstition Mountains. Needless to say, we were very hungry and looking forward to our dinner.

What a disappointment! I started off with the house margarita... and regretted my decision immediately. It tasted like salty dishwater! I'm not kidding! There was actually a faint soapy taste once you got past the overwhelming blast of salt! I didn't taste anything that even reminded me of a good margarita. I used to work as a bartender, so I believe I know what a decent one should taste like. Strike one.

Then my food arrived. I ordered the chicken enchilada plate (For $14)... and it arrived with two tiny enchiladas, and a small amount of rice and beans. While the flavor wasn't bad, it was certainly nothing to write home about. The enchiladas were about 2/3 full of a very salty chicken blend, and covered with a bland verde sauce. I ate them only because I was so hungry by the time the food arrived. I don't know if the kitchen was running out of food or if they are just that cheap! Either way, it left me very unsatisfied. I wish I had gone to the Basha's grocery store next door and bought my own food to prepare at home!

Overall, I would advise others to avoid this restaurant! There are too many other choices in the area that will not allow you to leave hungry and unhappy!
