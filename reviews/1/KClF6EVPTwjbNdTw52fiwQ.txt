The decor was that of a 50's Mexican diner if there is such a thing. We hadn't even sat down when the chips and salsa arrived. That was nice. 
As usual, we ordered pico de gallo for the chips which was just ok. Not fresh made but at least not out of a jar like the salsa tasted.
We had the steak fajitas. I can't say anything nice about it. It was the same plain, bland fajita that you can order at any chain store across Canada or the USA. 
The service was good but not enough to bring me back. 
I think this is the step between Taco Time and an authentic Mexican restaurant. You should skip this place.
