Far from top notch. This place had a table salsa that tasted as if it had been sitting out a bit too long. Perfect combo to go along with the stale chips. The best part? That would be when we were told that they ran out of cheese. 
What a letdown! Very difficult to believe that anybody would find anything tasteful in this restaurant. This place used to be awesome until it switched ownership. Not even a slight chance I'll ever be returning to this restaurant. 
Service is practically nonexistent too. Tables that came after were served before us.
