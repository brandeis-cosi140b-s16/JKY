I went here yesterday and the drive through worker was moving so fast she gave me the incorrect change. I went back and explained to them that they had shorted me $10 and all the manager/owner could say was its my responsibility to get the right amount. I was driving so I didn't count the change plus there was a long line behind me. They obviously don't care about their customers here.
