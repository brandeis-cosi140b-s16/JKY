I don't understand how anyone would consider this place decent. We should've left immediately after seeing the filthy condition the place was in, but stayed because we were desperate to find a decent Mexican restaurant and sometimes looks can be deceiving. After ordering our food we waited for our number to be called but apparently our ticket got looked over because we noticed about 10 people who ordered  after us were already eating their meals. Overall, the food was extremely bland and had no flavor whatsoever. 

I wish I read the reviews before coming here, a lot of them are frightening. At least the meat we received wasn't rotten.. Definitely not going to take any further risks with this place. 

Guess we'll have to keep looking.
