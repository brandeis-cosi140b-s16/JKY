I had a bad experience! Perhaps if I had ordered something else, it may have been different, but unfortunately, I will not be returning.

It was a late night and I was too lazy to drive to my usual, and reliable spot, Felipito's.

Went through the drive through and waited nearly 15 minutes at the window before I got my food. I ordered a chicken burrito and asked them what it came with. They said chicken, peppers, pico de gallo and sour cream. I asked to add rice and guacamole and they said its an extra charge, so I said "ok, that's fine." Came home to realize they gave me only ONE hot sauce, which is clearly not enough for a burrito. Then, as I'm eating my chicken burrito, I find that all they put inside my burrito was RICE AND CHICKEN...and that's it! Besides having missing ingredients, the chicken was huge chunks of chicken that made it nearly impossible to bite through.

I'll definitely be making the drive over to Felipito's next time I have a craving.
