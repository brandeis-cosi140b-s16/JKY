EVERYTHING was HORRIBLE. Food portion SO tiny,its smaller than the palm of ur hand. Loaded with lettuce and added a few pieces of meat if ur lucky. HUGE chunks of ice cubes larger than the cup only to water down ur drink. Service was non existent. Tables so small u constantly bang ur knee because everyone is crammed together. THIS PLACE SUCKS! Outrageous price for food that leaves u still on an empty stomach. We had 6 tacos that looked like we ordered a crappy salad bar.
