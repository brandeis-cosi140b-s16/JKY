This location has a poor staff.

I now understand why people dine in.  It takes so long to get thru the ordering process and checking out that the food is cold by the time you get it.

The gal putting the extras on orders was a sloppy, inefficient, wasteful mess.  Spilling everything she grabbed into every other item bin.  Not to mention having a terrible attitude.  I understand these employees are all probably paid minimum wage and are 17 or under in age but when I pay $13.00 for a Burrito that isn't even better than Chipotle with the poor service I received, it can't justify going back.

The entire ordering and timing process needs to be examined and experience dramatic changes.  There was only 6 people in line in front of me and it took me 24mins from getting my order taken to checking out.
