If you like faux mexican food served on plates that would melt lava than this is the place. went for dinner got the taco plate with rice and beans. when we got our food the beans where screaming for me to give them water so i poured a half glass of water on my plate. the water started to boil as the poor beans soaked up the rest. we stated our complaint and only a redo was offered so we left without burning our insides out. rolaids anyone? So we then went to senor taco which was waaay better. Senor Taco, best mexican in FH lol.
