Wish I could give negative stars...

Went out with a group of 4 people. 
The server came over after 10 min of us sitting there to tell us he is busy and he may take a while to come back for drink orders. 

Finally he comes by again clearly hassled. 

And angrily takes our order for drinks. We also order our food since we had sat there for so long. 

Our food came out completely uncooked. The steak had frost on it. Nobody came by to ask how the food was so we walked the steak back to the kitchen. The guy yelled at my friend for coming back to the kitchen. 

The waiter stepped on both me and my friends feet. And did not apologize and not to mention he was sweating into the food he was serving us. 
When we complained he ignored the complaint and just rang us up. 

Overall the worst service ever!!! 
Will never come back.
