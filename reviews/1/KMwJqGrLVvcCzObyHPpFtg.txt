As nacho connoisseurs from Texas my brother and I were stoked to check this place out! Great concept because really good nachos involve some prep work!
Nacho Daddy does not deliver! Ingredients do not taste fresh and are layered in a way that homogenized all the flavor.  Try not chopping everything into tiny bits.  Their menu offers very few divergent takes on the classic nacho supreme and what they do offer lacks imaginations.
