Worst service ever!!! Not just us, 2 tables around us as well....20 minutes after being sat, still nothing. Then came guacamole;  no chips no drinks. 5 minutes later we had chips;  no drinks. Went and asked for manager and got our drinks. 20 minutes later, 2 of 6 meals came out. More waiting. Asked for manager again. Finally the rest came out. Food was ok. The kids meal came with dessert: churros. Hard as rocks.  Manager never came out to check on us. Had to ask for bill; then find someone to run the card. The table next to us NEVER  received their bar drinks. They asked 2 different servers and the manager...they never came.  I've heard the lunch is great; I'll never know because I will never eat here again!
