Gave a 1 star because 0 star isnt an option... picked up a to go order, ordered 1 shrimp taco and 1 fish taco.. no fish on the fish taco- only had cauliflower and carrots? Shrimp taco had 4 pieces of shrimp.. ordered black beans, got refried... total let down. Stick to Phat Burrito or look up Picante. They are in a location that will flop quickly if they dont get their stuff together!
