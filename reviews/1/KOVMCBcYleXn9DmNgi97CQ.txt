We were at the mall and wanted to try something new so we stop into Sir Veza's.  We got a table very quickly, I think there staffing ratio was 3 to 1, perhaps training.  Although this didn't provide good service.   When ordering a beer say glass not pint the waitress didn't know what a pint was the size.  Also make sure you are very specific on your beer order otherwise you will get the wrong one (as I did).  We try a few appetizers, mistake the first was covered in cheese whiz with a dollop of sour cream, I thing there were French fry bit swimming in there but wasn't sure.  The Jalape√±o chicken sliders weren't too bad, but the onion straws with them were under cooked (no crunch at all).  And because of our massive food order it took a while for the food to arrive at our table.  And even though this place had a whack of staff obtaining a refill of salsa or chips was not an easy task.  I would not go back.
