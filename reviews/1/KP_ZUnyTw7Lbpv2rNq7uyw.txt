Food has really gone down hill. The Machaca Taco used to be amazing. You expect a serious taco when they're charging over $5.00 for a single taco. And they used to be that good. Not any more. Mine had a minuscule amount of beef. Essentially a prefab taco shell with no more than 2 ounces of meet. What a disappointment from what they were in the past. Pathetic! Really sad to see. My family and friends have been going to Tee Pee for over 40 years. In a misguided attempt to trim costs, Tee Pee has lost several lifetime customers. Adios
