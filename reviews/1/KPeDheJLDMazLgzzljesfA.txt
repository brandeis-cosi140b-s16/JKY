We have driven by this place so often and I was craving chips and salsa and it was my birthday so we decided to try this place. We came in for lunch about 2:30, so even tho there was only one car in the parking lot didn't make me think differently. They have a nice d√©cor of cactus, plants, butterflies, parrots etc. We were seated as soon as we walked in the door. The waiter he was soft spoken but, friendly and got us drinks and chips and salsa while we read the menu. It was old inside but, it does look clean. 
We ordered cheese enchiladas, beans and rice with green sauce and my husband got a bean and cheese burrito wet with red sauce. We started eating on the chips and salsa as well as the bean dip they brought. :( the chips were stale. The salsa tasted like something had been burned while making it. The beans had no flavor!! So we waited for our food. Its simple food who can mess that up RIGHT??
THEY CAN!! When they brought out the food the plates were super hot to touch but, the food was not. My cheese enchiladas were cold and how the cheese was melted on top you know they were prefab in the refridgerator and popped into the microwave!! The beans still no flavor and the rice no flavor at all. My husbands burrito looked like they just opened a can of tomato sauce mixed it with water and poured it over his burrito. YUCK!! Happy Birthday to me NOT!!!
We will NEVER go back thank got I didn't order something complicated like chicken taco.
