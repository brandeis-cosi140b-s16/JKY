My friend and I were on the hunt for some fried ice cream, the majority of the restaurants near us either closed early or were closed Sunday's. So we had the choice of eating here or at Coasta Cantina at the Suncoast. 

Walking in, there was no hostess, she was in the back and emerged to bring another customer her order, when she did acknowledge us, she was very friendly and proceeded to seat us, handed us the menus, and took our drink orders. Their website states they offer happy hour from 8 p.m. to close on Sunday's, but I can't confirm since there was no mention of it to us.

I took a look at the menu because I was craving ceviche but they did not have any, which was a bit of a let down because all of the Mexican restaurants I've visited have it. We just ended up ordering the dessert we originally came for, fried ice cream and also ordered some sopapillos. After we placed our order, the dessert came out around 5 minutes later. We took a look at our fried ice cream and were a bit thrown off. It looked pre-made, it was cold on the outside, no whipped cream, no cherry on top, and the texture was weird, it looked glazed, and came in a cinnamon shell. It was like no fried ice cream we've ever had, it's normally fried before it's brought out, so it's warm on the outside, cold on the inside, not here. Now for the sopapillos, they were not thick or fluffy enough, they did have good flavor since they were coated with cinnamon and sugar but it's a dessert that is very hard to screw up. After we received our order, no one came to check up on us, it took a little while to receive our checks so basic customer service was definitely lacking and there were only two other tables when we walked in. 

I was really disappointed. Overall we decided on this place because it was smaller and we thought, why not give our business to a mom and pop restaurant instead of a corporate company, but it was a mistake.
