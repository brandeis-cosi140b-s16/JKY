I'll post my actual review before I share the background story so those who are not interested can move on. Basically, the food is as mediocre as any other fast food Mexican grill, but the service is far worse!

The first and only time I set foot in this establishment was a brisk, fall afternoon as a freshman at the University of Illinois. My order was simple - all I wanted was burrito, without the meat. As the server relays my order to the other employees, he makes a quip in Spanish about how difficult we vegetarian customers are, not knowing that I also speak Spanish. I ignored his rude comment and went about my merry way, but I have never returned to this day. I can only imagine what might happen if I did...
