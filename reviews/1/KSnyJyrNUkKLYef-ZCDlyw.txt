Greasy, slow, expensive, unfriendly, and bland. I could think of more buzzwords, but that about sums it up. $10 and change for an unseasoned, greasy, meat-sweat inducing burrito with soupy gray beans, orange rice, and a drink. No salsa bar to speak of. Almost $2 for a small fountain drink and no free refills (not just on the Horchata/Jamaica variety but soft drinks as well). Terrible segmented Styrofoam plates, single ply napkins, and bendy silverware complete the experience.

I guess they have to cut corners evrrywhere else to afford their 70-inch TV that lights up their dining area better than fluorescent lighting. There are cheaper, better restaurants that actually care about what they're doing that would love your money.
