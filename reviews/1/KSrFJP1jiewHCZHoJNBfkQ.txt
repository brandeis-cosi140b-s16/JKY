Really not much here to say. The location overlooking the strip is amazing. City center and Bellaggio's fountains are across the street. The food and drinks are mediocre. But the food is overpriced and the drinks are wayyyyy overpriced. Seriously, $11 for a margarita served in a plastic cup and a $9 beer. Stay clear. Go to the lounge in Cosmopolitan for similar prices.
