very poor service from the moment we walked in and were told not to sit at the mostly empty patio. we couldn't get a straight answer about how long for the patio...so we waited about 10 min. when it became clear he just didn't want to seat us on the patio, we just sat inside. I would say every other table or more was empty, so I suspect the waiting was due to a shortage of staff. our waiter was either very awkward or arrogant. he kind of mocked my mother in law's order. very odd. even with many empty tables, the food took about 20-plus min to come up (we ordered really basic ala carte kind of stuff..tostada, cheese crisp, rice, etc. our food arrived with typical "careful, the plates are hot," which was anything but the truth. my cheese enchilada was tepid at best...to the point the cheese had turned into a congealed lump. at one point I accidentally knocked over a glass of iced tea...I mean ice cubes flying off the table. I would say at least three staff members just mosied on by like they didn't notice. when we finally asked someone to wipe off the table, they said yes and disappeared, never came back. Let's put it this way...I left a 15% tip for the first time in more than a decade....and that felt generous.
