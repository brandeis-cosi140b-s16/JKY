I had high hopes for this place after reading all the good reviews, but this place was a disappointment.. The beef taco and rice were the worst I've ever had and I have had A LOT of Mexican food, after all, it is my favorite. The crispy beef taco and rice I ordered didn't even taste like Mexican food, it tasted like garlic rice pilaf and the beef in the taco had a weird taste to it that I can't place. Ugh!
