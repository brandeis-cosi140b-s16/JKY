Awful! I stopped here during my layover in Phoenix and I was higly dissapointed. I love mexican food but this was disgusting. I ordered the steak tacos; the steak had an almost burnt taste to it with absolutely no seasoning. The entree came with black beans and mexican rice, they were both also VERY bland. The service also was pretty bad; my waitress was very slow. I sat there for 15min before she even asked me if I wanted a drink. I definately don't recommend this restaurant.
