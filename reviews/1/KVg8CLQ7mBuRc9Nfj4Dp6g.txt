Wednesday night.  8:30 pm, no clear entrance to the restaurant..  Found a way in, asked an employee if they were still open, didn't see anybody.  She said "yes, til 10".  Offered no assistance.  I waited for the host to arrive.  Flippant attitude, disgust ensued.  10-15 minutes later a waiter arrived who couldn't have cared less that I was human.  I ordered a drink and an entree.  I got both at the same time.  I would have expected this service at Taco Bell, and quite honestly, I wish I had gone to Taco Bell, as what I ordered wasn't as good as what I could get at the fast food restaurant.  My suggestion:   Stay as far away at this less than worthy restaurant.  Blech on all accounts.  No, double blech.....
