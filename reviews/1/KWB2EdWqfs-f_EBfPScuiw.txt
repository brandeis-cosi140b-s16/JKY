Drive thru is terrible. You are rushed the entire time, even if you are the only customer at 10 o'clock at night. 

The lady had no manners or any sort of restaurant (fast food) professionalism. While ordering she interrupts you with your total. I had asked for a specific item and it seemed as if she was in a rush to hurry and say "no". There was no entry and exit greeting as you pull up the window.  

As far as the food, I am disappointed. Putting aside the horrible customer service, the Carne Asada meat is too heavily seasoned, the spanish rice is also the same, and the burrito is wrapped as if it were done carelessly. I could wrap a burrito tighter then this with my eyes closed. 

Worse Roberto's I have ever been to thus far.
