Good food. Horrible service. Hostesses never once gave us a smile or seemed happy to have us. Server took almost ten minutes to greet us. Drinks took another ten minutes. Table sat down next to us and got up and left because the server never came and greeted them! As we were eating, someone from a table behind us threw up right next to our table. This was at dinner! There was no monitoring of people's alcohol intake and honestly, I lost my appetite after someone vomiting right next to my nachos. Overpriced, especially for the service. I live here in Vegas and was taking some friends out from out of town. Definitely will not be returning. I got a water refill once, and we waited for our checks with empty plates for 20 minutes. Stay away from this place! So many better options.
