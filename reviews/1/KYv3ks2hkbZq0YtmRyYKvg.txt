Ok this is new to the area, this is where our Popeyes chicken used to be. This was the 2nd time that i tried this place. As i wanted to try something different from Robertos. The first time i tried the burrito, not bad but not the best i have had. However i thought i would give them another try. This time a family meal, the char chicken. Well needless to say with the one star i gave indicates the food was not good at all. So not good that i got sick and threw it all i mean all up. And all the night was sick. NEVER going here again. And then after reading another comment someone made that he saw a worker empty trash and not wash her hands, now have me really questioning the cleanliness of the restaraunt. 

I am so good and will be back to Robertos when i want my Mexican food fix, fast food style that is.

I had to edit this review to add that even at 1:30 pm i am still feeling ill so i thought to at least call them to let them be aware that something that i ate from there made me sick. At first the worker (not manager as one was not there) was shocked and understanding. Asked me to hold on then came back to the phone and tell me that she is sorry but its impossible that i got sick from anything there because they make all their food fresh! REALLY????? 

All i could say is ok thanks and hangup, KNOWING if they are that stupid to think that, then that definitely not a place i would want to eat at ever again.
STILL FEELING SICK THANKS!!!
