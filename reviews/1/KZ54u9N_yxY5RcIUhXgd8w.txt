Came here for a quick bite figured we would check this place out. What can I say other then I most likely wouldn't return. Food was bland nothing special. Pancake was burned on the bottom, "chilaquiles verdes" were gross not authentic at ALL. Ordered over easy eggs came out cooked through the middle. Fake Canned refried beans that' the waitress said "they made fresh" which was bs I come from a Mexican family and I know when I taste real frijoles those were def not fresh. Anyways service was fine no complaints on that just would not recommend this spot to anyone. It was pretty empty too. We originally were supposed to go to tacos el Gordo but it was packed so we just came here .
