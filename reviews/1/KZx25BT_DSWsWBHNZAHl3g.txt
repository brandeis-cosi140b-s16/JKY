I was so disappointed with my experience here in phoenix.  I had been waiting for this place to open up, since we make special trips to Tucson just for a hot dog.  It looks like I will have to drive to Tucson still since the hot dogs at this location do not even come close, food tastes like it has be reheated, the buns are rubbery and chewy, horrible horrible!!
