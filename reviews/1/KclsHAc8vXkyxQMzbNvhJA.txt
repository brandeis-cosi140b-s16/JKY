When we were seated..... we waited almost 10 min. for service and they weren't even busy!! They didn't bring is chips and salsa until we asked, my husbands water glass was dirty. They are overpriced. Did I say they are Overpriced!? Ordered ceviche for 12.95. Surprised at how small the portion was. Ordered guacamole and that too was pricy and the portion small. Usually appetizers are meant for sharing but for those portions and prices I won't order either one again.....the drink my hubs ordered was not refillable. We were not told that prior to ordering... all and all less than stellar experience. Sorry to say we won't be back. Postino is next store so will be going there instead.
