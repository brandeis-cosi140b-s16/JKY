Extremely disappointed.   The service was horrible.  We were seated immediately but several servers walked past us like we were invisible.   We finally got recognized and got our drink orders.    The food was not great at all.  My Torta roll was very hard and the thing with the most flavor on my food was the red onion.   Who even offers fries as a side!?

But the capper was being over charged on my bank statement for a $40 tip on a $47 dollar check.   I guess their reading ability is on par with their seasoning skills.    You'd be happier going to Chipolte!
