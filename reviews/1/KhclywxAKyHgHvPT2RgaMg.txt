Their food is cheap but yet on grub hub its a $35 minimum?!?!?? There's no way 2 people can order that much as a minimum. each entree is about $8 by the time u get sides it's only $25 or so. It's unfair to those who actually want to eat your food. There's not many Mexican places that deliver  and they would corner the market.
