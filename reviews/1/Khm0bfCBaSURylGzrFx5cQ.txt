They get 1 star, because I can't give negatives. Honestly, I am a huge chipotle fan, and they usually never disappoint. I went recently on a Tuesday night, at around 9:30.  The line was pretty much out the door despite the near closing time. I wanted a steak burrito bowl, and there was no steak. Hungry and impatient, I agreed to wait for more meat. After waiting about 10 minutes, I finally got steak. I asked for pico de gallo, cheese, sour cream, and corn, and the associate was "selectively listening" and decided to not give me any of that. I asked for more and she just have me a dirty look. When I finally sat down to eat the bowl, the rice was hard as heck! I literally was eating day old rice and before I could complain, we were getting kicked out because they were closing. Chipotle.... You have failed me
