I went to try out the breakfast burrito, they say open at 730 but didn't open door til 745. I proceeded to order and was told kitchen wasn't ready and it would be 15 minutes. Seems like their missing out on the high school kids and parents with this.

Food: burrito left more to be desired although it was large it was lacking in flavor. Tortilla was falling apart and super crispy. Not my thing. Salsa was pretty good though! I got eggs, bacon, potatoes, cheese and beans my norm. I should have just got my norm bowl of  cereal.
