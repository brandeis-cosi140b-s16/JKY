We went here the other day for lunch. I have been here a few times, but unfortunately I felt I needed to write a review after this. The food has never been excellent, but decent enough to go back every once in a while. Kind of like a family staple when its like "Where should we go?" and after several "I don't know's" we would end up here because its decent and close to the house. I like their enchiladas. We were here on Tuesday. We ordered two cheese enchiladas and nachos. Let me put this out there, I LOVE CHEESE. SO much. For me to say there was too much cheese, it has to be really bad. My husbands nachos were so cheesy, there was literally puddles of grease on the plate. We were joking about what Gordon Ramsey would say about all the grease. He would have drained it in to a glass. We probably would have gotten a whole cup, no joke!  The chips were so soggy that they were not even able to be picked up, they would just break into mush. When he got down a little further, there was literally a 1/4 inch of cheese, cooked so much it had formed it's own plate, we were able to pick it up off the plate in one piece! We mentioned it to the waiter twice, he seemed completely unconcerned. On the third time we mentioned it, he said "Well, its probably because of all that cheese" and walked away and got our bill. Honestly, if he had just said sorry about that, or offered new ones, I would have been happy. The chips and salsa are good though (need to ask for the hot, the one they serve is just stewed tomatoes pretty much, but the hot is awesome).
