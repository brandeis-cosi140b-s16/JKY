This resaurant has consistently gone down hill for the last 5 years. I have been going here since the granding opening when I was 10 years old. It was always the best around. Not quite sure what has happened maybe their chef got deported?? Food is not the same!!! Bring your real chef back PLEASE!! Also the menu prices have gone up and up and up. Worse food higher cost Not a recipe for success
