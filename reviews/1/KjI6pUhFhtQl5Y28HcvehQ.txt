Went for lunch. No lunch specials just an overly priced menu. $8.00 for a cheese quesadilla! Portions are small. My chips were old and stale. My chicken was dry, just hope don't get food poisoning. The service was not good. I felt ignored. I was not offered a salsa or water refill. At checkout, the waitress just dumped the bill and left. I had to get up to pay at the cash register. Very cold and rude service. Not coming back.
