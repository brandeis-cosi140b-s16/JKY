So last night my girl and I went to pick up some food. She always gets the same thing. Bean and cheese burrito with adding sliced avocado. The counter help Martin said they can't do that! We say well all the others do. And he says " I'm not going to put up with this" we were shocked!! If I was 25 I would of dragged him over the counter but I'm better than that!! This is not what customer service should be!!! Failed Martin!!!
