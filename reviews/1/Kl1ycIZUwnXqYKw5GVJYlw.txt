Me and my husband decided to try Baja Fresh because we had a coupon for a free meal. When we got to the restaurant we were told that they were no longer honoring the coupon despite it being in a coupon book for 2012 and it was 1-2-12. The lady behind the counter instead gave us $5 off so we ordered out food. We waited and waited and watched people that ordered after us get their food. The lady behind the counter kept asking the cooks where our food was. I then watched the lady behind the counter get food and put it on a tray. She the walked the food out to a gentleman sitting at a table and told him she have him the wrong food and traded the meals. The meal she brought back was them put on a tray and given to us.  Needless to say, we asked for our money back and left.
