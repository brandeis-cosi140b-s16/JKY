It smells like wet moldy towels when you walk in. The restaurant looks like any mix can restaurant hole in the wall. You think it's counter service, but a gentleman name Juan served us. He was quite pleasant. My husband got the street tacos and I got a burrito. Their chips weren't fresh, I actually thought they were store bought and then my husband saw them cooking them. The ones we got must have been old. Their guacamole was ok. Tasted like Costco guac. There was very little meat in my burrito, but the meat was tasty.
