I went with my wife for dinner.  Our server does not paying attention to to us when he took our order.  My wife ordered chicken tacos and I ordered chicken burrito. For drink we both ordered water with lemon wage. The server came back right away with water no lemon.  When the food arrived, my wife got beef tacos instead of chicken. I'm not sure how it's happen but we didn't sent it back to the kitchen.  My chicken burrito was dry as a bone. This time we had to sent it back to the kitchen.  When I explained to our server that the burrito is dry and not eatable, he just picked it up in his hand and looked at it for a minute and asked me if I wanted something else instead. I ordered chicken fajita. Once again the chicken was too dry but at this point I already lost my petite.Moreover, all the side dishes were in poor quality. The rise was too try. The salsa was old like it was standing in the cooler over night. We could just go to one of the Mexican fast food restaurants and get better quality then that.  the one star up there is for the chips and salsa.
