First off let me say I have eaten Mexican food in many places Mexico, Arizona, Unfortunately California, New Mexico, TEXAS, Budapest Hungry,  Bosnia and throughout the rest of the USA.

How difficult is it to use a marinade or even season as you cook? Must be nearly impossible. 

This is horrible Mexican food period. Velveeta cheese dip with spinach for $9.

My Beef fajitas had 3 times the unseasonably veggies than meat. The meat is fatty with no flavor other than bland walmart tasting beef. Both sets of flour tortias were old and fell apart. how can you not make tortillas? HOW

My wife had a super soggy chicken enchilada.  WAter must be the dominate flavor. The taco is just hideous to eat. Tastes like a boild paste.  I'm not sure even my dogs will eat it. 

My Family will never eat here again. 10 stars all down
