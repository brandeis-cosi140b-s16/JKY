Great service less then mediocre food.
We went for lunch and the parking lot being empty should have been a sign. 
I had the fish tacos that were very fishy and came on flour tortillas and with lettuce when the menu stated corn tortillas and cabbage. rice and beans were fine nothing special. 
My boyfriend ordered the shrimp fajitas and he tasted one shrimp and said I cant eat this, ill get sick. The shrimp tasted old and were almost soggy.    
DO NOT recommend and will not be back.
