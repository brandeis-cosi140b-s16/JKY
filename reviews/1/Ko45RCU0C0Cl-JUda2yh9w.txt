We so wanted this to be good.  We have been watching since they first opened.  It is the closest Mexican food to our home.  We could walk. We recently visited on a week day evening around 8ish.  The salsa tasted odd, it had a zing, a bite, almost fermenting.  The tortilla that made up the enchilada,  was undercooked,  raw tasting.  The beans and rice were ok I guess.  The portion was not very much.  Needless to say I did not get that hot, cheesy, saucy goodness that you look for with a cheese enchilada.  We had a few drinks before going here, and I was really hungry...you know how you can get after cocktails...this was a huge let down.  Oh ya and I am a 5th generation AZ native.  So I do know a thing or two about Arizona Mexican food.  It wasn't just so so, it was not good at all.
