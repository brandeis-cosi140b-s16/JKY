This place is garbage.. my sister in law had a shrimp cocktail that was not cooked correctly.  And she got food poisoning. .and had to be take to the ER.. They did not take any responsibility to help or call the ambulance and they did not even want to give us water.. that's to show how guilty they are.. the food was garbage. . We paid for the food and we told them and they refused to take the shrimp cocktail off the bill. . Their agua chile was even worse.  Wads just a bunch of lemon with no seasoning. . I'm not posting out of hate,  I've eaten here before but the class and responsibility they showed today showed us how guilty they are...
