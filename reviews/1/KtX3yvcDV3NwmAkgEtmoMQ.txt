The 2 waitresses can't handle any more than 1 table at a time. I waited 15 minutes for a waitress to take my order. I had to ask for silverware and napkins. She never ask how I was doing. I couldn't tell you how long my food was done before it was brought out. Terrible experience. I'll never be back.
