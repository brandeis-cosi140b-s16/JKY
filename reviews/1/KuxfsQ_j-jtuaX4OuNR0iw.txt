Our second time to this restaurant confirmed that we will never be back!

We decided to stop with out of town guests we had just picked up from the airport, as atmosphere was the one memorable thing we liked from our first visit, and always believe everyone deserves a second chance.

Our one guest is a seasoned executive chef from the Caribbean - and you can only imagine our embarrassment by #1 - the totally uncongenial and poor service we received at the bar.  To add insult to injury, we decided to start with a Quesadilla.  Now I'm not certain how you can ruin something as simple as this - but Maria Maria seems to have mastered the art of making what we all decided was the worst any of us had ever had!  As a result, we opted to forgo dinner here, and left - never to return again!

What a shame ... beautiful decor, great lighting, good music - but service and food quality have much to be desired!
