Miguel was the worst waiter.  He stopped by our table only 3 times... drink order, appetizer order and dinner order... then never again, not to check drinks or see if our food was good.  I ordered my meal without tomatoes and it was loaded and I returned it for a new one and still never saw Miguel.  The restaurant never offered a free dessert or anything to apologize for the wrong order.  The food was decent but the service was horrible.
