I'm not really one to complain but I have to say, this place was DISGUSTING!!!! I'm the least pickiest eater, I will eat anything and everything but I couldn't eat my entree which was enchiladas. The sauce was the worst thing I've ever eaten. This place makes Taco Bell look like a 5 star gourmet  restaurant. It's a nice comfy atmosphere and friendly staff the food is just horrible. The chips were even stale. A word of advice, if you want Mexican food this is not the place to get it
