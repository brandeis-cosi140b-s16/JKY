The food was fine but they are a bad business. If you tell them you are using groupon then the prices magically change and they are waiting on the new menus to arrive. I had 3-4 different servers yesterday trying to be overly nice. I have worked in retail for years and no matter what you have to give the customer what they want at the advertised price. So word of advice wait too very end to tell them.
