I went with a friend today. We had our girls and thought we would try a small family place instead of the Subway in the same strip mall. Support local businesses right? Mistake.

Ordered chicken fingers off kids menu for my little ones to split. Eating too much at 3pm spoils dinner. For $5.95 I got two previously frozen processed chicken finger planks and some crinkle cut fries. Pathetic. Buddy ordered a $4.50 bowl of Kraft Mac and cheese for his kid. Absurd. 

I ordered a cheeseburger. Cant possibly go wrong with that right? What I got was a previously frozen pattie of tasteless meat that had two slices of barely melted processed cheese on it. Took three bites and sent it back. Waitress seemed offended personally when I said it tasted like garbage. $9.70 for a garbage cheeseburger. Honestly, a Whopper is a better tasting burger. The lettuce was shredded and browned limp iceburg the bun was soggy, etc etc. It was a train-wreck. 

My friend ordered the chicken fajitas and said they were VERY good. I didn't taste them, but Ill take his word for it. 

Terrible value. 
Service was mediocre. (I watched a blonde haired waitress literally twirling her pony tail while she was talking to a table. You cant make this crap up) 
Their receipts say "Best Mexican food in Anthem." Bullshit. 

Tighten up your act 8 Crazies. Your food is crap. Your prices are ABSURD. Your reviews here should be a wake up call.
