Let me preface this with I am from San Antonio, TX and have been DESPERATE to find decent Mexican food in Las Vegas. I saw the great reviews of this place on Yelp and also the parking lot seemed to be pretty busy (a good sign) so we stopped in. 
We were given chips and salsa to start off with along with a bowl of beans (very very bland). I am a big fan of homemade chips since it's easy and makes all the difference...these were from a bag. 
There were 5 of us so we had a pretty good run of the menu to see if this place was legit. We are also from all different parts of the country so this place was given a fair shot. We ALL thought our food was pretty bad and the service was horrible as well. I had a chicken chimichanga which I didn't eat because it came as beef. When I asked to skip the salsa on top and have them put cheese she said they had to charge me an extra $1...seriously?! Beans and rice had ZERO flavor and even my 4 year old said he didn't like his food. Also I asked for tortillas that NEVER came...we asked three people for the check before finally being able to pay for horrible food...I will not go back which is a shame because I wanted this place to live up to their hype.
