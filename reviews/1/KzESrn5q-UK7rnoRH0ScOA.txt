My Wife and I came here for breakfast on Friday morning. I ordered the chorizo & egg breakfast, and she ordered a chili relleno. I then asked if I could have my eggs over easy. The person taking our order said no, I could only have them scrambled, because that is the way they come. WTH? I can't have my eggs the way I want them? Why not? Are they giving us powdered eggs instead of fresh eggs? If that's the case, I don't want your powdered eggs. My Wife and I walked out, and we went to Del Taco.We will never be back again. We have been going to Ricardo's since it opened, but we do have a choice. Next time we will be going elsewhere. I think Mixteca on 67th & Bell has much better food and prices.
