I go there ATLEAST 2-3x a week! Only because my boyfriend loveeessss their food! But as for me, I will never go there again! Yes the food is great but the server is terrible ! They always charge me different for the same thing I always get ! I'm always getting ripped off & then they give me attitude for trying to explain the price I'm always charged it's ridiculous ! They need to set their staff straight because some of them are a bunch of idiots & probably steal their money since they over charge me! $10 for a $6 burrito? Cmon ! That's like $12 a week I'm getting ripped off from
