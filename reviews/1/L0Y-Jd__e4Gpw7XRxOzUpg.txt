Where to start? Tables were unbussed so we had to sit at a dirty one. Wait staff ignored us for 20 minutes until finally a busser decided that he would acknowledge us after the fifth time he walked past. We wanted to leave but had some other folks coming to meet us so we were pretty much locked in and resigned ourselves to waiting. Finally one of the three waitresses in the bar area took pity on us and got our drink order and appetizer. Drinks took another 10 minutes and then we were ignored again for the rest of the hour that it took us to get our check and get out of this sh*thole. Oh but only I could give half a star. :(
