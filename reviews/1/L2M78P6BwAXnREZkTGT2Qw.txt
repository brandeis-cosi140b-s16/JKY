We ate here about a year ago and it was wonderful.  I went again yesterday, and it was absolutely horrible!  The wait just to order was nearly 10 minutes.  There was just one car ahead of us, and we waited another 15 minutes for our food.  The tortillas used for the fish tacos were cold, and hard, they hadn't been heated.  The rolled tacos were wrapped in a way that all the cheese melted to the paper, and the meat was tasteless.  We won't be back!
