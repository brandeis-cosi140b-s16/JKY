TERRIBLE. Went with my grandparents nice ambiance and not bad staff but my papa order a taco salad that ended up having an inch of water in the bottom "from the lettuce" but the manager made no move to comp the meal. My carne asada was a few millimeters thick (looked like beef jerky) and burnt and tasted like ash even though I ordered medium rare. There was one helpful personal bus girl who talked to us more than our server but definitely won't be coming back
