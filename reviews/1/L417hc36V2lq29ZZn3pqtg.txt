1st time and maybe the last. Wasn't impressed, but mainly due to the cook that was cooking on the 12th of July around 630pm. I ordered a carne asada taco on flour tortilla, 3 rolled tacos, bean burritos and shredded beef tacos. Bean burritos were good, but those are pretty hard to mess up. My carne taco came on corn, even though my receipt clearly said flour. The rolled tacos were soft and soggy in the middle, not crispy like they are supposed to be. Same with the shredded beef tacos, weren't in the fryer long enough. Might have been a new cook that night, but either way my first impression wasn't a good one.
