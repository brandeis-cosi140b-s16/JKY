We just ordered  take out and the food was horrible.   The meat was spoiled and had a nasty taste.  The taco salad was awful as the lettuce looked like it was setting out for awhile.  The quality has gone down hill. I should have went to  taco bell instead.  Adios Garcia's as we are not coming back.
