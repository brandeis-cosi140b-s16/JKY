We arrived at this establishment and waited, and waited and waited. We saw servers stocking the bar, goofing around, chit chatting and we waited. Finally, we asked, and drinks appeared. Then, we waited. We now considered leaving, when our server appeared. Did not even get a greeting. We ordered and waited. Food arrived. bland. We then asked for our bill, and waited. No one said, pay on your way out. The staff was still chit chatting.
I commented that the service wasn't very good as we were paying 37.00 for two chimi's and two cokes, and the cashier, responded with, " do you want a tip on the card?" Pardon? I believe I had just said, the service wasn't good and they are asking for a tip as a response? 
Crazy. 
So many other choices when in Wickenburg, I suggest you try them.
