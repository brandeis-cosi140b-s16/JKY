It sad the food is really good, customer service is terrible. And make sure you check your bags if you order to go. Every time I have ordered from here they are always leaving out an item or two. You never really know what you are paying for because they don't give a receipt either. The food is good, but the service is so bad I will not be going back after the 6th time of not getting all my food and having to drive all the way back I give up on this place.
