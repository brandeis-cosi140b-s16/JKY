Food was okay. Service however was horrible. We waited 20 minutes to get our drinks and then they brought out our food and they didn't give us any silverware or napkins. Their "ensalada rusa" was so disgusting. The service here was the worst. NEVER COMING BACK AND NOT RECOMMENDING THIS PLACE TO ANYONE
