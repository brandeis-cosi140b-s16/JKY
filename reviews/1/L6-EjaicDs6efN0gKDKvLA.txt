What a horrible experience eating at this so called"restaurant" obviouslynobody here cares about their job or take pride in their work. There used to be a cute blonde girl that worked here who rocked at everything now theresjust a bunch of sad looking people with zero customer service skills. The food is no reason to come deal with bad customer service. I dont recommend this place to anyone. Avoid all americas taco shops at all cost!
