Bad customer service, bad hygeine, ignorant of their own menu.

Let me start with hygeine. The guys working the line look grungie. One had cut his thumb and the bandage looked pretty old.

I asked for a burrito and was excited about the fresh tortilla but the guy made it way too big and too fast on the press. It came out crispy, there was no one behind me so no rush.

I got the burrito filled then it came to salsa. I wanted the hottest salsa and I love Tomatillos so I asked for the Tomatillo Hot Salsa. Bandage guy said they dont serve it to which I said, "it's on your menu." He thought i was saying Tapatio then he thought I said "Tomate" which is in all of their salsas *forehead slap*. I pull up tomatillo on my phone and show it to him and he pointed to the red one. Obviously not right. 

He then told me to calm down, i was calm but the noise level is high in there so i had to talk louder. He then explained to me that i am in a different state and was talking over me from that point on. 

Anyways this place sucked, the burrito was small and crispy and these guys have no idea what Mexican food is.
