Today, I go for a burrito. I was told that the chicken would be done in 10-15mins. The NEW cashier attempted to force me to get another meat. I kindly informed him that I dont eat beef or pork. So I waited 30mins, just for the NEW cashier to tell me that there isn't any chicken. Mind you, it's 1pm. Not only that, SEVERAL people ordered AFTER me and where given chicken within a couple of minutes. Also, the cook brought in at least 15 freshly cooked whole chickens from outside as I waited.. So once again, the NEW cashier attempts to make me take another type of meat. I refused once again and nicely asked for a refund. He walks away tallying to other workers as I wait to be reimbursed. Another 10 mins goes by as I wait for my damn money. By far the worst experience I've ever had there. 

There was one instance where I ordered chicken (instead of asada) fries and the cashier handed me a half portion container. I order these fries at least twice a week and this guy swears they've always been this size. My buddy went 3 days ago and got the original larger portion with no issue. I was skeptical after that visit but gave them the benefit of the doubt. After today's visit I will no longer go back. Great food doesn't make up for s****y service. It's truly getting worse.
