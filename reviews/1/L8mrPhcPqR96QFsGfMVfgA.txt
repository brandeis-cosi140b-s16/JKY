I've never yelped before and decided with the latest experience I had at Wahoos I had too!!  My good friends LOVE this place and RAVE about everything about Wahoos (they are from Cali).  My friend and I went in the other night to feed our kids and have a cocktail close to home.  Since we had our kids we decided to do them a favor and sit on the patio so we wouldn't disturb the customers inside (keep in mind it was 100 degrees outside too).  The kids had to go to the bathroom once or twice, refill there drinks, they got our order wrong, etc.  All of these required us to go back inside.  We got a very bad attitude from the young hostess and dirty looks, she even TOLD one of my kids to keep the door closed.  Its not our fault when you open your door its stays open.  She could have easily came and closed it or asked in a different way. Seriously the attitude was horrible and then the food came and it was just as bad..  I will say this though, the cheese nachos were good :).  Anyway, I will never return back to this restaurant and don't appreciate the treatment we got, if you have kids and want good food don't waste your time or money going to Wahoos on Horizon!
