I was there on a Friday night with my Fiance and my family. It was "THE WORSE" customer service ive ever had! We waited about an hour to get our food which I would understand if it was busy, But was not! 
My sister had ordered a simple order "shrimp tacos" and they could not get the order correct. It took about an EXTRA 45 minutes to recieve her food. besdes the hour we waited for the rest of the family. A total of an hour and 45 minutes!
I had ordered a chicken chimichanga with NO SAUCE and no GUACAMOLE and NO SOUR CREAM. Of course the order was incorrect. 
Which she took it back and had it redone but at the end of the night when was time to pay the check I was getting charged for the chimi that was incorrect! I did not eat or touch it. Was very rude about the whole situation.
I had gone there many times before and this was the first time ive had a problem and not only one problem many problems!

I will never go back!
