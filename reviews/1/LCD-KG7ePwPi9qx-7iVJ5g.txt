I have been coming to this restaurant for 4 years, it was senior miguels and then was taken over by the casino.  Ever since the casino took over the food has continued to go down in quality.  They removed the margarita and taco special which was really good.  You used to wait to be seated....now its 50% empty.    Now they have a taco and enchilada buffet that is absoulutely horrible.  They dont even give you a plate to use!!!!   They make you use the appetizer plate on the table.  Food is cold and doughy...I mean really.  Dont bother to waste your time coming to this restaurant unless your already in the hotel, their are many better mexican restaurants all over the place.   Oh and by the way, the servers are rude and not knowledgeable about the menu, I mean just an overall bad place.
