The saying "wash your veggies before you eat them" takes on a whole new meaning for me today.  The lettuce in my taco tasted like dish water! The taste was an instant turn off. 
I no longer go in to eat as the overwhelming smell of bad meat hits you as you walk in the door!  
The beans on the nachos reminds me of mud and tastes about the same. 
Truly a fast food place with increasingly nasty food every time I go.
