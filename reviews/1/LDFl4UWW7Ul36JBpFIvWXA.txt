The service is horrible and the food is at best mediocre. If you really want Mexican go to the Salsaritas in the food court right next to it because it's better. I fly through Charlotte a lot and it's always the same - poor food, poor service. Today I tried to eat there on my layover and even though many people were trying to get in they closed. Really? I can deal with the mediocre food, but upgrade the experience.
