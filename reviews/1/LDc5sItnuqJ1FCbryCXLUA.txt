Filberto's #10, near Dobson and  Elliot,

I ordered a Beef Burrito and when I got home and took a bite out of it, it turned out to be a Bean Burrito. I ate it anyway, because I didn't feel like driving all the way back to complain. The other part I want to complain about is their website, which has a page for complaining, but is designed in such a way as to make it impossible to actually send the complaint to the company. One of the required fields you have to fill in is the 'Date' in order to send the complaint. But no matter how you enter the date it comes back with "Date format seems invalid". This effectively makes it impossible to send a complaint. Now I'm actually pissed off enough to actually start a Yelp account.
