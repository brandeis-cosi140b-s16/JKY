Service was a bit slow and confused.  Asked for guacamole twice and was told it was inside the burrito (it was not).  When I asked for pico de gallo, the gal ended up giving me a bunch of diced tomatoes.  The steak was not seasoned and the burrito overall had little flavor, if any.  I decided to try this place because I wanted to do something a little nice than Roberto's or Taco Bell.  Should have picked another place.
