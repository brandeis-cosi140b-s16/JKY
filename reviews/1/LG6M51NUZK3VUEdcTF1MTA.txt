Well, let me tell you what!!!  Tonight the wife and myself went to ol Taco Bell.   The date is: 10-3-13.  Time stamp on receipt is 7:52pm.  ( we went inside because there was 9 cars....yes, 9 cars in the drive thru. )  We walked out with our food and get this.....drumroll.....8:21pm and a " sorry for the wait " for  us and the other patrons that had the same idea to come in. One person ordered just (1) five layer burrito and it took almost as long as we were standing there.  I could understand if a basketball team or baseball or large party ordered but, come on. Almost, well, 30 minutes to get fast food????  WTF???!!!   There was a total of 9 employees working well, some, behind the counter. Two in drive thru 1 working register and others trying to work the food station. You would think with that many people you could get everybody in and out in a timely manner!!  NO, not here.  Just like every other fast food joint they ALL CATER TO THE DRIVE THRU.  But, if you have 9 employees why not have half work drive thru and other half work the people that come inside ?? I'm just saying.  In my opinion, I'd be looking at the management.  That is the person running the show!!  If you can't manage a restaurant, then YOU shouldn't be working there!! I'd suggest going down the road about a mile and go to Del Taco. At least they know how to get the job done!!!
