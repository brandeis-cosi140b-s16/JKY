Wow.  I have never seen a bowl of chips and salsa I didn't love (and inhale) but I have seen it now.  I like to think of myself as an burrito joint expert and Qdoba lacked flavor and taste.  It just tasted bland.  The rice was bland, the meat was bland, and the grilled veggies were bland.  The chips tasted bland and just weren't good.  It was a sad day when I had to dispose of the chips because they sucked so much.  Overall the experience sucked.
