I have to say I love cafe rio! Their food is simple yet delicious, the service is great as well as consistent, and my appetite and tummy are always satisfied. However I've been to this location 3 different times and have not experienced any of these.. Even though it may be convenient for many of us here in henderson, please listen to the other reviews and DO NOT EAT AT THIS LOCATION ! New management is highly needed
