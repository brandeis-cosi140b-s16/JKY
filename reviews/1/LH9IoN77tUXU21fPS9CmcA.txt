With one hell-of-a-layover, and starving I decided to stop at the Blue Burrito Grille in the Phoenix International Airport. I had many, many choices but this restaurant's friendly and warm ambience lured me in. I sat down to a semi-cleaned table that I had to wipe clean myself. Ok. Bad. But not that bad. I was quickly greeted and offered a drink. Looking over the menu my stomach told me to go with the chicken burrito. I hadn't had mexican food for quite some time, and the restaurant was bragging that they were known for their burritos so, bonus! Bring it on. The menu read that it came with all the ingredients that you would expect from a super burrito. It was delivered fairy quickly and cut in half, which I normally do not prefer. Come on now, I'm a big boy now, I don't someone cutting my food into smaller pieces anymore. At first glance it looked pretty tasty, and then I took a bite. Disappointment set in and if it wasn't for my gross need for nourishment at that point I would sent it back and left. This large burrito had no flavor what-so-ever, except for the taste of leftover chicken that has been reheated. There was absolutely no seasoning, and one third of the burrito was shredded lettuce. Adding the accompanying hot sauce did no good either. I don't know what to say. I had another bad airport food experience, again, on this trip. And, apparently, the people who were sitting two tables away were having their own bad experience as well, so bad, that they got up and left. In the end, SEASON YOUR MEAT! YOUR FOOD! Ambience is nice but food, especially mexican, usually has great flavor, so give it to us. Now that I am home I will be visiting my favorite taco truck in Oakland where I can get a real, authentic, great tasting burrito.
