To say it best. Find a different restaurant. My self and 2 associates ordered the Fajiitas. 
The meat had no taste. The flour tortilla's were crispy hard. I could go on with the other food, but I won't bore you. 

The service ,the waitress, English was very limited. We asked specifically if the rice was prepared with chicken broth. Our associate is a vegetarian. The waitress answered twice, no it is not made with chicken broth. My associate did not believe her and went and asked the cook. It was made with chicken broth.  Later She dropped a plate of rice and beans and did not return to clean it up. We cleaned it up. 
We paid the bill. She walked the tip back to us and proceeded to count  back to the bill payer?? No manager on duty. Adios.
