GROSS! After seeing an employee use the restroom without washing his hands, I'm definitely giving this a 1 star (if only I could give a 0) 

I wasn't to pleased with my order (carne asada torta). The meat tasted like plastic... The bread was good, which is nice... They gave me six chips total with my torta. For $7.61 I guess it wasn't a total loss

Not coming back.
