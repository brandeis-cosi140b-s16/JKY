So much grease! Also definitely not enough meat to justify an $8.50 price tag. The guacamole could have been from the packages at safe way, not good. Tortilla was good. What wasn't great was biting into what seemed to be cabbage??? Pretty sure it was old gross wilted lettuce. Not in the description for the pork a dilla. The sour cream was inside the quesadilla so it basically curdled while it cooked. It ended up looking like a white gooey powder on my food.
