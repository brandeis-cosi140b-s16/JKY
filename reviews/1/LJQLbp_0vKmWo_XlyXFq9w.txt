Fuck YOU Dick's Hideaway, I'm done with your "we seat according to our attitude" policy. I walked in by myself on this beautiful Saturday looking for a late lunch and the bar was full. So I ask one of the waitstaff where can I sit. The two four tops are wide open and so is the deuce that faces the wall. I asked him if I could sit at the 4 since it was way past lunch and not likely to get busy again until the dinner rush. He said "wherever you like". So I sit down and the next member of the waitstaff comes over and asks "how many in your party"?  I said it was only me. She said "we only allow 2-4 to sit at these tables". Good by Dick's!  You're completely HIDDEN from my future dining plans. I told the server I didn't want to stay and thanks for making me feel so welcome!
