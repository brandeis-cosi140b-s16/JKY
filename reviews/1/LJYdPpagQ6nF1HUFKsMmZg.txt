This was the most unorganized, hectic, and ridiculous experience I've ever had at a Rubio's, or at any eatery for that matter. I was picking up a catering order, which should have been ready at 11:30...With all of the confusion between the staff & the kitchen, in regards to multiple orders; it was obvious by noon that my order had not even been made yet. One of the employees was literally running back and forth, frantically delivering food to people's tables inside the restaurant. Meanwhile, a line of people piled out the door about 20 deep. The ice machine was out of ice for a good 15 minutes while I was waiting there for my order. This place was a mess. No system, no organization, and no communication between the staff in the front and the kitchen. I finally got my order, 50 minutes after it should have been ready. It's safe to say that I will never go back to this Rubio's & my office will most definitely not be making a huge catering order from them again, because they couldn't even get it right. With missing items, wrong items, and poorly put together burritos, let's just say it was a bad day for this poorly run Rubio's.
