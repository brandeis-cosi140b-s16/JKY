The food was good but the server forgot to put in our order and we waited 60 minutes.  She was slow to refill our drinks and when you conside there were four of us dining, it's hard to imagine all beverage glasses, inlcuding water being empty.  The server blamed the mistake on the kitchen but when we looked over the receipt, we noticed it was her mistake.  We were comped a desert and a modest discount on the meal, not impressed!  I will never go back to Barrio Cantina again, the service at a neighboring restaurant, La Parilla, is hands down far superior.  In my opinion, Barrio should consider a new management team. Our kids observed poor behavior from some of the staff, totally unprofessional and something that should not be tolerated in any business.  Once again, fire this staff and start from scratch.
