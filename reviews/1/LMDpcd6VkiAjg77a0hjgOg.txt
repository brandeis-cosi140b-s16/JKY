There were maybe four tables seated which all had food already when we got there. There were roughly 8 waiters wandering around not really doing anything obvious. Got my drink ten minutes after I was seated. After twenty more minutes of waiting my boyfriend had to physically stand in front of a waiter to get a check because no one would take our order. That's not acceptable for a not even busy restaurant. The plates of food were small for what they charged. We occasionally got to watch food wander past our table while we waited.
