The worse restaurant I have ever been too. Horrible food, worse customer service ever. Tony and the owner (tall guy with glasses) have no idea how to run a business. Ever heard of the customer is always right? So rude to their employees!!!! And to top is all off it has the worse "bathroom" smell!! I would never recommend this place to anyone!!
