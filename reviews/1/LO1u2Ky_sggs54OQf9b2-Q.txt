My lunch of chimi came out cold. The bar tender was great and ordered it again. The he gave me a free drink.  I was there over an hot and my second lunch of chimi came out and it was colder than the first. The bar tender did not want to charge me for anything and did an amazing job.
I made him charge me for something so I could tip him as I did not have cash. 
This was by far the best bar tender, worst food experience of my life.

I hope the bar tender working on September 20th at 3 pm finds a new job. And I hope the delta terminal gets and new restaurant!

This place was a disgrace!
