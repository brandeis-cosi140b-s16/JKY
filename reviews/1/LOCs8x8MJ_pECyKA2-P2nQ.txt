Apparently Angie controls the closing time. I know now that the sign says 1:00 am. She actually means 12:40. What makes it worse is that I called to ask if they we're still open at 12:40. The reply I received was "my office computer says 1:02, we can't serve you." I wasn't looking for a big order. And no assistance! This place is garbage!!!
