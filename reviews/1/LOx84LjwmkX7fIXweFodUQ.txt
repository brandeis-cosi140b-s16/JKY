I love Chipotle and I frequent the restaurants. This particular location is the closest to my job so I can go on lunch, however it is also the worst location I've ever been to. Many of my friends have started driving to the further locations just because the service is terrible. 75% of the time I go, the meat is not ready and they tell me it'll be a 10 minute wait most of the time. Today, I spent 30 minutes in the location - that is far from "fast" food. They never apologize like most companies do if there is a wait and they tend to get frustrated with the customer over the situation. The location near the Target shopping center is a much better location, but it's also further. I wish that this location had the management and customer service that most other Chipotles have in the area. A simple "I apologize for the wait" would do wonders. Other locations often offer a free drink to people that are waiting and while I don't even find that necessary, it is very nice and makes the wait less frustrating when they are friendly about it. People may suggest to order ahead to avoid the issue and I did that for a long time, but every single time I would arrive at pick up time and they would tell me it's going to be a minute, which actually turns into 10-20 minutes. Just a very frustrating location.
