Another Pile on... 

When the grand opening happened I was so thrilled.. Just 1.5 miles from us and we love Cafe Rio.  First visit great ! But opening week always is at a place, they blow payroll and want to make a good impression.  

2nd visit so so.. The mint drink I love was empty.  My luck 

3rd visit we ordered to pick up.  They didn't bother to make it until we arrived at the pick up time .  I am patient it happens... They were out of our favorite - the queso 

4th visit - online order again - We arrive and the store is filthy.  Out of ice , drink machines empty and gross.  Order not started again.  Waited 20 min.  Out of Queso again 

5th and last visit.   My daughter is a vegetarian and went with us hoping to get something tasty.  They were annoyed at her questions to ensure she was ordering to her preferences.  We waited 40 min .  Drink machines empty and gross AGAIN.  Out of Queso.  I ask why every time we come they are always out.  The annoyed answer was they use it to make salsa.  WTF ? 

We'll drive to the Stephanie store From now on.  It's crazy busy there but always good, reasonably fast, always clean and always has QUESO.
