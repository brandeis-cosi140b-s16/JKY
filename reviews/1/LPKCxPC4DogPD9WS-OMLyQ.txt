Came back after the strip to eat at our hotel and I my husband and I wanted Mexican food. Service is awful. The waitress could careless about guest unless your a single guy or guys. I ordered a torta and she said it came with rice and beans and it did not. Not to mention it tasted awful I couldn't even eat it. Ten bucks of nothing. Than you order chips salsa and gauc for nine bucks ya not worth it. My husbands buger was fine but he was so upset I was unhappy he didn't want to eat. Over all wouldnt recommend unless you like bad service or hey if your a single man who wants a fourty your old woman to give you a lot of attention.
