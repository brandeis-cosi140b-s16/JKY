I love Chipotle, but every time I eat at this location, I swear I'll never be back. The employees are so inattentive and sloppy. 

Today, I showed up right at opening time and they were scrambling around trying to finish things that should've been ready before opening. They didn't have brown rice. The employee said it would be 20 minutes until they had it. What the F is that?!  It's not like they ran out. The had just opened. That's just poor preparation, which isn't surprising based on my previous experiences at this location. 

From now on I'll just drive a little further and eat at the Chipotle in San Tan Village.
