If I have to give it a star it is only because of their busty waitresses. 

This is a miserable place, serving miserable food, with miserably loud music blaring at all hours of the day.

If you can imagine, it's a restaurant in Scottsdale trying to reproduce the worst aspects of places like Cancun. Got it?
