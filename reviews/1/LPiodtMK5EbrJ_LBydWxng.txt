A disappointment!  For me, it's not even about the argument for "authentic" Mexican food or whatever:  this restaurant offers poor service, a number of cold and oily dishes at an unreasonable price, and watery drinks (a waste if the restaurant is framed around this fancy tequila library they're so proud of).

I was in a medium-sized party seeking to get some drinks; we were a maybe on food, none of us had planned to eat full meals.  When we asked for a table, we were told that tables had to be saved for customers eating dinner.  OK -- totally fair when you're slammed with reservations and have a line out the door -- but this was a SUNDAY evening before the dinner rush, and the place wasn't even half full.  We really had to insist before the manager(?) signaled to the hostess that we could be seated.

So we get to looking at the menus and things look interesting, despite the high prices; we end up ordering food after all.  I decide on the special tacos -- gross!  Another commenter mentioned pork tacos filled with big chunks of awful overcooked rubberized things -- that was exactly what I was served.  These chewy pork nuggets were piled on top of what I was told were going to be "crispy" taco shells -- in actuality, oil-soaked corn tortillas -- and topped with some weird applesauce-like chutney that was so sickly-sweet I couldn't bear it.  On top of all of that, my dish was barely warm.  No wait, on top of all that, my dish was $14!  You can get good, juicy, spicy, hot pork tacos in town for three bucks.

Paired with a measly 5-oz cocktail that cost $10 and had a giant thumb-shaped lemon zest garnish in it?  A total scam.  If a cocktail costs $10, you invest a little time in the garnishes, the temperature of the glass, other little details.

All the mentions of slow service in other reviews are true.  Like another commenter, we sat around with our plates all sad and dirty for 20 minutes before our table was cleared.

Just gross.  A yuppie scam.
