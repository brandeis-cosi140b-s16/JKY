POOR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! customer service!!!!!!!!! I went there to pick up food and made a comment about the price of a drink and was told I didn't have to come back, asked for manager and he stood behind his employee with no apologies...I'm done and will spread this horrible experience to everyone who will listen.  The food maybe good but I can go eleswhere for good Mexican food and be treated better.
