I've seen this place from the bus and now the light rail when coming into work for a while now.  Friday, I got stuck working very late, and my boss took me to dinner when we were done with our project as a thank you.

She wanted something mexican, and close to the office.  She said that she loved this place, so she took me here.  Walking in, I liked the decore of this place.  Authentic looking, and seemed cute!  Thats where the niceities stop.

We walked in and were seated.  The service was absolutely HORRIFIC.  I was blatently ignored, but my boss was waited on as if she were the queen.  I have a theory about why, but I dare not write it down here, for fear of backlash.  I had to scream at the server halfway across the resturant when he refused to take my drink order.  I was astounded!  When he took my order, it was as if he were doing me a favor...horrible.

Food was HOT.  So spicy that I was unable to eat it.  Why cant they state that in thier menu?  My  boss thought it was hysterical because I turned 7 shades of red from the spicy-ness.  lol.  Anyways, the next day the food was better from my fridge, I just wasn't expecting a mouth full of spicy hot food.  lol.

Anyways, I will not be returning to this craptastic shithole.  Never again.  Service was aweful, and the food was just WAY to spicy for me.  I can get Mexican food just as decent with substantially better service at a spice level I can handle at about a zillion different places in this town.

Stay away from this place! Its horrible!
