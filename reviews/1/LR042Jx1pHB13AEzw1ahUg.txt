The food is simply horrible. It lacks flavor, probably due to the lack of it being fresh and seasoned properly. If you want a fried item then it is the same as any other fried food at any other place. The service is ok, nothing special. It is always busy whenever we drive by and it is a mystery. If you want fresh, perfectly seasoned and cooked food I would suggest chipotle.
