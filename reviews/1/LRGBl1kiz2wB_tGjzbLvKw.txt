If you want authentic Mexican food, stay clear of this place. I got the most basic dish. It was a combination 2 taco shredded chicken plate, crunchy. They brought me chips and salsa on the house. They do have really good chips and salsa. My order came after 3 mins of ordering. Suler fast. I swear they use the crunchy tacos from a box.not authentic or tasty. The shredded chicken was lukewarm and had no flavor made my stomach feel queezy. The beans were ok and the rice was flavorless. The service was not so great. I would rather eat the Mexican food at Macs Speed shop rather than come back to this place.
