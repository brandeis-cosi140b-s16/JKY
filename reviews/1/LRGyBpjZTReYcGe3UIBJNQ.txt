Stopped in on a Thursday afternoon.  Ordered a Texas Style CHIMI (I assume everyone knows they are deep fried).  They do not warm their metal plates (Strike One).  My Chimi was not deep fried which made it a regular burrito (Strike Two), the toppings were tepid which probably from the unheated metal plate.  They sent it back and remade it, now the Chimi was correctly made but the beans and rice were cold because they were plated on the unheated metal plated while the Chimi was cooking (Strike Three).   For a first time visit , I'm sorry but that don't cut it.  Good thing its not a pay before you eat place.  Its not really worth a star at all.
