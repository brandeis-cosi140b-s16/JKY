I gave it one star because its only saving grace is that the kitchen is open late...and it serves Pepsi.

I ordered (so typical of me) their supersomethinggooey chimichanga. You may as well have brought me a pile of flaming poo. It looked so unappetizing when it was plunked down in front of me. You know when you were a kid and you were forced to eat something you hated and you did all you could to prolong the agony? Well, there were no potted plants within range for me to dump my food in and the napkins were so flimsy I couldn't spit my bites out gracefully. Instead, I pushed away the food and claimed, "I savored every bite and now I'm full.  I'll take it home." My friend loves that place. Why? I can't understand it, either. I dumped the leftovers off in the trash at the Taco Bell I ended up at.

Service was crap, food was crap, parking was crap. It's located around the corner from my husband's old office...but hell, if the die hard alkies of my husband's office wouldn't go there, that's saying something. Geez, it's stumbling or in their case, tumbling, distance from work. Even happy hour couldn't persuade the guys to go.  Yes, it's that bad. You know it's bad when the alcoholics say no.

Thank god it's all you can drink Pepsi or I wouldn't know what to do with myself. *rolls eyes* I know what I'd do - I'd go to Jack in the Box across the street and bring it over because JITB is better than whatever Dos Gringos could ever try to feed me.

PS -- What's up with those park benches for tables?
