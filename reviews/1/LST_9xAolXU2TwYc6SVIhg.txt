Although I love the food, my current experience (and not the only one), have been extremely terrible. My boyfriend and I went to this location on Taco Tuesday, and we weren't informed which tacos qualified, so after paying, my boyfriend realized he didn't choose the appropriate kind. He kindly asked if he could change it, and the cashier, obviously annoyed, refunded the difference. Feeling bothersome, we were trying to be extra courteous at that point. We received soft tacos (after asking for hard shell), didn't receive the side of rice we paid for, and the other two tacos were drenched in what seemed to be water. It was disgusting. So I approached her and asked if we could just have a complete refund. She rolled her eyes and said "Why?". I explained to her why we wanted a refund and she performed it, but she threw our change on the counter, muttered something in Spanish, and walked to the back. I asked her to come back and she did not. The other two employees did not know any English whatsoever. We stood there waiting for her to return because I was furious. She never did. I was unable to find out this cashiers name (no nametag?) but she was a Hispanic girl with a lip piercing (super professional by the way). I will never return to this location and neither will my boyfriend or the other friends I've informed. I strongly suggest the manager considers a new staff, or at least a new cashier. Horrible.
