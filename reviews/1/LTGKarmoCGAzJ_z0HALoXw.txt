Horrible! 
Service was way slow, waitress was I in another world, tells in salsa and drinks took forever. 
I order the fish tacos, asked for sour cream instead of the spicy sauce they use. First off, there was so much sour cream, the disk was literally swimming in it. The amount of fish was ridiculous for the price of the meal ($11), I wish I had taken a photo of it.  It wasn't seasoned and had no taste. 
Oh, and the ice tea was nasty.

Manager gave us a free appetizer for our next visit but we went be back.
