Let me say first, I've been going here for years, they have great food and I've always tipped. I'm never going there again because they've started trying to rip me off the last 2 times I've gone there. I got 3 bean & cheese burritos, I wanted rice so he runs my card and I was like, wait what was the total? He said he charged me $3 for extra rice, to put a spoonful in each burrito. The menu says $2 for a 1/2 pint! He said don't order it with rice next time! I just went there again and he charged me $2 extra for the cheese that has always come with the bean & cheese burrito! He said he'd take $1 off, I told him to give me all of my money back, I drove down the street and realized he'd shorted me, for principle I went back and demanded it all, man I haven't been that livid in a long time. Watch these guys, they're trying to rip people off!
