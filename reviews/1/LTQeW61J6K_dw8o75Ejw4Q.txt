Got dinner from #elpoloLoco last night... told them no beans (even in the salad). Ordered a quesadilla with chicken as well... the results: 12 pieces of burnt chicken, salad had beans in it, lettuce in salad wilted, avacado in salad was old, no salad dressing, quesadilla did not have chicken in it, then... to top it all off... there was a hair in the salad! Called the store, no answer. Called the survey hotline and spoke to a live person. Ugh.. not eating there any more!
