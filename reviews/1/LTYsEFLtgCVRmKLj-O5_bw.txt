If I could give zero stars I would. I figured since the last time it was decent food I would go again.  I ordered the mini chimis for an appetizer and it was the saddest plate I have ever seen. I have attached a picture of the chimis.  My husband got the enchiladas with red sauce and it was the most foul tasting red sauce.  The sauce was over salty and had a strange taste to it.  The rice was also terrible. The only redeeming quality of this place is the salsa and the friendly wait staff.
