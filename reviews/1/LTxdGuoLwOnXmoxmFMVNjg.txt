Horrible food and service in outdoor patio! Really weird because we were here a couple years ago. Back then the food was better. Now you get tasteless tacos with canned beans and premade rice, gross! I've had better food at cafeterias! Took me 10 minutes to get my waiters attention just to try to get some hot sauce! Will never return here in Las Vegas again! HORRIBLE!
