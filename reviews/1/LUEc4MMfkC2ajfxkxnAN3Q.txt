I reviewed this place once before and now editing it! I thought it was great! However, my husband and I went here for dinner tonight and only one word describes it.. Awful!! I had the shredded beef tacos. No flavor, very dry and tasted old. My husband had a chicken burrito and had two bites and couldn't eat it. He said the same thing, tasted old. My friends have gone there and said it was awful and I always defended Senor Taco and said maybe it was just an off day there. Well, now I have to agree. What really sucks is that I follow a low carb diet and have a cheat day every couple of week and I ruined my cheat meal here! I don't think that I will be back.
