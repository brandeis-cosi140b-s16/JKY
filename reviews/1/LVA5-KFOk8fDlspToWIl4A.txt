After suffering the mediocrity of Agave, the terse life of Dos Caminos, and the overly authentic Toros, I was super excited to dine here.

Unfortunately I won't get the chance Due to a 'private event' booking the whole restaurant on a Tuesday after work. Nothing like spending millions on renovations and not letting locals access it. 

Thanks Mercadito, we're off to a great start.
