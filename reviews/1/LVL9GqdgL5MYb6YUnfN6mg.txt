This place sucks. I'd expect a new resteraunt/bar in the Summerlin area to want to make a good impression. This sadly was not the case. The place was not busy by anyone's terms.  Sat down with my family and waited 15 minutes before we got even a nod. Eventually we got a waiter and they took our order. It had been an hour of sitting at our table  and we did not even receive drinks from the bar. We had to call it quits and left without any food or drinks. The staff didn't even notice our departure. We let the hostess know our disappointment and she apologized with little shock or interest.  
And, I'm certain it'll go out of business without my shock or interest. NEXT PLEASE!!
