The first time we went there the food and menu was excellent. Took friends there last night and the food was horrible. I sent mine back it was so bad. Prices are very high, menu limited. Prices on the menu are lower then what they bill you. Restaurant must of changed hands as the difference was dramatic. They served the salsa in a styrofoam cup. Will not go back ever!!!
