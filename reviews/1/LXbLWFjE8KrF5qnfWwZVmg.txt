We love this place but today we had the worst service. Sitting on the patio apparently is the worst place to sit. Took 20mins to bring us drinks, 1hr to take our order, almost 40mins to get our food and took us 30mins to flag our server down to pay the check. To pay it!!! We could have easily walked out without paying and our server would have still been ignoring us/ not noticing we were gone. Besides that our server did not write down our orders and brought the pickiest member of our party a messed up order. On top of that tried to charge us for add ons that were clearly stated not wanted. We will go back but make sure its when the good servers are working and in the bar where you aren't forgotten.
