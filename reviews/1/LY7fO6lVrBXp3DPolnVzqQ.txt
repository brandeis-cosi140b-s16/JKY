Ok this may sound like a rambling but here we go
We just arrived home from the beach and needed to go to the grocery store
Instead as I was going thru the mail I read the article about giving La Fiesta Grande a second chance. We pull in and notice how nice it is on the patio. We sit down and enjoy our chips and salsa. As soon as our food is delivered it is like attack of the flies. Bees start swarming us. The waiter apologizes blaming the BP. We eat in a hurry while the busboy swats flies with a fly swatter. The waiter asks if we need to go boxes and I said no thank you, there were many flies on the food. Next thing I know, two managers come up to me and ask me whAt is wrong. I mention that I did not want to go boxes and they respond that we could of eaten inside awY from the flies. Next thing I know the managers friends  who are sitting behind me tell me I should have eaten inside that I am obviously not an outdoor person. The discussion continues and I end up in tears while wearing my be positive hat!!! Anyway I am posting to let you know that I do not recommend the Mexican restaurant next to the BP at Mountain Island. Please share with Mtn island neighbors. I really would not grant this any stars but with yelp you have to at least give one.
