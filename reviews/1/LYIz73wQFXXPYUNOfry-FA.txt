I was excited about trying a new place after a night out in Scottsdale. The menu was short and easy, which can be helpful if you are the DD of the group. However the portions per price was high.
The waitress was semi patient with us.
It took a while for the appetizer to come, which we didn't even get until the entree was served. 
When the check came I paid in cash due to a recent problem with my credit card and waited for my change...for 20 minutes.
I feel that the waitress tried to take advantage of the group due to their intoxication.
In the end I went to up to find her and ask for the change, which she had to search for to find.
I found it upsetting that she tried to take  advantage of intoxicated customers and I wondered if that happend often after the clubs close at this place.
