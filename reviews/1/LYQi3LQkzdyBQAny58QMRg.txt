A few minutes after our family's food was ready, we realized our toddler's chicken nuggets order was not served. Turns out they hadn't even started to make it. When we finally received it, it was raw in the center! I showed the cashier the raw chicken and she gave me a refund (she gave no apology and seemed not to care). Also, one of the salsas at the salsa bar was spoiled.
