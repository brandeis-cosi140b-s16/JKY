Seriously the lady bartender who worked  Friday 1 am aug 23 the last shift should not be working there , I was taking pictures of the bar and the asses on the seats and all the fun stuff having a good time, until she slapped my phone out my hand and said stop taking pictures! Where does it say not to take pictures ??  And the manager was not found ?? Stay away from this place and if you don't believe me take pictures at the bar and see what happens not a friendly place  , the people hate working there and are not nice to tourists.
