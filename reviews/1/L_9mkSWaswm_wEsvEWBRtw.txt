Service was so bad took forever to get order one employee screamed I FUC*** UP that's my bad with kids in the place the food was not that greats for the price I expected better food the rice was warned up in a microwave not too fresh I will say the Andes mint they gave me was good but waiting 18 min for 2 taco and rice with no one else waiting for food is very unexceptional also some guy took out garbage then gave a guy his food never washed hands I noticed it
