I ate at The Cantina Mexican Restaurant located inside the Tuscany Hotel recently and I have to say it was a terrible dining experience.  We ordered a enchilada and a chicken fajita.  The enchilada was the seafood one and it tasted a little off, fishy not at all fresh.  The worst was yet to come, the chicken fajita looked OK although they only gave us 2 tortilla shells for the whole dish!!!! Are they kidding, I asked for an additional package and they said there would be a charge !!!  The chicken they use for the fajita supposedly chicken breast was all gnarled and odd shaped and there was grizzle and fat in the pieces.  I cut  a few pieces to look at the chicken and was surprised that I was looking at clumps of fat.  Imagine if I  had bitten into the tortilla with the onions and peppers and chicken and sour cream and started to chew how I would have felt when I bit on those pieces of fat!!!  I called the waitress over and gave her back the chicken and asked for chicken that I could eat without fat and she brought back some more the chef had cooked and it was the same.I asked for the manager  who was of no help.  He said there wasn't any fat in their chicken breast and I was telling him there most certainly was.  So a word to the wise, do not spend your money at this restaurant because they think their food is terrific and if you have a problem you are stuck with it.  In this restaurant the customer is always wrong.  Don't waste your time or money here it just isn't worth it.
