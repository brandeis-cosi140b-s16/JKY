Well, its off course overpriced cause it's in a hotel/casino in Vegas. The food it's OK, good flavor. But I still don't understand why waitress here treat people like ish! I get its Vegas, drunk people all the time, crazy customers, etc. but if we are in work clothes, with our badges and laptops..... Can you please at least treat us with the respect that is needed as professionals??? 
I hate to give 1 -star reviews but this time I pretty much had to follow my gut and do it. 
Don't think I'll come back here.
