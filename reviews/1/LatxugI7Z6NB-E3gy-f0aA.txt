Service here is awful!! Tonight I went in and they were totally or of chicken and would not be making more even though they would still be open for another hour and a half. Then I waited for over 10 min to be checked out because A staff member was on a personal phone call at the phone across from the register and would not help me or check me out. My receipt says her name was Alejandrin and when she finally came to check me out she was still on the phone. Very unprofessional and for what this food costs you think you would get decent service. No thank you cafe rios, I will stick with chipotle who will not only make more chicken but they are always happy for my business and provide good service. Don't waste the money here!
