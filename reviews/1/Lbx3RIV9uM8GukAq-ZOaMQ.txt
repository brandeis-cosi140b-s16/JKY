So disappointed. I moved to Arizona from California last year and have been searching everywhere for some good mexican food without any success. Yesterday, two of my coworkers were talking about this restaurant and its tortilla soup and cheese appetizer and tonight we decided to try it out. 
Pros- good chips and salsa. my corona was ok too. fast service but I hate when servers do no clear the appetizers, dirty plates before the main course. And then give the check without clearing the table.

Bad- the FOOD !! tortilla soup was okay, really nothing special, I would not order it again. I guess when I think of tortilla soup, I expect cilantro, onion, chips, chicken but it was just broth and chips and cheese.

 We ordered the cheese and mushroom appetizer since my coworkers recommended it. We had a few bites of thick cheese and we were not impressed. tasted like canned mushrooms and bad cheese. We ate about 1/3 before just letting it sit there.  Main courses arrived and while they looked pretty, my swiss enchiladas with red sauce were GROSS. I took one bite and made a face. The sauce tasted very ketchup like and the chicken had no flavor. Beans were floating in broth and tasteless... like watered down bbq beans. I got about 3 bites into my 3 enchiladas and just gave up. My bf's shrimp tacos were better and had a few bites of his.


Overall, 40 dollars for us to eat and the only thing that were good were the chips. I'm not sure why my coworkers liked it but maybe its because I am used to good Californian Mexican food? Sigh, still looking for decent mexican food here in the valley.
