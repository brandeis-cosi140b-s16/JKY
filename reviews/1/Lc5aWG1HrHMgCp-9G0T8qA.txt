HORRIBLE!  DIRTY!  It was my first, and last, visit to Chipolte restaurants anywhere.  The first thing I did was ask the employees if the food was spicy, and of course they said no,'but they could make it spicy.  I told them I am wimpy and don't like food spicy at all, and my son cannot eat spicy hot either.  They told me not to worry, that they make it spicy.  WRONG!  It was so spicy neither my son nor I could eat it.  So I excused myself and went to the bathroom, and on my short walk back to the table, I saw a live ROACH on its back.  I immediately lost my appetite.' The only one who ate the food was my husband, who said it was o.k.  When I asked for to-go containers (for my husband) the employee who had just handled the dirty money, dug his hands in the containers and handed them to me.  So I asked the employees who were making the food (and were wearing gloves) to get them.   My husband didn't even eat the food we took home; even he lost his appetite after all of that.
