I don't get this place. Maybe we ordered the wrong things, but my husband and I left extremely disappointed. The shrimp ceviche was overly drenched in lime juice and were served with grocery store chips, the tamales barely had any filling, the puerco fritas were extremely dry, and the mojitos were watered down. The best thing about our meal was the free bread.
