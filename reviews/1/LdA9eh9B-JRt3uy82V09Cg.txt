Food is excellent as always.  We eat at wahoos in foothill ranch, ca all the time.  The really bad part of this experience was the service.  It was a 45 min wait from the time we ordered and there was only a couple people in line ahead of us. No one followed up with us after we asked about our food. The kids nachos had hardly any cheese and we had to send them back.....after 45 minute wait! We told the staff about our dissatisfaction and they just shrugged their shoulders. In addition the bar was full of drunks who were dropping f bombs as we sat there with our kids.
