This place has gone downhill, and that's saying a lot since they started so low to begin with. I've been going to this place since they opened and have been  disappointed over the last couple of months. Would it hurt to hire a cashier who understands customer service and tell the cooks in the back to put down their burrito to make the customer's? Go to Taco Bell across the street. Half the price for the same diarrhea. 

The picture I've uploaded is for my order of 1 chicken quesadilla with cheese plain. 2 orders for 5 rolled tacos with cheese and guacamole, and a beef burrito with cheese, sour cream and lettuce. 

Again, would probably have been half the price across the street with friendly customer service.
