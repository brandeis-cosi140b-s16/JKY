I cannot believe how bad the food was here.  Lets start with the salsa, terrible.  It tasted like some peppers and tomatoes mixed with store purchased Pace salsa.  The appetizers of Chicken Nachos where soggy from the second they hit the table.  My wife order Shrimp fajitas, that arrived just warm and not sizzling on the plate like they should be.  I ordered a Chimichanga that was so bland and dry I could only eat a quarter of it.  Even my daughter could not eat her bean and cheese burrito because she said it was so dry.

After a $71 lunch bill ??? I still cannot believe it was that much, I will NEVER go back to this place again.  How they are still in business I have no idea, as I've had a better burrito's at Taco Bell.
