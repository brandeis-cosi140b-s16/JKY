Beware of this place!  I went a few years ago and found a black hair in my salad (I am blond) and was disgusted! They replaced the salad and still charged me for it.  Fast forward three years and my Mother-in-Law found a cockroach in her taco salad.  My husband's family has been going to this restaurant for quite a while.  Not anymore!! The waitress asked if she wanted to take a new salad to go (she lost her appetite but give in at the waitress insisting).  She got it to go and was charged.  The owner was a complete jerk and argued that the bug could have flown in.. On top of that, the food is mediocre.
