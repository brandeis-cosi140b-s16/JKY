Ate here about a month or so ago. I greatly disliked it. Very pricy. you do get alot of food but it's all poor quality. I had the Yaki soba which tasted like the instant version you could buy at any grocery store for a buck (the dish here I believe is 12 dollars) a friend had ordered 2 rolls which took Forever to arrive to the table. they weren't very good either. I won't be returning. as a matter of fact everytime me and my boyfriend pass by this restaurant he jokingly tells me "I'm going to take you there for every special occasion" knowing very well I cringe at the thought. Just keep driving people you aren't missing much
