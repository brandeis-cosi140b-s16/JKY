I had heard good reviews about this place from my husband's brother but was warned that it was a bit expensive for fast Mexican food. When a groupon deal came out for it, my husband and I decided to try it. We thought it nothing out of the ordinary and their portions were small and overpriced. I'm fit and eat healthy portions and found myself needing more than 2 burritos to feel satisfied! That will definitely be first and last time I will be going there as the service was poor. It wasn't so bad that i wasn't greeted or made felt welcomed. What bothered me more was that the men at the counter were eating from the batch they were preparing and while they were putting my order together. That is a major food handling violation. I will not be coming here again.
