WARNING, do not sit on the patio. During this wonderful weather, you may be tempted to bask in the outdoors while you leisurely indulge in a mimosa or bloody mary. This restaurant is not the place to do so. For two weekends in a row I have sat on the patio only to be sorely neglected. I waited for 20 minutes to get a drink each time I sat down. This was because I discovered that the bartender outside is also the waitress for the entire patio. She is heavily bogged down and cannot accommodate patrons sitting at the tables. There were 5 of us, all four adults got their meal and were done eating when the 5th persons food finally arrived. I have no complaints about the food, but I also have no desire to give money to a place that has great food but crappy service.
