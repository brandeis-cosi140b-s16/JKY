Abstract: Go to another ChipotleÂ®. You're welcome. 

Maybe it was the time we went (although across the street I could go into In-N-Out two seconds before the door is locked for the night and everything served would be still fresh and employees would not act like you shat on their chests). 

Maybe it was the overt manifestation growing dissatisfaction in the lives of the employees. 

Maybe you should avoid this specific location unless you want COLD food, with dry meat (or hardly any ingredients if you order vegetarian). No lettuce in the lettuce bin. 

(An ASIDE): maybe it is easier to notice more negative components of an experience when the entire experience overall is negative .... WHY the hell do they ask what type of beans do you desire when you are asking for vegetarian? One type is vegetarian (black) and one is not (pinto); so is there an abundance of non-vegetarian patrons out there clamoring for over*priced vegetarian burritos who still want the non-vegetarian pinto beans? I mean, by all means ask, but why not ask "black beans, right?" instead of black or pinto. Maybe a vegetarian patronising Chiptole for the first time does not know that the pinto beans are prepared non-vegetarian. Reminiscent of McDonald's and their shit fries and their absurd aim to bamboozle patrons into consuming them as if they were vegetarian (perhaps Chiptole learned this practice while McD was in an early major investor).  

This location sucks and I would avoid it. - E
