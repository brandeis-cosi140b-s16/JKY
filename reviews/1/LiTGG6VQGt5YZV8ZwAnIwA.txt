I cannot believe what I was served here! I ordered the mini Chimis. The chicken ones were ok but a little plain. The beef ones, on the other hand, were freaking MOLDY! I can't freaking believe it. I was very upset. It seems as though I am not going to get sick from this (its been about 10 hours since I ate there and I feel fine). The waiter was nice and comped us the meal.
