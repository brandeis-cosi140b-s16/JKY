Went here today with my daughter for a late lunch. The place was fairly empty. We waited about 10 minutes before we even saw a server. Now if you like really hot salsa then this is the place for you, but I am from Louisiana and the salsa here took my breath away it was so hot. On top of that I didn't have water or my drink yet. Our server was very abrupt and to the point ( no friendliness here folks). When we were leaving we passed right behind the hostess who was playing on her cell phone and not a good by, thank y'all for coming in or nothing. There are a lot of better and friendlier Mexican places to eat in this area. Won't be going back.
