I've heard so many great things about the one on 12st and Northern, decided to go for my first time today at the their newest location. I was definitely disappointed with the service as soon as we walked in.  We waited for 10 minutes until what it appeared to be the manager saying that have some tables but they're dirty.  Um okay.  Finally we were seated and 10 minutes go by and no menus.  Well finally the manager noticed we didn't have menus and he finally got us some.  I don't even want to finish the review on the service.  The service was horrible! But the food was good.  I got the chicken burrito with green sauce.  A little stingy on the sauce, otherwise pretty good. I will never come back to this location.  Kinda sad it was my first and definitely my last.
