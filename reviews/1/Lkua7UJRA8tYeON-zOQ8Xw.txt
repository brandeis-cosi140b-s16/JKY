I don't even know where to start. 

Soggy burrito. 
Lumpy, tasteless salsa. 
Stale chips. 
Hard tortilla. 


It was like 9pm,and I really wanted a burrito, just not Roberto's (which I love btw), and I always get a burrito bowl from Chipotle, so I thought: "what the hell, never tried their burritos let's give it a shot."

Worst mistake of my life and I knew there was a reason I shied away from tacos/burritos from this place. When I began to order, they immediately informed me that they were out of chicken and steak, only had pork. I don't usually eat pork but I was jonesin' for a burrito, so I shrugged and said "that's cool, I would like some barbacoa". When I received my burrito, I just left the location, took it home and prepared to feast. 

Then I removed it from the bag. 

The bag was literally see-through,  it was so drenched in juices. 

It got all over my car seat, and my kitchen table. 

I should've stopped there. But no, I continued. 

I picked it up, the whole outside of the foil was wet. For some reason it was wrapped in two pieces of foil and although I asked for salsa on the side, it was still poured on top. I opened the foil, the burrito was red from the salsa. Soggy. Would not stay together in my hands. 

"Did I eat it? "you may be asking. Yes, I did. And it wasn't like it was a freak accident. My roommate ordered the same thing and got the same result. 

I didn't expect 5 star cuisine, Chipotle. I really did not. But,  damn. 

Will never eat here again.
