I went to the drive thru at 12pm and waited and never got helped. I had to drive the window that's when I saw a glimpse of someone run by but they never went to the window to take my order. I had to go in through the circle k its connected to and shout out till someone finally came out. I asked them why I was not helped at the drive thru and she said that she did not hear the bell ding. I was also told that I could not place my order because they were cleaning the grill and computer system was down. Bullshit! The hours posted on the sign said that they are open until 3am. I felt like I was lied to just to avoid doing there job. Never will I ever waste my time or give my money to this company again.
