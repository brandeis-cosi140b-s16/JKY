Zero stars!!! Service and food was horrible.  Finally thought we had found a great authentic seafood eatery... Was completely let down.  Our food was served two hours post ordering.  Food was cold and the shrimp on ALL platters were NOT cleaned/deveined.  Management lacked all experience on how to handle our complaints.  Only decent thing were the Tecates and oysters.  Do not recommend and will not revisit.
