We have been here a few times and every time it was great.... this last time ruined it completely for us. I dont know if our server was new or what but our glasses were empty almost the entire time, except when a manager came by to refill them. We watied a fairly long time for our appetizer, which wasnt that great anyways (the stuffed jalepenos were good but thats all) and we waited about another 15 minutes after finishing the appetizer for our main food to bE brought out.... COLD! We were very very disappointed in the overall experience :( We will not return again sadly!
