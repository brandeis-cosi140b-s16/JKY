So I used to eat at this location

And I loved it

But slowly
Each time I ate here

I'd get a tummy ache

Then my boyfriend was all like "hey, everytime I eat chipotle I get diarrhea"

So it wasn't just me!

We continued to eat here though, because we loved it.
And we'd make sure we had no where to be for a few hours after eating it.

I know, we're weird.

But we got sick of getting sick.  Poo.  Literally.
