I love El Pollo Loco but this is my 3rd bad experience with this location. It took 45 minutes from the time that I ordered at the drive thru teller to receive my food and drive away. with only 3 cars ahead of me why 45 minutes!!! I could of cooked it myself at home. I ordered the family meal and  my enchiladas were not cooked cold as ice. The churros were hard as a rock to the point that you could not bite into them. Cold flour tortillas and the chicken did not seem to be cooked to the EL POLLO LOCO standards skin was soggy and did not seem fresh. Corn tasted like dirt and was overcooked to point of being rubbery. The only decent thing was the beans. So I waited forever to receive food that was not eatable. Everytime I go to this location it is the same thing!  My hungry family ended up eating Peanut Butter and Jelly because the food was so bad. $25.00 spent and completly unhappy not to mention 45minutes of my life that I will never get back. 

Never Again after 3 times of super bad service I have learned my lesson.
