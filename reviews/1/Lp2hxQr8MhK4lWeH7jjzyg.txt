What a joke. Worst service I think I've ever received. I feel bad for the owners of such an awful establishment. We went because reviews on yelp. Awful. Vegetables weren't cooked all the way through. We were one of 3 tables and had to wait 30 minutes for food. We all ate cereal at home it was so bad. Cold, not cooked, no flavor. Shame on Susie.
