Not happy at all w/this establishment!  Too start off w/the lady behind counter looked at us if we were speaking Chinese & No Acknowledgement when we asked her something.  2nd, ordered a #6 & got something else instead.  3rd I ordered Menudo & I wasn't impressed w/it. I always thought it came with hominy but, apparently Not this order? Way too spicy & the Tripe looked & tasted old.  Would've been better to get Juanitas in the can!  Needless to say won't be coming back here.  Not sure how others who commented previously got good food & service?  Everyone has an off day I guess?  Too bad it had to be me...
