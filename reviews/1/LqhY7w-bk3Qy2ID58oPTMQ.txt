I am so beyond pissed with this location. The staff sucked. I ordered a burrito and the girl couldn't even fold it correctly and when half the ingredients spilled out she took another tortilla and slapped on there and STILL couldn't fold it correctly. My burrito fell completely apart and the least she could've done was offered to make a new one instead of giving me a half ass made burrito. I definitely do not recommend this location.
