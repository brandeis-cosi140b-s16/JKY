I haven't even left the parking lot yet. It made me so upset. I love chipotle and maybe I'm just used to California and their hospitality but this location sucks at customer service. When I walk in I see 3 employees at the make table and a gentleman ahead of me had questions so one employee was happy to help him. The other ran to the back. Well he had a lot of questions and while waiting, the same employees who could have helped the line decided to stay and peek around the corner and stare instead of helping. Then when the one employee called for a cash register person.  It took a good 3 minutes for an employee to stop ignoring her and come help. I know plenty of people looking for work maybe chipotle needs to clean house at this location.


Also, I come home to find that they have store bought chips instead of the chips I love. Big fail.
