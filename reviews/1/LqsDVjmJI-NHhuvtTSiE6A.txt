My fianc√©e and I went to this restaurant around 4:40 p.m on 8/17 our waiter was oscar.. he was the worst not friendly person ive met in the waiting business. . Its kinda sad because im a waiter myself and he makes us look bad.. he didnt come by to refill not one drink..  disappeared when asking for him.. then when other tables came in he catered to them like we werent sitting there..  we had to walk to the hostess stand to ask for our check.. ive never went to a restaurant and not tip.. but yesterday was the first..
