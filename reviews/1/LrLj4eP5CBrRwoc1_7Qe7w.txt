I have eaten there twice good each time but very disturbing that Johnny the owner takes your money and then makes the food without washing his hands UUUUGH this is a health dept violation and will make people SICK. I wont be back sad as I am from New Mexico and this food is from home  but I wont risk contamination . I was in the rest. biz for 25 yrs. and this a lawsuit waiting to happen.
