Man what a let down! I was so amped to get to this place after I saw it on Diners Drive-ins and Dives. Flavorless beer battered fish taco, chips and salsa with no pizzazz, even the beans and rice were blah. And my server had some kind of narly rash on his elbows, yuck. It's not an experience that I ever care to have again.
