Lets start by saying it's nice to be acknowledged!
I went there on Tue night . I was meeting two friends so I told the Hostess I'd have a drink at the bar. It was 5pm . There was one couple at the bar and that was it. I sat and waited, and waited ,and then I waited some more. The manager was to busy talking to other employees to even acknowledge me at the bar. 5 min seemed like 30. I could see exactly why no one was partaking of Happy Hour!! I eventually had to ask the bus person to get me a bartender. Unbelievable!! 
My friend arrived. To my dismay they wanted to stay. With no bartender or waiter in sight to take our order once again we had to ask to be served. Orders were taken. Now! You don't really think the order was correct?? I ordered a side of rice . Never received. We were there to eat and enjoy a drink or two, after all it was Happy Hour! Well!! It was only Happy Hour when we had to remind the waiter/bartender of the Happy Hour prices. Ridiculous!! He gave us $2 in cash back......how convenient he forgot bout Happy Hour ? 
Please don't get me wrong.....I've never gone anywhere for the "deals" when it comes to food. I'd prefer "Great Service" and so so food then the other way round. 
The food was ok. I had guacamole and three chicken tacos. 
Will I return?? No. I'd hate to see the place if the bar was really slammed busy.!! Just sayinn 
As a foot note. I've been around the restaurant industry for many years. I love great service , attentive wait staff, nice settings. They really did a great job with the decor but the decor ain't gonna pay the bills.
