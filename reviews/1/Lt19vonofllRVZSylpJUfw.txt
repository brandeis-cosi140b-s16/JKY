This review is for the poor service. It was so bad, we walked out before our main food ever came. It took 25 minutes to order food and after 1 1/2 hours, we asked if our food is on the way. The waiter made excuses saying he doesn't usually work with these cooks today and that they have their own thing going on back there...blah blah blah...basically, he didn't want us to blame him for the bad service. But, they're a team and he should've be on top of it. We walked out after sitting there for two hours and empty drinks that haven't been checked on for 30 minutes. This place needs to be on the RESTAURANT IMPOSSIBLE SHOW. We will never eat here again and strongly suggest anyone shouldn't either. There are way better Mexican restaurants in town that have authentic food with better prices. If you're looking for authenticity and good service, you should go elsewhere. This place is reeks americanized Mexican food and clueless waiters. Don't disappoint yourself by going here.
