Terrible service ! As a matter of fact it looked like our server went out of their way to ignore us. When we finally did get some food it was only average. The only good thing is the Salsa Bar. However, the little containers are so small you can't dip your chips into them without breaking the chips. We'll never go back ! I'd rather eat at Taco Bell. The rest of our experience at Sunset Station was excellent. Just stay away from Guadalajara's.
