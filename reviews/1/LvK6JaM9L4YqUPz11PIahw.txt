I have been a customer for over 12 years, but the place has been on the downhill slide for years.  They closed the location on indian school years ago, for the same reasons.  Those reasons are many now. I stopped back in after being away from Julio G's Take out.  Had 2 beef tacos and rice....  The rice is very plain and has gotten more gringo over the years  which equals bland.  The taco's had a nice shredded beef filling and was better than 2 years ago.  But the salsa bar has been reduced to salsa given out on plastic topped cups.  Bad news is you have to ask for more all the time if you like the sauce, the hot is far from hot any gringo can use it.  Bad news one person taking orders during lunch service in take out and service said orders.  Cleanup needs to be focused on here... They have forgotten to do this.  Yes, a long term customer is seeing another location in slow spiral down the drain.
