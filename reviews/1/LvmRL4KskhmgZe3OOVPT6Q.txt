Located inside Aliante Station. That should tell you something.

The bar and decor is visually stunning, but that's it.

Had the WORST service ever. It was so bad that I took notes on my phone.

One server was responsible for two separate dining rooms, so we scarcely saw him. Our salsa was ridiculously spicy for some reason, and we couldn't find anyone to bring us water or take our drink order. He waited until our plates had been cleared to offer us refills! 

I tried a carne asada chimichunga. I was served a burrito drenched in old-tasting grease, stuffed with bland rice with a few pieces of stringy pot-roast type meat. Everything we tasted was bland. I had to put hot sauce on everything. Isn't that the chef's job? 

After our disgusting meal, we had to wait about 20 minutes for our check. I was honestly about to dine and dash because it was THAT bad.

They claim to have over 100 premium tequilas at the bar. Save your money and go to Tequila Cantina on Boulder Hwy.
