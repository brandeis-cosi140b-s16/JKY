Awful experience from start to finish.  Horrible service.  Inedible food.  We had eaten at Taxco probably 6 times and deemed it an OK Mexican restaurant but after last nights debacle we will never be back.  Sat 10 minutes then had to go ask someone to bring water.  Two (of our party of 5) ordered fajitas.  They served the fajitas, no tortillas, then it was 5 minutes till they brought the third persons meal... and then another 5 till they brought the last two.  The last two were both wrong. Never an apology. Horrible experience.
