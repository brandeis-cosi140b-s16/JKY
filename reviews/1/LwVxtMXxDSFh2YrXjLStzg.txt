The food is good but this place has the WORST customer service.  They throw your food, are so slow, act like you should know what comes in everything,  the tall guy is so rude, and they are ALWAYS out of something.  Zaba's is much better, I just wish it were closer. We will have to start going to the Cafe Rio on Centennial from now on.
