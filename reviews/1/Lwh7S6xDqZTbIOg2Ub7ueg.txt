0 stars if I could have given! 
I will never be back here again! 
I do understand it is Las Vegas, but go easy on your prices and portions -whoever is in charge of pricing! 

$6 for ONE small taco! 
And I ordered soy sauce, the server DID not tell me I'm being charged for it! Please take a guess how much he brought me: 

Go ahead...I'll wait. 

....he brought about a table spoon of soy sauce (no joke); n charged us $3!!!!! WTF- GTFO for those of you who know what that stands for.  

I had to double check again that this was a Chinese Resturaunt; and I don't know where  y'all are from; but even in the getto soy sauce is FREE! Ok? It's f***ing free...



Anyways, again I asked for a chilly sauce; charged again 

Real bummer when I checked my statement, I was charged an extra $6, for the heck of it. 
I called in and spoke to the manager, he confirmed it. I was in fact charged an extra $6 for the heck of it; but it would take 72 hours for that to go back to my account! WTF again!!! 
That sucks! Good thing I called man. I mean just why? Change your system before people freak out, I already freaked out enough about your service! 
The manager was nice tho on the phone. But I'm still keeping my 1 star; and if I could give 0, I still would. No management could ever change that!
