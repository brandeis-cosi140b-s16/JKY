First off I love Baja Fresh but not after this last experience...  I went to Baja Fresh with my family (wife and  two year old daughter) they had to use the ladies room so they waited 7 minutes for someone to come come out so they could use it.  The person in the bath room was a hispanic Baja Fresh worker.  He told us he was cleaning but we could go in after after was done.  He then left and we went in" it was disgusting.  Nothing was cleaned and we knew he was in their on his cell phone pretending to clean.  Then I went in the mens bathroom  and the bathroom floor was completely covered in urine.  The guy who was cleaning the bathroom also went stright from the bath room to cooking on the grill without ever washing his hands.  We were completely grossed out.  I got my girls back in the car and went in to talk to the manager.  The cook we had the run in with heard that I was waiting to talk to the manager and tried to maddog(stair me down) from behind the counter.  I told the manager what had happened and how disgusted we were.  I told the manager who also looked like he was probably intemidated by the workers himself.  Never eating there again after this...GROSS!!!!!
