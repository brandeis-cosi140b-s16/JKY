I thought long and hard about this review and here is the bottom line. This is just pitiful. Apparently, no one connected with this place cares...; they are just going through the motions. The place looks and feels blah. The food is uninspired - dull, cold, boring. This may have been the most depressing meal I have had in a while. And I have been eating at Garcia's going back to the mid 80s. Its time for management to re-commit or just retire. 
Anyone thinking this is ok isn't being honest with themselves. Apathy can no longer be accepted. I work too hard for my money and I am sure you do too. This review makes me sad, and I am sorry to be so blunt.
