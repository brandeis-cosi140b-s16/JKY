I got a quesadilla from here today for lunch when I opened my bag to start eating I discover a crumbled up ball of foil which didn't at all resemble the shape of a quesadilla. Upon opening said foil I find what I can assume used to be a quesadilla. It was sliced up and folded over in the foil and so greasy it was literally dripping while I tried to manage to separate each slice. I ended up having to eat it with a fork and knife because of all the grease and there was hardly any meat inside for an $8 quesadilla. I will not be going back to zabas I could get a better quesadilla at Taco Bell. Overall overpriced and unsatisfactory.
