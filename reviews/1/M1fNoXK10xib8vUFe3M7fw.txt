Just visited this location today at about 10pm. We went through the drive thru and attempted to order a #7 and 2 beef tacos. After saying our order it was not repeated back to make sure it was correct nor did the employee tell us what he had for our oder at the window when we paid. The order was wrong only gave us our #7 and then we asked for red sauce and received only green. After this visit we were so displeased we visited another fast food restaurant to meet our needs.
