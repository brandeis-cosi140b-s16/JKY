My husband and I were meeting some old friends of his here. When we walked upstairs we sat down, but we noticed everything was falling apart, so we moved to a different table and ordered our food. Needless to say, the food was dry! I ordered fajitas and the beef was so dry it was hard to chew. I was disappointed especially for how much they charged.
