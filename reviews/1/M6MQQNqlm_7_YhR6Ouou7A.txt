HORRIBLE SERVICE. 
The girls that work the line here have such terrible attitudes & their appearance makes me wish I went to the freaking McDonalds next door. A girl cutting chicken literally had a pack of cigarettes right next to her on the counter and another had a pack sticking completely out of her pocket. The girl that was cleaning tables was standing by the soda machine from the time I got there until I left talking to her friend. Save your time and go elsewhere, even the portions they give you at this location are not worth what you're paying. They put the food on your plate as if they're scared to put the right amount. I'm just going to keep going to the Centennial location, where you can tell the staff got trained and knows how to give good service. Even if it is a further drive. Oh, and the 1 star is for the cashier who is the only one that had a good positive attitude.
