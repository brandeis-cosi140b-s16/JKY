Dingy, dark, dirty, sticky -- that's your table. Greasy, unappealing, low quality -- that's your food. Someone obviously put a lot of time, money and love to build this business (from the decor I'm guessing it was once an interesting, somewhat upscale place). Today, it's a dump.

I ordered the chile relenos. The beans and rice were overcooked and tasteless. There was more egg than chile, though it was hard to tell because of all the cheese congealing over the plate. I'll never go here again.
