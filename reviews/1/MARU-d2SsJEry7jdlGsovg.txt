We were really hoping this place would be good, but unfortunately, it was far from it. The salsa had a decent flavor, but was too chunky. We asked for some hot sauce to add to it, but all they had was Tabasco and Tapatio. The chips tasted like they were store bought, the enchilada sauce from a can, pre-fabbed taco shells, dry carne asada meat in the rocky point tacos, cheese that wasn't melted in the cheese enchiladas... Pretty rough. The only thing we liked was the beans. The owner really needs to revisit the ingredients and the way they're prepared if they want this place to be more than just a bar that has off track betting. Our server was really nice, but she had way too many tables... Again, the manager or owner needs to pay more attention and staff appropriately. I really hope they can figure this stuff out, as it would be really nice to have another option over on this side of town.
