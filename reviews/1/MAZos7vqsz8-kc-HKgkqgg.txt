I wanted Mexican Food, took my wife... Menu is deceiving with them pictures for the orders. Well, we get there... get seated , no hello's , any water and wait for 10 minutes.... Boy ! I had a funny feeling thas was a BAD Place to eat.... then we got some chips , then the water and got our orders taken. Hmm good 25 minutes waiting. 

Well, like always try to be polite and wait to see if the food is good like the pictures on the menu..... Nope, the food tasted like old cooking oil the Rice very dry, the Tacos soggy the beans where kinda burnt. I told my wife can I taste your dish ... I was no way it taste the same cooking oil ... I left my food , did not finish it ... I'm sorry , this is not Mexican Food. I should of eaten at home and save my money ....  it should be a  Minus 2 Star. Never coming Back.....
