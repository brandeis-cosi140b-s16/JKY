Come on folks, yelp only works if we're honest and this place is all about 5 star prices for 2 star food and service.  I can't even give it a 2 star because of the deception.  I'm guessing this place caters to people who live the diabetes lifestyle . . . sorry.  High fat, high sugar, high sodium and large portions.
I have never been served a saltier main course than I had here.  You could not taste the food, only salt. The chef's solutions to mid quality ingredients seemed to be to keep adding more - every dish had too many ingredients and was large.  They have small portions on the menu yet the waitress dissuaded us from them in most cases.  This is the kind of place that makes a salad unhealthy.
The servers and bus people kept insisting how great everything (food & drinks) was when it simply wasn't.  The service was fine, if you don't mind asking for every single thing at least three times.  I get that they were run off their feet, but what's a diner to do?
On a positive note, he ambiance was nice, the staff were nice and I was given a good wine recommendation.
