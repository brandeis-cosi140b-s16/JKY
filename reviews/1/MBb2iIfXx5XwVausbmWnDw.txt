We visited Carlito's based on positive Yelp reviews. The location was a storefront of a strip mall and did have some family owned charm. However, the food was nothing more than Mexican fast food. The sauces were cheap and did not appear to be freshly made. I ordered the Navajo taco and was very disappointed. It arrived in a to-go container (we were dining there) and a water-like sauce made the taco soggy. There was little spice or flavor. I would not recommend this restaurant.
