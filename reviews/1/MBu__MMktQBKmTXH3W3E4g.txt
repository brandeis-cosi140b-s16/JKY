Walked a mile into the casino to get my drink with my Groupon and the workers closed shop an hour early!  The three unprofessional workers told me their website isn't updated with their new earlier closing time amd they refused to honor my voucher. My vacation was carefully planned out so I dont have the time avaiable to go back to use the voucher so I'm out  $20!
