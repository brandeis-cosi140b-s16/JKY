They are very stingy with the amount of food they place in the bowls. After all the ingredients my bowl is still not full. And the employees gave me a questioning look when I asked for extra lettuce. Really? You want to stiff me on lettuce? Never again at this location. I've been to other Chipotle locations around the valley who have given me ample portions in the bowls.
