Ok so the service is fine here but everything else was terrible. They didn't have horchata, my taco was made with a hard shell and had lettuce,  might as well have been from taco bell. The chili renos had no flavorand way too much egg for my taste. It was also pretty pricey. Sorry but there are just too many better options for good Mexican food for you to waste your time here.
