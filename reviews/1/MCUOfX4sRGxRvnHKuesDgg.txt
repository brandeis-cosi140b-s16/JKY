I went here with my family after seeing it got 5 stars.  We waited in line for about 10 minutes and ordered 2 kids taco with hard shells, 1 regular taco salad ,and 2 chicken taco salads.  Total without drinks came to $27.00.
The hard taco shells came pre-made out of a box.  You can buy the same at any grocery store.  Very underwhelming.  The chicken in the tacos was very highly processed and had a rather unpleasant marinade.  The 3 taco salads again came in pre-made taco shells.  The beans tasted like they came out of a can.  All 3 adults thought the food was very marginal and will never go back.  My 9 year old said the taco was bad.  All of us prefer Carolina's or Someburros.  I did not get an opinion from my 3 year old because he did not touch the taco.  I guess he knew better.
