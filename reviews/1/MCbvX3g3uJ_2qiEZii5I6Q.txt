I love chipotle and have for many years. That being said this chipotle has the worst service ever. I ordered online for pick up and when I showed up on time to pick up my order the woman said "the food will be done in a minute" with the rudest attitude I have ever experienced here. And THEN I had to wait and additional 15 minutes for my order while they helped everyone in line first. What the heck!! 

I am so upset with chipotle right now. 

The food is what you expect when going to chipotle.
