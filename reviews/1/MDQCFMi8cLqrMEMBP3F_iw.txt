It's the time of year for an annual pilgrimage from Tempe to the Cerreta Candy Co. for Christmas gifts and La Perla Cafe for dinner.  BUT most likely we'll NEVER GO BACK TO La Perla.  Tonight they were charging $10 just to park in their parking lot, and then if you ate dinner there, they would give you back $5.  We told the lady in the parking lot that we had driven from Tempe for dinner, but it made no difference, she said "I'm just doing what my boss told me to do."  Unfortunately, I guess people who come for Glendale Glitters take advantage of their parking lot.

We were really in the mood for Mexican food, and the good news is we found another restaurant.  Now when we go to Glendale, we will bypass La Perla Cafe, and go to PEDRO'S at 4938 W. Glendale Ave.  Food was very good at Pedro's and our wait staff was very helpful.
