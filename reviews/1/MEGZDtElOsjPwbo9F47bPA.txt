Javier the server was really rude with an attitude. Have you got my order wrong and blamed me for his mistake. Javier got loud in the restaurant and wanted to argue about the mistake. Javier gave me a menu then he left. The gentleman brought me chips and salsa and I was almost through before I called Javier for help . Javier seemed preoccupied with the cooks, I understand Spanish perfectly and he talked about me as if I did the order wrong .. He knew he was wrong he tried to offer me chips . He did not even want exchange my order. Needless to say I will not be returning to this restaurant. Half of the servers are sitting there eating their food looking at you drinking having a good time while you're waiting to be served . I waited and I just left. After I told the cashier she acted like she didn't even care it's not the area it's the people in the restaurant that are not professional or have an understanding of English unless you speak very very slow . Again I will not go to this restaurant ever you cannot pay me to go to this restaurant because the staff are so rude.
