So terrible.  This is not quality food folks.  Everything is overly salty and the queso.  Their beans taste stale and their staff is rude.  The salsa has some spice in it that is so out of place and gross.  I just was so heartbroken that this is what qualifies as Mexican food in Arizona.  Let's just say that I tried it so you don't have to.
