This restaurant usually delivers I just ordered three items for pickup and none of my salads had any dressing with them. I called them back after getting home to ask if this was something they just forgot and I was left on an open line without even being asked to hold or given advice what was happening next.... 
Eventually after waiting for 5 minutes and countless hollers "anyone there" I hung up and wrote this review. Not very good customer service after ordering and delivering the product.
