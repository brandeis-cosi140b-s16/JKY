Yes I know they are new but I wanted to give another try/chance.  First time in the store waited over 20 minutes for our food. The store wasn't busy. Second time which was today I went through the drive through. This time waited over 30 minutes. . They said sorry and gave me a senior discount. Manager was Danny and didn't come to say anything. The teller was new and at least he was nice. Don't recommend.
