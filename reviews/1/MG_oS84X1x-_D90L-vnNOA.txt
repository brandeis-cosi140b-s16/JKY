Bar was not crowded. The short brown hair female bartender could not handle the crowd. She looked stress of the crowd which was not that bad. She took our order & it took 45 mins to get our bar food. Tacos were old& tortilla was hard & food tasted awful. Don't eat here. Drinks are ok one star is too much
