You know what sucks is when you've been dying to trying a place for months and you finally get the chance to go with your family and you get the worst service of your life. Don't get me wrong the food it was tasty but food is nothing when your being judged by the staff and getting bad service. Just a FYI for your staff just because a family looks young and maybe doesn't seem like they could afford to eat there seeing as thats the vibe we got the WHOLE time doesn't mean they should be treated badly. If people are at your asstablisment they are obvously there to spend money and eat and they should be treated with respect! Very disappointed.
