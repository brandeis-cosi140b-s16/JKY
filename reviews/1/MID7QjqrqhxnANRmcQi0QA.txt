Went with my husband on a Wednesday night. We were the only people in there. The interior was cozy, a little dimly lit...fairly good decor. 

We were brought chips and salsa. The salsa was good but the chips were cold and probably straight out of a store bought bag. NOT a good start..

We ordered a chicken fajita each. The waiter first brought out a taco bowl filled with guacamole, sour cream, lettuce, and shredded cheese( no rice or refried beans) and it took like 5-6 mins after that for the actual fajitas to arrive. One of the worst fajitas I have ever had. The chicken seemed dry, the dish was low on salt and seasoning, AND the pieces on the bottom were fully charred and bitter. Blegh!

Throughout our meal, we could hear really loud noises of pots and pans that sounded like they were being thrown about in the kitchen.....

At some point in the middle of our dinner,I asked the waiter for some hot sauce like Tabasco or something and he said they don't keep any. What Mexican restaurant doesn't keep hot sauce?! He did, however, recommend another kind of sauce and said I would be charged for it. I ordered it anyway. It came in a teeny cup and definitely not worth something to pay for.

They have a deal running through the end of Nov wherein you buy one entree and get the second one half off( on Tue, Wed, Thu). Even saying that, our bill was lik $30+ (including $2 for the sauce). Overall, not a good experience... Wouldn't come here again, even with the half off deal.
