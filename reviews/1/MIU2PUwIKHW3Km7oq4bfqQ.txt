Avoid this place unless you can't hold out, the plumper of the two girls that work there is always pissed off at something, mumbles when talking to you and, gets upset when you ask her to speak up because you can't hear what she's saying because her conversations with the cook is more important.

I'll make a trip and pay a few extra bucks at Los Favoritos
