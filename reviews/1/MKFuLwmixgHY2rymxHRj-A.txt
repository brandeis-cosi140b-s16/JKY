Terrible food and service.  We ordered the food without cilantro and everything we ordered had extra cilantro.  The cook even made a remark that he saw the request for no cilantro and decided against it. The food was overpriced, the drinks were mediocre at best, and the service was some of the worst I've had.  The location is cursed and so is this restaurant, evidently.
