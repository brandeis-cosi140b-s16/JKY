Great location, good food but the worst service I've ever experienced in a Scottsdale restaurant in FOREVER!!

Took 50 minutes to get our drinks.
Food arrived before the drinks, and the order was wrong.
When we complained to the owner, she never apologized, tried to throw our server under the bus - who was very nice and super apologetic.   Owner returned and literally threw some gift certificates at our table "for next time" and ran onto the next table.   

It's so disappointing a great location, great restaurant has the worst service ever.  Even with free gift certificates, we won't go back.
