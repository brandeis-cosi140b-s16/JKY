I never thought I would be writing this review.... I fell in love with cafe rio while vacationing in Utah. I was THRILLED when I had one of my very own right down the road!!

Because I loved their food so much, I've given this place many chances. Tonight was the last straw. Hoping for a quick queso snack, I waited in a long line. The employee then started dishing out queso from a dish that had been sitting on the back counter, and trying to get enough out of the bottom. GROSS! I was somewhat relieved when she spilled that cup, only to be quickly disappointed that she did not offer to make a fresh batch. She just said they were out and asked if I wanted anything else. Ummm no. Too much inconsistency and bad service, sad to say I won't be back.
