I was charged $12 each for two dishes listed on the menu for $9 each.  I pointed this out to the waitress as we left.  She said she was sorry but did not offer to correct and refund the difference.  We certainly will not return and suggest anyone dining at Cinco review their bill closely.  Ripping folks off seems to be part of the business plan.
