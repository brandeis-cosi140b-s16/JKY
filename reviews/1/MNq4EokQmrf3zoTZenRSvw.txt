I refuse to ever go to this chipotle again, the staff is unprofessional-probably because they all look and act like 5 year olds. Everytime I go its normally right before they close and its PACKED, yet they won't serve anymore guacamole or bell peppers or anything else if they are out (they have more in the back) horrible customer service! I'd rather spend my money elsewhere
