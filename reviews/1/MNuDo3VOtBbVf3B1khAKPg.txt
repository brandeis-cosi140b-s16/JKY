I bought a Groupon for Fiesta Chips and Salsa.  My husband, son, and I went one afternoon and we ended up walking out.  We waited for our drinks for 45 minutes.  The server waited on other tables, counted money at the cash register, made a couple phone calls, and had lengthy conversations with other employees.  A table that came in after us finished their food before we got our drinks.
After 45 minutes we cancelled our drink order and left.  Our Groupon will go to waste because we have no desire to return.  I would not recommend this place.
