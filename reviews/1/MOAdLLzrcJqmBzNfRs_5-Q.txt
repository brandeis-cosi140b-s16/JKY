My boyfriend and I were Guests of the Hotel. We wanted to a Bar to watch the Warriors game at and walked pass Cabo. It wasn't busy so, we decided to try the place out.

We SPECIFICALLY ordered Coronaritas. The Waitress then drops off MARGARITAS. I politely informed her WE ORDERED CORONARITAS and she RUDELY / SARCASTICALLY replied, "No, you ordered Margaritas. We ran out of the mni Corona bottles". First off, WE KNOW what we ordered, so for her to reply back with that rude remark had us both unhappy. She kept trying to ask if we wanted something else, we kept saying "No, nevermind", and she just kept insisting as if anything after her 1st remark would make up for it.

THEN, our food comes out. Disgusting. We didn't finish any of it.

THEN, I couldn't even her attention for the Check as we were waiting 15-30 minutes for service, so I had enough and requested for a Manager. 

As soon as the Manager walks over, the Waitress decides to come to us and ask if we wanted our Check. 

Fortunately, the Manager took care of us, but we will NEVER go to this Restaurant EVER AGAIN!
