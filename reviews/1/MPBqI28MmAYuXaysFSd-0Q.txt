The restaurant has been refurbished and it looks great !!!! They must have spent the entire budget on the re-make and left nothing to the service and the food !! 
The chips were lacking salt.... The queso average at best .... The service very slow (it took more than 60 min to make a burrito) .... And when it arrived it was very bland and really not better than a frozen meal from costco.....There s a Chipotle opening up next door .... They should outsource the kitchen to them and they would do much better !!! 

We will not come back for a while .....
