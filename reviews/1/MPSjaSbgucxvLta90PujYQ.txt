The food at Frida's is LAME. Not so bad in the sense that you'll want to vomit, but certainly bad enough that you won't even think twice about throwing away your leftovers instead of taking them home. I'm not exaggerating when I say that it really is some of the most mediocre Mexican food I've ever had, and that you honestly can get more flavorful Latin cuisine at Taco Bell. 

To start, the meat is dry and totally free of any significant spices or marinade, leaving you with a stringy and uninspired base for the dish. The tortillas are tough to bite through, even when soaked in the flavorless liquids that adorn your plate. The beans taste like they came straight from a can bought at the dollar store, and the vegetables aren't all that fresh. And because every dish they make is incredibly tasteless, Frida's will load up on obscene amounts of cheese to compensate. The cheese is equally as hopeless, tasting like nothing but chewy grease. 

Frida's only redeeming quality is the atmosphere - a large, well-decorated 2-story loft - unless you're not a fan of looking at a giant picture of woman with a unibrow while you eat, I suppose. All in all, dining here is a horrendous, underwhelming experience. Don't waste your money. Casa de Lara is 2 blocks away.
