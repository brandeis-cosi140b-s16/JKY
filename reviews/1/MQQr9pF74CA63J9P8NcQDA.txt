If I was the franchise owner, I would highly recommend all cashiers take a business and customer service course. I stopped into this location and ordered a burrito bowl. As I order, I am told there is no rice of any kind. So I make my way to the end of the ordering station and up to the cashier. Chicken burrito, lettuce, hot salsa, black beans, and shredded cheese. The cashier proceeded to charge me $8.xx for a basic burrito bowl without even the most basic ingredient. (Who runs out of rice?) I told him, I don't think so. 8 anything is over priced to begin with and you're unable to offer a basic ingredient. I will be happy to continue with 10% off and he says no, full price or nothing. Here's where the kid who is likely going to the UW should have enough common sense to say, we can make 90% and still satisfy our customer, or we can miss the sale, waste product, and of course take a 10-30% loss. I proceeded to say you're unable to offer your full product, I will be satisfied with 10% off or it's no deal. He proceeds to put a lid on the bowl (more money wasted) and throws the bowl in the trash. Good job bud. Way to make your franchise owner proud.
