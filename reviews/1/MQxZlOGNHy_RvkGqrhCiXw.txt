I arrived with my brother and friend, hungry, and ready to order. After waiting for half an hour, we decided to leave due to the fact that the two men working ignored the complete fuck out of us. We addressed them once for help, and realized they ignored us. Maybe at an attempt to avoid working. Nice job guys.
