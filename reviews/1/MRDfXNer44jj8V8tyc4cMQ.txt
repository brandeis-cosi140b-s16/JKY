Went through the drive-thru on 7/1/15.  The worst experience I've ever had at a fast food restaurant.  Order was wrong, got major attitude and insults.  Asked us to pay the difference for their mistake and both woman (animals) started name calling me.  So disrespectful.  And they want 15.00 an hr?!!!
