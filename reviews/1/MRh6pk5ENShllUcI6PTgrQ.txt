Nothing like the original, which I love.  I ordered the poblano chicken burrito.  I got a soggy burrito loaded with dry chicken, go figure. Anyway it's sounded great spicy chicken with grilled pablano, onions,  etc... I asked the waitress she went to the kitchen, only to come back and say it doesn't come with peppers or onions.  My response,  menu says it does. Well we're out of peppers, I can give you 10% off is that ok. No,  I didn't order a pile of chicken I'm a soggy burrito.  5 minutes late she comes back with a side of grilled onion,  peppers,  whatever else was supposed to be in the burrito.  It helps but I'm annoyed and the meat is cold at this point.  Whatever,  I have a flight to catch,  I just paid my tab (no discount), I'm done and never coming back.
