Being from Tucson, I used yelp to try and locate what is supposedly the best mexican food in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area.  I had high hopes when I arrived at this restaurant.  It is charming, and looks authentic.  Much like the restaurants down in Tucson.  The chips and salsa came out quick, and the service was great.  Chips and salsa were very good.  However, I was disappointed that you only get one serving, and then you have to pay $3 for another....something that I have never seen before.

But sadly, this is was the only positive for the restaurant.  I had a #1 and the person I was eating with had flat enchiladas.  If this is the best Phoenix has to offer, I feel bad for anyone living here.  The food lacked flavor, the green chili sauce tasted like they opened a can and poured it on top.  Beans and rice were not good at all.

The sopapillas were good, but that is not hard to mess up.

Also way overpriced for what you get. 


Do yourself a favor, and find another restaurant.  Not worth your time.
