Oh man. The real question is, why? Why Taco Bell. This is the only fast food I've never gotten sick from. Until just last night...


I Woke up in the middle of the night sweating and some sort of uncomfortable smut festering in my lower intestine. Then I knew... Taco Bell was a bad choice. After hours of what seemed like a bad super soaker commercial that was taking place in my very own bathroom. I could of swore the damage was done and I can rest. 

I was terribly mistaken once again.. With little to no more hope left in my immune system, I drove to my doctor where he then diagnosed me with "shigella". Fun fact: this specific type of bacteria is caused from a sort of physical contamination. To be more specific, human fecies. 

I recommend that the entire staff takes a workshop on how to properly wash your hands and or learn proper glove usage.


Will I return? No. Save yourself the physical anguish. Do not eat here.
