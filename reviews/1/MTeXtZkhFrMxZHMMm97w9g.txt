My husband likes to come here. Although I am not a Mexican food fan, I usually join him and order the chicken tortilla soup. Although it is still on the menu, they now say they do not serve it any more. What Mexican restaurant does not serve tortilla soup? I guess we will be finding another restaurant. Disappointed!
