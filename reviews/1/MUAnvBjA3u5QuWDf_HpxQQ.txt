It was sad ,  the server was the slow  , she so busy talking to the bartenders that she forgot us.  She finally remember us to take our order. It took 10 minutes to get our drinks and another 30 to get our food.We finally got our food. The tacos are just o.k.  nothing big at all. The salsa was blah . I just couldn't believe why they call mexican grill because it wasn't not here. I was not impress at on.
