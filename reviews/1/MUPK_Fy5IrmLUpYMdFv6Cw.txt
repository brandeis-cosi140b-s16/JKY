Had the worst experience tonight. The bean dip was cold and below room temperature it seemed. I got my soft taco with meat and cheese only , only for it to be a loaded taco. Then when we got our ticket the reduced a drink off I thought. Nope , came back and fixed the check and charged me for the drink even though niether me or my significant other at our meals. So $20 down the drain to a "local" establishment that's customer service is garbage. Won't be back again , sad that our family ordered $150 worth of food from them for our family reunion. What a waste. Wow.
Also for the drink they recharged me for , the server never refilled once. So $2.50 or whatever for a drink I couldn't even get a refill on. COME ON!
