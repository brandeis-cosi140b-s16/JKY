Last week I stopped here The fryer oil was so old the fries tasted like burnt  lighter fluid. The crunchy taco shell was so stale cardboard would have tasted fresher. If the food taste this bad I can't imagine they keep the place very clean either. They definitely never clean the fryer. Nasty.. don't use this Del Taco unless you like getting sick after you eat.
