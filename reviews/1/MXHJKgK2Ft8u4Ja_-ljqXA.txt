My husband ordered take out for us last week. I ordered the chicken burrito bowl, the chicken was very hard and chewy, the guacomole had some brown spots. It tasted disgusting, I had a few bites and threw it away. Then got very sick with food poisoning symptoms for the next  3 days. In all fairness my husband ordered a steak burrito and liked it. I normally go to the chipolte @ baseline and stapley in Gilbert, there food everytime is AMAZING AND FRESH!
