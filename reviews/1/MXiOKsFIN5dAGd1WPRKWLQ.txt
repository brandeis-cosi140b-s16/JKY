The reviews were very good so my wife and I tried this place last night. Granted it was the Friday before Christmas and it was 30 minutes before closing but we could not have been more disappointed. My wife ordered enchiladas and I had a carne asada burrito. Mine came to the table 5 minutes after my wife's and when I bit into it it was cold. I sent it back to the kitchen and 5 minutes later it was re-served cold again. Besides the temperature, the meat was very tough to cut. At that point we gave up after registering our complaint with the manager. He asked if I wanted something else but by this time I had no confidence in the kitchen. My wife's meal was fair at best. She said her food was tasteless and not very fresh. I'm afraid we won't be back. There are too many good restaurants in Scottsdale to risk another disappointment.
