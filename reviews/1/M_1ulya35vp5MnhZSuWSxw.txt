My wife likes this place because of the beans they serve with the chips but this location blew it tonight.  What was supposed to be a casual meal to cheer me up turned into a 2 hour ordeal.  The waiter forgot us..... I literally had to walk through the kitchen and fill my own drinks!  Then when he finally came back he was completely oblivious to the fact we had not gotten our food after an hour.  Kudos to him for alerting his manager but by then it was too late.  They offered me a 15% discount and a free desert which I didn't really get to enjoy because my 2 small kids had had enough of being in a restaurant for 2 hours.  

Thanks for ruining what was supposed to cheer me up. You won't see me again anytime soon.
