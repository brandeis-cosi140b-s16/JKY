I've gone to Filiberto's for awhile since there's not much to choose from out here.  Today I experienced the absolute worst customer service and am inclined to never return.  The food itself is average at best, and not overly cheap compared to other fast food Mexican.  
Anyway today I went in and order an Arizona burrito WITHOUT PICO DE GALLO.  I made this very clear by repeating the without pico de gallo several times because I extremely dislike the taste.  Sure enough they messed up my order anyways and I didn't discover this until I was home.  I figured it was a close enough drive to go back and ask for a new burrito.  The manager refused to remake my burrito without a receipt.  I can see some reasons why they wouldn't but I was there less then 10 minutes ago, they were the ones who messed up, and the worker recognized me.  From my experience in customer service I know when I mess up and a customer has to drive back because of it, I do whatever I can to fix the problem.  In a fit of rage (I was already having a bad day) I drove back and brought the burrito and receipt with me to get a refund.  They offered to remake my burrito, but at this point I just wanted my money back from this pitiful establishment.
TL;DR: Average food at average prices, poor customer service, don't order something with extras or they'll mess it up (this wasn't the first time!)
