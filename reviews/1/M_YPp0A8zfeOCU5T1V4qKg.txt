I will never visit this establishment again--due to the owner's xenophobic remarks about how caucasian women raise their children, and I am married to a hispanic! Don't think that your ugly attitude and remarks were not in earshot of your reprimanding the waitress--and all over two lousy bucks add on for tortillas! Sick. Her dropping the Fbomb and shouting at a waitress for not removing a cap of Perrier before bringing to the table was also loud and clear. I would never want my Perrier uncapped before it arrives to my table.
