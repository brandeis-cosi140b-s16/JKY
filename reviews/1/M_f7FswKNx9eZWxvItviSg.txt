Alright, granted this was airport food but this was still thoroughly mediocre.  I originally intended on exiting the airport to hit Pizzeria Bianco, but alas I chickened out because I wasn't sure I had enough time.  I settled for this after reading about the food options in this airport.  Supposedly this is an outpost of a Phoenix restaurant that is famous for their tamales.  I love tamales and don't get to have them often, so I decided to try it out.

The lady I buy tamales from next to the subway in the Bronx has better ones.  This tamale was a soggy mess due to the sauce on top of them, and it was devoid of flavor (as were the rice and beans).  The pricing also made no sense in hindsight.  A tamale is only $4 and the soda and rice/beans brings it up to $10; however if you get a burrito ($6), it's the same deal for no more food.  Basically this is a local place that is cashing in on people who are trapped in the airport.  

Bring your food or just starve.  It's better than this!
