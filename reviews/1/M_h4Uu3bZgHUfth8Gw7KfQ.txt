absolutely the pits! margaritas are tasteless and impotent. salsa and bean dip completely horrible. beef burrito pictured for you to see is missing the beef and much more: an absolute  joke. chile relleno breading is mushy and insides still cool from having being nuked. the worst experience imaginable - only reason for this nightmare joint being open is captive audience of local workers. do yourself a big favor and avoid at all costs - it does not get much worse than this: virtually inedible fare at high prices and incompetent management.
