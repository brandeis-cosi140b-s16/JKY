I don't live in Arizona anymore, but when I did I always ate a some burros in Tempe. Every now and then I would eat at the other locations. Well we came for a visit and of course we needed to stop here. The place was filthy and not cleaned up. Our Pollo Fundido did not taste as good as it normally does. And on top of that my husband, myself and a friend all got food poisoning. It was awful!!!! So whoever is preparing the meals isn't washing their hands or fully cooking the chicken. Never again!!!!
