Writing this review makes me kind of sad, because really, I enjoy On The Border. Their margaritas are huge, delicious, and cheap! Yay for happy hour! The one closest to me closed down due to health code violations (oops)! I figure the alcohol in the margaritas killed any sort of germs anyway...
Ok, back to this review. Since the one near me closed, the restaurant on Power is the closest. I've been here twice, and both experiences have sucked royally! Not the food or drinks, mind you, but the service, the hostesses, and the management. 
We called to see how late happy hour lasted--stated we understood how busy they were, but it's one simple question. Bitchy, short answer, and then they hung up on us. We go to eat anyway (because it's National Margarita Day) 45 minute wait, not including my 5 minutes of standing in front of the hostess stand without being acknowledged. Open seating in the bar you say? I took a look while waiting for friends--open table = yay! No chairs = boo. I mention this to the hostess, hoping there's a secret stash of chairs. Ignored. We talk to management about being hung up on and the snotty attitudes thus far--doesn't care! We gave our pager to someone else and left...
Will NEVER come here again.
