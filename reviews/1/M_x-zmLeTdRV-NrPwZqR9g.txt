I'm sorry, the sickness I feel in my stomach is compelling me to post. And I never post ever. This place is objectively the worst Mexican takeout in the Gilbert-Chandler area. I'm sorry, but at least you know what your getting at Taco Bell and Del Taco. I got the Burrito Supremo (with very bad chicken and much for beans) and the Steak something. The steak was tasteless and luck warm. And a weird tinge of grey. Like it had been kept warm for a week in water grey. Don't go here.
