I like custom made burrito shops, and one of these popped up near my house. I figured it would be a nice change of pace from Chipotle until I walked in the door and realized... Chipotle, with a different logo. The offerings were virtually identical, except that the quality was obviously lower, visibly lower, as in looking over the sneeze guard it seemed as though I was peering at a cheap Chinese knock-off of a successful business model. It's hard to find good fast-food guacamole, and Chipotle's is THE best fast food guac, period. What the Qdoba employee was scooping onto my burrito was an insult to good guacamole. The overall flavor was flat and not-fresh. It's no surprise that the location by my house closed, and I'm shocked that any are still in business.
