If you are going to participate in AZ Breakfast weekend,  staff accordingly.   We did not have reservations and when greeted told we should have made them and they will take walkins for a 30-40 minute wait.   Yet we look around and had open tables inside and outside and also lots of open  counter space and told those are reserved too.   When asked if we could get drinks we were told she doesn't have e enough staff.   We wait a bit to see if the wait will really take that long,  met a couple who had already waited 30min  and we're told it would be another 20-30minutes that they are calling more staff in.   They asked about the empty tables they were told that those are reserved for people with reservations.   We left.   This was a FAIL.
