I do not recommend this place.  I ordered the menudo, and was very disappointed.  It had no flavor. I added 3 slices of lemon, 1 cup of salsa, 2 small packs of salt. It then tasted a bit better.   My friend ordered camarones a la diabla.  He described the sauce as tasting like can tomatoes sauce with chile. It looked watery to me.  Horchata was good. I will not come to this restaurant again.
