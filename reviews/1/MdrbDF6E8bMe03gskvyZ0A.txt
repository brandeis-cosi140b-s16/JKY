My boyfriend and I grew up on Serrano's living in Tempe. It had been years since we have been so we figured we would stop in for happy hour. I cant believe how badly this place has gone down hill! Though there was only a few tables of people in the whole place, we decided to sit at the bar in hopes of faster service. Upon sitting down there was dirty dishes left on the bar that looked like they had been there awhile. The buser quickly came over and cleaned up and brought us chips and dips (he was probably the most attentive person in this place). We had to flag the bar tender down to get drinks (mind you there was only 2 other people at the bar). The drinks were horrible. No Tabasco on hand for a bloody Mary and no oranges for the blue moon they have on tap... really you have Blue Moon on tap and no oranges? I had to ask the bartender 3 times for a water, the last time she said "ya sure", then walked in back for 5 minutes... The fourth time my boyfriend finally asked her for my water and had her remake me something to drink as the bloody Mary was unbearable. We then had to ask for menus, and also had to ask her to take our order.... I mean what is your job if I as the customer am doing all the work??!!! The manager brought our plate out, it was cold. The food was mediocre at best... what a disappointment especially for the price. My boyfriend asked the bartender for silverware which she said "oh yeah sure" then walked off and did something else. I told him not to even remind her and see if she will ever bring it. Nope we ended up sharing silverware. We spoke with the manager when we left about how poor the service was, he didn't seem to care much just staring at us with a blank expression. So that is if for us we will not be back! So sad that we use to love this place and it has gone down the drain so much!
