I am a huge fan of the Chipotle brand and food. This negative review is for the service I received this afternoon at this location.

Earliest pickup time available when we submitted our online order was 1:15pm. We arrived 15 minutes early, was told that our order was not ready and would be about 10 minutes. We tried to pay when there wasn't a line of customers and were told that we could not pay until our order was fulfilled. The girl in charge of the pickup orders came out and told us it would be another 10 minutes. She came out with our order at 1:15pm on the dot, and told us in an exasperated tone to call next time if we would be arriving early. Her attitude was terrible, as if we were a HUGE inconvenience and had rushed her (which, obviously, we hadn't since our order came out right on time...). A simple, "Sorry for the wait, I was backed up on other orders and couldn't get this out earlier for you" would've sufficed. 

What's even BETTER is that when we mentioned pick-up-girl's attitude, the manager followed up with the same answer, "next time call ahead if you'll be arriving early" without so much as a hint of apology. Clearly WE were in the wrong here. It was definitely a missed opportunity on the manager's part to turn the situation around and save our experience from being so disappointing. Coming from a background in retail and fast food, I was baffled by their self-righteous, unapologetic attitudes.

I also didn't understand why 1. the manager was working in the fulfillment line the whole time and 2. there were periods of time when there were no customers to help - whey didn't someone (like, ahem, the manager) go and help the girl filling pickup orders?

I've never had a bad experience at Chipotle before today, and will definitely never come back to this location.
