Based on the high reviews decided to come here.. First of all, I'm pregnant I was craving for a mojarra Frita (fried tilapia) with an agua fresca de pi√±a.(pineapple drink) When it was time to order Guess what..?? She came by to ask what we wanted for drinks I asked for an agua fresca and she said we are all out... So I ordered a jarrito (which she said we only have mandarin). Waiting for the rest of my family to decide what they wanted to eat then the lady came back to ask us what we wanted to eat I ordered my mojarra, my husband a fried shrimp plate and my daughter a kids meal., you won't believe it.. 5 minutes later she comes back and tells me they are out of mojarras, I said "WHAT" both of my craving just got crushed!!! Never again coming here!!! Because I was super hungry I just order another thing.. I almost wanted to cry!!! I ordered what was closest to a mojarra. A fried red snapper..wow it was too salty that I could not eat it.. There goes my night.., way to go!! Still hungry and between what I told you guys what we ordered it was $47..
