Hey! Anybody who liked the art in this restaurant should let the REAL artists know! Manuel Gilavalos y Garcia and Ricardo Ramirez are LIARS and THIEVES, and those with actual talent are getting ripped off.

The owners and managers of this restaurant really need to do some research before giving money to supposed "artists" for their work. Countless news articles have now been written praising those thieves. The idea is deplorable.

Anybody who gives two craps about doing the right thing needs to show support for the artists who have had their work stolen and then displayed with credit given to another.
