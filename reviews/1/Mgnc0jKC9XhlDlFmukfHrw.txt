If I could give this place .25 star that would be too much!! The food was HORRIBLE, the service was HORRIBLE, the management was HORRIBLE! I ordered the deluxe tostada, it came with a soggy, NOT crispy, tostada shell, the meat was chewy and the flavoring was disgusting! When we gave it back to the manager he said he would get it taken care of...30 minutes later...I still had no meal! We finally left!! It was an awful experience! The people next to us even we're talking about how bad the food and service were! Beware!!!!
