Some people must have different taste buds ,I have been here about 5 times over a span of 6years , never once have I enjoyed it ,
Every time I say oh let's give it a try and I regret it I've tried enchiladas burritos tacos crane asada this is no where near the real thing , the last time I think there was lettuce in the guacamole maybe by accident but it made me sick
