Had to ask the lady mending the register to wash her hands since she had just finished counting change and decided she would just put some gloves on without washing first. 
The owner and manager need to teach their employees proper hand washing techniques. 
This is why people get sick and get food poisoning. 
After I asked her politely to was her hands, another employee came in and they started talking bad about me in Spanish, I speak Spanish and people need to learn to not make assumptions since most think I'm not Hispanic. 
Very disappointed at the quality of customer service, I love the food and I came to this location since I was visiting a friend but I live very far from it and have only been to the location in Henderson. 
I work with the public on a daily bases and we have to make sure hand washing is done prior to wearing gloves before working on someone, but it seems that in a food place that is not being followed as it should. 
This place needs to have the health department come show them the proper way.
