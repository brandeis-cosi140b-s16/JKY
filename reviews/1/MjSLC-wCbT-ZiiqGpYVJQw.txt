Had high hopes for a good close by Mexican food restaurant but this one failed. The chips and salsa were great but when it took forever for our food to arrive, our server said some of our food went to the table next to us because that server was faster! The food wasn't that great even after the wait and there was no offer to make our experience better either. Never again!
