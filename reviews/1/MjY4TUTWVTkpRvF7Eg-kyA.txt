My husband and I came to downtown for our 1 year anniversary. Id heard great things about this place and told my husband I wanted to try it. We came in today around 2 in the afternoon, it wasn't too busy and we sat at the bar. I don't know the bartenders name but she was a young woman with red hair passed by us multiple times not taking our order. One time to ask for ids then walked away. A few times after that finally asked what we wanted and when my husband ordered a dos Equis she said sorry it's frozen and walked away. Another 5-10 min passed by and she didn't come back to us until we started walking out of the restaurant pretty annoyed that we had been there for 25 min and didn't even get a drink order in. The service is terrible. I can't comment on the food or drinks due to the fact we never got to order anything.
