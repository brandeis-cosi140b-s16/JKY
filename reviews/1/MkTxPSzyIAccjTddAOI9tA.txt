The food was average and the service was terrible. The app came after the entr√©e, really??? Was at a difference location on Wednesday and had a great time, never coming back to this location again.                 

Not to mention, it was my birthday and jokingly I asked what's a good bday shot and he looked at me like I was an idiot! I went to the bathroom and my friends asked if I could get something for my birthday he replied "Are you looking for a freebie?" Well he obviously did not check my ID clearly since it was my birthday.

Well thanks Jay that was a great birthday experience!!

Mate you're not much!
