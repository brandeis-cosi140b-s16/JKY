This place used to have pretty good food until recently that new management came in and changed the menu ( according to the waitress) Now, the food is terrible. Went for breakfast and had the menudo. I am Hispanic and let me tell you this was unlike any menudo we had ever had just horrible. I think canned menu would have put this menudo to shame ( seriously, that bad) the waitress asked if we wanted white or red so I ordered the red. Well, when the food came it was white menudo with chilli powder sprinkled on top. I didn't even touch it. The waitress noticed my disgusted face when she placed the plate in front of me and apologized, that's when she explained the change in management and menu. ( the recipes come from the new white manger she explained in a whisper) She also noticed we did not touch our food because of our dislike for it but even then she did not offer to replace our meal or discount it from our tab. Needless to say, they have lost a long time customer and based on other reviews, they have lost many since this change for the worst took place.
