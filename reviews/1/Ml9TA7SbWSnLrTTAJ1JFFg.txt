Q: What can I say that would make someone who loves Mexican food want to try this place? 

A: "Nada" as they say in Spanish. 

And thats what you get here in the way of great Mexican food. Nothing. As a third generation "semi-native" of Arizona and part Mexican myself, I can say without reservation that the food here is plentiful for all the big eaters out  there but as far as authentic or even flavorful, I would not waste my time. The Taco shells are similar to store bought Ortegas and the beans are no better than canned. All entrees are served in the traditional "Americanized" idea of a Mexican meal. That is to say that everything on the plate runs together and looks like somebody got sick on your plate.

Sorry. The only thing that was good here was the wait staff. Very attentive and gracious. One of the things I look for in a Mexican restaurant that gives me a pretty good idea that the food is decent is by how many actual Mexicans are eating there. Shallow perhaps but this place is to authentic Mexican food what Rawhide is to the "true old west".
