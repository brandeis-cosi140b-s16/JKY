FAIL!!
This Filibertos openend recently in place of Church's chicken. They still seem to be having problems with the chef as I walked in on the conversation where the teller was explaining to the cook how to make the chicken. Not a good sign at all. I decided to get the green chile as I typically do, it came out in less than 2 mins (not a good sign at all).
 Wow the chef had just gone to task with adding salt and making the chicken mushy. 

Royal fail .. Avoid like a plague.. I know its a filibertos but atleast get the franchise recipe down. Now as to the freshness of the product.. well that is something I never question at a Filibertos
