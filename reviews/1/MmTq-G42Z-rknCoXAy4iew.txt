Can't believe the positive reviews! This place was awful. Bland watery chicken, salsa had no flavor, even the mango salsa. It just tasted like pieces of mango. The staff was neither here nor there. They seemed a little tired actually. I found it funny that the menu had descriptions but they ask you what you want as they make it. Don't waste your time here, go to Chipotle, Baja Loco, heck even Rubios. Seriously don't bother unless you like to eat soggy cardboard.
