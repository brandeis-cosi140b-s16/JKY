By far the worst Mexican food I've ever had. It only gets the 2nd star because the service was decent probably due to being one of three people in here. The salsa had no flavor and looked like vomit. Tried to doctor it with their hot sauce to no avail. Chicken enchilada tasted like bumblebee tuna drenched in ranchero sauce that tasted like tomato soup with a touch of hot sauce. Steak burrito had no flavor and was the size of a taco. Rice and beans are the same the burrito...no flavor! As I received the bill an ant crawled across the table!  Awful place! Awful experience!
