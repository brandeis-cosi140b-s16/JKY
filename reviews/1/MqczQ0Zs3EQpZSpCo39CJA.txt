Worst dining experience in the area. Our group of 5 ate here on a Sunday evening expecting a great meal and service. We were put at a corner table for 4, after waiting longer than we'd been told. The noise was so bad we could not converse, the server was rude and the food  ok- nothing exceptional..... None of us will be back.
