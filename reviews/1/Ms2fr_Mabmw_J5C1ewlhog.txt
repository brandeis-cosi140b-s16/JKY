Used to like this place, but it's gone downhill in both service and quality. Waitress explained menu prices weren't accurate, but $2-$3 higher and that they didn't have their new menus in yet. Normally that wouldn't be a problem except for the already overpriced arroz con pollo went from $11.99 to $13.99, not to mention there was hardly any pollo in the dish. Wife's chicken fajitas were the same deal, overpriced without much meat. They bill themselves as upscale, nothing upscale about the joint.
