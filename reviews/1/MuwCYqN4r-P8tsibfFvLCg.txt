YIKES! I really don't even know where to start with this place. I was so utterly upset after dining here that I honestly can't stop thinking about it, lol! It was just such a disappointment! I am very easy to please and rarely complain but goddamn I HATED this place. First of all, the atmosphere looks really cute until you get all the way in, lol! The chairs suck ass. lawn chairs!? REALLY?! The bathroom is not properly marked and I walked in the mens bathroom only to find urinals so obviously I was in the wrong one!  They serve you water in a mason jar and offered no straw until I asked for one. I am not picky about sink water at all but their water tasted like it came straight from the toilet. Their menu is not descriptive at all which makes it really hard to figure out what you are ordering. The prices are just plain ridiculous! I am not cheap when it comes to food but they are really crazy trying to sell their version of mexican food that is not worth the money at all. They told us that the tacos has cabbage and all this other stuff on them but then when we got our food, their was nothing but chicken. Half of us had green sauce on our tacos and the other half did not. We all ordered the same thing with no special request and yet we all received different things. And somebody please tell me who the hell told them that their rice is even worthy of serving to people!!!??? My god, that waS THE WORST rice ever!!! UGGHH I am just so upset that I did not like this place! I had such high hopes and was looking forward to finding a diamond in the rough! NOT! On a positive note, the servers were very nice and the margaritas were yummy! Other than that, HELL NO, NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!
