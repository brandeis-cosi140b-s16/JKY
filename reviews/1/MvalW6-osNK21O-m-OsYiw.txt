Hard to review anything other than their "reservations" on Open Table. After reserving a table for 4 we arrived at our scheduled time only to be told by the hostess, "we don't do reservations, that's really more of an illusion of a reservation. It's kind of like call ahead."  We waited 40 minutes and then left. Unprofessional and really poor management.
