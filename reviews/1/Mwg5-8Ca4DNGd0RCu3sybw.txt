I usually hold my tongue when i notice certain incidents but i have been noticing this one happen too often now. This location use to be my favorite place because of the atmosphere and now i have been noticing the employees being treated like poop by this certain employee or manager and especially when i feel like im not wanted and feel like im being intimidated. I was able to ask one the employees for the name of this person and her name is teiley or taileigh i think. She is rude and whatever position she is in she should be demoted , all the times ive seen her i notice her fake smile and rolling eyes whenever she turns around. Its too good of a location to have a certain person like that helping to run it. I dont feel welcomed when shes there. Good place food food but theres always a rotten apple
