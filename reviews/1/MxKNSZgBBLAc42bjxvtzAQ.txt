I have eaten at a multitude of hole-in-the wall taquerias in CA and AZ.  I prefer them to chains as a rule.  I have NEVER had anyone tell me the tacos i ordered are the same thing as the flautas i was served.  Tacos are open faced.  Flautas are rolled.  I didnt want flautas, i wanted tacos.  Wont be back!!!
