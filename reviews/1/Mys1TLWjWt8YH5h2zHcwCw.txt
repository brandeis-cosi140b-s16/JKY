Filibertos has always been bad but this location is the worst of all. Their service is unfriendly and their food SUCKS.

I have eaten there twice. The first time I ordered a chili relleno combo. The chili relleno was cold. The beans and rice were flavorless.

The second time my husband picked up a couple breakfast burritos. Mine was supposed to be an egg and cheese, no meat. It was loaded with their disgusting pico de gallo (mostly onions) and had bits of meat in it. So frustrating. 

Filibertos is bad and they know it. But they will never close down because of the drunk asses that crave bad Mexican food in the middle of the night.

Filibertos is one of those few places in Arizona that give Mexican food a bad name. Shame.
