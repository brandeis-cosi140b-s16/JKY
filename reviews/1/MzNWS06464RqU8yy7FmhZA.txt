Went in for lunch today and walked out after waiting 20 mins for a server to come to our table.  No one came by, no water, no one to take our order, nothing!  Servers were either all yacking behind the counter or all 3 of them waiting on 1 table. 

Everyone should skip this place and go to New Mexican Grill instead.
