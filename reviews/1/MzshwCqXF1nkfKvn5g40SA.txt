Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me fifteen times...why do I bother?

Project team wanted lunch from Chipotle, so I obliged and ordered online (which was actually quite convenient and very intuitive). 

Went to pick up the food (dodged the long line thanks to ordering online), and it wasn't quite ready. No biggie.

Took the orders back to the office, opened the various bowls and wraps, and... blah.

I thought I had "fixed" my woes of skimpy portions by ordering (and paying extra for) double barbacoa on my salad. What I received was about 2-3 ounces of barbacoa (and I measure nearly everything I eat, so I am familiar with portion sizes), maybe 1/4 cup of black beans, maybe 1 cup of lettuce, a huge ladle of salsa, and - seriously - 4 thin slices of bell pepper and 2 slices of onion (the fajita veggies).

$9 for that? Ugh. Seriously - no more Chipotle for me. One person on my team accused me of eating part of his salad - he said it was "quite light."

I'm not looking for monster portions by any means. But when you find more lettuce on a Subway sub than you do in a salad from Chipotle, something's amiss.
