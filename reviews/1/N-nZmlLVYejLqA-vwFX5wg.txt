This is by far the worst Mexican food I have ever had. Took the family my wife had the combo with a cheese enchilada and a cheese tamal.  The red sauce is nothing but pure chili powder watered down.. Terrible. 
 I had the Carnitas Uruapan. Should have asked for a plate of pork jerky because that is what it was.. 
  My son was the only smart one that did not order anything. 

   I have had my share of "Authentic" Mexican food and this is not even close to authentic. 

   To top off the night I ordered two of the $3.00 draft beers and was charged $7.98..
