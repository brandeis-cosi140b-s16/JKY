If you consider going to this place through the drive-thru , make sure that you open up every item and look in it thoroughly.  I stopped by per a request and order some carne asada fries , no pico, no sour cream , guacamole on the side. Well I get home and what do I get ??? Extra sour cream no guacamole !!! OK so what right????....well this was the peak of the iceberg.  The time before that I again stopped at this location and bought a shrimp cocktail.  Came home and what do I find....only 4 shrimps in my so called shrimp cocktail!!!! I called the manager right away and apologized for my frustration and told her that this was just simply not acceptable service. She said that if I had my receipt and brought in the item back then they will be able to replace it. I explained to her that the reason why I went to the drive thru was to come home , and how it would be an inconvenience to me. Her answer , well there's nothing for us to do then. Really???? Not an apology, no I will take care of this for you....NOTHING! !! Way to show your customer service. A truly waste of time. Never again.
