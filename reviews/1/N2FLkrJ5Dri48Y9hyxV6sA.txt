AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS!!!! The Owner is an Animal. As I was outside the umbrella came flying out of the table and hit my car and almost hit my wife. The "owner" could not have been less remorseful. I told him that it was a safety hazard and he replied; "What do you want me to do about it?" I then shook my head and told him he was an idiot, at that point he tried to start a fistfight with me. This guy is out of his mind and should most likely be in prison!
