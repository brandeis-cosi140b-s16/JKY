Wow. What a disappointment. I've been to the North Mesa restaurant and expected the same from here. NOPE. I noticed another reader commented on how it doesn't even smell like there is Mexican food cooking here.It didn't. We just walked in and realized you didn't get to sit down and get waited on. You went up and ordered as if you were at a fast food restaurant.We had just barely walked in the door and 3 people behind the counter asked if we were ready to order. There were 5 more people around them. This would explain why many tables had dirty food on them. I ordered a mole enchilada and a fish taco. Do you think they could have put them on the same plate? No. The mole was good, but pricey. The fish taco was good, and pricey as well. You have to pay for chips and salsa and they give you salsa in little cups. I asked for the hot and it was not hot and very vinegary. This is a do not return for me.
