Me and my girlfriend walked into this place after Mary Anns diner was full from Unofficial weekend. The chips where not bad, but when i took the first bite after dipping it in the salsa my perception of this place completely changed. The salsa tasted like it was from a can. 

The service was not bad but i think the waiter suspected we were not enjoying our meal. Everything tasted like it was microwaved and on top of that the food was already bad. If i wanted beef tacos, tomato sauce enchiladas, and flavorless rice I would have gone down the street and ate at taco bell for half the price. 

To sum things up, if you want authentic Mexican food, DO NOT GO HERE!
