I read the reviews and honestly after eating at Serrano's, I would never go back!!

Terrible food and a pushy waiter!  My wife and I went in on Halloween.  We ordered a house margarita at $5.00 each/Happy Hour pricing.  Not good at all and had a funny taste.  The waiter Bruno kept coming back every 5 minutes to take our order.  There were only about 10 couples in this huge restaurant so I didn't understand the big push.    I asked Bruno to give us a while.  We just wanted to relax but it didn't matter.  He just kept coming back and coming back.  We finally went ahead and ordered.

I had the seasoned Chimichanga and my wife had the shredded chicken Chimi.  Mine had no seasoning at all.  They came with sour cream, guacamole, rice and beans.  The rice was old and hard.  The Chimi's were over cooked.

I travel every other week and eat out all over the country.  I also am a very good cook.  I would rather go and buy a frozen Mexican TV dinner than go back to Serrano's!
