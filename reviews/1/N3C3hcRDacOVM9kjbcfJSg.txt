Really disappointing when you go to a place 20 min before they close and they are conveniently out of everything. 4 people walked out in the 30 seconds I was there. .. assuming they just didn't feel like cooking anymore.  If you aren't going to be fully functional up until you close,  then close early.  Or offer a discount.
