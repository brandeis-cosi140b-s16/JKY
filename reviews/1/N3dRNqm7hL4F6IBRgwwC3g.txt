This place has a "dress code" which I noticed only applies to people of color. I was turned away at the door on a slow night and I saw 2 white men dressed the same as me: t-shirt, sneakers, and a jacket. All my clothes are in great condition. Glad I didn't have an opportunity to waste my money here.
