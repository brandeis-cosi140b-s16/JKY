I was very disappointed in the service my friends and I received tonight. We waited over an hour to be seated and although the restaurant was steady, I didn't understand the reason for the wait. Once we were finally able to order, the food took another 45 minutes to come out and was delivered by someone who seemed to have no knowledge of the menu and what items were supposed to be on each plate.  The food was actually really good but not at all worth the wait, not to mention the 3 out of 7 people who had to send their food back for various reasons. 
I wouldn't waste the time or money trying this place.
