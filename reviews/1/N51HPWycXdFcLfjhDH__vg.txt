Tried this spot on a recommendation from a friend.  His words "dumpy building, but great food".  Oh he was right about the building!  But the food was horrible.  Let me define horrible in my terms- wouldn't feed it to a dog.  The beef taco was so dry even drenching it with their mediocre salsa didn't help.  Save your money, T Bell is an upgrade compared to this joint.
