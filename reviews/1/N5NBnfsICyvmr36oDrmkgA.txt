I used to LOVE eating here and ordering take-out. Today, I called to order breakfast for take-out for my family. The person that answered hung up on me so I wasn't sure if she took my order. I called back and the person that answered, told me to call back later. Sadly, the customer service has declined. When we stop in to eat, there are always open tables, but not enough servers. The prices keep increasing. Honestly, the food is what makes this place great. If we can't even get that, why be open?
