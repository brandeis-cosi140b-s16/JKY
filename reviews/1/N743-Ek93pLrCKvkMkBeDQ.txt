only got one star because I can't give it none.  

Ordered Huevos Rancheros, after waiting 20 minutes for our order, it came, with what I believe would, be dripping with grease had it been hot/warm.  But it was cold...both orders had congealed verde/tomatillo sauce.  Though we were quite hungry, we left with nothing touched.  There was nothing good about Some Burros, save your money and head to Del Taco, Taco Bell or any other Americanized Mexican establishment.
