Stumbled in due to its close proximity from the Tavern.  I ordered chips with nacho cheese and a bean burrito.  The cheese was really watery but I stuck to those instead of my bean burrito since it was FILLED with beans that tasted like they were from a can and were so thick and pasty.  I flagged down a server and asked for a glass of water in exchange so my throat would be cleared out from the beans!  The manager came over to let me know he took it off my bill and that he "tries to steer his customers AWAY from the beans"........... well- why don't you just STOP serving them??? tsk... tsk..... tsk.... I would have preferred Taco Bell instead!!
