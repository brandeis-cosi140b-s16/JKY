Just left... Remodeled the place but did not have staff to accommodate all the people..... Waited from 8:16 until closing 9pm and our food wasn't ready... There were maybe 20 people in the place when it fits like 45. So it was half full.... Would never return! Left and asked for $$$ back. Terrible service! If you value your time save your time and go to Del taco
