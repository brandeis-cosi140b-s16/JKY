customer service  - okay
presentation  - poor
atmosphere  - okay
taste  - poor

We spent around 28.00 for 2 people and got the same amount of food as you would get at a Chipotle for maybe 14.00 thing is not so much the same as the fact that neither me or my boyfriend where happy with our food. I LOVE LOVE LOVE tamales...these where not very good and they are pretty small. I got the green chili and cheese one and the desert one a la mode... they forgot my ice cream. My green chili tamale had a cream sauce with a strange texture to it- sort of jelly like. The taste was not much better.

Over all I really wasn't too happy with this place. Sorry folks.... I know it looks good- cute little sign and sounds simple enough yummy tamales but in my opinion not so great!!
