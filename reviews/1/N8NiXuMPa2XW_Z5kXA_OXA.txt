Went here with my wife hoping for a nice cool treat, I got the Diablito wich has chamoy, chili, tamarind and lime, my wife got the strawberry and cream. These were absolutely the worst tasting things we have ever tried. Mine was bitter and sour and not at all appetizing. My wife's strawberry and cream tasted rancid like either the cream went bad or the strawberry a did. We had to throw then away after just a few bites, an unfortunate waste of money.
