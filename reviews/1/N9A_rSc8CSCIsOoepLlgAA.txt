We stopped for dinner the other night - I had some qualms due to the exceptionally loud music. The hostess promptly seated us and said somebody would be right with us. That was the last employee we saw. During the next 15 minutes that we waited, I determined that they must be saving money on their electricity bill by keeping the lights turned off. Seriously, we could barely read the menu due to the very dim lighting. 

I nearly fell out of my chair when I saw that a cheese quesadilla was $14 and a bean and cheese burrito was $13. I was beginning to worry I was going to need to take out a loan to pay our bill.

I didn't need to worry though, because after waiting 15 minutes for somebody (anybody? Hello?) to come to our table, we gave up and went elsewhere. I guess a Tuesday night at 8PM wasn't a good time to try them out.
