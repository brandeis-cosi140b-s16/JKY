About once a year I say to myself, I like Serranos, but I wish there was one closer to my apartment.  Then the memories that I have sealed return, saying Hey, what about the terrible one on Val Vista and Guadelupe roads?  It's the same local chain, surely all your previous visits were aberrations, and it will rebound to approach the quality at the other locations.

No.

Chips and bean dip are consistently room temperature or cooler, service is generally inattentive.  Enchiladas tasted microwaved.  Water glasses and plates were dirty.  Albondigas watery.  30 minutes to get check.  I just don't understand how this location is so much worse than the rest.  Hope betrayed too many times, just pack it up at this location.  Shut it down!
