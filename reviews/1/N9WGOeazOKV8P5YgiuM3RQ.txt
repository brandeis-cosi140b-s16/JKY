It had been a long time since I had eaten at a Garcia's and I was kind of looking forward to it.  Last one I actually ate at is now a Popo's.  I think I'll go to Popo's.  If the rudest hostess in all of Phoenix doesn't put you off the lack of air conditioning certainly will.  I'll be happy to see all the Garcia's close again.  And to the rude hostess, I hope you lose your job.
