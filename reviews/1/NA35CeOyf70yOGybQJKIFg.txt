Can't think of much good to say about this place.  Don't go for food, and not sure I would recommend the bar either.  There was a smell of rancid trash that would waft out of the kitchen occasionally and the service was poor.  

Unless you are a teenager or a college student that just wants to get drunk, avoid this place like the plague.
