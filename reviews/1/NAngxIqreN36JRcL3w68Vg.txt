First I want to say the food is Great! The pricing is reasonable but the service was horrible. I asked for a high chair, waitress never brought it. They ran out of orchata, didn't offer to make more. The drinks they served us and everyone else were Styrofoam. Not one time did our waitress come by to ask how everything was, she just walked bye with this blank look on her face. I even had to get my own refill. I will never go back there again.
