My friends and I (a party of about 9) went for dinner last night and experienced a few things.

* There's very limited parking. The parking they do have is unlit and in a bad area of town. Definitely thought my car was going to get broken into because I had to park in a dark alley.

* Waitstaff is more than a little pushy. Especially the guy that walks around trying to sell you an overpriced photo he took of your party. Not hospitable at all.

* Portions were generous, but the food was mediocre. Our waiter even said that Lindo Michoacan had better food.

* 3 of the members of my party wanted more sauce to put on their burritos and tamales. The server brought out 3 portions of green sauce, but failed to inform us that sides of sauce were $3 EACH. When I saw an extra $9 added to our bill, I politely asked if they could remove the charge. I was told that wasn't possible so politely asked to talk to a manager. She also told us that it wasn't possible to take the charge off, even though we weren't notified when we ordered. 

For putting the business ahead of their customer, Casa Don Juan has lost a customer.
