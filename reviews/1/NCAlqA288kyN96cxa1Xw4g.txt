Nice decor, friendly staff, the food won't make you sick, but...the chef must be from Indiana with her recipe testing staff from Iowa. Bland beyond belief. My Chile Rellano sauce tasted like chicken stock with corn starch, that's it! Hot sauce was mild, OK the chips were good. Go somewhere else if you want Mexican food. Filiberto's has much better Mexican, but not the atmosphere.
