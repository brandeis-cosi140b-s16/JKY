We had dinner last night at CR, my daughters wanted cheese quesadillas and they still charge $8, dinner for all of us was $35. I will say that the food was good, but not at the price and style(this is a sit down price) As we left it reinforced how great Chipotle is. I hope not to return. Do yourself a favor and drive somewhere else.
