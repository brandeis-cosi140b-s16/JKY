I've had two bad experiences here. Most recently we went and two tables who were seated after us were waited on and served first. My husband had to go to the bar to get someone finally. I didn't get what I ordered and when I asked our waitress said they had run out. Oh, so I guess I wasn't suppose to notice when they served me spicy rice instead of garlic potatoes..Really?! Pinto beans were not good and spicy enough that my child cried when he ate them. Never going here again. There are so many great food options in Madison, I don't know how this place stays open.
