This used to be my favorite restaurant in Vegas. However, let me tell you, this was when Hecho En Vegas was called Diego. I went to dinner here with my family and noticed the name change, but assumed the food was the same...WRONG. First off, we had to stand around and wait over 45 minutes to be seated. I know Saturdays must be busy, but the wait was way too long for the quality of the food. When we were finally seated, our order was taken after a while and it took them forever to bring us our food. I mean, another hour or so. By the time they brought us guacamole, we were done with the chips and were starving. The food arrived and it was very small portions for the most part, compared to how it used to be. The enchiladas were my favorite when they were Diego's. That's the reason I came back as well as for the service. Needless to say, the change was for the worst. Everything was different and didn't compare to how it used to be. The service was nothing special and was super slow. I was extremely disappointed in the change. By the end of the night we were all just ready to leave and waited another 30 minutes to get the check so we could leave. We were there for about 3 hours and most of that time was spent waiting. None of us were happy about the change. I will not be returning. Bring Diego's back!!!
