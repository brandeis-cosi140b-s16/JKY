I came here very exited to try the food after work.  I walked in and I was pointed to a table to sit at my w young nice guy.  I sat where I thought I was asked to sit.  Once I sat down I was rudely moved to another table by an older guy.  The guy said "the guy asked you to sit at that other table", but said it with such a quick and nasty attitude.  I said sorry and moved to the other table.  At that point I really felt embarrassed and upset and felt like leaving.  I decided to stay anyways and try the food.  I ordered the bulgogi fries.  They were not what I expected.  The fries were soo soggy and the meat mushy.  I got the 1/2 order and I'm glad I did not order the full size because after eating 1/4 of this I started to feel nauseous.  I had ordered an order of the bulgogi rice to go.  My husband tried this and didn't like it.  He said it left a weird after taste and feeling in his tongue.  I hadn't even told him about the fries.  I will never go here again.  I don't know what everyone goes so crazy about and why the reviews are soo high for this place.  Nasty nasty and terrible service!!!!!
