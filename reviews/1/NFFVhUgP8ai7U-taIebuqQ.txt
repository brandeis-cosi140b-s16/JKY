I have to be honest that this is the first review I've ever given less than than 4 stars. 
and after this update a few weeks later I don't think it deserves 2.

After giving this review I sent my picture of the torta to corporate office along with the yelp link and to date 07/10/13. I have received no input or return email.

I digress  on to the review which is indeed my judgment.

I did not wait long nor did I have any issues with my order. .however I was taken off guard by what i thought would be a 7.00 sandwich.  The al pastor torta was very disappointing.. it did not even appear to be shaved meat that is evidently the meat on the gyro looking roaster. however I did not watch them cut the meat.

The meat I received on my sandwich was about 4oz of nothing that resembled anything edible for human consumption as being shaved meat but in fact looked like dog food paste... I'm sorry took be criticle but it was exactly like that.

Little to no lettuce and i can't even remember what else was even suppose to be on it I was still upset I do not see any pinapple and as for guacamole? well maybe it was but it may have been mixed with 3 parts sour cream one part gauc

.. literally less than 4 oz of meat that appeared to be put through a blender. .. what gives?  A flattened bun which was the only appetizing part. A radish cut in half and a slice cuke doesn't make up for a really bad sandwich...

I should have complained but as any one can tell you the last thing you ever want to do is complain about the food to a restaurant. .. probably don't have to tell you why right at least , i hope. I took a picture of it but Don't think i can upload to here
