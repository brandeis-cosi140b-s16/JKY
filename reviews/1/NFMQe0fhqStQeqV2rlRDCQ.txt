Well shame on me, I thought my soft taco would look like the one on coupon ad. It showed this definitive picture of bulging cheese, eggs, salsa, and the taco dwarfed by the size of the food spilling out of the end. Hoo Ahh, I could cut off the first three inches of the taco and not touch the filling and then it was only a half inch high and two inches long. It was just a glop of egg, cheese, and the salsa was one spatter of red stuff. The "hash browns were just old greasy flavored tatter tots. How could anyone possibly serve this stuff with a straight face? I emailed the company and they sluffed it off on the store manager. She called me and I told her the story and her answer was; well everyone advertises this way, but admitted that it was a little deceptive. Duh yuh think? She said come on in and I will buy you a breakfast to get your business back. Do me a favor and hold your breath. . . . .Check out my picture above.
