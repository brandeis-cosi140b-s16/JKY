I'm reading these great reviews and wondering if I'm crazy or are all the other reviewers?  I hated this dumpy little place...not that I haven't found 5 star fabulous places, but I found the food great at those 5 star dumpy little places, too. I didn't find that at Rito's.
OK, so I take a friend after bragging that I Yelped the place and the reviews were great--and--as per her request--they had beer.  I knew that, because I looked at their menu shown on the internet.
#1.  Not the same menu AT ALL.  You have a very, very small menu at this place.  They show the fancy, long menu--with beer on it--from the other location instead of the handwritten 6-7 item on paper you order from here.  Not fair at all!
#2.  No beer at all here.
#3.  Ordered a burrito which was filled with some chunks of meat and oodles and oodles of green chili sauce, so essentially you are eating a tortilla with lots of green chili sauce.  Ick.
#4.  I must not be a New Mexico burrito kind of girl, cause the green chili sauce was just too darn hot for me.  Not my thang one bit.
My friend got the enchilada which looked passable.  I was so disappointed in Rito's that I didn't even ask if it was ok.
So, dear Yelpers, as you rave about this place, I give it a one star.
HUGE disappointment.....your discerning taste, Yelpers, has let me down this time.
