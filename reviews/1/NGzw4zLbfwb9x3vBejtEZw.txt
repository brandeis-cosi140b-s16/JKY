I ordered through Eat 24, spent over $60.  We ordered Hummus w/ Meat, Carne Asada Fries, Chicken Fingers, a Chicken Burrito, piece of Kiss Cake and piece of Russian Cake.  It took 90 minutes, the food was ALL cold and flavorless, what little we ate of it.  They didn't send any bread with the hummus and the driver said the kitchen was closed and there was nothing he could do to help, so we didnt' open the hummus immediately.  Well, when we did open the hummus, it was ROTTEN.  The meat had mold growing on it, it smelled rotten, it made my nephew vomit from the smell of it.  I wouldn't let anyone eat another bite of the prepared food for fear of food posioning.  I did think it would be safe to try the cakes, but the Kiss cake was freezer burned, so I didn't even try the other cake.  I contacted Eat24 and sent them the photos of the hummus and we were given a full refund.  Its just shameful to send something out that you know is rotten....the smell alone was so strong that there is no way they didn't know it was bad.
