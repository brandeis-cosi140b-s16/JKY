If I could give this place a negative star I would, what a sad place, first they messed up the order and left out item, when I called they wanted me to drive back there but it was late and I said I would stop by tomorrow, when I did stop by they want to give me food, but the food I had the night before was so bad that I didn't want the just refund the money for the missing item, there response was you should have came back yesterday, that was never stated when I spoke to the lady on the phone, when I asked for the manager she said that he wasn't here, check back later, the place even though it located in a Farley new building was dirty and the employees unicorns was cover in the days of sweat and food, a breeding ground for germs, I have never been treated like that by any company, don't worry folks if they keep that kind of customer service going they won't be around long,
