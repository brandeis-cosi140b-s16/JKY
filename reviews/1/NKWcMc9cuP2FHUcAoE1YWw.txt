Stopped in with friends  last night for a late night meal after bowling.  It wasn't very busy, we were seated right away.  Horrible services, the waiter couldn't seem to get our order right, long wait for our drinks ( 2 beers, 2 ice teas) brought us the wrong food and left most if the skin on the avocados for our table side guacamole. Then the manager came by our table to say that we could put our bowling bags next to the table,  We would have to move then across the room. She stood next the table waving her hands and tapping her foot while embarrassing us in front of the other customers. So rude and unprofessional.  Not a good dinning  experience due to the staff... not really even worth 1 star.
