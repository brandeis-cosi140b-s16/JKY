I have been to this restaurant a few times.  Every time we were there because we were looking for places to dance (my workout exercise).  Every Saturday night, they have salsa, bachata music for a few hours.  We normally got there early at around 9 pm.  Right, the customers had never been close to ten each time.  I always like to have red wine, desert and snack.
The crowd will not come till around midnight when they change the music to reggaeton then you will see hundreds of young people flood into the restaurant.  There were not enough seats for everyone and there was no room to walk thro'.  People are drinking and dancing within the limited place. Doubted if they just love that jostling feel.
Normally once I see the crowd, we will start to leave.  There are always police around the parking lot.
On a Saturday last month, without knowing they called celebration of Columbia night, we went down in a whole family of four as we had children visiting.  Out of my surprise, they charged $15.- per person just to get in.  No drink, no nothing.  It was my friend who did not want to upset the party, he paid for it.  What?  $60.- to just get into the crowd with no seats.  Later he found some friends who gave us a few seats.  Honestly I was not happy at all.
The floor is carpet.  Price of the drink is above average.

I talked with many of my friends, everyone said $15.- entrance is outraged.  Even I never have to pay, I still consider not a place for me.  I know they do charge for entrance, check out before you go unless you do not mind.
