Soo gross! I walked in here with my husband for tacos.  I ordered 2 of pastor, 2 lengua and 1 buche.  We ordered 2 drinks: 1 horchata and 1 tamarindo(these drinks are not from scratch but made from pre made powder).  The tacos were soo bad.  The tortilla was a little cold, and quickly got soggy.  The meat on the tacos was not hot at all.  It was kind of room temp.  The only taco that had warm meat was the buche taco but this taco was dripping in fat.  That's what made my tacos soggy.  Please don't come here to eat!!!  I went to the salsa bar to get some radishes to eat with the tacos but I was grossed out when I saw that some of these were brownish.  The establishment was very dirty, and is in need of remodeling.  I don't understand how this place has gotten the good reviews that it has.  Look at pics to see how dirty this place was.
