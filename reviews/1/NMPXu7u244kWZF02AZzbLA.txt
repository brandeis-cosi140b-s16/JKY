This USED to be my favorite Filibertos.

I've had quite a few bad experiences with this one. And today is the last time I'll ever go here.

I went around 3 pm. And it was extremely hot in there. I ordered my food, I said 3 jr. quesadillas. And the guy who barley speaks English charges me for 1. I had to ask my boyfriend to ask for 2 more because the guy didn't look me in the eye whatsoever. and I just couldn't stand the fact that I had to repeat myself, when I clearly said what I wanted.

I went to the salsa bar to get my green sauce that I love so much. And guess what. It wasn't over there.... So when our food came out, I asked for some and over course the guy didn't understand me. He ended up only giving me four sauces(2 green and 2 red). And I love spicy food, so I wanted like twice as many as he gave me. So of course they're annoyed when you ask for more.

Then I sit down to eat my food, and our quesadillas are really burnt.. YUM!
To top it off, the sauces were warm, like 90 degrees and tasted bad. Like sour almost. In the past when they were in the actual salsa bar, they've been the same way. It's obviously not refrigerated. (Someone please call the health department.)

I couldn't enjoy my food at all. Oh well.

I just know I'll go to the one on 83rd ave and Thunderbird next time.
