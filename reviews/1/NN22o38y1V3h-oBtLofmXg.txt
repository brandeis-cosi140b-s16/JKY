I've been to this place a few years ago and decided to stop by again today 2/24/15. I couldn't remember why I stopped coming. I ordered the steak burrito. I was the only customer, no one inside and only one in drive-thru, however I waited 10 mins for my food after paying and getting my drink! No check in or explanation from workers about length of time. I get to work and start eating and immediately tasted the "oldness" (sour like) of the tortilla, not to mentioned it was burnt. I took the food out of the tortilla and put some of the salsa on the food and even worse, the salsa tastes like it's been sitting there too long. So no breakfast for me until I can go for lunch. :-( 

I called the place and the worker did not acknowledge my concerns and insisted all their food is fresh. I won't be going there again.
