Location:
Right off Baseline Road. Across from Fry's Electronic Store

Atmosphere:
Not bad..has a nice little front room and seemed clean

Food:
Absolutely horrible. The food was smothered in sauce which worries me because I feel they do this to cover up something and it did...flavor.  We ordered the "Special" which I feel would have been the best to try...it was very salty and had little overall flavor. The cheese crisp appetizer was pretty much a tortilla smothered in tons of oily cheese. was completely upset and will never go back again.

Recommend:
Absolutely not. I felt Taco Bell has more authenticity than this place. I hate to say that but it was a complete waste of money.
