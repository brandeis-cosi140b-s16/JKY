Bland, boring, terrible Mexican food... But hey, at least the customer service was good.

The salsa and margaritas were the only redeeming quality.  And it's hard to screw up salsa and margaritas.

We had the combo appetizer (quesadilla, chicken taquitos, potato skins stuffed w red/green chili, and nachos) and the chicken and steak fajitas.  The quesadilla was very greasy and it was the first time our kids called quesadilla "gross."  The nachos were just greasy cheese and beans.  Boring, bland and very greasy.  The potato skins were obviously reheated.  Also very bland and boring. 

I've never had a place mess up fajitas, but somehow they did it.  I keep saying the word "bland" in my review because its the best way to describe my experience here.  The meat was so flavorless and when you're not using a high quality cut of meat, everyone knows seasoning is pivotal.  Terrible!   

If this place could get a new head chef and menu and keep the great customer service, they could be OK.
