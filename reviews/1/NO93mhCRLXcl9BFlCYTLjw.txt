I wish they could give negative stars.  I mean seriously this place is a health violation.  I have eaten Mexican food on the streets of Tijuana and almost never has it been this bad.  Gordan Ramsey needs to put this place on kitchen Nightmares.  Honestly, I joined Yelp just so I could post a review of how bad this place is.  I am not even joking when I say the marg tasted like it was made with a mixing powder like Koolaid.  I have never, ever, ever walked out without finishing my food.  I can say after 4 bites we were out the door.  Help others and warn them that this place is toxic.
