Sorry yelpers this was awful!

Cheese crisp was made with an old tortilla.  Like eating thick paper.  Sick.  Cheese was barely melted.  We ordered a three combo plate 2 tacos and a cheese enchilada.  Plate was not even hot.  Cheese not melted in the enchilada and the tacos were on these weird shells. 

So disappointing and a whopping 35$ with tip.
We were expecting 5 star food from all the reviews......only thing we can imagine is they have never had really good authentic Mexican food.  Big big let down.

Never again.

Sick sick sick.
