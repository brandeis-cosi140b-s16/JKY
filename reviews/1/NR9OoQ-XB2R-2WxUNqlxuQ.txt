First time here wasn't that impressed. Ordered a Tamale plate with rice and beans. Tamales must of been mistaken for some other ingredient but it was killed with SALT!!! Could not stand another bite! Beans on the plate looked like it was sitting out for awhile. It was crusty and dry. Rice on the other hand was not that bad at all. 

Sorry to say but I will not go back. Maybe just for Margaritas or beer.
