This has to be the worst fast food establishment known to man. Okay, that's a little harsh but my experience was so awful, I will never stop by this establishment again.
First off, it took a few mins to get someone on the intercom to help me take my order. Then I preceded to ask what were the indigents of one of the menu items, considering I hardly ever go there I didn't have a clue. Then there was silence, I asked the same question again a minute latter when someone was on the intercom a 2nd time. Then there was silence, only to have this punk kid come outside and point at the menu and say something to the effect of look here, can't you see what's on this. Then I made an remark about his unprofessional attitude, then he came back outside like a gang banger and asked me "What did you say" .
So yeah, if Del Taco will hire an unprofessional gutter trash like this,  I won't be visiting this or any other Del Taco establishment ever again.
