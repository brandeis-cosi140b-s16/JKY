I eat at Chipotle often. 3-5 times a week due to my busy schedule i find chipotle to be on the healthier side of fast food. At this particular one the service is horrible. They are super stingy when it comes to meat and ingridients. I have to ask them to put more chicken or more steak everytime. I dont except to pay 10 dollars for a bowl of rice and beans.
