Even after reading the reviews we tried this place yesterday. Went for early dinner around 4 p m was told seat yourself then a kid brought our menus...Our waitress was actually very nice and friendly. Then this couple walked in...they sat near the door and proceed to yell a conversation with an older gentleman 2 booths away. Annoying to say the least. I ordered the 2 item combo...my husband did the same. I got a Chile Relleno and Shredded beef burrito, he got 2 Chiles. Served quickly....was actually liking eat except in the burrito no beans...then I bit into a piece of hard plastic! When the waitress came to ask about dessert we said no and I handed her the plate and showed her the plastic and said to let kitchen know. We got an apology and our bill....thought there would have at least a discount or a complimentary dessert or come back free entr√©e without plastic ...... paid....won't be back. As a permanent resident not a snow bird we're the ones to make sure are happy  as we would want to support our local businesses in the summer.
