Not authentic.  Trying to pretend to have a nice selection of good dishes but ingredients are not quality.  Just run of the mill.  Not made with care.  Too salty to cover boring food.  Salsa was boring.  Chips were not freshly cooked.  Service was poor.  Like a chain.  Nothing special.  Not horrid, just tasteless and boring.  CHAINISH - like Olive Garden quality.  Great for kids.  Don't let the white table cloths and napkins fool ya.
