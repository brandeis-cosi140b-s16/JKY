I feel like this place deserves 2 stars  and my wife feels like it doesn't deserve any stars...we split steak calamari..I thought it was okay and my wife didn't care for it at all..the sauce was decent.  For entree, I ordered carne asada burrito and it barely had any steak OR FLAVOR and my wife ordered street tacos and she only had a couple bites...I later found out that she didnt eat it because the meat was raw/red..I am a real fast eater and usually not that picky so at this point my food was 80 percent done because I was so hungry and didnt care at this point. When she pointed out that the meat was raw..I observed my dish and noticed it was raw as well..the server knew that my wife didnt care for the food and he didnt do anything about it..he was really nice though but oh well..I am kinda buzzing right now while writing this review because we had drinks at Narcise afterwords..I should have known not to go to SOL because my wife's boss mentioned it was ehhh !  The food was missing seasoning...no flavor!  Later, we went to Menchie's for yogurt and the owner told us that someone she knew got sick from there..we are not sick yet..we will keep our fingers crossed......our bill was 51.09 and I still gave the water 10.00 tip..I feel like its not his fault!
