I was near Sunset station and craving mexican food. Since discovering Cafe Rio I had not been to a Chipotle in quite a while. Since I was right there I decided to grab a bowl to go. I definately concur with the other 1 star reviews. The service here is really slow and they are extremely cheap with the portions! 

They barely put any rice or beans in the bowl and when you ask for more it seems to be a huge issue. When it comes to the meat forget it, again very stingy. I paid $1.95 extra for guac and it was a really small spoonful. Just the bowl and chips was over $11. Don't see myself ever returning here.
