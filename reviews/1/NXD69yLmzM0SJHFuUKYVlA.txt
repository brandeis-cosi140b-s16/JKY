The one star is completely involuntary as I have absolutely nothing to base that one star on except for the shitty "don't call us we'll call you" wait to be seated system! Fuck me! It's been over 2 hours and we still haven't received our phone call for a table for two that was quoted for a 45 minute wait. Is this seriously the place that took over the space once occupied by 8 Ounce? Wow! Bye Felicia!
