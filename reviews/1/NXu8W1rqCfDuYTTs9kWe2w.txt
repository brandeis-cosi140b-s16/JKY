Brought some out of town friends here last night. Got to the restaurant around 7:10 or 7:20.  Waiter was so in-attentive it was embarrassing. It took forever to get water, then drinks, then refills. Most Mexican places serve your food so quickly you barely have a chance to enjoy a basket of chips. We went through 4 baskets and waited an hour for our food, keep in mind I took forever to get chip refills. 

I like to think I have appropriate expectations for food quality and service on a $10 meal but this was terrible. This was our 2nd time here and we won't go back!  Waiter was very rude and unaccommodating.
