Went to this locations was over charged,  the receipt absolutely made no sense. We wanted to split the bill and do 4$ on my card and 4.79 in cash so we told the lady to wait while we got the change, she ended up charging the card 4.79 and taking the change. When I called in the morning to ask about it, the person could not speak english and hung up on me. Will never go here again. I know your not going to a five star restaurant but shouldn't there be some way of communication with them? We are in the middle of a college town and they can's speak hardly any english and really  hanging up on the customers?!
