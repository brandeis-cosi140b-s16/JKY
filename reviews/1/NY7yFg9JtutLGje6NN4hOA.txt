Long ass review sum: DO NOT EAT HERE. Unless you want food poisoning.

Came here to eat last night because we were headed to Adventuredome and figured we would grab something near there. First of all the selections at Circus Circus are minimal. We settled on this place. Literally stood in line for 35 minutes. Got our food about 15 minutes later. 

Chips and salsa- 4.99 for this. The "hot" salsa tasted disgusting, and they literally give you about 15 chips.  Not worth it at all.

Burrito Grande- all I could taste in it was cheese, hardly any rice or beans in it. I only ate a few bites.

3 deep fried tacos- guess it was the only thing at our table that was edible. Bf said he wouldn't eat it again though. More of a survival eating lol.

Rolled tacos- this was for the kids. My daughter took a bite and spit it out and said it was disgusting. She usually loooooves taquitos. My son (2) took a bite and said it was fish. I told him it was chicken. Bf tried it and spit it out and said the chicken is old. I smelled it and omg it smelled disgusting. We felt so bad for giving it to our kids. I went to the front and they asked if I wanted to order something else...ummm no thanks.. Not trying to up our odds of getting food poisoning at this restaurant. They ended up giving us $10.25 refund (we also added the rice and beans to it).

My son who ate a couple bites was up all night gagging. Please avoid this place like the plague. Even if you are on the tip of death from starvation, I would suggest eating out of a dumpster before you eat at this place!!!
