Worst customer service EVER!! First time we went we went through drive thru and it was a girl she was nice but the food took FOREVER!! As most of these reviews would say.. I understand your making the chicken fresh and your grilling, but if you know it's lunch / dinner time you can start cooking a little more earlier so we don't have to wait so long. Then second time I went through the drive thru it was a guy and OMG idk what it is about this kid but he ALWAYS FORGETS SOMETHING. EVER SINGLE TIME!! I ordered salad and didn't even put the dressing!! Wtf kind of salad is without the dressing!! Then last time I asked for some salsa and he only puts 1 little cup.. when I have a family of 4 and we ordered family meal!! This place is just rediculous!! Where's the management!!
