When did the Wheel of Sin become the Wheel of Suck? Seriously, when I started going to Diablo's for happy hour the wheel had many awesome items for a mere $2...fast forward to 2011 and the items on the wheel are $5 and $7. Um, since when is a $7 shot of Patron considered a good happy hour deal? Or how about a $5 Pacifico? With all of the other awesome drink deals on the strip I am saying adios to the Wheel of Suck.
