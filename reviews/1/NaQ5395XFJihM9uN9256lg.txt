Pros: Drinks are good.
Cons: Breakfast was cold (twice), and expensive.

We were early for a flight and stopped in for breakfast and a marg.  Breakfast came out cold.  We asked for them to pop the meals in the microwave for a minute, and would have been happy with that.  Instead, they remade the meals, which again came out cold.  By this point, we didn't have much time before our flight, so we ate some of the food, then left.  The manager was nice and apologetic, but nothing was comp'd and our meal with 2 drinks each cost about $75, not including tip.

This would never happen at the 16th street location - Frankly, ownership should be paying more attention to their chains, particularly at an airport where opinions can be formed quickly by locals and visitors alike.
