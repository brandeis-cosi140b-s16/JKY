Two tasteless dried out Al Pastor tacos 3-4 inches wide, with a smattering of chopped onion and a couple cilantro flakes. Not enough for mouse. That and a bottle Coke set me back $5.50. Food stuffs piled on table, closet sized space. Not even trying. Just got home and put a frozen pot pie in oven. Ridiculous. Keep driving.
