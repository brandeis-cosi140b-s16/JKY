I would love to give this little Mexican restaurant a great review, but the rude staff prevents me. Great salsas, delicious verde, amazing chile rojo and fantastic homemade corn tortillas.  

But, we were completely ignored -when we walked in and stood at the counter to order (the place was empty-it was about 3pm)-when the female employee finally 'noticed' us, she was extremely rude-it really seemed as if we were not welcome. 

Excellent food but we'll never go there again.
