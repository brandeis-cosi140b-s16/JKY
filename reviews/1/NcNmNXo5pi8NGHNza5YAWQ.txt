This is the second time I have eaten here. The first was not very good and the service was terrible. I simply had nachos. I have had better nachos in a school cafeteria. 

This time, I had a chimichanga. The pork barbacoa was dry and lacking in flavor. No chips and salsa at the beginning either. 

There is no need for me to return to this establishment, since there are so many Taco Bells nearby.
