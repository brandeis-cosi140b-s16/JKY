It was okay last year - nothing great but nothing bad.  Maybe it's because we've had some pretty great food this last year, but we weren't pleased with this place and will not return..  The food on the plate ran together.  It looked like soup.  We couldn't even make out the enchiladas as they were covered with the rice and soup-like sauce.   It was an awful presentation.  The sauce around the edges of the plate looked like it had been overcooked and burned.  The meat in the taco was seasoned really weird.  It was awful.  I couldn't eat it.  We love Mexican food and this place is at the bottom of the barrel.  The service was slow and food took forever.
