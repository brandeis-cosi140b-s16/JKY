Jeff,

Thanks for your response but I won't be going to your establishment only to pay and, in return, be berated by a dimwitted, stupid server who tried to humiliate and embarrass me in front of my friends and family.  My previous review didn't go into details about my encounter but you are misinformed.  Your server yelled at me... publicly scold me to leave and refused service (albeit she wanted the rest of my party of 30 to stay) - all due to her unprofessional conduct! I'm not the server; I'm the paying patron.

Had the server done her job and informed me of your state restrictions or simply been more tactful then we wouldn't have had this problem. Instead she created the unnecessary and upsetting confrontation and by attempting to debase and disgrace me. 

She claimed to be a "manager" so she should have known better and I assumed properly trained.  I'd like to think she lied about being a manager rather than think that you hadn't trained your managers properly but that's not the issue. 

As a matter of fact, the server provided multiple pitchers of margaritas and other cocktails simultaneously to the table without questioning the number people sharing the pitcher or anyone's age. Many of my friends were  consuming from the pitchers, other cocktails, inidvidual shots - all in apparent violation of your state's mandate.  

Because it was a large party I paid my bill for our family plus the gratuity however if you'd like rectify your server's misconduct and I'd appreciate a refund for my meal if you're truly sorry for my experience. You can message me directly.
