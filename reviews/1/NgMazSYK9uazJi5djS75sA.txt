This place...good grief. I have lived in Dormont for 5 years. So I had eaten at Mexi Casa when it was under original ownership. It really wasn't bad for American style Mexican food. The food was a little inconsistent but I was never expecting top notch Tex Mex. When I had heard it reopened I was excited to see what improvements were made. Unfortunately, somehow this mediocre place became awful. My roommate and I were a little late but we're really craving a Bloody Mary. What we got was no more than tomato juice with pepper in it. I didn't taste any vodka at all. For $8, I would at least expect some celery salt or horseradish. If the bartender didn't have the ingredients to make the drinks we would have been happier picking something else.

Our food made the drinks seem impressive. I ordered the "wanna iguana" burrito. The description says that it has spicy chicken, queso, rice and beans. I opted out of the beans just because sometimes I feel that they tend to take over the burrito. The burrito was disgusting. The queso was too thin and just saturated everything. The chicken was also texturally similar to that from a can. There was not an ounce of spice to it either. The oddest part about the burrito is that the rice had corn and peas in it. PEAS. Weird. I have been to actual Mexican restaurants where they use several vegetables that one would not expect. My great grandmother put potatoes in her beef enchiladas. But this is not a place where creative cooking is expected so it just seemed more like the rice was a mix with dehydrated corn and peas in it. Overall I am saddened by this place.
