This was without a doubt the worse restaurant I have ever eaten at. I would highly consider never eating here. Asada was fatty, customer service was terrible and I didn't receive what I ordered. I would of rather ate at Quiktrip down the street and had their hot dogs from weeks old (thats an exaggeration) but save yourself the trip and keep driving.
