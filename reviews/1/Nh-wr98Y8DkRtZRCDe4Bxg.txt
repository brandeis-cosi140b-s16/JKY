If you are looking for an eating experience that is a combination of sitting in a medical office for people with no insurance / the unemployment line while being served food that makes dog food look appetizing... Then look no further, Rito's Burritos is the place for you.  

By far the worst eating experience I have had in Phoenix, since moving from East L.A.
