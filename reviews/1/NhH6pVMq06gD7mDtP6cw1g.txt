As a Las Vegas resident I have visited numerous Chipotles across town. This one is by far the worst. They give you as little as possible. The workers are stingy with the food like it is coming out of their paycheck. If you ask for extra anything they will ignore you. If I am paying $10 for a bowl I expect a decent size serving. The line is always out the door because they are very slow and out of product all the time. Drive the extra mileage to go to a better Chipotle across town because you will get better service and food.
