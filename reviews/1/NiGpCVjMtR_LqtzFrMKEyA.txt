I went to this place last Saturday after reading all the great reviews. However, after eating the Carne Asada burrito, which was mediocre at best and the salsa wasn't even hot. I was greatly disappointed by this place. I don't know if they changed chefs from all the other reviews, but this place isn't worth stopping by.
