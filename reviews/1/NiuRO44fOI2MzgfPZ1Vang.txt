Horrible food (the most dry taco I have ever eaten and the enchilada was very chewy) and awful service, not to mention a giant cockroach walked right past us  to nibble on a piece of meat on the floor.  They didnt get our order right and we ended up having to eat it anyway because the waiter never came back to the table, then we had to look for him to pay the bill and then again to get our credit card back.  When we showed the manager the giant cockroach he just picked it up with a napkin and didnt even offer an apology.  I give them 6 months at most and then they will be out of business.
