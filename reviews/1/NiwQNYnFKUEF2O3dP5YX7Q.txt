We've eaten at this Chipotle several times and, although it is not one of my favorite places to eat, I recognize that the supposed quality of the food may be better than other fast food restaurants.  That being said today's experience was not a good one!  We arrived just before noon and there were few people there.  The employees were apparently  filling an order that seemed to be causing them some trouble and our food, once started, sat on the prep line for longer that it should have before they finished it.  I took two bites of my taco and the meat was refrigerator cold, not lukewarm from sitting on the counter too long.  I informed the manager and suggested that perhaps their warming trays were not operating properly and she checked and said everything was at targeted temperature.  I had her touch the meat in my taco to demonstrate that the meat was cold.  She agreed with me and said she would make me another.  15 minutes later, since my husband had finished his meal, I approached her and asked that my money be refunded.  She said she had totally forgotten about my taco and she couldn't refund my money because the cash register had frozen and she was trying to get someone on the phone.  Only after I stood there a moment did she offer a "card" for the next time we visit.  I told her there wouldn't be a next time.  I can forgive one oversight, even two on a restaurant visit, but these folks totally "dropped the ball" on ours.
