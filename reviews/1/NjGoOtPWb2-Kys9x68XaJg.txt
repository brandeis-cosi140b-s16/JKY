Sitting at the bar... Super slow had to practically do jumping jacks to get service  sitting at the bar really??.. Food way over priced for what it is and was really bad.. carne asada ??wtf horrible. Cheap beer is the only good thing that's if you can get a drink  from the snooty want to be server/ bartenders... I know what ppl have been saying in the Gilbert community and its obvious there is no way this is a four star joint... Fake reviews forsure buyer beware.
