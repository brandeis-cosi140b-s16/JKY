Not good and not sure how they got a strong 5 star rating.. Not sure how 40 ppl so far that have taken the time to write a review have loved this place.. Did not taste good. Not impressed with their "fresh salsa bar" either... I waited to write this review just incase I was just feeling grumpy last night ... Woke up this morning ... Nope still disappointed.... Maybe my review will help someone like me using yelp as a guide to help find yummy places to eat when you don't know where to go and are not from the area.... Which is why I chose this place. Can't win them all lol !
