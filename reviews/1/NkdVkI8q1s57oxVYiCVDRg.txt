Went during the middle of winter ... always noticed it being empty ... owner seem very nice and his wife helping also. Its a very small one man shop. I always try to stop by mom and pop shops to help boost there business and hopefully find an up and coming restaurant. ... this one??? ummm ... I don't think it will last too long sorry to say. Chips and salsa were store bought ... cold hard chips are never good. Salsa left something to be desired ... it needed something. Menu is kinda weird .... but i went with basics on the first try ... carne asada burrito ... Took awhile to make for some reason ... i was hoping for something great based on the time it took to make. Right off the first bite, I knew the ingredients were not fresh .. meat had that 2 day old funky taste ... what made it even worse was the hard fatty grisle that is found in really cheap meat. I was spitting out hard bits and when i was done with my burrito i had about two spoonfuls left on my plate. Maybe if your really hungry and don't chew your food like  a person should ... maybe you wouldn't notice. I pass by this place everyday and cringe ... only saving grace is the kids during the summer at golfland to help with keeping the business afloat.
