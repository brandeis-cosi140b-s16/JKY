This has to be the worst "Mexican" food I've ever tasted. Maybe it's an acquired taste. This place is horrible. My carne asada nachos were exactly the same as the nachos you get at the movies or 7-11. How they attract customers is beyond me. Obviously Phoenix is in dire need of authentic Mexican food. The place is a dump. I'll never return.
