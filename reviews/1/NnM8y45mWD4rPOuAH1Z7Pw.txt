NEVER EVER EVER EVER!  Me and a few of my other co workers (we're all bartenders and cocktail servers in downtown) went out after work...so we all had a few hundred on us Thursday Nov 20 one of the girls needed food so a guy stopped us offered us a band and for $20.00 get unlimited well drinks into "the club" and for $40 or $50 get top shelf unlimited...we asked at 1 are u still serving guy said sure are..so we all purchased then he told us ohh no we're not serving food then they demand I finish my drink before I enter then haha to top it off they told us the unlimited ends in less than two hours....so he refunded all our money but it was heinous lies to try and pull U in...
