This place is horrible....everything from the decor to the service. I've been twice, both in 2011. I can't remember what I had the first time (that says a lot in its self). The second time, I had a chicken enchilada & beef taco combo. The food is so bland it's ridiculous, otherwise it tastes like dog food. This place is hideous...the funny thing is both times I went with my friend & his family and they love it. I can only guess the family has no taste buds or has NEVER had Mexican food before.
