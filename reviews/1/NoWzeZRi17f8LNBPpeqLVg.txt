On the urgent pressing of a sister, I grabbed some take out from Rubio's for a quick delicious bite. While I did get a bite in, my burrito was small enough to finish in two bites. Considering I am more man than just two bites, this place needs to step it up. They do give you chips to enjoy along with your burrito. However, I would rather have had a second burrito without the extra cost. At least with places like Chipotle, I feel as if I am partially full and not just running on empty.

Overall, the burrito was small, the taste was fine. If you want to get a great burrito sometime, head over to one of the many hundreds of other good Mexican restaurants and leave this one to rot away.
