Usually love robertos and know it's hit or miss on locations. Went in today and they were super busy. Even watched as a customer asked for ketchup for her kids fries and was ignored. Customer finally just sat down. Got my chicken tacos and went back to work only to find a hair in one of them. Lost my appetite !
