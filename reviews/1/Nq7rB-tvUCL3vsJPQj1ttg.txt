Service sucks. If you are from Texas don't eat here. Others may like this form of Mexican food but it was lack luster. Drinks were also not very good. We got two bowls of soup with no spoons. No silverware until after the food got there. I saw a few people wait at the hostess stand just to leave because they weren't acknowledged. It wasn't even busy. Stay away
