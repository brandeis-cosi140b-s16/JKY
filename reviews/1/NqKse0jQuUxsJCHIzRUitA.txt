Horrible horrible....our waiter was not so friendly the food is way overpriced chips and salsa are not free...rice undercooked with no seasoning beans I didn't touch the enchiladas of chicken were ok but when the waiter brought out our food a fruit fly came out with the food im guessing it was in the kitchen and followed our food and it didn't go away from our table I complained and they didn't make me pay for it but horrible experience for sure
