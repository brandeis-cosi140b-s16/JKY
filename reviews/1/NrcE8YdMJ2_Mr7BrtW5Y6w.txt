I'm glad I am writing a review now, because this place won't be in business very long.

Let me do start on a positive note; Cecelia is a very good and personable server.

That's about it. 

As you can discern from the name of the place, it is very Gringo.

I ordered a combo plate of Tamale, Chile Relano, and Carne Asada Taco. 
The taco was better than Taco Bell or Del Taco, but not as good as fast food favorite, La Mexicana and not even in the ball park with Taco's Del Gordo.

The Tamale was dry, and nowhere in the class of Dona Maria's, or for that matter, any decent catering truck. 

The Chile Relano, was soggy, and low on cheese.

Very Gringo, and I'm with Heather as it was very disappointing.

I had a "buy one, get one free coupon", and I wish I had never used it. 

A free meal doesn't always taste better.

No returno!!!
