All this bar cares about is your money & your money only. They do not care about individuals themselves. They willingly will treat people horribly just because they like another customer better. It is rather childish if you ask me.  There are plenty of other sports bars that have better prices, better food, better drinks, better atmosphere, and friendly employees. 
They also have a location at bell & 32nd st. I would not suggest going there either considering it is the same owner.
