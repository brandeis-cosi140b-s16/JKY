Okay, where to start... 

I've been to this location many times and, given them many chances.  

However every time has been terrible. 
1. The employees are not very bright and and the lack of communication from one end of the line to the other is atrocious. 
2. I order my burrito with light medium salsa. This translates to EVERY employee at this location to put as much as they can on the burrito until it's just liquid. Not to mention the sauce is NEVER a consistent taste at this location last time I went I had to open my burrito and scrape the most vile expired tasting salsa off my burrito and could lot get the taste out of my mouth. 
3. When I order my partners burrito they rip it every time and refuse to double wrap it when they have clearly done a shit job at wrapping the burrito. 
4. If I go to any other chipotle in Nevada (I've been to quite a few) my meal costs 20.00 even. Here it cost about 26.00, what are they charging me for?

So in closing I drive an extra 10 minutes to the eastern location where they are more competent then the dead animals there serving.
