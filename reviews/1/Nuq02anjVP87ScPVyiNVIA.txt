I got a recommendation from a friend to eat here.  He loved it.  I did not.  

I went here with my husband and a friend who was visiting from out of town.  We made a reservation and good thing because they were so busy.  The interior decor was charming and the bathrooms were fun.  It was a nice spring day so we sat outside.  And that's when it went downhill.

Our server took forever.  We asked for chips and salsa several times and never got it.  The busboy kept bringing chips to the tables around us but never to us.  Finally, the chips finally arrived -- a few minutes before our food did!  The food was not good.  We each ordered something different and none of us liked what we ordered.  We tried switching dishes hoping we would like something the other person ordered but no such luck.  The only thing we did like was the sangria.  

I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.  Save your money and go to a real Mexican restaurant.
