Food is over priced and very bland.  Husband had the steak burrito and I had a chicken quesadilla.  Both of us agreed that it was bland and needed flavor.  The place was packed which leaves to believe that either it is new and people are trying it out or there is a market for bland Mexican food.  The drink bar did have a nice selection of options, that would be the highlight of our visit.  We won't be returning.
