I understand that when you go to a ghetto fast food place like del taco you shouldn't expect much in terms of customer service. But these guys have given the term "horrible customer service" a whole new meaning. Here's been few of my recent experiences:
-I go to the drive-thru and order 2 sausage breakfast tacos and emphasize twice that I want them with sausage. The cashier gives me my total and Instructs me to pull to the window to pay. I get to the window and I double check my order and the cashier with attitude, Richard, tells me I ordered a regular breakfast taco without sausage. I go to tell him that's not correct and he cuts me off and says "I was going to ask you what kind but you drove off." Drove off?! He specifically asked me to pull to the window telling me that he's got my order!! After that Richard was full off attitude and essentially threw my order in the car. No thank you no nothing! 
-Today I go to the drive-thru order breakfast with hash browns. I come home and there's a SINGLE hash brown stick in the bag. Really?! That's like ordering French fries and getting a single fry in the bag! I go back and they replace the order.
Called del tacos customer service line and of course no one bothers to pick up!! 
Done with this place!
