I usually love Cafe Rio but this location is terrible. I ordered my usual tostada and I noticed that the guacamole was starting to brown. The girl behind the counter just scooped out the brown bits then put the guacamole back. Then one of the girls behind the counter ended up starting an argument with another one of the workers in the back. I left the building very uncomfortable. When I got home and started eating, the rice was hard and stale. The barbacoa was overcooked and chewy. Needless to say I will never be going back to this location. The Stephanie location is now the only one I'm going to.
