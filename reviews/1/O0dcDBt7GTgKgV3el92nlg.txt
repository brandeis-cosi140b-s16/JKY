Waited ten minutes for drinks at the bar, 35 minutes for food that had very obviously been sitting waiting under the heat lamps. It was hard enough for our waiter to bring us the drinks we ordered, so I didn't bother with telling him that our steak fajita burritos were more beans than steak. Which may have been good since the steak was chewy. Disappointed to say the least.
