This place makes me wish Yelp had an option for 0 stars!!!
Yayo taco has been bookmarked in my yelp ever since i saw it on Diners, Drive-Ins, & Dives. That is how i convinced Kenny L to go with me. If its on food network... it must be good right? WRONG!!!
 
The Pollo was HORRIBLE! As soon as i started chewing, i had to spit it out!
I was able to eat the Bombay, probably since the curry masked everything.

I left Yayo feeling guilty about recommending such an awful place and also kinda worried about getting food poisoning from eating that Bombay taco. gross.
