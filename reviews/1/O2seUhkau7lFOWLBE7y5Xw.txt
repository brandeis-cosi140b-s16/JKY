This place was gross. I wouldn't call this Mexican food at all, it's an insult to Mexican food. The chop meat on the Mexican pizza reminded me of dog food.  I could have had better food at Filiberto's. The lettuce was frozen in the taco salad, and the tamales were stale! Never again I hope all our winter visitors don't think this is real Mexican food!!!
