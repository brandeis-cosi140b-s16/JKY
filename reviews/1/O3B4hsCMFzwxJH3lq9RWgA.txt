never never never go to this location!!! im a big robertos fan being from california, but the service was so bad at this particular location i actually had to log on and warn u guys against it!! the guy behind the register was like high or something, lazy, unfriendly and ..forgot my drink once all was said and done.just kinda rude.. i was in a good mood when i came in and so shocked at the service or lack of ,i wanted to run out in the end. if youre new to vegas and gotta have that bomb mexican let me suggest the other location on gibson theyre way better.
