First and foremost, the only reason I gave this place a one star rating was because the decor was pleasant to the eye and the owner and or manager came by to refill our drinks. The meal was pedestrian, the wait staff was curt and only polite because it was their job. Finally the hostess hated her life and had an attitude problem because of it. Will not be returning, worst experience I've had. Don't come here,  go to chipotle instead.
