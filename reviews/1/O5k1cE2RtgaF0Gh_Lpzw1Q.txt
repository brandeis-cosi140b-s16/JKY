Ok i've been coming here a lot but yesterday I will never go back..... EVER!!

It's a shame because I loved this place and will come here every other week with my hubs.. here's what happened:

We get there and it was insanely hot inside, I thought it was just me because I am preggo but my hubs said it was a scorcher inside.  I sat down and he went to go to the salsa bar for our chips.  He was waiting in line behind some "fluffy" lady, she took too long and he sat back down.  We were both looking at her so we knew when the salsa bar was free.. and then we see her dipping chips inside the salsa bar!! And not just a little chip she was getting gobs and gobs of it even though she is still standing there with salsa in her cups already.  She was sticking her whole hand in it it seemed like because she had salsa on her hand and we were about to call the worker over there to let her know what this customer is doing, but then we saw her double dipping her chips!! I sat there in shock.. she double dipped! It's now become a Seinfeld episode!  I apparently said the same thing pretty loudly because the couple in the booth behind us stopped and stared at her as well.  The worker there must have heard me, she looked at us, looked at Senorita Fluff and stood there with her mouth hanging open at the entire scene.  

I thought the worker was going to tell her to stop, remove the salsa and let her be on her way but no.... the worker went up to the salsa bar, looked at her and poured fresh salsa inside the bar.  So there was new salsa mixed with fluffy germs from that customer.

The couple behind us got up and trashed their food and left.  We should have done the same thing, we just got our food and thought that since Senorita Fluff wasn't in the back cooking our food, it would be fine but my poor hubs got sick after eating.

We won't be coming back again
