One of my worst service experiences ever. Now I wasn't expecting a lot but...I sat for 15 minutes, nothing. Others were getting service.  So I went to counter. Took my order then served other tables...confusing. anyways I waited and waited for food. Nachos had no sour cream or cheese! They brought me sour cream but no cheese is chips not nachos.
