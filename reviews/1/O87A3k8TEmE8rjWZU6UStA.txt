I am so tired of this Taco Bell! we would usually come here because it's less than a block from our house, but I've had it with them. any morning my boyfriend or I try to get breakfast, no matter what time, they are seemingly always out of waffle tacos. that would be fine IF they told us while we were ordering and not after we order and are already paying for our order at the window! and they can never make more because it "takes hours to make them"... really? you expect us to believe your fast food waffles take hours to make? my ass! this story and run out of supplies happens 8/10 times. now let's get to day time taco cravings. why is it so hard to get the order right even after you repeat it back? something we order is always replaced with something we didn't order or is just missing overall. for example, last nights order... how do you confuse carmel apple empanada with taco?! seriously?! granted two of their employees are super nice and get the order right when they work, but everyone else sucks there! if you're unsure of what we said in our order, just ask! I'd rather you get it right by asking instead of guessing and fucking it up. we will be driving to the Taco Bell on jones from now on!
