Interior is something to behold, but it's not impressive enough to keep one coming back. So, what about the drinks? Sangria is okay; margaritas aren't anything to write home about. 

So, what does this place offer? It's certainly not the grub. The salsa tastes like burnt rubber. The namesake dish (pink taco) is a mess on a plate. If you want to go to say you went - to say you had the pink taco - then go, but don't say I didn't warn ya. 

This place epitomizes all that's wrong in the world, or atleast what's defunct about Scottsdale. Flashy baubles, boobie bouncin' women, marked up mediocrity and the air of popularity that's so desired, service and quality are jeopardized. 

Uhm, no thanks.
