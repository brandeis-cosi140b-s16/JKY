My dad ordered a chile relleno.... and it came out with what looked like chicken inside?? what the??? I flagged down our sweet server Norma who said although she would never dare make her own chile relleno that way, Aunt chilada's does.  It seriously looked like canned chicken and I was shocked they would ruin a simple dish like that by adding chicken stuffed inside.  My dish was just simple taquitos and the chicken was so dry it was near jerky.  Salsa was average... nothing about this place was "mexican" and the ducks all over the place kinda grossed me out.  NEVER again will I spend my $ or allow anyone to spend theirs while in company.  Aunt Chilada's... you FAIL!
