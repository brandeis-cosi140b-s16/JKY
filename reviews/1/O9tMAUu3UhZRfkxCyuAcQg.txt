I give it one star for their customer service...

I went to this restaurant on their opening day after reading an article:

"Pancheros Mexican Grill, a fast-casual Mexican restaurant, is opening Jan. 29 in Chandler, and they'll sell $1 burritos to mark the occasion.

Burritos will be available for a buck a week later, 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. Feb. 5 at 2051 W. Chandler Blvd., Suite 1."

After being told to "come back Feb. 5th"  I showed the employee the article and she said no it was written wrong. I drove over 20 minutes to get here I told her and asked for the manager, she said he was busy...REALLY? Too busy to talk to an happy customer? 

I am not unreasonable after I left I can see their ad was poorly written and easily misunderstood. I would expect a manager to come out and speak with me and explain what happened in the least or act like they care about their customers. 

I don't like to give one stars but in the few cases that I have it is usually for bad service. I would have paid full price for their burrito, but after the way they handled the situation I have no choice.
