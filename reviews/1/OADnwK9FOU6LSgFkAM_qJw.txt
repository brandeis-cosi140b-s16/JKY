Girl working the counter was NOT pleasant at all, down right rude.  We were trying to not let that ruin our Robertos fix, sadly the food was not up to normal standards.  Side bar with all the peppers, carrots etc was lacking normal ingredients, baggies and napkins were also out.  
Carne Asada fries were good, bean burrito was ok, chicken tacos were horrible, meat dry and shells were so oddly chewie and hard at the same time.    Gonna have to rethink our Robertos meals hopefully this was just a one time bad day.
