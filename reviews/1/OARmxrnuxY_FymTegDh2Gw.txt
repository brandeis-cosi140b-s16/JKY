In all honesty ... 1 star might be overrated.  I rarely write reviews, but this restaurant needs to step up their game!  I would not only return, but I would discourage others from going.

WAITED - over 30 minutes ... after a reservations was made.
Food was awful.  Drink were awful.
There was a cockroach at our table.

I could go on and on, but overall, the management was rude, the food was not edible, and it was very disappointing. We had a lovely waiter that was doing his best, but could not compensate for everything else.
