I travel a lot and I've never had such a bad airport restaurant experience.  It took them 35 minutes to have our meal served and when I told the waiter it was taking too long for the food to arrive (we were in an airport after all!) and we better have our order "to-go", he responded in a nasty tone "that the restaurant was a sit-down restaurant."  He did offer to refund my money (I had paid him during my wait) but I opted to wait as he said they were boxing my food as we spoke.  We ordered a crab cake sandwich which tasted ok and the Mexican salad.  Unfortunately, we didn't realize until we were on the plane that the waiter did not put the cilantro dressing on the salad, nor on the side.  The cilantro dressing was the reason my wife ordered the salad!

A couple of other observations: 1. The restaurant layout is horrible (we had to walk upstairs with luggage) and; 2. the first person to greet us was also quite unpleasant and inattentive.

I surely wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone on a tight timetable and the service left much to be desired.
