The food is good but the staff is seriously rude!!

  At the end of our meal I paid for my food n my friend paid for hers. The guy that was serving us accused my friend of not having any money on her card. This caused embarrassment on her part n she had to call her bank I ended up using my card to pay for her food anyway.  The bank  told her the money was already taken out.   

When we told our server, he said he was going to get his manager which is this overweight Mexican guy. We ended up paying twice for her meal, n wanted a refund back on my card. While my friend was talking to me bout  my refund , the  rude manager cut in, gave her the dirtiest look, n said " CAN I TALK OR ARE YOU JUST GOING TO CUT ME OFF??" umm excuse me?  You don't talk to customers like that.

 To cut this story, I never got the refund on my card, we're neverrr going back to that chevys,  they need to hire people that know how to swipe a damn debit card, n I also heard from another friend of mine that she had a run in with the exact . Same. Manager at this restaurant n she wasn't treated kindly either!  

I guess they only treat certain kind of people nice in here.  Oh well. I'm usually a big tipper when I go out to eat cause I know customer service is hard, but I left leaving no tip, n my friend was very unhappy with the treatment .
