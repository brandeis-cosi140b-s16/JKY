After searching for a parking spot for 10 minutes, we arrived to order carne asada tacos that were priced at $2.49 a piece. When they arrived at our table, the tacos were incomprehensibly small, heavily over-salted, extremely dried out, and simply unsatisfying. The other person who I went with ordered the carne asada quesadilla and shared the same sentiment. Bottom line: if you want to overpay for sub-par, pseudo Mexican food and only get a fraction of a serving, visit this taco shop. If not, find another place that will give you higher quality for your dollar.
