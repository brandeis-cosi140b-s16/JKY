I can't even believe this is the same place we are all reviewing. I went last Thursday with my co-workers and was promised authentic, cheap, hole-in the wall in all its glory Mexican food.

While I will say the decor and weight staff seemed authentic - the food tasted horrible.

We were given three salsas. The first was a bit too spicy for my taste ( I am a solid medium fan) , the second was normal salsa but nothing to rave about, and the third tasted like my co-worker said  "a Bloody Mary on my chip" basically entirely too watery. 

I ordered a beef Chimichanga. Now a Chimichanga should be crispy as it is fried but this fell flat- it tasted like it was reheated in a microwave! The meat itself was scary looking (wasnt ground-or really shredded either just gross chunks ...yucky). 7 out of 8 of us made comments about the scary looking meat that filled our various Mexican entrees. I was told the chicken tasted like Chinese food -take that as you will. The rice and beans were the one part I did enjoy.

Overall my meal was $10 - and yucky. I will not be going back.
