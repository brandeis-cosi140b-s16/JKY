I was very disappointed in this restaurant after finding two other Yelp reviews with 5- and 4-star ratings.  I ordered the Supreme Nachos which come with ground beef (which is what I prefer), and from the first bite, I knew I was eating something substandard when it comes to nachos (something I order all the time at Mexican restaurants).  The ground beef had NO flavor whatsoever -- no seasoning at all.  Eating the top layor with the guacamole and sour cream was better as that gave it a little flavor, but that soon petered out, and I was into the middle layor which was beans and cheese, cheese, soggy cheese for days.  I finally dug under the whole thing to see what was on the bottom layer -- nothing but greasy, soggy cheese.  On top of that was some very soggy ultra thin tortilla chips that were also substandard as far as Mexican restaurants go.  I could go on, but suffice to say I threw away about half this meal, and then fought the after-taste for a little while after leaving.  Sorry, Julios, I won't be back.  :-(
