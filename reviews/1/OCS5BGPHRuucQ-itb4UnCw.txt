I haven't written a review on Yelp in awhile but after eating here tonight I had to share our awful experience.  This place is terrible.  I have to say that I am from LA and moved here a year and a half ago, so I am a bit spoiled as far as Mexican food goes, but this place is really bad even if you don't know what good Mexican food can taste like.  I do like Cantina 1500 so I am not being a total snob!

The service was very, very slow, the drinks were tepid and boring, and the food - ugh.  My husband had a bean and carnita soup that was a greyish hue and was inedible.  He had mole enchiladas, and let's just say the mole sauce was not what it should be.  The chicken in the enchilada appeared to have come from a can - that shredded tuna - fish type chicken.  I had a snapper veracruz and I could smell the fishiness of the fish from the moment he set it down in front of me.  It tasted old. And gross.   
I always take into account the cleanliness of the bathrooms when I eat out, because if they can't keep the bathrooms clean you usually don't want to see what the kitchens look like.  I went into a bathroom stall and there was no paper dispenser on the wall.  Instead, there was a big, sopping wet roll of industrial toilet paper (with STAINS on it) sitting on the back of the toilet.  Ew.
