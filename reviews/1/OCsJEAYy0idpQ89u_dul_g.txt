Roberto's isn't really my choice place when going for Mexican. The food is decent so it always passes when in need. 

Two big complaints for this location. I've heard of refilling horchata at a charge but $1 to refill a medium sized Pepsi cup? Better off ordering a soda.

To add insult to injury, they charge $1.25 to use your card. Be sure to bring cash. 

Didn't know merchant services were charging restaurants a flat fee to process credit cards. It's always been a small fee plus the percentage. Is my money not good?

I don't appreciate them making profit to take my money. Won't be coming here especially if I don't have cash with me.
