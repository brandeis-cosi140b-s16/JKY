I would have given zero stars if it were an option. I live nearby and thought I would pick up a burrito to take to school with me for the next day.

When I went to eat it in the morning, I decided that I would like it to have some cheese. As I opened the tortilla a found a piece of a metal sponge on the tortilla. I let that issue slide and I ripped that piece of the tortilla off.

As I ate it later and fought the horribly over-cooked flavorless meat (I had also ordered the Green Chile Burrito per the employee's recommendation) I found A BUG inside of the burrito!!! I was so disgusted!! I have never had something like this happen to me before and I ignored the metal to only find something even worse.

I then called them to explain to them what had happened and they asked if I wanted another burrito. I refused the offer, because really, WHO would want to eat there after that?!? I told them that I was just calling to let them know what had happened so that they could be more careful and clean and then they HUNG UP the phone on me!!!! They wouldn't even take responsibility for this nastiness!!!

I paid $4.50 for the burrito and I left a $3 tip so that I could eat METAL and BUGS?!?  This has been my ultimate worst food experience EVER.

I HIGHLY recommend that you NEVER go here. Sorry guys, but you REALLY screwed up!
