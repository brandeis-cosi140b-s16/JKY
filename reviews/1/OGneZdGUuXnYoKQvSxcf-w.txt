I am a vegetarian and I only order the bean and cheese burrito. I substitute cheese for rice, but for some odd reason they don't view rice as a substitution but something more expensive. I got charged $1.70 extra for rice. This has happened twice so I know it is not a fluke. I won't be going back. They aren't doing anything special I can't do at home.
