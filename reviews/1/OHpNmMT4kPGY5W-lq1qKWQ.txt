Automatic 20% gratuity on parties of 5 and more.  No separate checks.  Tiny tiny portions for the money.  Seriously, $15 for 2 corn tortilla enchiladas.  The rice was hard, the beans were dry.  A message that says, "one complimentary refill of chips and salsa."  Who charges extra for chips and salsa?  At a mexican restaurant...and one that' s much more expensive and less than average quality.  Seriously, I love my fellow yelpers, but this is not authentic mexican food.  It's just bad.  I understand that Phoenix has much to be desired in this area, but yeah.  To be fair this was just one time here....they may just be inconsistent and have good food other nights, but the portions are not likely to change.
