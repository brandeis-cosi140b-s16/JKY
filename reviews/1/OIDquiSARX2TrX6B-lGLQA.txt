it was terrible. it looked like the food wasn't prepared correctly. the soft tacos were soggy with grease. the nachos were a 2.7 out of 10. we didn't mind the wait because we ordered the food for delivery but the quality was the worst. the "steak" on the nachos looked like beans. BEANS. never again.
