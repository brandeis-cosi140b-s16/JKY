I can't comment on the food, because we didn't get any.  We showed up at about 6:30 last Saturday night and were told there would be a wait of 30 minutes or so.  No big deal, even though the restaurant was not at all crowded.  The only place to wait was outside on the patio.  Again, fine, and typical for a Phoenix restaurant.  There were other people out there as well, enjoying beers and margaritas and what not.  So I start looking for the bar....can't find it.  I ask the host where I can get a beer...he tells me it's impossible, because "that part of the restaurant won't be open for another 20 minutes."  What?  People who have written about the uncaring, arrogant service are exactly right.  What kind of restaurant, particularly a Mexican restaurant, won't let you buy a beer on a Saturday night?  How did these other folks get served?  We decided it was too strange, and left and went to Frank and Lupe's in Scottsdale....had a great meal and good service.
