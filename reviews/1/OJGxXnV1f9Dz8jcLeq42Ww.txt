This place used to be good. For some reason, the quality of their food has gone way down in the past couple weeks. My
kids and I loved their Carne Asada Fries, especially since their fries were super crispy. Now, it's nothing but Carne Asadas atop soggy fries....what a disappointment. Also, had the Char Chicken Enchiladas...bland. No good flavors; unlike when we first started going here few months ago.

It's really sad that small businesses like this try hard to keep its doors open but can't understand that in order to do so, they have to keep the quality of their food up to par. Sorry to say, but we are not coming back unless they bring their food quality back up.
