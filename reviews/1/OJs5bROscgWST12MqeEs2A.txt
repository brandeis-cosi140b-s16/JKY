I love chipotle, and this location is very convenient, but the customer service is by far the worst that I have ever come across in any chipotle I have ever been to. (Or restaurant in general.) The employees are rude, rushed, and on more than three separate occasions I have come in and four or five are sitting around a table eating and talking while the line is nearly out the door and there are two people behind the counter. I have even been in line and had an employee hop in front of me to buy a drink before. Terrible service. Employees are frequently talking to friends who come in while working the register, not paying attention to what they are ringing up or being polite to the customer in front of their face. Other than the horrible service, their food is still great. The service alone will keep me from continuing to come to this location.
