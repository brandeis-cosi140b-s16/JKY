Chipotle is awesome. However this one is now on my shit list. Everytime I go here they skimp you hardcore on meat. They say your suppose to get 4 ounces of meat.. well yeaahh im afraid they dont know how much 4 ounces of steak really is because 4 little cubes isnt 4 ounces. I suggest they use a scale because im never coming back to THIS ONE. I will literally drive 15 minutes out my way to avoid this place so I will get what im paying for.  I want my 8.50 worth of my burrito. Yeah sure I could get double meat for 3.50 right? Get 8 ounces of steak! Nice, but double meat weighs 4 ounces at this location. Weigh your meat when you get home if you think im crazy I gave this 1 star because the little food they give you tastes good at least.
