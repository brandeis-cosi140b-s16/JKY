So disappointed. I ordered a beef taco with just cheese on it, made it a combo and when I got my order and bit into my taco I figured they must have gotten the order wrong because it didn't taste like beef and from looking at it I couldn't determine what it was. I went up to the counter and told them they got my order wrong and I was told that they mix their beef with potatoes so what I got was the beef taco. 1. I was not told this when I ordered it - had I known it would be made with potatoes I would not have ordered it. 2. When I sat down and looked at it closer I could not find any beef in the potato mixture. Not only did it taste gross but I feel it was a bait and switch. Won't be back.
