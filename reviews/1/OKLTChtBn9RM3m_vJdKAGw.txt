Been ordering there for years but recently disappointed ordered a dozen & 1/2 of tamales and 3 were raw. After calling 2x and being on hold the girl tells me "come in & bring the tamales & I'll exchange them" not even a sorry or anything!  I've been giving you my business for over 15yrs and that's what I get!!?? Poor customer service
