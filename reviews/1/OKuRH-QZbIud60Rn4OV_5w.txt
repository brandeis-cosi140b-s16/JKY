Stay far, far away. 

Okay, so here's the backstory, I flew to Philly a few weeks ago from SFO and had a layover here. My flight was at 6am and being the responsible adult that I am, decided to go to a bluegrass festival in the city the day before. My friends and I weren't PLANNING on finishing the boxed wine but hey, these things just happen right? Anyway, I spent the night vomiting my brains out and it's a miracle how I even ended up making it on the plane but that's another story.

ANYWAY, fast forward a few hours later, I wake up in Phoenix and your girl is still hungover but feelin' like some food could help. Oh man, that was some wishful thinking. I ordered the vegetarian burrito bowl and the whole damn thing was SO salty I swear my hangover was coming back with full force and I was gonna vomit on the plane. I also bought a side of guacamole and that was SO salty too. That should be a crime. 

I actually was so upset I tried to write a review while I was on the plane but completely forgot to finish it. So here I am almost a month later, better late than never!

Moral of the story: don't come here unless you want to overdose on sodium.
