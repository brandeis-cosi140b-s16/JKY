Never again will I come here as a piece of wood ended up in my rolled tacos. I'm usually a forgiving person when it comes to stuff like this but one of my front teeth is fake and probably could have busted biting down on A PIECE OF WOOD. No thanks, Robbie. I'll just have to find somewhere else for my late night post-work food needs. Ew.
