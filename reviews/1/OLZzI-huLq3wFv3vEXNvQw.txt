We have been here before and it's been fine.  Nothing special.  I had received a free entree coupon in my inbox because of my birthday.  Since my husband works close by we met for lunch today.  I ordered a salad and they lettuce was shredded, not what I remembered.  I was craving a salad so I went with it.  I got it vegetarian with grilled veggies and various other things.  The grilled veggies were just terrible.  Especially the onions.  My husband ordered a veggie quesadilla.  While waiting for it, they dropped it and had to make another.  They rushed and barely put any cheese in it and he said his onions weren't good either.  I couldn't even finish mine (which is odd not to be able to finish a bowl of vegetables).   Salsaritas, Chipotle, and Qdoba will get our business first.
