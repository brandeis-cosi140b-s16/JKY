You know how you go to a place for the first time and its totally awesome.. then you go back sometime later and the experience is not as good then the first.. thats Rio Mirage in El Mirage, AZ.

The first time we stopped in this place was awesome! They had the yummiest rice and beans.. as well as very good chimi's enchiladas etc.. but since the first time we've been there it just hasn't been as good.. the rice dry and greasy.. the beans, run of the mill.. food being burnt and greasy, greasy, greasy.. spotty service and in my opinion sub par ingredients make this place now an avoid.. what a shame too since they had so much going for them. Very disappointing.
