Came here to have breakfast before going to church and I'm truly overall disappointed with this place. First they didn't have what I wanted. Then I ordered an egg and ham burrito so I can just eat the inside because I'm on a special diet. What I got was mostly potatoes with an over cooked egg, and ham. Needless to say that most of the food went to waste because I can't eat potatoes. I would have taken it back and asked for them to remake it but it took so long to get our food that I would be late for church if I waited.
