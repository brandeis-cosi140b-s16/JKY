this place does not even deserve one star.  i went here on my luch just to get some simple nacho cheese fries. the manager there took my order and gave me chili cheese fries. i kindly went back from the drive through, as he did not give me a reciept for my order and gave me the wrong order, to ask if they can please fix my order and just give me regular nacho cheese fries. the other manager there had an attitude, and as i am watching the cooks, they just throw my food together, with barley any cheese on the fries, and the manager tosses the bag on the counter and says "here". at that point im pissed off, but i still ask nicely for my second order of fries that i had ordered in the first place but they had not given me. they then tossed shredded cheese and nacho cheese on the fries (which, by the way, the nacho cheese fries do not come with shredded cheese) and again threw the bag on the counter and said "here"! so being beyond pissed off, i simply just asked for a refund, and one of the male manager there said "what was wrong with the food now", i simply said "my order was still not correct and i did not like my service her today, and i would just like a refund". the female manager then told me that they would have to throw out the food, and i told her i did not want the food and i just wanted my refund. the male manager at that point went back to the drive thru register and yelled out to me that the refund would be back on my card. i told him i used a debit card, he could have just given me the cash, but he said he already did the refund to the card so i now have to wait. i asked for a reciept for the refund and the female manager said there is no reciept for a refund. i asked her how can i get proof of my refund if i didnt even get a reciept from the drive through. she then said "well it's now deleted, so there is no reciept to give you". by then i wanted to jump over the counter and bash both their heads into the register, make my own food and take my refund money back! but instead i just asked her to give me the main number, and i left. i waisted my whole lunch there over some stupid cheese fries, and i left without a proper refund and no food. i will never ever come back to this place, and i do not advise anyone to ever ever come here! i have never had such poor and rude service from anywhere else other than here!
