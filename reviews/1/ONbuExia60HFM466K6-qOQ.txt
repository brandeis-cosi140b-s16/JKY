Horrible experience my boyfriend brought the burrito home for me, it was good the following week i actually went in to buy burritos but the cashier with blonde dyed hair was so rude and the guy with long curly hair made our burritos without gloves and instead of putting the burritos on the aluminum first he put it straight on the counter first thats horrible. Bad service all around dont recommend it at all!!!!!
