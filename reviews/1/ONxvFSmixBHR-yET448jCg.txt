Worst Mexican food EVER..ordered enchilada got the wrong order..snotty slow hostess asked what my problem was. When I asked to talk to the manager she said he was not there. It was the dinner hour. Before going here take some bland cooked chicken throw it on a piece of White bread  pour salsa on that and save yourself $$
