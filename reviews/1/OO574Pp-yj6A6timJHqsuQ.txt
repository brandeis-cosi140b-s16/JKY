The staff at this location is very unprofessional. I went here three times and every time was a disappointment. The females are all the ones with attitude. There is this one Latin girl that speaks little English that took me and my friends order the first time we went here and she looked upset, had a very unpleasant and ignorant pout and attitude in her face, she was rolling her eyes the whole time. The second time we went there is one Latin girl that speaks English very fluent and has bedazzled nails but I feel she picks and choose who she wants to greet and be nice to and was very cold with her personality when me and my friend order our food and kept repeating "anything else?" I don't expect this to be a 5 star spot but at least have some good costumer service this is a business where you work and get paid not give people attitude and act mean because whatever that's going on in you're life. I pay money for quality and this business will not last with these type of little girls with horrible costumer service. LAST TIME I WILL BE EVER COMING TO DON TORTACO! NO MORE! PLEASE EMPLOY BETTER PEOPLE! Thanks!
