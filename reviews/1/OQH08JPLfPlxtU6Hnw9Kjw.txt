This place is absolutely terrible!!! If you want to pay $12 for 2 soggy and cold chicken enchiladas the size of a pack of tictacs, this is your place! There was no chicken on them and the cheese on top was hard and cold. I couldn't even eat these! I also ordered a side of chips and salsa (simple you would think) and they chips tasted about a week old and the "salsa" was practically watered down tomato paste. It was the consistency of water, and absolutely flavorless. This was a bland sauce not a salsa (no chunks of anything or spice just straight tomato water). Oh and should also mention the kitchen looked gross and the staff were just playing in the kitchen as i sat and waited for my cold food that was made well before i even thought of coming.
