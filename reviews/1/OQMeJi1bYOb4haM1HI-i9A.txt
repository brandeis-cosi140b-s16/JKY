If you get service,  it's not good; it's more delivery service than customer service.   I'm in this airport weekly,  rarely stop in here unless with friends for a drink,  always filthy, tables piled with trash and they just keep moving from table to table.   Cleared my own table today,  but never got it wiped down while the staff just watched.
