I hate bringing down a once 4 star review to one star, but it had to be done. If we ever go back, I'll see if it still stays the same.

I went back a couple of weeks ago with my metal arts friends...and I have to say what a difference it was. Literally night and day.

Our server was surly and pissy...the food was just appallingly bad...Flicka was nowhere to be found. Service was slow and it wasn't even busy. A whole...4 tables including ours?

The only remotely good thing about that night, though it's still NOT enough to make me give Flicka's 2 stars, is the checks were all split and correctly done.

Maybe the employees decided to take a break since the owner wasn't there? Whatever it was, we won't be going back.
