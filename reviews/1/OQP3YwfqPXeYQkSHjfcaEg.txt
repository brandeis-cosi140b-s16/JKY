Food was average, service was not good.  Might be good for burrito take out,  haven't tried that yet,  but won't go back for dine in.  We ordered coffee and one water......Coffee is serve yourself.  Water never arrived. Coffee was empty.   Told the cook and  the waitress the coffee was empty but they did nothing about it, just said ok.  so before we finished I told the waitress that she could bring us water instead of coffee since there was none.  That did it,  she said it would take 3 min.  I saw her run in the back and start making it... Right next to the young man I told 15-20 minutes earlier!   Hmm coffee was done when we stood up to pay.   Too late!   Also the odd thing about my toast.  :-).  I ordered rye toast with my breakfast, I could tell there were two slices as both halves matched!  Now the odd part was,  it was two top halves of toast...... Where was the bottom?  Oh yeah,  the toast was dry,  no butter.
Yup,  our last trip there but we'll give the take out burros one shot.  On a positive note:  they did apologize for getting us nothing to drink..and removed the coffee from our bill.
