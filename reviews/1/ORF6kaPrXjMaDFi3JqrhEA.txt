I came to this place bc my friend gave me a groupon, so my expectation is not high at all. However, the whole dinning experience is just HORRIBLE!!!! 

Waiting 15 min to be seated, which it's understandable for a Saturday night. 

The waitress didn't came to the table til I waved her down to ask for a server, bc i sat down for 15 min without a drink, but the table next to me got their drink a long time before us, and they came after me!

Ordered Fuente Marinia, a seafood plate with crab leg, mussel, clam, scollop, octopus, and shrimp. I asked for no mussel and no octopus, just extra shrimp! 
I also ordered a sopa de pollo.

When the plate came, there's no CRAB LEG on it. And there's only 2 big shrimp! So no worth for $23! I just told the server to send it back and get me tres amigos(chicken, steak, and shrimp). Such a disappointment. 

Then I found a yellow rubber in my chicken soup!!!!! So I just tell her to switch to shrimp tacos without onions for me. She kept apologizing, but I can see she was annoy by I kept founding something wrong with the order.

And when the tacos came, guess what!!! There's onions on them. You would thought she would paid extra attention to the order since the "kitchen" messed up soapy times already. But no!!!!

At the end I just tell her to box up the tacos, even tho there's onion on them. I would have return everything and left if I didn't have the groupon. I definitely will NOT go back.

Oh and she tried to charge me the $23 for the $16 plate I switched to. Ugh never again


Oh I guess the only ok thing is the mango margarita
