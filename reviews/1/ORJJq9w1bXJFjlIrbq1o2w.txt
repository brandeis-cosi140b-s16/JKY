Worst Chipotle ever. Carnitas in a big hunk not nicely shredded like other locations. Gauc had a half an avocado not even cut up which would be fine if I could get knife but apparently that's too much to ask. Also out of iced tea and the staff acts like you're bothering them when asking for these basics. I love Chipolte but will never go to this location again.
