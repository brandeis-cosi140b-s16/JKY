I ordered a $28 KFC bucket from this KFC/Taco Bell. I was ignored for 15 minutes while I stood at the counter. After 15 minutes I was told that they do not have the Extra Crispy chicken that I ordered. I asked for my money back and the cashier was very hesitant and insisted that I could have original or grilled instead. When the manager came over she was very prompt and polite in giving my money back. The cashier name on the receipt was 'Newbie'. I will never visit this store again.
