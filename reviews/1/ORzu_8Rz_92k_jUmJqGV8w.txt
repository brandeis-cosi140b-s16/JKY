If you have all day to sit and wait for food and drink that is just ok... run to this place.  If you expect normal service and not to wait 30 minutes for a margarita then go anywhere else.  The server was very flustered with only a few tables.  When we spoke the manager/owner, she did not care that service was bad.  They really only care for their regulars... in fact so much that regulars who walked in 30 minutes after us were invited to quickly put their order in before us.  I have visited this place twice in the last two weeks and both times I felt like an inconvenience.  If they only want to serve their regulars they should close for a private party EVERYDAY!
