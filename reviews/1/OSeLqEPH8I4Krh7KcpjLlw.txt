I went to this location tonight. As an avid Don Tortaco customer I expected the same service I would get from any other location. I was the only person in the restaurant at the time and I stood for a few minutes waiting for someone to come up and greet me. I saw them in the back eating and chatting and they looked at me a few times. After standing at the front for 10 minutes and no "hi" or no "be with you" or even a "Go away we don't wanna serve you" I asked one of the workers how they were doin and as soon as I said it he turned his head and started speaking in Spanish to someone in the drive through! I've never been so completely disrespected in my life, this isn't the first time these people have been rude as they seem to have something against you if you look Hispanic but don't address them in Spanish. I finally ended up just walking out after 15 minutes of standing there like an idiot and 3 more minutes of just plain disbelief. As someone who also works in food service I can't believe this establishment would allow people like this to work in their store and represent them. I'm so disgusted. When I got back in the car my daughter asked me why I didn't have food and I had to tell her " I guess we will go somewhere else, these guys don't want to serve me". What a terrible experience for both of us and what a bunch of low life, piece of shit scumbags. Don't support a restaurant that treats people like this. Don't go here!
