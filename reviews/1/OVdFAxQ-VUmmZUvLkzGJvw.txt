Horrible, robotic service. Limited menu if you're trying to eat healthy foods. 

I have limited options when it comes to eating out. I'm diabetic, and I manage my disease through diet and exercise - without drugs. So far, I've been very successful. 

Therefore, my rating really doesn't reflect the fact that I was disappointed in the menu options. I realize most people don't put their health first when eating out. I didn't for most of my life. 

No, the one star reflects the uncaring, robotic, demeaning service I got from their staff, other than the guy who showed me to the table and offered me chips I didn't want. 

I'm sure once they see my photo, they won't give a damn about this review, because clearly they didn't care that night whether or not I was treated like a human being, much less a customer. For whatever reasons - my age, my lack of designer clothes - the staff decided I simply didn't matter that night.

I can't remember the last time I went into a place like this and didn't leave some kind of tip, but this time I didn't. I ended up giving it to some homeless guy instead to make myself feel better. 

I left wondering if the staff is trained to ask questions and not wait for answers, That happened twice that night. That's pathetic.

I ended up just getting a salad with seared tuna. It actually wasn't that bad. But I will never go back.
