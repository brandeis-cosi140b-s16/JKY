Intrigued by the idea of a Chinese/Mexican restaurant. Since it's not actually fusion because there are separate Mex and Chinese items, you would think that they'd be masters of both Chinese and Mexican cuisine. However,  not one thing on the menu was interesting or tasty. The broth in my wonton and noodle soup was absolutely tasteless - I prefer the Sapporo Ichiban that I make for myself at home!  Don't bother with this place. It's trendy but tasteless.
