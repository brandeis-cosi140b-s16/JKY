First time here, probably my last. Worst. Taco. Bell. Ever. Enchiritos & smothered bruit to had no sauce, waited over 20 min in drive-thru, tacos were just thrown together. 

However, when I brought it back the shift manager was very apologetic and remade everything on the spot. A possible save...

Just ate the food they replaced. Horrible. All of it was lukewarm. I won't be back.
