So I tried the "new" Elvira's.  The new place is very bright and colorful, clean, nice place.  I really like the decor, but I'm afraid you just can't make a silk purse out of a sows ear.  Although our waitress was pleasant and worked hard, you could tell she was not getting much help.  I don't know what the problem was.  There are only about 15 tables and the place seems to be in complete confusion.  There were 3 or 4 waitresses, 3 to 4 bus people, one guy that helping and the rudest bartender I have ever come across.  Our waitress was running her butt off.  Our food came out in a timely fashion. THe atmosphere was just "uneasy" cause of all the confusion.  The food was kind of like Taco Bell without flavor.  Ok, I can live with that, after all, it is AJ.  We ordered Margarita and a Tom Collins.  THe margarita was your basic amateur margarita. Tequila and margarita mix.  Totally drinkable but the tom collins was a short glass, VODKA with a splash or club soda and sprite???  Oh, and don't forget the bug. A small black bug floating in it. I scooped it out, this is Az and bugs get into stuff,  but what I didn't like was the drink so I sent it back in exchange for a margarita.  That's when this ridicules "bartender" (and I use that term loosely)  came out and asked me in a very rude tone "what did I think was in a tom collins." rolled her eyes and left.  Absolutely unbelievable, we won't be back, and when I'm asked about places to eat in AJ, which I often am being a local, I will tell Elvira's is not the place to go!
