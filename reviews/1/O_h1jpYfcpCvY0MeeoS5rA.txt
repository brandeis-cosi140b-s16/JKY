A friend suggested this place to eat before the Zumanity show. The service was really good, that's a plus. Sat us at a little table outdoors, we enjoyed that.

The food was the issue! We ordered the table side guacamole, it was delicious. 

I ordered the chili rellenos....the cheese in the middle was not melted at all, it was actually a large hunk of cheese unmelted, disgusting!!The pepper itself was not cooked properly and was basically in raw form. I enjoy some crunch to my veggies but this was not cooked long enough.

The BF ordered the chimichanga and he kept biting into large "whole" basil leaves. These are used for seasoning (which is understood) but are supposed to be removed prior to consumption. When complained to the waiter we were told "the ground beef is prepared in the basement in a mass amount and they aren't able to pick out the whole basil leaves".  eww.
