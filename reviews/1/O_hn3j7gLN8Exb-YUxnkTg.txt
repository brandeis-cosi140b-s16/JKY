Wow, unfortunately what a let down.  

This was my second visit came here a while back for some drinks and had a pleasant experience I figured we'd stop again and this time try some tacos.  Place wasn't busy my any means as there were tables open. We sat at the bar top.  

The bar top was filthy, food crumbs and dirty glasses everywhere not just where we were sitting.  The bar tender came and I thought he'd wipe the top down. Nope my mistake for thinking he would do it without me having to ask.   I look over to the end of the bar and the entire corner was evidently conquered by an army of dirty dishes, pint glasses, plates, and pitchers.  The bar tender just went about his business taking orders and ignoring the mess. He brought us our beers and once again didn't even make an attempt to wipe away the previous three meals that were all over the top.  

My desire to eat quickly faded, as I wondered if they were this messy out in the open I can only imagine how filthy they are behind the scenes.   

Such a disappointment as this place has potential and I like the garage decor and feel.  But I will never go back to a place that blatantly disregards cleanliness.
