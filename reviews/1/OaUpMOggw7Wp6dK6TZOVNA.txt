So although I've never actually set foot in the place, I've taken a gander at their menu and decided this place would be a complete let down, waste of time, and money --- and here's why:

You are charged for chips and salsa... complimentary at even at the holiest of hole in the wall mexican/tex-mex restaurants.

The tacos... $2.89 for a run of the mill taco in a FLOUR tortilla? Really? And the corn tortilla taco is a TOTAL bargain at $2.49. What a joke! In real, authentic mexican restaurants - like in Chicago, you could get 3 of the most fantastic steak or al pastor tacos for under $5.

That's pretty much all I needed to see to make my decision that I would never, ever go there. That, and if the quality of their other restaurants is any indication of Texas Tubb's... yeah, keep on walkin'!
