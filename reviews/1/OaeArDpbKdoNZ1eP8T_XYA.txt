This was the first (and last) time we had eaten at this restaurant. We were at The Orleans and thought we would try it out (since TGI Fridays had a long wait). The waitress, Oralia, was very nice and got our drinks right away. The chips and salsa were nothing special. We did have to ask several times to get refills on our soda. When our food came out  all 3 of our orders were wrong. Finally after getting everything correct the food was not that great. When the bill came we saw they had charged us for a side of cheese (which we did ask for but they didn't tell us there was a charge for it) and they charged us for an item that ended up being sent back because it was wrong. We finally got the bill sorted out and went to pay the waitress, using credit cards and cash, and that became another ordeal I won't go into. Bottom line: DON'T EAT HERE!!!
