I have been to chipotles all over California (Bay Area and Southern California) and in and around the Las Vegas area and this is the only chipotle that gives you BELOW mediocre service. I have never any issues with chipotle till this one and MAN are these people STINGY as $&@?! When they give out food in anything. I have gone there 3 times at 3 different times of the day (opening, mid day, and lunch), with different people helping me and hoping it would be different. Sad to say it was the same thing. Barely any meat or anything at that in my bowl or burrito. The chipotles at Sarah/S Fort Apachie Rd AND E Haron/S Maryland have far better customer service and are very generous when it comes to putting food in their bowls/burrito. Such sad multiple experiences for a place I used to speak highly of.
