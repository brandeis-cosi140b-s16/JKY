There is no choice.   I wasted ten minutes in a slow line. I wanted pork. Good thing there was no other meat available. But at 1 in the afternoon, who would think you could still eat here?!  I looked over reviews. I thought the and half would be a very good spot.  But I can't give two starts to a place that doesn't serve half its menu..

I understand I'm in Phoenix. But my bol construction person spoke English very well when they had what I would ask for, then quickly speak Spanish when they were out of salsa, queso, chicken, beef, chili wuth Limon. ...  I can't let another person go through this place
