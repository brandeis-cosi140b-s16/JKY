Went to this location around 2:00pm on Thursday March 19th.

Line staff was arguing with cooks. Line was completely out of both rice, chicken and sour cream. Had to wait 10 minutes for a restock.
Then line staff not listening to order, had to repeat I wanted my sauce on the side twice, it was still poured on top of my burrito. Then the burrito was busted, line staff would not remake, wrapped burrito in two tin foils and put it in a bowl. Terrible experience.
