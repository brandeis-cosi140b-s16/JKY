A piece of advise do not complain about your food at Laredos.  I just left the Laredo's on Fish Hatchery Rd and was  stunned by the treatment  that my husband and I received.  I ordered Carne Asada and I couldn't cut through the meat much less chew it. The entire portion of meat was nothing but pure gristle. I felt like I was chewing leather.  I asked the waiter over to explained that the portion was inedible.  He said and I quote "What do you want me to do about it". I repeated myself because I thought he must of misunderstood.  He shrugged and I was surprised because I wasn't expecting such a response and so I stammered "um am" may speak to the manager.  His response was, "he's not here he already left.  It was six p.m.  I then asked to speak to the person in charge.  He left the table and  I saw him go over to speak a fellow waiter and he  turned around and gave us the dirtiest look.  I was more flabbergasted by the fact that they seemed offended that I didn't like the food.  My husband and I have eaten at this location several times and I can say that in general we are very generous tippers and have been to this same waiter and we certainly didn't expect to treated in this way.  Anyway to sum  up my disappointment, in their "generosity" they gave us a $4.00 discount off our bill.  More laughable is that when he brought our bill he asked if I wanted a box!  LOL!!  We will never go back, not because the food was atrocious, but because of the treatment after the fact.  Some establishments just  don't understand that 9 times out of 10 patrons are willing to over look bad food but never bad service
