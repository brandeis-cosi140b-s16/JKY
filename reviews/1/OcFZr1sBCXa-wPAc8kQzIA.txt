Writing this as I'm waiting in the drive thru line going on 25 minutes now with only 3 cars in front of me. The young lady taking our order had to repeat it at least 5 times (we only ordered two items.) We wouldn't have as much of a problem until we got to the window and Mr. Jonathan handed is our food. We asked what took so long and this was his answer "it was only me dude and I had the girls on break." we will not be back here for a long time. Thanks for the ridiculous wait, lack of not only professionalism but customer service as well. We'll be sure to fill out the lovely survey on the receipt
