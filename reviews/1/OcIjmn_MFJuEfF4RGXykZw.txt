My husband ordered Shredded beef nachos with no guacamole, a chicken soft taco, and a #2 . However, we got nachos with JUST CHEESE AND GUACAMOLE, a CARNITAS soft taco and a #2. He didn't realize until he got home and when I checked the receipt, it was entered correctly yet they still got it wrong. This is the 2nd time this has happened and I'm done. Lost my business!
