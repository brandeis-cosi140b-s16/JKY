Legitimately the worst Mexican food I've had in Charlotte. Possibly the worst Mexican food I've ever had. Tacos were cold, soggy and tasted microwaved. I think they might have given me an order that was sent back and was being held. The rice was pretty decent. I took my food to work because I didn't want to waste it, gave it to some friends and it was promptly thrown away.
