The only positive thing I can say about this place is their green chile is good. If you love bad service and rude employees then you'll love this place. 

They are also never open when they say they are , but if you call they at least have a recording that tells you what time they open. They close at random times so don't even follow that picture that says "New Hours." For example just today I was craving the burrito I show up at 430 ( they're supposed to close at 5) and there are people in there but the door is locked, and they just look at you like your dumb for trying the door. On a separate occasion it was 10 til close and they just "ran out" of food. 

On several occasions I have seen the staff ,including the "owner" ,be rude to customers for no reason. I know it's a hole in the wall but you don't have a right to be a dick to anyone. Needless to say I will never go there again. Thanks for the awful service.
