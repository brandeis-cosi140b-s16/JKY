The service was rude and they were a rip off. $2 per taco..6 small tacos for $12. The cashier wasn't courteous at all and I kept having to repeat what three different types of tacos I wanted. 

Tacos weren't good at all...they had a condiment bar with flys all around. Not recommended at all, you're better off going to Taco Bell. BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!
