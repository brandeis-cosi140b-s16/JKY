I've eaten here semi-regularly for a while. As others have mentioned, it's a good spot for drunken, after-bar snacks. I work nearby and sometimes stop in for a cheap lunch. The food is not good quality but it's also not terrible. I wasn't disappointed because I knew what I was in for. Before my experience yesterday, I probably would have given the place 3 stars. 

However, yesterday I stopped in hungry and thirsty after a long bike ride. I ordered some food and asked for water along with my meal. The guy on the register (who I think was the manager) insisted that I buy an overpriced bottle of water. I pointed out that they have plastic cups by the register and a water dispenser on their soda fountain. He replied "Hey, we don't GIVE AWAY water, we SELL water." I think that's ridiculous. I'm not going to buy an overpriced bottle or pay for a sugary soda when there is a water dispenser right there. I was about to spend $6-7 on food, so it's no skin off your back to give me a 5 cent cup and enough water to fill it (costs less than 1 cent from the tap.) I walked out without buying anything and I won't be back. I think this restaurant is under new management, which might explain their change in attitude. I hope the new people figure out that being friendly and offering good value is the way to keep customers, not being rude cheapskates. I advise everyone to stay away from this place. The mediocre food is not worth the poor service.
