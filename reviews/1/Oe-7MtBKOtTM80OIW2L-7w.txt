I wish there was an option for zero stars. They ran out of chicken and apparently every nacho ingredient. When our order came out, the nachos were smothered in ranch and jalapenos with a scoop of guac. It did not resemble the menu item aside from the chips. No silverware and we had to get our own napkins. By far the worst dining experience of all time. They did change the tv for me so thats a plus.
