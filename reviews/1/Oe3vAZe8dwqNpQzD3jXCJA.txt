Worst place I've ever ate at in my life! $35 for TWO people & the food was complete shit.
I had a cheese tortilla(TCT) & my husband had chicken tamales. 
The TCT was so greasy I could barely eat it & my husbands chicken tamales weren't even cooked. The meat was PINK!!

A car full of ladies were holding us up from getting into our car & when all 6 piled out they asked, "how was your dinner." I replied, "it was terrible & I would never recommend this place to anyone!" 5 of them started walking away & one lady kept talking & said one of the ladies that walked away was the OWNER! Not even a I'm sorry your dinner was bad what can we do to make it better....

We came from BOULDER CITY cause I'm 7 months pregnant & was craving Mexican food so we had a date night there.
After reading a lady had a COCKAROACH in her tamale & the chicken wasn't cooked in my husbands, I think this place needs to get reported to the health department so I will gladly be doing so.  just looking at his tamale made me want to THROW UP!
