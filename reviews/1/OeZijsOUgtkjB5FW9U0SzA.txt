Terrible. We ordered take out and upon paying realized that they charged us $0.50 for each item that we ordered because it was to-go...it wasn't a huge deal but annoying since they didn't mention that when we ordered. We also thought that maybe it was for the containers, but they packed everything into as few containers as possible. 

Once we got home we opened the containers and were bitterly disappointed. I ordered a side each of rice and beans ($2.95 each) and received maybe a couple spoonfuls of each. My boyfriend ordered Chile Colorado ($10.25) and received less food than a typical kids meal. 

If the food was good, it might be worth the price but it certainly wasn't. We won't be returning.
