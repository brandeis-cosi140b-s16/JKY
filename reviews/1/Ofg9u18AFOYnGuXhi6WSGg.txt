I use to the this place but the management is horrible. I go there often but my last three visit were terrible. 1. I dined in and the waitress brought me a water, as I go to drink it there was a bee inside. I tell her and the manager tried to tell me the bee came through a CLOSED door, which I knew was wrong because the bee was settled inside my drink. He take the drink brings it back to show me the bee again to make more excuses but eventually let me get my beverage for free (margarita). 2. My friend went to pick up some burritos, when she got home I realized they never gave her my food (they put two containers in the bag so she thought it was there) I call they blame her. When I went to pick up my food he had just put it on the table and once again blamed me, I stated you just made the food you never gave it to her. Wasted time and time, no compensation.  3. My last time going!!! I call in my order, when I went in he gave me my food and something told me to check it WASNT CORRECT. I go back in he said no it's all in there as if I was wrong. He didn't listen went back to "fix" it and still brought it back wrong. The manager is rude and shouldn't manager a bathroom
