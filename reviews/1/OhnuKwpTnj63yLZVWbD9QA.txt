My husband and I go here every now and then. The first time we were there we got the pork and loved it!! In fact, overall the food is good. I think they have some of the best chips around and they have good salsa. In fact, if it was just for the food I would give this four stars. 

So why did I give them one?! Well, it has to do with the service and not necessarily the wait staff. I have loved the waitress and waiters we have had (except for one). Our second time there we sat in the dining room and the service was soooo slow. What made it worse was I could see my waiter doing nothing but talking (I haven't seen the waiter since). We have sat in the bar ever since so it hasn't been an issue. Our last visit we ordered the fried ice cream which was delicious until we found a hair!!! Ugh. The next time we ordered an entree to split and sure enough, another hair! Honestly this one was sitting right on top and we hadn't started eating yet so it wasn't a huge deal, the waitress immediately took it and got us a new one! However, when the owner brought us the new entree there was not so much as an apology!!! I wasn't looking for a discount or anything but to not even acknowledge the grossness of what happened made me so upset. Needless to say we won't be back, which is a bummer because there food is good. Hopefully they see this and start making the kitchen staff wear hair and beard nets (we saw the chef and there was no net).
