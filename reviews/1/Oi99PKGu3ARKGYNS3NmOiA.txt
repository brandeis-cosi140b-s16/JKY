I have to say that the service was excellent. Our waiter Luis was very nice. But the food was awful. My husband had a torta with pulled beef, except the shredded  lettuce and tomatoes looked like they have been cooked with the beef instead of being fresh and crispy. Also the queso that was brought out before the meal tasted old, not freshly made. I will never go back.
