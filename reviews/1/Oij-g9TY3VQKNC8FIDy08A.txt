Underwhelming Mexican food and absolutely horrible service.   I have no idea why some people like this place.   The food is all about heat rather than flavorful taste.  Nothing is super fresh, unique or even memorable.    It's like eating Mexican food at Macayo's, which is also mediocre, but adding heat to the food.  To top it all off this was the worst service I've had at a restaurant in years.   I'm talking painfully slow.   No refills unless we asked, no ordering unless we asked, no check unless we asked, and after we asked we had to remind them once or twice.   Good grief it's like they don't even want the business.    This place should become a bar and forget about serving food.   Meh!
