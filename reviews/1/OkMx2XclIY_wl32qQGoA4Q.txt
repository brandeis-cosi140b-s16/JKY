The food is okay but the service is horrible. They won't even accept their own coupons and claim that companies put out fake coupons. This was from the owner himself. Lying to my face. Dine4AZ isn't a fake coupon site. But that's what he said when he decided he didn't want to take the coupon. Seriously?? And the coupon? For a free cheese crisp with purchase of an entree. Oh yea - and we had a party of 30 PEOPLE. Won't ever go back being treated like that.
