I purchased a coupon from restaurant.com the other week. You pay a certain amount depending on the increment and then you have to order a bill twice as much as whatever increment you got, mine was $15 so I was ready to order $30 of food. It took me that long to use it because they aren't open on weekends and they close at 5. I finally got to go today and no one was attending the register. When she saw me she came up, I showed her my coupon and she rolls her eyes and says to wait and leaves, another woman comes up and says that its old and they aren't doing that anymore, the woman tried to hang onto my coupon and I grabbed it from her. If she calls the number on there it will make my coupon invalid and I will lose the $15. my mom who was with me asked when they expire and I showed her where it said it never expires. Yea right! I can't comment on the food because after that visit I wasn't going to buy anything from there.
