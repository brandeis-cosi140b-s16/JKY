I've been here a couple times and the staff are nice, until this time. I ordered a cantina bowl and paid .65 extra for ranch..... I also ordered two chalupas and asked for it w/ no tomatoes and a loaded griller (beefy nacho). First off, the salad in the cantina bowl was definitely not fresh. Secondly, I didn't get ranch for my bowl including the extra one that I paid for, so I had to go back and ask for it. Third, my chalupa was not fresh and was soggy and not crunchy like before. And there was tomatoes on it!! And lastly, the loaded griller was hard, not fresh, and tasted disgusting. My boyfriend couldn't finish it. I know it's a fast food joint but this time it disappointed me.
