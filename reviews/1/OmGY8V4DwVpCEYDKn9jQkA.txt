I love the Chipotle franchise but I will have to find a new location. The last two times I have been to this one they have been extremely stingy on portion size.  The portion of barbacoa I received today was the equivalent to a meat portion at Taco Bell but without the value. I pay 9 dollars and change for my bowl (2 dollars extra for the guacamole), I don't think it is unreasonable to expect more generous portions.  The elderly hispanic lady and the younger hispanic man with glasses were the two employees on the line and both were very skimpy with their servings.  My daughter's chicken burrito was also on the small side.  I'll have to drive further to another location to get mu money's worth.
