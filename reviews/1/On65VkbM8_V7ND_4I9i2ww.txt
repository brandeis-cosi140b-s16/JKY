We ended up here completely by accident. We were running out of time to watch a show and decided to check this place out because it didn't seem too busy for a Saturday evening.  First we entered the restaurant via the Quad. Upon entering we approached the hostess stand where 2 hostesses were standing. Neither one greeted my girlfriend and I and had my girlfriend not said said anything, who knows how long we would  been standing there.  We were seated immediately. The server was polite and helpful taking our drink orders immediately and giving us ample time to peruse the menu.  

Now for the drinks, my girlfriend ordered the Don margarita and ordered another cocktail called the Office. Drinks were pricey at $14 each but I guess it was to be expected on the strip.  We weren't too impressed with them and ended up ordering 2 beers.  We ordered chips and salsa ($3) & for our meals,  my girlfriend ended up ordering the Manchego burger ($16) and I ordered the carnitas ($13 for 3).  The chips weren't bad and the salsa was tasty with just enough kick to be able to enjoy it.  My girlfriends burger was tasty and nicely seasoned with a side of fries. The carnitas however, were tasteless and extremely oily! Initially I thought what I was seeing was the lime juice I had squeezed over them, but I realized it was oil and I literally had to pick up each taco and tilt it to drain the oil.  I held each taco up for at least 10 seconds before I attempted to eat them.
Total bill before tip $79.99.  Overall, service was ok at best & the food - nothing to get excited about. We agreed the best thing was the chips & salsa.  Would we come here again? No...and neither would we recommend this place to anyone looking for good Mexican food. Sorry.
