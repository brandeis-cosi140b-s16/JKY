Thick stale chips, slow service, rude server, menu was lacking in choices. Taco,burrito,enchiladas.  About 2 maybe 3 choices each. Food its lacking flavor, and appeal.   Maybe dinner is better, but lunch its a bust in my book.
  There we 2 of in our party for lunch, we both had the same dishes, the exception was I had beef and the other guest had chicken.  They ended up getting food poisoning from the chicken.
  This is not a place to come if you are limited on time.
  I will not be coming back to this location for any reason.
