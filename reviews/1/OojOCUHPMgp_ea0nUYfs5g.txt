Waited 3 months for this place to open so when it finally did I rushed in! How disappointing. I ordered 1 lg chips and salsa, 2 steak tacos, and 1 reg drink. How do you average almost $13.00 for that? The tacos were the size of your palm, literally. There was almost nothing on them. I guess that's why they make it with two tortillas to make up for the lack of food you pay for. The manager looked like she was intimidating the girl making my food so she was scared to put anything on it. Not worth $3.25 + tax a piece. The chips were good but mind you it was a large. They gave me a 4 oz salsa cup filled up to 2 oz. To top off the whole visit the manager had her kids there working. There was a little boy, had to be no older than 8-9, come out from the kitchen to the front. No hairnet but was wearing gloves? As a 10 1/2 year culinary chef I know that this is obviously unsanitary and illegal. I wonder if the owner is aware of what is going on over there? I've heard many people talk about this place and every one of them has said that they're not going back. I felt like I got ripped off to make up for building costs' of the place. What a joke.
