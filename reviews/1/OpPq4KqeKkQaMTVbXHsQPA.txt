I don't know about the night crew. I order chicken tacos. The cook dropped my tacos in the grease and proceeded to scoop raw carne asada from a drawer that had the metal scoop already in it. After butting the scoop back in the meat and placing it on the grill he starts putting lettuce and cheese on my tacos. Uhhh. No. No. No bro. That's not gonna work. I told the person behind the counter and rather than address the issue and offer to make it right he flat out asked if I wanted my money back. Rude! I sure do tho.
