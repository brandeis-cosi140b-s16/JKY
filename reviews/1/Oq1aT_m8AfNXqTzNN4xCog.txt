I have been to this one many different times as it right down the street from my house and it is on the way home from school. I love taco bell; however every time I go to this location it is like there is something major wrong. 
At first I thought that it was because I went during an off time, I used to work at a Taco Bell in CA and know that food only stays good for so long and during off times you will end up with the end of the containers or you will end up with gross old food.

So I did not write a review because it was just my timing. I waited and went at a busy high traffic time; and still was not happy with the quality of the food.

Every time I order the soft taco supreme they are always like wet and stuck to the wrapper, with the meat soaking through the wrapper. Thought at first this was me because it took me a whole 10 mins to get home; so the last time I actually just drove out of the drive-thru and sat in car and looked tacos they were already like that; I order mine special so that they cant use the premade stuff; yes as employees we would pre-make some of the most popular items to make it easy to give out, like the soft tacos; pinto and cheese.  

The beans on the nachos every time where cold and so gross! I am just wishing that they would pull it together because it is on my way and super convenient when I want something before I hit home.
