I really hate to give a place a bad review, but Spanish Fly EARNED a bad one today.

Drinks were served in a dirty plastic glass.  Water spots all over the glass.  While we were sitting at the bar, the barmaid knocked over a large quantity of red straws (twice) and then picked them up off the floor to use them.

We were there for happy hour.  When my bill arrived we were charged $9.00 for each glass of wine.  When I asked the barmaid about the charge, she informed me that wine is not part of their happy hour.  I have NEVER been to any place offering a happy hour were wine was excluded.

Strong chance that I will never be back.
