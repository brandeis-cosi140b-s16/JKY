Let me start by saying the food is always average but so convenient that we have frequented this place on a weekly basis since they opened. 

Well, last night we went and it was a little bit busy - 5-6 orders before us. I ordered a simple order of two kids meals (bean burro and quesadilla) and a red chili plate. It was to be "for here". The time on my receipt is 7:07pm. 

Finally, my 4 year old asked if we were ever going to eat, I looked at the time and it was 7:44. I went and asked about our food. They had no idea, no food ticket, nothing. Two of the girls argued over who lost the ticket. Finally they reprinted my ticket. I had to wait for two other people to get their food before, finally at 7:56 receiving my food - TO GO. I told them it was supposed to be for here. The girl looks at the ticket all confused. I told her nevermind, grabbed our food and headed home. We live 3 minutes from the shop.

We got home, opened our COLD food and ate! 

I called this morning to give them a chance to make this right and Dehlia, the manager, told me she would have to talk to "her girls" to see what happened. She never took my phone number to call me back or anything. She could not care less about this.

With three other mexican restaurants in the same shopping center, I suggest Villas starts caring about their customer service.
