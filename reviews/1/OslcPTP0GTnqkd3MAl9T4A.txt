The worst experience I have ever eaten. Been here few times and keep giving them a chance to make my meal experience better but after I come back here, I regret giving a chance and wasted my money and time for a food that doest even know how to cook a simple breakfast burrito.

 my bf and I went and order there breakfast burrito (steak,egg,and potato) it was the tasteless food I have ever eaten. No flavor at all. I had to put alot of hot sauce and lots of ketchup just to add flavor to my food. The food was horrible... 

Don't ever come to this filiberto!! You would regret it....
