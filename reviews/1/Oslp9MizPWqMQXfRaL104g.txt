So i stopped by to support the local business, well everything went wrong. the staff seemed very confused like they didnt know how to help me, I ordered their nachos with chicken, everything about them were horrible, the chicken was greasy and the chips and cheese were like the kind you get at a gas station, overall really bad food for a restaurant thats supposed to be family owned. ill stick to tacos n more
