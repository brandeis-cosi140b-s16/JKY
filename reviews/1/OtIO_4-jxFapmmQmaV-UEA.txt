This may be in an airport, but their service has no right to be anywhere. Where is the zero stars? The workers are so slow and they are consistently arguing in front of everyone. When an order is ready for pickup,  they slide the tray over after slamming it on the counter in disgust to actually have to do some work. No wonder one of the trays fell on the floor. Instead of correcting it, they argued and didn't want to clean it up. The whole time I was watching this circus act, I glanced next door to the sandwich place that I should have went to. Too bad I was craving a chicken burrito with almost no chicken. It was more like a refried bean and cheese burrito. All I tasted was tortilla with their watery tasting beans. Absolutely one of the worst places I have ever eaten at, even for airport food standards. I never will come back here. I rather starve on the airplane and pay the ridiculous snack prices onboard. Stay away at all costs! I haven't even ate next door, but I'll recommend that place over this one. (Terminal 4 Gate C, next to gates C1-C9)
