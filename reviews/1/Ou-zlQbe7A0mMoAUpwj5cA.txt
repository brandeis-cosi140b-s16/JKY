I'm not one to complain about food & have never had a problem with this location till recently. Not only did they skimp out on the quantity of the food but, the quality as well. I don't think I will be returning to this location no matter how convenient it is.

Not to mention their burritos at this location is like 1/2 or 1/3 the size of all the other locations that I've visited. 

I don't think I've ever been this dissatisfied with any Roberto's Taco Shop location!
