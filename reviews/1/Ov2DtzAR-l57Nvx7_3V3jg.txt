Had a party for 9 today at lunch. Took 40 mins for our food to arrive. We advised our waiter Harry ahead of time that we were on a work lunch break and if we could get our check with our food. Asked for Togo boxes with our food those never came had to go get them. Our checks were not ready had to wait on. My taco of whole bean rice and lettuce was wrong sent back then still wrong. And for one taco it apparently cost $4.27. When I wanted to changed my form of payment from a card to cash I was snapped at by Harry for messing up his order there were 3 cards there including mine. At no point were we ever apologized too for the late food. A sorry about that would have gone along way. The other girls said the food was good but would never go when your in a hurry.  We were at lunch for a special occasion and it was dampened by the poor services we received!
