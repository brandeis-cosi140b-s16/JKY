I just went to Havana Grill for the first time and sadly it will be my last. I did not personally get to order any of their food off of the menu, however I did get to try their free bread they give you before your meal is delivered and I have to say that was tasty. I also ordered their passion mojito and that was good albeit pricey. 

My bad experience was with the staff of the restaurant. We were in a semi-large group of people sitting on the patio, ordering lots of appetizers, food and alcohol. Apparentely there was an incident up front with one person of our group (who wouldn't turn his hat around) and they kicked him out. We had no idea that incident took place and the General Manager stormed back to our table and told us to all leave. We were treated so horribly and were being screamed at by the GM (can you say embarrasing?!) and we had no clue what was even going on. We had to leave that second with our drink cups full, food still on our plate AND still had to pay our bills with the 18% gratuity conveniently tacked on the check. 

I have filed a complaint with the owner and will never step foot in there again. If you are brave enough to give it a shot then I can only hope your experience is better than mine. Such a disappointment...
