My husband and I visited this past Sunday for a quick lunch at about 3pm.  There was no wait, but still about 5 people working the line.  I had a Barbacoa burrito bowl and my husband had the carnitas soft tacos.  We also ordered a bag of chips and guacamole.  We proceeded to sit, and while 90% of the tables were empty, they were all filthy.  The one clean table was a large booth table, so we sat at it.  After a few minutes my husband looked down and said he saw vomit he kept stepping in.  I think it was salsa smeared in with dirt, either way it was gross.  So we scooted over and ate pressed against eachother at a table large enought for at least 6 people.

The food...  First off, neither of us were able to locate a piece of meat that was not covered in fat or a gnarly thing.  We went through over a dozen napkins, discreetly spitting out meat that we could not chew.  We had some chips and guacamole, but noticed the chips were only salted; they did not have the flavor of lime that they usually have.  The gucamole was not as chunky as I remember, it was almost like store bought gucamole.  I love their rice with lime in it, but again, it was bland and tasted just like white rice.  We gave up and didn't finish our meals and left.

After shopping, 10 visits to the bathroom, and a few hours, we vowed to never eat Chipotle again.
