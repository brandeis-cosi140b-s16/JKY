Wow where do I begin with this train wreck of a place...What ever you do STAY AWAY! Just returned from lunch and it was quite literally a joke..The single worst experience in recent memory...Taco Haus was the last place we hated this much and it closed in 6 months..We think Fogon will maybe make it a month...From service to the food it's as if the people there have no idea what is going on..bizarre! The investors should go in and fire everyone this afternoon and hire professionals. Suffice to say they aren't even trying and they have only been open a week...Adios Fogon you won't be missed!
