Came here around 6:30PM and door is closed. Hours on yelp says 9am-9pm. So what the heck. There is no sign of their hours on the door or even a close or open sign. Lol. Tried to call the phone number they have here on yelp but no answer, just goes on the voicemail. ugh. Will update once I get to try their food.
