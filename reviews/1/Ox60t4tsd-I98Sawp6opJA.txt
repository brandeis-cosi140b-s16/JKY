To be clear, this review is for this location, and not Chipotle in general. Not surprising the ingredients were good (Chipotle has excellent consistency in their prep) but the meals that were created for us left much to be desired. We ordered on-line with some fairly basic customization and received food that was poorly put together and hugely disproportionate. I ordered a carnitas burrito with light rice, light sour cream, light cheese, and extra veggies. None of that happened. I got not cheese, TONS of rice, sour cream bursting out of an unclosed seam in the burrito, and very few veggies. 

Guys, I get that some people come to Chipotle specifically for a very large burrito, but if you can't wrap the guts the thing is made wrong. You have great ingredients to works from, show them even a modicum of respect and the end result will be much better. 

I get that this is probably an unconventional review of a Chipotle location but I was sorely disappointed with my meal tonight and I very seriously doubt I will frequent this particular location again.
