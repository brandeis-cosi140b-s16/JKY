The food is excellent.  The staff is VERY stingy with the lids to there salsa.  I bought 25 dollars worth of take out and they would only let me have 3 salsa lids so each person getting food barely had any salsa.  I asked them to buy more and they would not.  It was really disappointing because the food was so good.  I won't be going back because I like salsa with my food.  If you don't like salsa then your fine. Not giving enough lids Really cheapens this place.  They have lots of customers you would assume they can afford to give you salsa.  I think over time they will really get hurt by this.
