The food from the moment we walked in did not look to good, but after working for 13 hours I just needed to eat. I ordered the sweet pork barb burrito. The rice looked kinda yellow with green splotchs of i guess a vegtable. They were out of black beans and they brought out more cut the bag of beans open and poured them in the heating trays, very classy. He scooped a little rice, the a heaping portion of the bagged beans, on top, Then a descent sized portion of meat, the only good thing I will say about my experience there. Then the order taker kept insisting I get the sauce on my burrito I dont like sauce a lot, on or in, my burrito but after three attempts to say no sauce, I gave in and aaid a little on the inside, I got A LITTLE  on the inside and hit me a dollar for my dab of sauce. Now I feel like a sucker. The yellow rice was under cooked, the beans were to many. The order taker made a sloppy wet burrito and backdoored a dollar. The kitchen floor needed to be cleaned. Even the cute girl at the register was rude and to distracted to take the money out of my hand. My first experience will be my last
