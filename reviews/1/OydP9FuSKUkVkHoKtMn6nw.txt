I've NEVER seen my husband almost spit out his food before. It was horrible.
Their menu is tiny (but do-able since it's the staples of Mexican food) but decently priced. Until we got the food. 
The waitress forced a to-go box on us after asking if we wanted one and we said no. Normally, one would notice the untouched food and the customer not requesting a to-go box and question the meal, but there was no concern for quality here.
We'll never return.
