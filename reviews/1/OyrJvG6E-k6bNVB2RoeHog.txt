I visited Two Hippies several months ago and was so unimpressed that I didn't even bother to Yelp about it until now during a "new restaurant" dry spell (Read: I'm broke.)  In my experience, tacos are one of the most foolproof foods around, mostly because I love them for their simplicity.  The tacos at Two Hippies were so bland that I didn't even bother to finish the second one.  My boyfriend said his carne asada burrito was decent, but I think steak just makes him happy.  I understand from recent reviews that Two Hippies is under new management.  But, I won't personally be going out of my way to try them again.
