One star for: 
Great tasking House Margarita, however expensive ($10.50) and small (maybe 5 oz.).
Patio seating on the roof was great for fall.

But:
My "Vegetarian Chile Relleno" was stuffed with chicken.
Our waitress didn't bring a drink to my kid after he asked for water.
Slow service on the roof. 
Food is overpriced by about 20%. (I know it's Carefree, but it's silly.)
