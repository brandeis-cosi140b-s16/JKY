Visited this place on Sunday for their brunch menu, since we purchased a deal on Groupon. As soon as we walk in, there were no host/hostess, 2nd in line and 2 other groups behind us. The waiter comes by and tells us to sit wherever we want. We grab a table and it takes the waiter 15mins before coming by with a menu. No water or asking us for drink orders. We get up and show the other waiter our coupon and he tells us to help ourselves to the buffet bar. It's a small bar with about 7 dishes, There are no plates! and 3 of the 7 dishes were empty!!! we waited for 5 mins and there is a line of 5 people, finally get the plates and only thing to eat was some fajita mix, mostly veggies, beans and potatoes. ugh! so we get back to our table and finish what we have and waiter finally comes by and asks us for our drink order. We order margaritas and menudo. That took about 15mins. finally get our drinks and waited another 10mins for menudo. Menudo came in a big shallow bowl, mostly homini corn, white with a bland taste. Throughout this whole time, we watched at least 6 group of people walk out. The waiter kept saying how busy it was and they weren't planning on the groupon coupon to take effect on Sunday and they weren't prepared. I was like REALLY???? 1st rule in running a restraunt!!!! be prepared. This place is unoraganized, food is not good at all, go elsewhere.
