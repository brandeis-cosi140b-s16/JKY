I used to go to this place fairly often. The last time I went will definitely be my last. I ordered nachos and a chicken quesadilla. After paying (almost $20), I asked for some cups for the salsa bar. I was given two cups and after walking away, I went back to ask for more cups. After all, the salsa bar selection was one of my favorite things about this place. I was told that I was only allowed to have two salsa cups and would not be given any more. Even when I offered to pay for them! It was a fun time being your customer since you opened, Taco y Taco. Sorry it had to this way.
