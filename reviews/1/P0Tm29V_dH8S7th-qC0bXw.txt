We had some friends visiting from out of town one night who wanted to meet us there. Since it's constantly being raved about by the locals, and it's not too far from home, I had no problems trying them out. Might as well see if the other Mexican place in town is good as well, right? Yeah, I was not impressed. We were stuck in a corner and practically ignored all night. My husband and I both ordered steaks, which were pretty bland. Everything just kinda felt like it had been pre-made ahead of time, then stuck in a microwave and heated up. Mine was supposed to come with tortillas, yet I was never asked my preference between corn or flour, and never brought tortillas. Even though my meal was presented in a way that would have benefited from the tortillas. We were also never offered proper knives, and with no waiter in sight, we were forced to eat our steaks with butter knives. You likely won't see me back there any time soon. Which is disappointing. I really wanted to like this place.
