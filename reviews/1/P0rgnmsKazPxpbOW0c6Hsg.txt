I have been to over 10 Moe's across the US and this is by far the worst location (this includes the location in NYC Penn Station).

Burrito was very small, to say they skimped on ingredients would be an understatement. They have even managed to obstruct your view of the assembly line so don't see how little food you are actually getting. Additionally, the salsa renditions were not the same as other Moe's locations. The salsa they had tasted old.
