The waiter did not speak much English, as well as she could not explain the menu in Spanish. When she put our order on the table, a cockroach that was obviously at the bottom of the plate started running on the table towards my friend. I looked around there were bugs and crickets marching around on the floor. We spoke to the cook, who spoke some English and he acted like it was quite normal for the cockroaches to be there. He said that it was Arizona; it was normal for Arizona. I can only imagine what is going on in the kitchen. I could not eat not only at their restaurant, but anywhere for the rest of the day.
