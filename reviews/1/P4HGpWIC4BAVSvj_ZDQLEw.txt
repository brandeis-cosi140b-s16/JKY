I've always wanted to try Moe's! Grand opening was great especially since all the big wigs were there! The next time I went the steak was dried out, the food was not consistent and what really ticks me off is that they measure every little piece of food in my burrito yet it comes with guac yet I barely got any. The staff doesn't seem to know what is going on and most of the food was either over cooked or under cooked such as the rice for my burrito. I really wanted to like this place but I guess growing up in LA and used to REAL Mexican food, this place is too American for me and the lack of flavors or creativity leaves a lot to desire!
