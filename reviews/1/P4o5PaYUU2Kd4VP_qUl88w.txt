The worst food I have ever had in my entire life. 

I had the enchilada plate and it was disgusting. The rice was half cooked and tasted like some little kid TRIED to cook Hamburger Helper and FAILED miserably. The enchilada was cold and tasted like mush. 

I usually eat everything in front of me- I love food that much- but this restaurant served microwave food (at least it tasted like it). I could not even finish half of my plate.

The chips and salsa and guacamole did not have enough flavor. This food is overall not edible. The waitress was too busy watching tv and was difficult to get her attention.

I went to Pasqual's because I had friends from the area who grew up going there and recommended it. Well, the food was awful. I think people who still go there and think the food is ok, I'm sure it's just the nostalgic effect of going there at lunch in high school or something. Anyone with taste buds minus the sentimental effect, would not even finish the food they order from this restaurant. 

Save your money and just buy TV dinner if you really want shitty food like served in this restaurant. You even have to pay for chips and salsa. Puhleaseeeee get over yourself Pasqual's!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
