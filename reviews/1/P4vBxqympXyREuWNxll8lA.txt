This place is horrible. I just made a yelp account so I can tell you to not come here. I support local businesses but this food was inedible. We ordered two carne asada burritos which were bland which is fine. What I have a problem with is the meat. It was so tough and tendinous. The entire burrito was filled with the junk that you cut out of meat while trimming it. Ugh just awful. Name any other Mexican place and I would rather eat there. Hell I rather drink a glass of water than eat here. Save your money!
