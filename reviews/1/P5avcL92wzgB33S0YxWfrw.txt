I went once and I will never go back again. The service was horrible. The waiter did not speak English well and kept pointing at whoever he was talking to when taking our order. The margaritas were syrup-ie and not very good. The worse part was the food. The food did not taste like Mexican food and none of us (there were four of us) liked what we ordered. I will never go here again after that first experience. Don't recommend going here at all.
