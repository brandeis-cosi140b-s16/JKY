Praying I don't get food poisoning after this... I was SO excited for a cafe rio here. Unfortunately, total bust. Terrible, slow service. Got home and stared eating, the noticed something chewy. I pulled a piece of Saran Wrap out of my mouth. A wadded up piece. Yes. Saran Wrap. And no, my salad wasn't wrapped with Saran Wrap. Disgusting. Stay away from this place.
