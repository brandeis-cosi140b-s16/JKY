I honestly don't know where the 4.5 stars came from. This place wasn't that great. l always start out with steak tacos, if a place has can prepare good tacos then its other plates are worth a try. The tacos were mediocre, they weren't delicious nor inedible. The steak was cut in too large of pieces, the seasoning was never added, the salsa was watered down and flavorless. I wasn't full so I processed to order enchiladas. I had two bites no more, there is a handful of other places to go to for better mexican food.
