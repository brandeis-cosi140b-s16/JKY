I have this place another try after the manager or owner messaged me. This place is still dirty. The food gave two people in my party sickness. The staff washed windows instead of refilling our drinks. I didn't see them wash their hands before handling food. The service was also slow. The worst service and food around. Not to mention the rat poop I saw the time before that....
