NEVER AGAIN!  6 of 8 of our party arrived.  There were plenty of tables available.  They would not seat us.  So we waited at bar.  7 of 8 arrived, they still WOULD NOT SEAT US.  When the 8 person in our group arrived they had no tables and told us there would be probably an hour wait.  POOR MANAGEMENT!  I WILL NEVER GO BACK.  We went to Kassab's across the st. their grape leaves were FANTASTIC.  Go to Emeliano's if you want mexican in the SS.
