If I was able to give 0 stars I would. This place has thee WORST customer service EVER and may I add there are servers/server  that are quite prejudice. 
Throughout my business travel in & out of CLT weekly for the past two years I much rather grab food at any other restaurant prior to arriving at CLT as the selection is crap & once you think you see a great place such as this one, you are in for a terrible surprise.
I ate here twice the only reason I went the 2nd time is because management contacted me after I complained & left my business card & I was left assured that this wasn't the type of service that the restaurant was built on (my terrible prejudice experience). 
Low & Behold let me explain my 2nd visit, it went a lil something like this:
I entered the restaurant & because it's seat yourself I found a cozy seat on the back wall where tables to my left & right were empty. I begin to sip my FiJi (water already on the tables for purchase) & watched servers go around & around on this very unbusy day & not one checking on me or acknowledging me. I began to think I sat in a bogus section & proceeded to pack my things up to move until two groups of ppl walked in & sat at the tables next to me. As quick as they sat someone was there to serve them & greet them which prompted me to ask if there was a different server for the middle table? I was again ignored & then that was followed by the waitress asking "is there anything I cab get you" I replied "definitely I would like proper customer service as the other guest who are not of my race are receiving" she rolled her eyes up into her thin blonde head & said "would you like something to drink"? I smiled, declined & exited the restaurant to NEVER return again in LIFE not even if I'm stuck in CLT & starving as the food wasn't that tasty anyhow (I ate my 1st visit & only returned because of my phone call from the manager & the good margarita I had).
