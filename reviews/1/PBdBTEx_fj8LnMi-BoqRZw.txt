Surroundings were very festive, but the music was blaring. I ordered one shredded beef taco with rice & beans, my friend ordered a cheese enchilada. I was served a hamburger taco in a pre-made taco shell (the kind out of a box) with the smallest serving of rice & beans I have ever gotten at a Mexican restaurant. My friend was served the same exact thing. She did not send hers back, but I did (If I am going to eat a hamburger taco, I will make it at home, NOT pay $9.95!). I could swear the waiter rolled his eyes as he picked up my plate. I will never go back here again, and I usually will give a place a second shot. Do yourself a favor, if you want a delicious Mexican food meal, go to Nando's or Manuel's!
