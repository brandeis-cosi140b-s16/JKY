I hadn't been here in a while so thought I'd try them again, this time for breakfast at 8:30AM on a Saturday.  Ordered the Mexican breakfast and it was listed as coming with rice & beans on the drive through sign but I never received them.

Have you ever been burned at a drive through, only to find out the dissappointment when you open the bag and are too far down the road to turn around?  Well, this was one of those times of getting burned - in more than one sense.

I received a breakfast burrito that was scorched.  
I mean this in the most literal sense, the exterior of the burrito was speckled with black marks the size of a dime.  It was so badly burned that I could smell it even before I opened the wrapping.
The smell permeated my car.
This is the scent that only occurs when oil has been heated too hot, well above scorching levels.

But the burning affect doesn't stop at the exterior of the tortilla.  Oh no.
Inside the eggs had been cooked the same way - scorched from too much heat.  
It's obvious Armandos is cooking with their oil way too hot and the food ends up smelly with black specs inside and out.  

Funny, the green peppers inside were raw.
