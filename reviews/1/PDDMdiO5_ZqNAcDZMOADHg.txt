I eat Chipotle a lot at various locations (mainly by the airport).  But this location on Sunset near the Galleria Mall has the worst service ever!

I ordered a burrito bowl with double steak.  The worker handling the meat portions barely gave me any steak.  It amounted to about one scoop.  I told her I ordered double steak and she snapped back and said that "it is double steak."  I said that I eat at Chipotle all the time and the portion size you gave me is severely lower than usual.  So she grabbed the bowl, scooped a small amount in and sarcastically said "Is that enough for you?"

I couldn't believe it.  I'm paying extra for double steak and you are being sarcastic and giving all kinds of attitude.  Turns out this lady is one of the managers!  We spoke to a different manager and told her what happened.  She apologized and said she would speak with her.

I love me some Chipotle but won't be coming back to this location again.
