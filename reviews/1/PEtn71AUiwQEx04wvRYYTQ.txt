We used to go to Lindo all the time back when it was a real Mexican restaurant, now its the Denny's of Mexican. the food is so commercialized and bland, it is no longer authentic and the quality went down hill and the prices went up. I will no longer be a patron after my last visit. first we sat at the bar to wait for our table and the bartender told us we can get half off if we text some number to vote lindo the best of Las Vegas, that's cute, however we cant vote if we just sat down and haven't had a drink or food yet? how do we know if its the best. that was unpleasant.  Sorry lindo your food is not good any more, nor your prices. the one star is for the attentiveness of your servers.
