If I could give -1 star I would. The service on the patio was horrific. First off the server got our drink order and after that didn't return for about 25 minutes. I had to ask for salsa to go with my chips (isn't that common sense to just bring it with the meal?) anyways my water glass had a crack all the way down the side after after the waiter was informed he seemed to have forgotten my new water so I was sitting there drink less for about half my meal. We spent $10.75 for table side guacamole, it was horrible, it was one avocado, pico, and pomegranate seeds, then doused in like juice, the avocado was not mashed it was chunks... We could barley eat it. We ordered the 3 tacos for $10 and they were bite sized. The server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome... I would not suggest this place! There are plenty of places to eat in Scottsdale and this place doesn't appreciate your business!
