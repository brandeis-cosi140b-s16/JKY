We seated ourselves and waited 15 minutes to be noticed. 10 minutes later our server introduced themselves and we were able to order a table of drinks and an appetizer, The drinks took another 20 minutes to arrive (bartender appeared to be doing nothing during our wait) and the guacamole and chips followed after our drinks were consumed. The cocktails were expensive, weak and heavily watered down with soggy ice. Sangria was barely a few sips of wine in a huge glass full of watery ice. Menus were dirty and table was sticky. No free chips and salsa so don't come here expecting any, and the $6 order of chips and guacamole is not large enough to be shared. The patio was busy but the inside of the restaurant was about 1/3 capacity and service was very slow. Everyone seemed concerned with what was going on outside and not inside. The food was lukewarm when it arrived. The rice was swollen and overcooked. Small spoonful of black refried beans. Flavor of everything was okay but nothing special.The carnitas were shredded pork fried on an oily flat top and not large cubes of tender fried pork like every other Mexican restaurant. Portions were smaller and less tasty than prices would indicate. My dates fried egg chorizo tacos were also delivered without eggs and then we were over billed, causing us to hang around even longer an be late to our show. Total disaster of a dinner. We had heard bad things from friends but decided to try Wedge for ourselves and we regretted the mistake immediately. Our table of 4 spent ~$100 and felt ripped off.
