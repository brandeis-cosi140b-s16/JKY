I placed my order online. Got home and my burrito was made wrong. I called back to let them know and they said just come back in. I informed her that I need my steak well done. It was not done well done by the time I got there so I had to wait ten minutes. As soon as I walked up I asked to speak to the manager...the girl at the front desk says she already told Management what had happened. So, I asked for the Manager again. The Manager finally comes out and I express to them that if I ask for a Manager I should be given a Manager. I also expressed my poor experience and how customers should be acknowledged by Management if there is a problem. This particular Manager didn't care so I asked for a refund and I will not be going back to Chipotle (ANY location) until customer service practices have improved.
