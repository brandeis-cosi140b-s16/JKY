Dude. I can't even call to cuss this place out! The phone is busy ALWAYS.

Your order will ALWAYS be wrong. Always.

I don't know how many times I have asked for a "bean and cheese burrito with NO sauce" and ended up will a sauce explosion. Nachos with no cheese, ask for a side of secret sauce... Get sour cream. 

Flour tortillas should be soft, not crunchy. Also, why are you hoarding the cheese? Put some on the tacos. 

Will drive the extra miles to not give them my business. 

Done.
