Been here a few times for happy hour and recently had a bad experience with the arrogant all powerful bouncers.

I'm 35 so I'm too old now to party with the youngins after 10:00 PM and that's when this place turns into a night scene. I was with a group of friends and we had just paid our tab and were leaving shortly. (By the way, if you order a 5.00 class of whiskey, and you want ice, they charge you 1.25 for the ice) We were at a table and i started to slowly roll down the umbrella from over the table as a goof to mess with my friends seated around it. Within seconds a bouncer came over and told me not to do that and he rolled it back up. I laughed (not at him) because I thought it was funny I "got in trouble" and then sat back down and started talking to my friends. About 1 minute later he came back and said I needed to leave and yelled at me that he told me to stop messing with the umbrella. I was a little shocked as I did nothing. He told me to stop, I stopped and that was it for me. He got in my face and bulked up and backup arrived and I hadn't even said anything at this point. In my younger days I would've been pretty upset and ended up striking him, getting roughed up and end up in cuffs. This time I was extremely polite and said I respected his warning and that I didn't do anything but I'd still leave. I argued with this for a bit (didn't raise my voice, just wanted him and the people around me to know that I didn't do anything wrong) and just said it was ridiculous. He then said, "You laughed at me" (like I hurt his feelings?) Anyway, it clicked and I laughed and said WOW, I see your kicking me out because I hurt your pride or something. I turned and left peacefully. Maybe they needed a reason to kick us out so they could get us old people out and clear a table for the VIP line starting to form at the front door.

Needless to say, I'm never going back. I can't stand bouncers who take their power to extreme levels and the establishments that hire them.
