I first went to this restaurant over 20 years ago, might have been soon after it opened.  We had wonderful food that first time.  I still remember having the carnitas (pork) burro.  We went a second time a month or so later and the deterioration had already set in.  I ordered the same burro and it was very dry.  About a year later I took relatives there and again tried the carnitas burro and it was again dry and uninspired.  No one else raved about their food but things overall were still average. 

Now to the recent experience... Over the past 3 months group of people and myself wanted to meet and talk at a restaurant so THEY choose ACs on two occasions.  I was hoping for a good experience but it was even worse than my last one  years ago.  On both occasions the service was quite slow.  On the second visit the server literally said, you should order now cuz you probably won't see me again soon and see was in a hurry to get the orders and get out.  I suspect the owners purposely understaff.  I would have again ordered carnitas but they no longer offer it except with a very high priced combo meal. So I ordered my other go to choice, a Green Burro, for both these visits.  Both times it was no better than average and overpriced.  

The chips and salsa are also just average.  As another reviewer mentioned, the salsa tastes like they cut it with canned tomato sauce, it's soupy and has no bit whatsoever. 

I don't know how this place stays in business.
