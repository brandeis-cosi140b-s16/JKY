It's quick and cheap but it's also tasteless. I got the carne asada taco and the 3 rolled chicken tacos with guac. How can something this bland be called Mexican. The rolled tacos were worse than the frozen ones you get in the supermarket. Totally tasteless. I'll go to Taco Bell right next door next time!
