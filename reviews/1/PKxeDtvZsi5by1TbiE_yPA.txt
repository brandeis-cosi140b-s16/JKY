The food was disgusting!!!!  SALTY... coming from someone who orders salt on their Margarita rim. The beans were so salty it was just ridiculous, tacos were just as bad! Not to mention the fire alarm was ringing through our entire  lunch with no explanation as to why. The Hard Rock Hotel  gave us some coupon for a free Margarita but they couldn't take it because you have to sign up for some rewards program or something,  fine (not necessarily their fault ). Yet I  can't get over how disgusting  and salty that food was. You couldn't pay me to eat here again. 1 star by default. .. you can't do negative stars!
