I visited at lunch time, around 1:30 PM. I didn't think there would be much of a line given the time, but unfortunately there was no parking and the line was out the door. Once inside I realized why there was such a big line: the employees are less than the model of efficiency. After waiting 30 minutes in line, I was unlucky enough to have a lady in front of me who was filling an office order for 10 people. Why didn't she fax in her order you may be asking? Well, she was well aware of the process because she had the DSL (Don't Stand in Line) bulk order sheet in her hand and usd it to read the order to the burrito makers.

So by the time they finished her order, they were a bit flustered and in a hurry. I was ordering two burritos and was further unlucky to have a phone order prioritized between my two burritos. I had to walk back and forth along the counter to tell each person what I wanted on each burrito. That was why they forgot to include guac on my veggie burrito even though I asked for it, and why I didn't notice until it was too late.

I've ordered almost everything on their menu and off their menu and eating a veggie burrito with no guac was my first negative experience.

Am I blaming them for having to wait in line 40 minutes? No, I only blame them for 30 minutes of it. Why was the manager out clearing tables when only a couple tables were occupied and while there was only one burrito maker on the assembly line?

I may go back to this location, but only to get some free guacamole.
