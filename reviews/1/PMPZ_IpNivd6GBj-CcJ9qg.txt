Why, oh why does this awful food court even exist. 

In a resort with some of the finest dining in the city, this food court is an insult to any human with taste buds. 

We were on property for a show and we decided to grab a quick bite in the food court beforehand since we didn't have time for a sit down meal.

My mom and I decided to share some nachos and a drink since we weren't super hungry. I stood in line next to some extremely obnoxious spring breakers and ordered my meal. When I first asked for nachos, I watched the guy in back making chips from scratch, so I started to feel a little more optimistic about our food court decision, but feeling soon faded. The girl at the counter topped the freshly made chips with a sad amount of shredded cheese, ran it through the warmer and then asked if I wanted any salsas to go with that. Um, even for strip pricing I would expect a little more for my $10 than a sprinkling of cheese atop 20-30 chips... 

I asked her to add chicken and then proceeded to add every possible other topping I could think of to salvage this travesty of a meal. By the end, it looked decent enough. I paid and was on my way to the table my mom had secured.

One bite in and I was done. He chips tasted stale, despite watching the guy make them fresh and were so salty. The chicken was beyond dry and none of the salsas tasted like anything close to food. 

I cannot stress this enough, there are so many wonderful places to eat inside Venetian and Palazzo at the same price point or slightly more, that there is absolutely no reason anyone should need to eat at this pathetic little food court.
