Wouldn't recommend this restaurant unless you have an entire afternoon of nothing planned.  The chips and salsa we ordered came out 15minutes after we ordered them and that was only after we followed up asking how much longer they should take. I ordered the veggie taco which came out 20minutes later and had a cube of chicken inside of it. I also ordered the sweet corn side but was told this would be at least 30minutes because it's shaved fresh from cob so I got rice instead.  Keep in mind this was 6:30pm on a Tuesday and the place was dead. Overall very disappointed with my experience.
