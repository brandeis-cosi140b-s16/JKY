update, and a warning to you.

repeat visit 1:
a nickel in the nachos, not a dime, a fucking nickel....last i check this is a major health violation.

repeat visit 2: 
egg shells in my Chorizo Burrito. 

on a positive note: i didn't see any insect diners on my table. but i didn't look underneath it in fear of seeing a swarm. remember that movie Candyman..remember the bee's in the toilet...yea that gives you a mental picture.

this place must have some serious pull to not have been shut down by now.
