They need a new crew at the location immediately. The food is so horrible my kid wouldn't eat it, bc it had no flavor. Everything is always bland and the line has crumbs littered everywhere. This is the worst chipotle I've ever been to in my life. I'm a regular so I know bad chipotle when I see one. They don't pay attention to your request, so you have to repeat you order over and over. That's the third time this has happened in a month. I'm done personally, save your time and avoid this location. Drive to the camelback location or go downtown. Trust me!
