Avoid this place at all cost on the weekend. Waited 40 min for a table on the patio that sat empty the entire time. Hostesses relay on a computer system that does not work and they were rude. If the tacos were not so good I would ditch this place! No wonder it doesn't show up in the top 20 restaurants in the area. Step it up Bario! You used to be really friendly. Ditch the greeters with attitude stat!
