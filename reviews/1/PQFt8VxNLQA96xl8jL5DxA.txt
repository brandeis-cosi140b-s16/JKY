Coming from the Midwest, I'm used to mediocre Mexican. I actually like mediocre Mexican, itself a style of food. But Mad Mex is sub-par Mexican - quite bad, actually. If this is the best Mexican Pittsburgh has to offer (as the readers of Pittsburgh Magazine suggest), then the 'Burgh has some work to do. The house salsa (extra charge) is a lousy blend of tomatoes and tomatoes. Entrees were just plain bad. Again, the consistently high ratings for this place mystify me. Have you had good (or even mediocre) Mexican before, Pittsburgh? The silver lining here was attentive service, despite a busy and obnoxiously loud dining room.
