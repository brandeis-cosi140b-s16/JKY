I ordered a veggie salad.  The lettuce was soggy, the roasted veggies were lifeless and the staff seemed disinterested.  The guy that was in charge was distracted and sweating profusely - to the point that I was concerned that it might drip in the food.  The other server was barely aware that I was even in the building.  She kept gazing out the front window and gave the impression that she did not give a rat's behind about my food.  :(
