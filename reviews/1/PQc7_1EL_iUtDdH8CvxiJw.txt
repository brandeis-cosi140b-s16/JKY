With the four stars we hoped for an unforgettable authentic Mexican meal. Restaurant easy to find kinda in a run down area, oh well sometimes that's where the best food is. Our first clue should if been the house that's part of the parking area that the lights had been absolutely or electricity been turned off, the tenants were out sitting on couches and steps. The second clue should of been the music that we could hear from our parked car. On entering the establishment we saw one table occupied  the rest empty, the group of five musicians were playing so load that I never new what the waitress was saying or my group. The room was small , we ordered drinks and learned there was no hard liquor Fortunately one us had two pair of ear plugs that they inserted immediately . I chose to insert to big wars of napkins in my ears. We discussed leaving but we didn't want to be hasty. We ordered and prayed they would stop playing. Both of the orders of chimichangas were over fried and the tortilla was so thick We could not cut it . Both of the guys had enchiladas the sauce was something other than the normal one , one of the plates had to be sent back cuz it was cold. The prices were the same as a fine franchise , Chilies , El Toro, . We waited longer than necessary for our food considering we were the only table ordering. Yes the music finally stopped near the end of our meal.
Don't go , it's a waste of your money and time we were very very disappointed. This was November 25   .
