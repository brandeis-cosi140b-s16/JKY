I went to this Filibertos for lunch today.  I ordered the Arizona burrito with a water. They had chips and salsa in a plastic bin off to the side. I had some of that before my burrito came out.  I asked them to cut it in half cause I usually can't eat it all. I got the burrito at 12:20pm just in time for lunch.  I ate and left fairly quickly cause I had to get back to work. Literally 20 minutes later I was in the bathroom with diarrhea. I  have had diarrhea for the last 12 hours almost. I haven't been able to eat and I have been to bathroom at least 8-10 times since then. Either some of their food was bad or their employees are not wearing gloves. This is the most horrible experience I have had at a Mexican restaurant. I highly do not recommend going to this restaurant to eat unless you want to be completely sick for the next 48 hours and visiting the bathroom every 30 minutes or less.
