I grew up in Atlanta and Moe's is great there. This one is terrible. I tried repeatedly to make it work. I've gotten hard rice like others complain about on here, they've been out of guacamole and other items, and today the most disgusting thing of all happened.

I went in about 1pm on Friday Nov 6. The person behind the counter walked to the back when I arrived. Someone else was sweeping the floor.  She came over carrying the broom and dust pan, brought them back to the kitchen and put gloves on without washing hands.  I walked.

I understand that all restaurants have some level of uncleanliness. If someone isn't going to bother to follow the most basic health code of washing hands after handling garbage right in front of a customer, what other corners are they cutting? 

I made a complaint a few months ago. An account here contacted me as the franchisee. I was actually going to PM them this story until I discovered that they were abusing their account. 

They left a glowing review of their Moe's and negative ones about three competitors in their shopping center, including a competing Mexican restaurant.  The other negative reviews are about Pieology (its next door neighbor) and Shake Shack.

I took a screenshot of them and contacted each business and Downtown Summerlin to show them what their competitor/tenant was doing. I also contacted the Moe's corporate office.

That is as sleazy as it gets. I will not be giving the Las Vegas locations, apparently owned all by the same group, any business. I will be happy to visit the ones in Atlanta.

Edit: I contacted Yelp about this user and establishment and they removed several of his reviews, including his positive Moe's ones and the negative ones about competitors.
