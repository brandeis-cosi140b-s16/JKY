Horrible service!  I'm a patient man, but seriously! It's seems that out servers were more interested in drinking with each other and having social time then making sure we had drinks and food.  Then getting napkins was like pulling teeth.  We asked for forks 4 times ! It's wasn't until the food came that the food runner brought us some. He should have been out server.  The food is good and it's sad that service sucks!  So many places downtown up and coming and this could be a great place if they get their act together.  Tables should be attended all the time and when you have a large party ordering shots , drinks and food you would think they would want the business.  Very disappointed !
