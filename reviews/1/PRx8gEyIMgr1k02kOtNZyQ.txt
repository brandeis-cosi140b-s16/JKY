We went there last night, hoping that the reviews we read were wrong. We are new to the area and looking for a favorite Mexican place, it will definitely not be this place. The service was horrible, our waitress walked past us just sitting there 4-5 different times. The food was most certainly not worth what we paid. Bluntly putting it, horrible food and horrible service. I do not recommend this place.
