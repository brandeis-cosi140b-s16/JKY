Wow! Had a great first 15 min. You know chips and salsa and a beer...then....45 min goes by and I have no food. I ask for a manger and she says its in the fryer. After 45 minutes my mini chimis are in the fryer?!?! Ridiculous, they were not even very busy. Lots of empty tables. If you're not very hungry it might be the place to go!  Unfortunately I was hungry and ended up leaving without eating.
