I don't understand why people eat here. The food is greasy, the restaurant/ store/bakery smells, and you get that smell with you in your clothes. I went over a week ago with some coworkers as an "appreciation " meal, thanks but no thanks. I am from Mexico, and even the street restaurants are better than this.
