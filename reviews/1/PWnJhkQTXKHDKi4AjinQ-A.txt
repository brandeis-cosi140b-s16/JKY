So, if I were thrashed and needing food like NOW, I'd give it better stars. It was sub-par ingredients thrown onto a plate and cost boyfriend and I about $15. 

He got the Nacho Supreme. It's comparable what you'd get at a Little League snack bar. Chips, "cheese sauce", dry shredded chicken, olives, and jalapenos. Let's say the only thing gone from the plate at the end of the meal were the chips. 

I got the "chicken and salsa" burrito. It was mostly shredded chicken (which was dry, by the way), mixed in with some salsa (very spicy), about 10 strips of shredded lettuce, and unmelted shredded cheese. The tortilla was the best part. 

Don't think we'll be going back.
