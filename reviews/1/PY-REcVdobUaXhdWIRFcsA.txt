After a desperate search through this gigantic Phoenix ghetto for an hour looking for something to eat, finally ended up here. They have a zillion new items and it is tough to decide, but everything new seems to include mango. The grilled chicken tostada is only 480 calories, but after you add some cilantro lime dressing, I'm sure that number bumps up a bit. I did find the mango, but it was part of a salsa in the far right corner of the plate. The tostada is not a shell, but a giant wheat tortilla filled with black beans, lettuce, pico, and some very large and tasty grilled white meat chicken chunks. It is pretty good for a fast food item, although the fast food prices are getting a bit out of hand as this thing costs $6.99. That is way too much for an item purchased in a drive through and not a combo price either. They have this $1 off coupon on the back of the receipt, so that should do the trick next time.

UPDATE: Miserable performance on 2nd try. The tortilla and most everything else was soaked with black bean juice, half the chicken was inedible due to fat and overall it was just a disgusting meal. I did save a dollar though with previously mentioned coupon. Nothing is ever as good the 2nd time.
