Some co-workers of mine are absolutely ga-ga over this place.  After three visits, I can't understand why.

The food is decent but not the best.  My gripe is that there's only one cook, even during the lunch rush.  That means a very long wait for your food.  I am allowed a one hour lunch break but I don't like wasting 55 minutes of it waiting for my food.  That means having to drive like a southern Californian to get back to work on time, even if work is just down the road.

I have noticed the name change, but I'm not sure if their way of doing things has changed.
