DON'T GO THERE

This had to be THE WORST Del Taco I have ever been in. It was disgusting! It was dirty, the prep area was really not up to par (I didn't really check this out when ordering) the food was horrid. It was clear that this was a problem from the bottom to the top. The attitude was "We're in the middle of no where, we don't have to have good service, food, facilities, etc." Now understand, I'm not that overly fond of Del Taco -- but my roommate loves their food. He ordered his usual chicken burrito and couldn't even finish it.

Bad, bad, bad STAY AWAY! (If possible I would have given it 0 stars!)
