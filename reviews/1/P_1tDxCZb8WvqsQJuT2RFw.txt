The most horrible Taco Bell I've ever been too. I made my order and waited for her to take my separate order and didn't say anything for 5 mins. I finally drove up and waited for another 5 mins for her to answer the window for me just to repeat my second order in the pouring rain. Then messed up both orders and combined them into 1 full order when I clearly said 2! It takes about 30 minutes to get food here. Even if your the only one in line. Don't eat here. If I could give it 0 stars I would.
