It's a rare occasion for me to not bring my leftovers home... With that being said, while the staff is friendly the food is completely lacking flavor. 

I ordered the cheese enchiladas- soggy tortillas, cheese wasn't melted, sauce was lacking flavor. The waitress offered to microwave them after we flagged her down, and luckily realized that remaking them was probably the better option. While the second batch was better, which is entirely relative to how awful the first were.

My mom ordered a chicken tamale which her kindest description of was "yucky"


For sure won't be coming back.
