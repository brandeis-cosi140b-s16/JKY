Cafe Rio has good food, this location however is not  place I would EVER recommend! I went in today on my lunch hour to get a quesadilla. They put the meat on a taco tortilla and put it on the grill. The next guy in line didn't even know what I had ordered! This was after waiting 30 minutes to order my food! The next guy in line didn't seem to care when he said "oh, you wanted a big quesadilla?" I was ordering from the adult menu and was by myself, so there should have been no question what size I was ordering. He then shrugged and said "Well I guess we can remake it for you". This kind of customer service should never be tolerated. I will not eat at this location again and I recommend if anyone likes Cafe' Rio, DON'T go to the West Sahara and Ft. Apache location!

As far as their catering goes they obviously can't handle the volume of business they have at that location, much less any catering orders as we have to order catering at my work from a different location just to get the orders correct!
