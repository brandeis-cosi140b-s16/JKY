I wrote a polite note on the El Charro Facebook page indicating my dissatisfaction of the fact they have been closed "for family reasons" for 5 now, almost 6 months.  Instead of a businesslike response, my post was copied and pasted along with the sarcastic,  typo ridden response from the owners presumably telling a 50+ year customer to "take it or leave it"  The El Charro response evoked a lot of sympathy from other readers saying "take as long as you need"  I stand by my post:  6 months is too long to close a business and expect to have loyal customers return.    Although my original post gives my old favorite restaurant 5 stars.  My new rating is zero.  I don't think I will ever return.
