Service was terrible. Food was beyond bland.  My husband's tacos which were supposed to be crunchy had been laid on top of his beans so the shells had turned to mush. He had to eat them with a fork. They had a sign hanging up saying that they are now open on Sunday's. If their business is struggling, we highly doubt that being closed on Sunday is the problem. It took forever to get our food. They brought some of our family's food ages before other people at the table. No one wanted to eat in front of those without food but we also didn't want our food getting cold. The server seemed like she would rather be anywhere else in the world but there. We won't be going back.
