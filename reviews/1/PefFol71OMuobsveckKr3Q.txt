So today a coworker was going to get lunch and offered to grab me something.......he'll buy.

So I ask where he's going....Fredricos...... I paused, but figured if he's buying, I'll give it another try....."Get me a Carne Asada Burrito".........after all, I had read this is what made them famous...

My rating has not improved.....still disgusting......couldn't eat it all, not because of the size.....but it was just disgusting......stale tortilla, meat flavored horribly......I could go on.......
