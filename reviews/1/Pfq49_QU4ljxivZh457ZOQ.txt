We stopped in for fried ice cream - the taste was akin to a McDonald's strawberry sundae with soggy corn flakes on top - not fried ice cream not worth you time, calories or the drive.  Service was terrible in the bar - waitress was unhelpful, disappeared for a while and I had to chase her down to actually pay my tab.  We were completely unimpressed and will not be back - don't waste your time on this subpar place!
