This is the worst Chipotle location ever. 

Lines are always out the door... And I've never seen a line move so slow in my life. No joke, plan to wait around 30 minutes. There are 3 reasons for this:

1. The employees are slow... And don't listen. I can't tell you how many times I've either had to have them remake my order entirely due to a lack of communication or add sides because they only put on a teaspoon of hot sauce.

2. Not sure why people don't use the online ordering. In the land of Mormons (aka Gilbert), this would really make a difference in the line... One person will be ahead of you placing 10 orders they are reading off their phone. 

3. Samples. "Can I try the chicken?" Who the hell needs to sample chicken?! I mean really, people. Get yourselves together. 

You're much better off going to the Chipotle location on Gilbert between Ray and Warner.
