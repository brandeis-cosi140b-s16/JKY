The food may be good, but the staff and service stink.  I have come here a couple of times since they are open 24 hours.  I went to the drive thru and sat there for 10 minutes with no acknowledgment, so I decided to go in.  I had to wait another 5 minutes to order.  The cashier then overcharged me for my food. When I complained the cashier made it be known how inconvenient it was.  As i sat to wait for my order, the staff began speaking in Spanish about my order.  (I know Spanish) While I didn't catch everything that was said,  it was enough for me to throw away my food as I walked out the door from an uneasy "they probably spit in the food" feeling.
