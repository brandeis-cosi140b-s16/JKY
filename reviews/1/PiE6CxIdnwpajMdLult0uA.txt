The lady who was my server never told me her name in the whole hour and half I was there. She never gave me her recommendations for what is good. I spoke to the young man Huntyr who was the busser and he was extremely helpful with refills and making sure I was ok. This spoke volumes as I hadn't seen muchof the server throughout the evening. I felt bad even tipping the waitress because she hardly did squat.... Food is EXTREMELY OVERPRICED!!!! I got a side of guacamole and they charged me $5!!! Not only that but by the time I got my bill for the meal which was a soda, a plate with carne asada rice, beans and the guacamole it was $24.00!! I couldvetaken my wife out to dinner for almost the same amount...$24 for one person is outrageous.....Great Job Huntyr on the customer service, Poor Job Waitress, Management might want to consider a pricing change.....
