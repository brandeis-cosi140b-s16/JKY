Stopped by for a margarita, salsa and guac.
Margarita: had the pineapple chilli marg. it was ok but expensive. 
Chips & salsa: mediocre at best. Kinda bland for us. 
Guac: blah blah blah
This place is really sleepy, and we were here on a Saturday afternoon. We were really disappointed. It was really expensive and everything lacked flavor. We had to add salt and pepper to everything but it was still blah. We didn't have any food because we were so disappointed with everything else. The resort was beautiful so it was nice to check out.  We went to The Mission for lunch and there is no comparison. The Mission is soo good.
