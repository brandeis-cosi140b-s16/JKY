Zabas was once a place I always wanted to eat. I've been coming  for 7+ years. However, it has sadly stopped catering to their customers and is staffed by rude employees.  
I've had several bad experiences here whether it's burnt meat, not properly wrapped burritos, and baby scoops of chicken on a $9 bowl. I have left unsatisfied and feeling like I did not receive my money's worth too many times. 

My last experience with my sister was so horrible due to the way she was treated by the employees I will NEVER come back. I was rooting for Zabas to get it together but it seems like they frankly do not even care to try. Their upcharging is also ridiculous. 

Everything is extra which I understand to a certain point, but it can really make your meal expensive.   I will definitely stop recommending this place until serious changes are made.
