I made the mistake of taking this places advice and ordering online.  I was quoted 45 minutes for delivery of a taco and chimichanga.  After an hour and 15 minutes, the food finally arrived.

The "crispy" taco was anything but and luke warm on top of it.  Not one crunch from the entire shell.  And the meat was nearly flavorless.  The chimichanga was the same, warm, soggy, and just as tasteless.  Even with sour cream, there was virtually no flavor.  Even the refried beans, which were cold, at very little flavor.  In addition, I had added jalapenos to the meal, something I like to snack on with meals.  These were inedible.  They started off bland and then exploded with what I can only describe as a rotten vinegar taste.  What's more, they weren't even spicy.  I didn't brave the salad after all of this and instead moved to the chips and "salsa".  The salsa, at least, had flavor.  Though, it wasn't very good.  I was given two kinds, but no indication as to what they were.  Neither was hot, both tasted tinny, and I only made it through two chips before I couldn't stomach any more of either.

You'd think that for $2.50 a taco, that it'd be hot, crunchy, and taste like something.  Or that for $8 a chimichanga would be hot, crisp, and seasoned properly.  But then, you'd also expect that things like jalapenos and beans are easy enough to do that they'd be edible.

Between the extremely slow turn around and the horrendous food, the menu is vastly overpriced.  If you're really going to eat something this poor in quality, you should just go to Taco Bell.  I won't eat there, or here, again but if that's what you're looking for, at least you can save money and taste your food.
