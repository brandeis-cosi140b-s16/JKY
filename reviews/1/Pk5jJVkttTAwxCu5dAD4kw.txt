Barf. stay away from Mexican Chinese should have been my first thought. It was like a freaking flashing sign:  CHINA POBLANO means "STAY AWAY, I'M DISGUSTING!" in Korean. no, really! But my girls n I were sooo hungry we took a shot. Veggie Fried RIce, some kind of dumpling and both were barf. I'm sorry it tasted like someone pre-chewed Mexican food and placed it back into our fried rice bowl and as the dumpling filler. 

Granted, we were ALL sick that night, and not from all the free Vegas drinks.
