Gross!  I don't know how they stay in business, with the Valley so full of fabulous authentic Mexican food.

How bad was it?  Let me count the ways:

- Cold, hard thick chips
- A restroom with one broken toilet and two gargantuan "la cucarachas"-- roaches... they had to be at least as big as my hand, and they were alive
- The apathetic attitude about said roaches when I told the hostess
- BURNED beans-- how can you make BAD beans at a Mexican restaurant??!!  
- Very mediocre, non memorable food
- Amateurish service.  Friendly, but inept
- Pricey for such crappy overall experience

DO NOT waste your dining dollars here.  You'd do better at Taco Bell.
