This is for drinks only. 

We got the frozen yard sticks. 2 for $30 because it was happy hour. Not a good deal I found out later. 

I ordered the poncho villa. Gross I hated every taste of it. I had to choke it down. 

The boyfriend got the frog punch. Not enough booze (in either drink) but at least it tasted better. Go to Fat Tuesday, better tasting better price.
