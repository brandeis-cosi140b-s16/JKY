I was excited that Patron was moving in nearby to where I live however I am ready for them to close and make room for something better.  I was afraid my review would be harsh but every day when I walk by and see the restaurant vacant I'm guessing that there are many others out there who share my opinion.

First off, I expected good salsa.  I have no doubt that the salsa came from a wholesale jug.   The chips that accompanied the salsa clearly came out of a box and were disgusting.  I would have rather gone across the street to Chipotle for chips and salsa.  

I ordered a quesadilla for dinner which was lackluster similar to the overall experience.

This place needs a new menu or at least a chef who understands Mexican beyond prepackaged prepared goods.

Overall I would suggest walking up the street to Mad Mex or go to Chipotle and save some money.  Patron is just not worth it.
