I have been eating at Jim's Burros for many years.  In the beginning, the food was great, the portions were large and the prices were good.  Well NOT ANY MORE. Today was my last day.  The chips were stale and I mean really stale.  The burrito had more tortilla folded up inside than chorizo, potatoes or eggs.  The chorizo itself was borderline flavorless, the eggs were dry and the potatoes were scarce.  The service was there to take my order after having sat down for five minutes.  Last visit my food sat in the microwave for ten minutes until I reminded the waitress she forgot about my order.  Yes, I said microwave.  I saw the waitress removed my plate from it.  Once my food came today, my waitress disappeared and my water was not refilled once.  

If you want a great breakfast with huge portions for a great price, go to EggsTC in Queen Creek.  If you want decent Mexican food (for this area), go to Morenos in San Tan Valley.  As for you Jims, close up shop and stop taking people's hard earned money.

Sincerely,

Thirsty Disgusted Customer
