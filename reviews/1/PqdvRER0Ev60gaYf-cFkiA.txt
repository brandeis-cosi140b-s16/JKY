I can't believe people pay to eat this food. The guacamole actually comes out of a squeeze bag like you buy in the grocery store! Disgusting! After two bites of my salad and my husband taking a couple bites of his burrito, we asked for the manager so we could pay and leave. She said she didn't like the burrito here either! Thankfully she discounted the bill but we will not be going back.
