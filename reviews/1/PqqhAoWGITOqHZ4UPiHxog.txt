Worst service in the planet! I wasn't really in the mood for Papa Johns, Burger King, Chinese, or Chilis, so I went with Salsarita. The burrito was good and affordable, but your staff is super mean! 

I asked for a chicken burrito and made it a combo, I asked the lady if the burrito brought chips and she rolled her eyes at me and says to the other employee "don't give her chips, she don't want em". I'm like "I do" and she rolled her eyes and kept saying "ugh". Then I asked them if the combo brought soda and she didn't answer me. I think she's mad at the world or something, must really hate her job. 

I would give the burrito and chips, a 3.5, it was pretty good! As for customer service, I have to give you guys 1 star because you guys need to replace your staff!
