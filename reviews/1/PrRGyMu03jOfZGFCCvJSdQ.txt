Been to the one in Shadyside a few times and always had a good experience. The one in the south side still doesn't have it together. Service was awful. Took 20+ minutes to get our first round of drinks. Our server took our order after we were sitting there for 30 minutes. Our food came out, but we didn't have silverware. Server came over 10 minutes later and finally addressed the issue. By the time we had everything we needed to eat, the food was cold. It wasn't even a packed house, so the excuse that they were really busy isn't applicable. The manager still tries to use the excuse 'we just opened and are still working on things'. It's a restaurant chain that's been open for weeks now. They should have things rolling smoothly by now if they new what they were doing. Won't be going back and would not recommend.
