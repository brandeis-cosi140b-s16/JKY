4 stars? Not even close. Came in for lunch during my visit to Madison. Ordered some steak tacos. Steak has no flavor what so ever and was very bland. I will give it credit that the tacos are huge but it doesn't matter if there isn't any flavor. Went to pay and handed the cashier my Amex card. He swipes it twice and says "I don't think my machine takes this card". I stated that the sign on the door says you do take Amex. He swipes it again and it magically worked. Amex charging you a % is not my problem so don't lie and says your machine isn't working.
