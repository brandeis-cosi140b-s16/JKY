I've come here dozens of times since it opened and the experience has been all across the board.  When they first opened, the food was fresh, the service was good and the place was clean.  It's gone severely downhill with crummy, extremely slow service and completely tasteless food, and a dirty, shabby interior.  Also the employees do not like each other and are clearly unhappy being there.  My husband and I give places a lot chances, especially when it's in our neighborhood.  But we've had it with this one. With all the consistently bad reviews I see here, why have they done NOTHING to improve?  That speaks volumes.  They just don't care.   It won't stay in business much longer, which is such a shame.  We needed some Mexican restaurants in Tempe, especially in this area.  I have noticed the patrons are really falling off.
