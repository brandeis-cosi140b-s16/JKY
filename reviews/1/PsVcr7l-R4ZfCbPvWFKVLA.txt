While visiting Maricopa last week, I had a craving for some Fajitas. Penascos seemed to have great curb appeal and quite a crowd outside. 

Once I arrived at my friends place, I called and placed a carry out order for the steak fajitas. I found the person answering the phone to be somewhat difficult to communicate with. 

45 minutes later my fajitas were ready to pick up. When I got back to my friends place and opened up the containers, I was immediately disappointed. The presentation wasn't very appealing. The meat actually look like canned dog-food. 

Hoping for the best I went ahead and started rolling up a fajita, only to discover the worst tasting Mexican food I had ever put in my mouth, 

This was by far the worst Mexican food I have ever eaten anywhere. 

Had I been in the Restaurant, I would have immediately returned the food and promptly left. 

This Restaurant is offensive and I do not suggest it to anyone.
