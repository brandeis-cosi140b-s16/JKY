While I admit comparing the old Tia Rosa to the new Rosa isn't fair, it is the comparison black cloud that will always hang over this place from all the customers in the area. Tia Rosa set the bar and the value of this new version falls way short.  I have been back a few times thinking it is me being too critical, but each time it seems that there are fewer and fewer cars in the parking lot telling me my thoughts are probably confirmed.  Some have voiced their opinions like me here on yelp, but my guess is others have simply gone away.  The issue is it needs to be better than the old tia rosas to maintain business... it isn't.

My biggest complaint is the value.  Paying $4.50 for a bean and cheese burrito and then having to spend another $2.00 for the "grande" one... or should I say one that would actually be considered average is a bit crazy to me.  Truly 6.50 for a bean burrito in a takeout restaurant?  Another $5 for 2 drinks.  Mix it in with 2 small shrimp tacos for $14.00. $25.00 for lunch for 2... no chips = crazy.  I can go down the street to Serrano's, sit down, chips and salsa with the same food and it is $7.00 less.

Today both of us left hungry and unsatisfied. Would I ever come back?  Why should I? Too many other choices. Our new place to go is backyard taco in Mesa.  There you will find a similar idea, better prices, better food, and filling portions.  Of course they have it figured out there and people have responded so you will wait in line to get your food.

Back to Rosa's.... No longer a crowd there and while I'm sure the new owner is please to be getting a few extra "bonus" bucks for smaller portion meals, when the people keep feeling ripped off and stop coming (like me) getting those few extra bucks will go away and we will see the building empty again within a year.  Goal achieved!
