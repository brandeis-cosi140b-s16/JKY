Closed Down !!!  Shut the doors !!!  

Left some employees without paychecks. Check with the labor board 

I don't know why my first review was placed in the "not recommended" section because it was a very honest review. I have lived in Las Vegas for 14 yrs.  I loved this place when it first opened. We ate there 1-3 times per week until the great chef left. Then we took a break and then went back when we thought they might have gotten their act together. They never did recover.  My reviews will ALWAYS be true to my own personal experience and opinion. 

If you are a Yelp employee, I just watched the PBS special and I am not being paid for reviews. This place DID deserve a 5 star.  Two months before closing, they didn't even deserve 1 star the food sucked that bad.
