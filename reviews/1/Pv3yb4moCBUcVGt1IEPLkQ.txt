This was our second visit to Don Pedro.  The first visit was disappointing but we assumed we caught them on an off night.  Sadly that was not the case.  This may have been the worst dining experience I have had in the last 10 years.  We went there on a Friday night.  The restaurant was maybe half full.  Service was slow and the food at best was tasteless.  The chips and salsa were terrible.  The chips tasted as if they were made in week-old oil and the salsa had a strange after taste.  We ordered a medium-well steak and a taco salad.  The steak was served nearly raw.  The taco salad was served with a tough and tasteless beef picadello with some shredded lettuce and a few pieces of cheese on top of it. It was sitting in a plateful of some liquid that completely soaked the taco shell the salad was in. Neither of us were able to eat what will be our meals there.
