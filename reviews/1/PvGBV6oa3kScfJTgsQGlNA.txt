Just gross. First and last time here. Ordered huevos rancheros. No extra tortillas but the ones under the eggs were driiiipppiiiinnngggg with grease. No taste to the sauce and unappetizing color. No rice served either. What mex restaurant only has one kind of hot sauce, which doubles as salsa?  Poor excuse for a restaurant period.
