I was just there yesterday for a Latin night they were hosting, so my critique is of their bar staff. First and foremost their liquor variety is lacking. So instead of Jameson or Crown, I had to settle for Jack and Coke. The first time they made it correctly and everything was fine. The second time I ordered it (I didn't watch them make it) I got a liquor that was clearly NOT Jack Daniels. The place was pretty busy so I assumed it was an honest mistake. I gave that drink to a friend and went back to order another, and watched them this time. This is what happened:

Ordered my drink and girl turns around and says "Jack and Coke" loudly enough for the 2 other people to hear.
Guy handling the tabs says "That's $5.50" and charges it to my card.
Then the other guy makes the drink and proceeds to use a liquor from the well...
I had to actually shout across the bar that I ordered a Jack and Coke to have him put Jack in my drink.
The tab guy and the drink guy shared an "oh sh*t" look with one another.
They then let me see my tab when I closed it and it had a rum and coke on there in place of one of the Jack and Cokes as though to make up for it.

Had it not been busy I would have seriously called them out on this issue. They charged me for a Jack and Coke the second time even though I got something that wasn't one. The difference is only a couple of dollars but the fact that they were trying to save nickels and dimes by giving me crap liquor instead of what I ordered is ridiculous. I have been to a great many bars in my time, especially while I was in the military, and I have NEVER had someone swindle me out of what I ordered in this way.

Due to the fact that the guy made my drink correctly the first time, and shared that glance with the tab guy when I busted him is strong evidence that it was not an honest mistake. I will not spend my money in this establishment again and I can only hope those that own this establishment will see this review.
