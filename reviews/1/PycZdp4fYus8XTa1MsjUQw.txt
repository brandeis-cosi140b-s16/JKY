I grew up about an hour away from the U.S/Mexico border, so I got used to eating really good, authentic Mexican food. Ever since I moved to Las Vegas, I have been on a mission to find restaurants that can compare to the places I used to love in Arizona.

We decided to try Restaurant 2 DOS Potrillos without really looking into it, just because we had seen it on a previous visit to the area. The restaurant is cute, simple but clean. The prices were good, service was fine, as it should be since we were the only customers. 

I will never return though. Hearing the microwave ding multiple times before your food comes out is a major turn off. If I wanted my dinner nuked I would have went to the frozen section of my local grocery store.
