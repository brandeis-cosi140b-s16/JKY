Bad customer service lady want you to buy another drink she said I don't give free refills. I will amend not bad presentation when it comes to the food but the meat as no flavor  and it's OVERCOOK and then the hot sauces isn't even HOT! The radishes that they have is cut too thin this to dry taste like paper "FIRST TIME HERE NEVER COMING BACK!"
