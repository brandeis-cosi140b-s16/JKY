I was out with my friends in South Side the other night, and we were finishing up at Acacia and looking for another place to go. Why not Steel Cactus? After some poor experiences at the Steel Cactus in Shadyside, I thought I'd at least give this place a chance.

We got in a bit after midnight to meet some friends on the first floor--the bouncer let us know that the first floor is closed and we can only go to the second or third floors. He explained that the bathrooms were out of order and so they weren't letting anyone else on the first floor, even though there was a huge crowd and a busy bar. After some negotiating, he "allowed" us to stay on the first floor with the group we were going to meet.

I struggled to approach the bar and got out some cash to let the bartender know I was thirsty. I waited for about fifteen minutes before giving up. I tried again later and was able to get a weak bourbon and coke. Around 1:40, the music abruptly stopped and a staff member came around to our group to loudly tell us that they were closed and we needed to get out.

No last call? No thanks for coming? Who closes at 1:40?

I won't be back to try the food; if it's anything like the Shadyside location, I'd be similarly disappointed.
