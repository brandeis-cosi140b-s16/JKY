1 star from someone from Massachusetts should say enough.  It was unimaginative, unflavorful, uninteresting, I could probably go on with the "un" words for quite some time, but I think you get the idea.  I had the Chile Relleno and it felt like I was eating an omelette with some bland chile in it.

This is Phoenix for crying out loud, there are much better options for Mexican food.  I found one the day after I ate here, it's a bit of a hike, but well worth it.  Check out my review for Los Taquitos in Phoenix for a much better option.
