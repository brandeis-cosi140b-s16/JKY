Been here a few times,  every time it was a negative experience. 

Food wasn't great

I had 20 dollars in songs on the juke box skipped over. 

Bought drinks only to have a bouncer tell us it was closing time literally 2 minutes after we were handed the drinks and that we had to leave, In this case my friend sternly dressed him down and the guy left us alone.

This is 3 separate trips,  3 negative experiences. 

Don't waste your time, goto one of the other perfectly fine bars on walnut street
