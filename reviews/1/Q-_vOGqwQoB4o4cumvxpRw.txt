Authentic Mexican cuisine and a great tradition.  But no matter how great that is, I can't get pass the cleanliness factor.  Servers with headcolds coughing and hacking on the food as they carry it out to be served -- not cool.  And apparently there is a "3-second rule" that applies here if things hit the floor:  worker dropped the ice scoop and it banged across the floor several feet which caught our attention -- and it was immediately picked up, waved in the air to flick dirt/hair off of and then stuck back into the ice to fill a water pitcher that the waiter walked around filling peoples glasses with.  We passed.  Not cool.  No mas.
