My experience was an absolute disaster.

My group and I were seated outside, which felt nice and cool at the time. We ordered our food, which were all just simple tacos because we had plans for later in the evening. Well, an hour passed and we still haven't gotten our food. During our third pitcher of beer, it started to rain on us. We wanted to relocate back inside where there were still many tables left, but no one even bothered to check up on everyone outside. All the other tables were rained on too. Finally our food had arrived, all in its microwaved glory. How it took over an hour was beyond me. It wasn't even that busy.
