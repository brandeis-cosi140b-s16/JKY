We used to love this place for the chicken tacos. Something has changed, there was not much meat on the tacos and they didn't taste the same.  One of the tacos had only about a tablespoon of chicken in it. When my husband showed them, they made him a new plate, but stuck the taco back on it without adding any meat. We won't be back.
