I am giving one star because it doesn't have a choice for zero or negative, thought I would finally try Filiberto's - Egg shells in breakfast burrito, ok, give them the benefit of the doubt, happens in rare cases -  same thing in my next bite, (YUK!, spit it out) & after a look at the burrito -  eggshells throughout! I phoned to make them aware and manager wasn't available or so I was told by the rude employee who took the message. Left number for manager to call me back....no call back. Will never go back, and will stick with my Favorites - don't know how this place stays in business with the lack of customer service, bad food & higher prices than other places nearby - this is NOT the way Mexican Food in AZ is. Spoke to some family members about this place and they too have had similar experiences with disgusting food and customer service - wish I would have known ... as long time AZ Residents, do NOT recommend Filiberto's on Pecos in Chandler.
