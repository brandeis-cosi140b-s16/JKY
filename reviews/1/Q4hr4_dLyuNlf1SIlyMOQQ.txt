Absolutely awful. If I could give no stars I would. I went for lunch, and waited almost a half hour for some tacos and a salad. While we were waiting, there was two other tables that ordered after us and had gotten their food before us. When I went to ask how much longer it was going to be, both of the waitresses snapped at me to wait my turn like everyone else, and they would bring it out when it was ready. I would not recommend wasting your time or money.
