I used to really love this place. Authentic dishes. Great prices. However sanitation has gone to shit. They just got an 84 grade. Inspector's comments indicate they lack basic food handling safety understanding. Since their rate has been falling the past year or so, I assume they don't care anymore. No longer a customer. Adios Taqueria Mexico.
