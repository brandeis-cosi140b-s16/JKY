Stopped there for lunch today and ordered a carne asada burrito and it was DISGUSTING. I took one bite and had to immediately spit it out.  The meat in the burrito had gone bad. I don't mean that it simply didn't taste good, I mean that the meat was SPOILED.  I am not a picky person and don't complain when the food isn't good, I just  don't go back, but I decided to tell the cashier.  I couldn't believe what I was hearing when she told me "And what do you want me to do about it?" WiTH A ATTITUDE.  I asked her to take it to the cook and he gave me attitude, as if it were my fault they served food that was spoiled.  Needless to say I am never going back and would definitely  not recommend this place.  I gave it one star because the app does not allow you to post your comment without a rating.
