I'd been to other La Salsa locations in Vegas, and they have never done me wrong.  I went to this location because I was starving in the middle of the day, and wanted a cheap meal with a beer.  La Salsa advertised both a lunch and beer special on sandwich boards on the sidewalk, which sounded great, so I obviously I'm going inside.  

There is a bar near the front, so you can still get some sunlight, and they have video poker!  SOLD!  I drop some cash in the VP machine, order the beer special, follow it up with the lunch special, and I'm good to go.

Strike 1 - The bartender comes back 10 minutes after I order my meal, and he says that they are out of the lunch special, and hands me a menu.  It's 3-frigin'-30 in the afternoon, and they're already out of the lunch special?!?  How about taking down the sandwich board outside so more people don't get rooked into buying a meal that's twice as expensive as they planned??  FYI, they didn't take down the sandwich board.  I ordered something else, and it was decent.  And how do you run out of Mexican food?  Everything has the same ingredients, it's just packaged different.  And this was a basic burrito.

Strike 2 - None of my beers were comped.  Whoa whoa whoa, what??  Is this Russia?  This isn't Russia.  Really, is this Russia?  What bar doesn't comp beer for playing?  I've been to one or two in my life, but they let you know up front.  

So I lost money in the machine (as I expected), paid for my beers (not expected when playing), and bought a lunch that was twice as expensive as they advertised (never crossed my mind that would happen).

This La Salsa either intentionally rips people off by LYING that they don't have a certain dish left, they have terrible business practices, or they are incompetent.  I am NOT going back to this La Salsa ever again, and the other locations probably lost my business as well.
