Anyone rating this 5 stars is absolutely nuts or works there or both. Service was horrible, margaritas tasted like cheap mix with virtually no tequila and the food itself was borderline inedible. There's a Taco Bell on Sardis North and you would be better off going there. I'm serious. This place is horrible.
