Very poor service. Took 5 minutes just to be recognized that we were waiting to order. One person working on a Sunday. Waited 35 minutes for our food. Was served with no napkins. When tried to ask for some the guy working was no where to be found. Water machine disgusting and there was no ice in the soda machine. While eating a previous customer came to get a refund. Her burrito tortilla she said was hard. She warned us all to check out food before we ate. When ordering they were out of chicken. The guy working serves us our food after the long wait with headphones in his ear and you could hear the rap music he was listening to as he put our food on our table. Unfortunately it's hard to be mad because the food was actually good. It wasn't that good to forget about this experience so we will never be back.
