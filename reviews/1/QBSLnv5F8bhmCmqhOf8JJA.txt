Sourly this is a big "UGH" review.  Due to a big shopping decision earlier in the day, we ended up here (to save $$) for our 1st Anny dinner, instead of Fogo De Chao.  So the place is located inside the Suncoast Hotel and Casino.  My hubby had previously ate here alone, and wanted me to try it.  I'm a vegetarian, so I'm rather limited at Mexican restaurants, but I browsed their menu and chose the cheese quesadillas app and "sizzling" veggie fajita.  Hubby got some mexican platter.  All of our food was below average for the price you pay.  ALL OF IT.  But I could get over that, because I'm used to average mexican food.  So what made this place 1 star?  SERVICE.  Horrendous service.  Our male server, could not give a damn about helping us.  He was absent, slow, and non-friendly.  And we went at 5pm, and the place was only 1/2 full.  He disappeared for long stretches, even when I paid and so we had to wait for the receipt.   We spent over an hour inside, just because of the slow service.  We wanted out, and couldn't because our bill was held hostage!  We'll never be back.  My sizzling fajita was barely edible, UGH.  This place is SUPER UGH.
