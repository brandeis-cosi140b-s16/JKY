I normally go to a different location but I was closer to this one, not thinking it would be a big deal.... I was wrong. I literally saw one of the workers there use his two figures to pick his nose and seriously EAT IT. Are you kidding me??? Later I found out that this employee was a manager named Daniel. I can't believe they have someone working there that would pick his nose, let alone a manager. I have to say I wasn't fully surprised... His hygiene was noticeably crap. I'll NEVER be back to any of their locations EVER
