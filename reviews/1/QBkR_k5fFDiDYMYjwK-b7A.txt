Went here tonight after a long day and got fab tacos. Had been told to LuLus for a long time but ended up here. 
Ordered fish tacos and was helped by a very nice younger no older than 9/10 years old. 
Got home and realized they need to advertise Fish Stick Tacos.
My boyfriend said our kids could have made better tacos. 
I will be finding LuLus Tacos tomorrow! 
Only getting one star because I had to and the green salsa was good.
