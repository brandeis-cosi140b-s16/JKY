I see everyone else gave this restaurant a high review, so perhaps I got them on a bad day.

I ordered the Tamale combo. It was obvious that it was microwaved and thrown in some sauce. The beef was extremely dry, it was refrigerator cold in the center and scorching hot on the ends. Very little flavor.

The rice wasn't cooked all the way so I kept getting hard rice chunks, then finally the beans were so watery that I couldn't eat them with a fork at all. I thought maybe I'd mix the beans and rice, maybe it would make it a consistency I could eat. 

Don't think I will be going back, the whole meal was bland, and lacking in flavor, but all had the same dirty grease taste to it, and how you get that with a tamale is beyond me. I didn't finish it, and didn't save it for left overs. Had I not purchased it as take out I would have returned it immediately after my 2nd bite, I even considered taking it back to the restaurant and telling them how bad it was..

Good to see that other people had good experiences, but I took a chance on a little place and it did not work for me at all!
