I tried eating here saturday june 28th around 10am for breakfast. I called to place my order. I ordered a giant caramba burrito and a steak and egg burrito w/ chips and salsa. When I arrived for my food i was given a giant steak and egg caramba burrito which i didnt even see as an option. When I tried ordering correct food I could not because the manager wouldnt stop argueing with me. Every time I said "I want a giant caramba burrito with steak AND"... I would immediatly be interupted by the angry employee that would say " but you told me this!?!" Or " but you told me that". After trying to reorder three times I finnaly just gave the incorrect food back, and became so angry I began to leave completely forgeting my change. Ive never been so frustrated since i can remember. The funny part is if my order taker spoke better english this never would have happened. I refuse to learn spanish just to get my order correct so i guess me and carambas are going to have to go our seperate ways.
