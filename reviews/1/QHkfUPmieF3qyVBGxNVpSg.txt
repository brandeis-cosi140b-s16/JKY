So today i got a crazy idea, i said lets try and go to Chipotle, its not like i haven't been there before but I stopped going because of the low quality of their meat especially chicken. Who cares if the chicken is organic if its always dry and tasteless.

So i stopped by with my one YO and figured I would get a bowl so he could taste some and i would order steak to avoid the dry chicken. I kept my smile even after the 20 min wait which was 100% due to immature and untrained staff and i also told myself not to bother getting irritated over the fact that all the Ikea teenage furniture was dirty and reminded me about any McDonalds restaurant, even the goofy hipster music couldn't take your attention away from that.

Now finally i sat down and trued to focus on the actual meal, since the added cost for guacamole took this bowl to $10 i got really annoyed finding only 9 little lumps of beef, on top if that 3 of them turned out to be inedible simply because of whatever ligaments and other crap had bot been shaved of prior to cooking, but i did finish the other ingredients, the rice, the cheese, the corn and ofcourse the guacamole but it would be an understatement to say that i left unsatisfied.

This place is a joke, in a very competitive world where businesses fiercely compete to earn your business this place is a loss, there is not a single Mexican restaurant in henderson where they don't serve better food with better service and at a better price point so why bother.
