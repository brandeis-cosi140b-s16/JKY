Repeatedly the worst Taco Bell ever. Slow and rude drive through they don't pay attention when you order so it's always incorrect and they and unapologetically bad. Food is sloppy and meat is extra runny they just don't care at all about quality in any sense of the term. Save yourself the frustration and disappointment and go to the next nearest Taco Bell.
