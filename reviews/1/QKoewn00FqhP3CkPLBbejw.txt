Love cafe rio, but wont be back to this location again! Lines are sloooooow youre food is cold by time you get to the cashier, if they even have the food. Four out of five times at night between 5/6 (dinner time) they are out of meat? I work in the restaurant business and this shouldn't be occuring daily. On a good note the mean girls that used to work on the line, i havent seen for a while:) Tonight was the tenth chance i gave them. Here i come Stephanie st! Bye Horizon
