This was my first trip to Filibertos and it will also be my last.  While the food was ok (it was ok, nothing more) the service was beyond pathetic and I will be following up with corporate after I finish this post.  

We got there at 5:50PM tonight (Sunday) and the place was empty except for a car in the drive through.  After waiting several minutes and being ignored by the 5 people behind the counter, somebody finally came to take our order.  Our counter person had difficulty understanding what we were trying to order and then walked away without giving us our drink cups.  I stood at the counter for another 10 minutes while everyone in the back continued to ignore me...one guy walked right past me 5 times a few feet away and actually looked over at me.  FINALLY someone came up and I got our cups.

When the food came out my order was wrong.  I ordered the fish taco combo and an additional shrimp tack.  I went back up and tried to get my order fixed but the guy at the counter was arguing with me telling me that I ordered two shrimp tacos.  When I tried to speak with him he suddenly was not able to understand me again.  I asked to speak with the manager, and was told "no manager, not here".  I asked where the manager was and was told "be back tomorrow."  I then said I wanted my money refunded and he said "no" and walked away.  

I'm not sure how they get away with no manager on premises, but that's also a conversation for corporate.
