My wife and I ate there this evening.  We used to love this place.  The service used to be so so, but now it is just terrible.  The carne asada tacos were my favorite item on the menu, but I think they misunderstood me when I ordered and gave me the carne ASSada tacos.  Almost flavorless.

We were never given chips and salsa, even after we requested chips and salsa.  My margarita was terrible.  They must have misunderstood me again and thought I wanted a virgin margarita.  I think we were getting poor service and weak drinks because we weren't gaming.

It looks like Agave is owned by the same group that owns the Roadrunner bars.  The Roadrunner corporate "chefs" must have gotten ahold of the original recipes and "optimized" them for profitability.

We have removed Agave from our list of restaurants that we will eat at.
