The slowest drive thru of all.  I have no idea what takes so long at this location.  Employees also forget to put half of your order in the bag so check it before you pull away. 
I just ordered cheese and chips and a drink. I get home to find only the cheese in the bag. I order three items off the menu and they can't even get it right!
