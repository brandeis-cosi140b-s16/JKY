Service!  Where us the service! I have been here for 15 minutes without so much as a glass of water. You shouldn't tell people "oh just sit anywhere" and forget about them. It doesn't matter how your food taste if no one ever gets to order. I just watch three customers walk out and I'm right behind them...
