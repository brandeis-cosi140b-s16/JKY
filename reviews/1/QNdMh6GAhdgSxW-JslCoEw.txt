Zero stars! Sorry, not good at all. The salsa tasted like it was made with tomato paste. The sauce on top of the burrito enchilada style tasted like tomato paste and the burrito had shredded beef and nothing else. No chiles, no onions, no sauce, no flavor! We ordered rice and beans with it. The beans were the consistency of wall paper paste, and the rice was bland and crunchy. My husband had a dirty spoon and the drink glass smelled like it was rinsed in mop water. They had two songs going on at the same time. The overhead dining room music and the loud sport bar music. If they are going to have music in one or the other room, turn the other one off. My husband and I are both musicians and have perfect pitch. Listening to two songs playing at the same time was giving us a headache. As we choked down our food, someone in the men's room had a very bad, I mean bad like he didn't quite make it accident and the smell floated into the dining area. When you are trying eat in a room smelling like an outhouse, it's time to leave. We complained about the food to the cashier and the fact that we couldn't finish due to the awful smell, we Got a smile and "Oh sorry, and sorry for the smell, that will be $40 please. Yeah, we won't be back.
