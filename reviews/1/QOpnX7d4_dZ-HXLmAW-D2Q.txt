Grabbed a couple of breakfast burritos this morning... The burritos were pretty good but the guy put on plastic gloves to make the food, handled my money, then counted change and started making them with the same gloves on, yuck!

Lucky for him I was nursing a hangover and didn't feel like putting up a fight... If guy would've removed or changed his gloves they'd have gotten 4 stars instead of 1 for the nasty health code violation.
