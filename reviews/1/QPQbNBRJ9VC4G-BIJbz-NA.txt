I would have enjoyed staying for some food, but alas the complete disfuntional front staff prohibited that. I had called to make a reservation and was told my party of 3 was to small. I enquired if we came around six if we could get a table, and if not how long of wait might we expect. I was told if might be a few minutes wait but we should get in. When we arrived, we were placed into a computer list, and told it would be 25 to 30 minutes. We went downstairs for a glass of wine, and waited by the bar. We checked with the staff about 30 minutes later and found that our place had been bumped downt the list... An hour and half later we left knowing that no table would be found in the near future. 

Don't waste you time unless you have a reservation, this place completely upset our evening.
