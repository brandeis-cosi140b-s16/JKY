I came here late night to eat tacos, I order three tacos, im starving by the way...I eat the first taco and notice that the meat is cold! Not warm or hot but cold...the gentleman in charge ask me "how's the food"?  I informed him of the problem, he goes and looks at his grill station recognizes that something is in fact not keeping the meat hot or warm and he didn't do anything to make it right he continued to prep & completely ignored me ?? Hello!!! You have a customer who just spent 13.00 for 3 COLD tacos and a  Horchata (that didn't taste like Horchata) :/  (my stomach hurts already) I don't care about the money but he should have quickly got me 2-3 hot tacos and made the situation right
