This place has not only the worst Mexican food that I have ever had, but quite possibly the worst food that I have ever been served in a restaurant!! We could tell immediately that our lunch was going to be terrible. The salsa that accompanied the chips was more like marinara sauce. We had to season it ourselves with salt, pepper and whatever hot sauce was available on the table. The entrees were not any better. I'm not sure if they don't have salt, pepper or any other seasonings in the kitchen, but it didn't seem like any made it's way into our dishes. The refried beans were burned and tasteless as well. Avoid at all costs, unless you've never left Pittsburgh and have no idea what authentic Mexican tastes like.
