I had high hopes for this authentic Mexican restaurant in Madison, but here's the reality of my dining experience:

We ordered three assorted tacos, a chicken gordita, a pastor quesadilla and cheese quesadillas. 

1. There were flies everywhere, lots of them
2. The dining area floor was dirty, tables were filthy and sticky
3. The help-yourself salsa bar is a great idea, but the salsas were not fresh.
4. Waitstaff was friendly but slow - and we were the only patrons for the dinner hour!
5. This was the greasiest Mexican food I've ever had in my life.
6. The food was nothing special.

My search for amazing Mexican food in Madison continues...
