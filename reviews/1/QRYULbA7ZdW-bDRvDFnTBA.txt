Most people that know me will tell you that I LOVE mexican food.  I am a San Diego native and have had my fair share of good cooking.  When I saw Las Famosas one day on my way to work, I knew I would have to stop by to see if this would be my new spot.

As I pulled up I noticed a drive-thru (wooh too!).  I ordered a carne asada burrito with cheese and the cost was close to $9.  WHATTTT?! That's reckless.  A good burrito should never cost that much.  When I finally had the opportunity to taste the burrito, I wasn't impressed. It was stuffed with rice and the carne asada was bland. I had to soak the burrito in salsa in order to taste any flavor.  I couldn't even get through the burrito before throwing it away.  Sorry, but I can't say that I'll be coming here again.
