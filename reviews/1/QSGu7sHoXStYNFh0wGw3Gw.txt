If I could give negative stars I would. First off they completely forgot my burger... Which was 1/2 our meal... Then the only thing they left me were my fries.... Which were cold and soggy...

Horrible location. Second time they've messed up my order. Never going back. IT WASNT EVEN BUSY. We were literally the ONLY people in the drive thru.. With 2 cars in the lot (had to be your workers). How could you guys possibly be that stupid?

I'm bringing back the receipt tomorrow. This is ridiculous. Never felt the need to leave s negative review on Yelp for fast food. 

But you earned it.
