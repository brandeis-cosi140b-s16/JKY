We've been to Carlsbad a number of times. The location is great and the nachos are fantastic. However, let me explain why we won't be going back:
1. The service is atrocious. We have gone in groups of 15 and as a couple and either way, the service sucks. I understand when there is a big group that service will be slower, but not bringing in 2 servers for extra large groups is just dumb. We ordered HALF the beers we could have because our server was never around! The food orders have taken 20-40 minutes! It's just insane. This is also when the restaurant does not appear busy. 
2. The manager was a jerk. He mocked my husband and insulted some of our friends.  
3. I personally would prefer to see some "lighter" options on the menu. There are 3 or 4 salads and that's about it. If you don't want a salad, then you better not be on a diet. 

Overall, we are disappointed with the service. I don't go out often, but when I do I expect better.
