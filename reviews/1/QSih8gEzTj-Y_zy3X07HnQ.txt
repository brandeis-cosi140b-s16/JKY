So tried enchiladas 2 different ways. Both sauces red and green both tasted almost the same. Instead of chili's flavors it was more like a light brown chicken gravy, very bland. I ordered ground beef for my son, it was shredded. I had chicken loaded with breast meat but it needs  seasoning any kind. We tried the wings. OK ok my bad, they were.breaded and soggy. I noticed a change in kitchen staff. For the worse.
