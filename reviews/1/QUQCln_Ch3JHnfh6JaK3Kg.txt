My friend and I decided to come here for cinco de mayo thinking it was going to be good. It wasn't. Horrible service who failed to tell us they were out of pastor and horchata. Came to our table once. And our server didn't know what kind of margaritas they served. The tortillas seemed like they were microwaved and the tacos were mediocre. Don't recommend it.
