Would the owner/operator please step in and take care of your business! You may want VALERIA to go through training again. This young lady made our food and was quite rude I felt like I was in a soup line and like I was being an inconvenience to her for being there. She threw the ingredients in the tin like she didn't want to be there when I ask her a question she literally just stared at me answered and rolled her eyes! WOW!!!!! It seemed like she didn't want to be there and honestly she shouldn't have been. The cashier Alejandrin was pleasant and when I ask for a survey card she actually took initiative and went and found a prior receipt with the information for me. The restaurant had 2 other tables dining other than my family and 4 employees including a manager and the dining room was a mess. Mr. or Ms. Owner we know that no one can run your business like you do but anyone can run it into the ground. Word of mouth travels fast... I've eaten at the Cafe Rio location in Scottsdale several times and even the food at the Avondale location wasn't as tasty. Then again it could have been the girl making it, over kill on the red/enchilada/ sauce ruined the burrito. My daughter got the quesadilla took one bite and threw the rest in the garbage. My husband said Chipotle would have been a better choice. I honest believe it was the location. We won't be back...
