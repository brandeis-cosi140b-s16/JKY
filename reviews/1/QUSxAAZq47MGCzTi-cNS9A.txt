Disclaimer: this is a service-related review only. Didn't get to try their food. An extremely cranky server barked at myself and another woman at the table next to me (after we waited patiently for 20 minutes to be acknowledged) that it was going to be a 'really long time' before she'd get to us and another 30 minutes at least to get our order. It was the way she said it, so crazy rude I was taken aback, she basically yelled at us. The wait I didn't mind, but was too damn tired for that miserable surly attitude so I promptly walked out.
