DO NOT EAT HERE!!! The food is terrible!! I ordered 2 tacos and my boyfriend ordered 3. One of the tacos was so hot I couldn't finish it and I love spicy food. There was nothing on the menu about the chicken taco being spicy!! The second taco was just bad! I sent both tacos back. My boyfriend's didn't even finish his food it was so bad! The guacamole was a dark shade of brown and the margaritas were over priced and tasted like the premixed ones you get from a bucket at the store. On top of all of that my boyfriend and I got food poisoning that night from the horrible food at this place!  The one nice thing I can say is when I called to complain the next day the manager was very apologetic and refunded our entire bill.
