Andy and I sat at the bar tonight and the experience was almost impossible to describe. When we approached the bar the "bartender" Maxine says "it's dirty" so we sat down while she cleaned the bar. No hello, no I'll be with you in a moment... Nothing. The busser grabbed us waters and the hostess grabbed us menus. We were considering ordering margaritas but then witnessed Maxine dumping a new batch of margarita mix into the old container.... The date was just a little over 2 weeks old on the container. That's when we should have left... We ordered a 3 item como. Two shredded beef tacos and a cheese enchilada. The tacos were sour... Not a great taste for beef. The enchilada was Luke warm. We barely ate half the meal and asked for the check. We were never asked how it was. Over all the bar was disgustingly dirty, the food was terrible and the service even worse. Were honestly worried about getting food poisoning. This was my favorite restraunt as a kid, this expierence makes me very sad and disappointed. I will never return.
