I travel for a living so I eat out for most meals and have done so for nearly 20 years.  it is with that background that I can honestly say this meal was the worst meal I can recall having in a very long time anywhere.  We ordered chips, salsa and guacamole.  The chips tasted like they were out of a bag and not the kind I prefer buying, the guacamole - OMG.  We would think it comes out of a bag from Costco, one bite and each of us were done.  My salad was a few beans and kernels of corn atop iceberg lettuce with a big glop of the aforementioned guac. . . . I could go on and on and describe the 4 meals in detail but I will stop and say that I only wish Yelp offered a star option that was below no stars.  It was memorably horrible.  I will now begin the process of trying to forget this experience.  The people were nice enough but that and the cute decor are its only redeeming features.  Keep on driving - there are many choices that are better in the area.
