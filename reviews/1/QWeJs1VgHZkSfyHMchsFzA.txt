I can maybe understand giving Pink Taco one star because the tacos I had were actually really good.  However I really wish I paid more attention to the verbal reviews I received that warned me against eating here.  For, despite enjoying the flavor of the carnitas tacos while I ate them, the price I paid for the next 36 hours of gastro-intestinal misery was far from worth the few moments of guacamole deliciousness.  

Normally, I would just attribute my digestion issues to residual side effects from drinking a yards worth of margarita composed of the absolute best of the bottom shelf alcohols, but when everyone else in my party started canceling their plans for their last night in Vegas in exchange for a bed/bathroom/pepto/alka-seltzer combination, my powers of deduction left me no other choice than to blame pink taco.

I don't think I'll eat here again.  Las Vegas has too many other amazingly fantastic places to eat. FIN
