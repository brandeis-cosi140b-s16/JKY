The worst Mexican food I have ever eaten. The steak fajita meat was full of gristle and I had to spit out every piece I tried to chew. The waitress had trouble understanding English when I told her about it. There was no apology or attempt to substitute another menu item or removal from bill. The other members of my party disliked their entrees too. While the margarita was strong, the cheap tequila gave the drinker a stomach ache. Perhaps WI does not know what good Mexican food is like.
