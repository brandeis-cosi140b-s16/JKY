I love that they have more fruit aguas but they don't usually make them with mainly just the fresh fruit like other places (Los Reyes de La Torta has the best I think). I think it is a powder mix with some fruit cut up in it. 

But I have tried them since I love fresh fruit and they are closer to me. Watch out to because several times when I have ordered items they charge you for the larger size. When I asked about this they tell me "oh we only have large not small or medium" even though those sizes and their prices are listed on the menu. Shady!  This has happened to me at a couple of their different locations.
