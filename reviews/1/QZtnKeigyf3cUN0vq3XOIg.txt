Im from san diego and i have never experienced racism like i did tonight! I had six girls and three guys but cuz my black friend wore shorts 2"too long cuz hes 6'3" they denied him. I called out 4 other white guys not to dress code in the club and all they can do is give excuses! It pissed me off, I was so disappointed that i took all my friends else where (easily got in) and spent my money where i didnt feel prejudice! Im sorry tempe but if this is what they have to offer...fuck you! I respect people and dont judge on their skin color, i have video proof and for me i will not endorse anyone to come here!
