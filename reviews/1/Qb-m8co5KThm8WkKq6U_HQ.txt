So any Taco place that opens up in Central Phoenix will always be critiqued to the max as there are so many great taco places in town from dives to gourmet. I had high hopes for this place but it may do good business feeding ASU students at its Tempe location but not here in CenPhx! We tried this place twice. The first time we ordered burritos. These are like a cross between a burrito and a sandwich wrap - not what I'm looking for! There was a lot of mayo and lettuce stuffed in ours, it did not mention that on the menu unless they gave us the wrong order! We also give places a second chance so I tried to pick up some breakfast burritos to try them one Sunday morning. Placed our order then 10 minutes later they told me they did not have any potatoes, this was at 8:30 a.m.! I asked for my money back but it took an additional 20 minutes as the cashiers did not have access to the registers and they needed to wait for their manager to come back! They did nothing to win me over, you think I could have gotten a free meal or something but the likelihood of me ever going back to Fuzzy's is slim to none! Too bad, it's a great location!
