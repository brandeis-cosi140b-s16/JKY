I really love Mexican food. A lot. And I cannot stand to eat at this restaurant. I've had a few different things on the menu, but I am just never satisfied with the quality of their meat. Every time I've had anything with chicken on it I've been greatly disappointed. Qdoba is basically the only restaurant I will not eat at. And I will eat almost anything.
