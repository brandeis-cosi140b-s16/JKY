My friend and I were looking for a place to eat, something quick  and fresh. When we pulled up and walked in we immediately heard "ooh s***..." Mumbled from one of the employees from the kitchen. It became very apparent that they were preparing to close, and that we had arrived 5-10 mins before they closed. We immediately felt guilty and asked if we could still order and the male employee response was "well it's not like I can ask you to leave" he then proceeded to tell us what was shut down and what we couldn't order, it was then we decided to leave.  From my experience it is understood that the close time is when they lock the doors and that is when the clean up happens, and you never turn down an opportunity for more business. Overall this was a poor experience and the employees need more customer service training.
