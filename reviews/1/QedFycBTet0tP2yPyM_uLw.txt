I recently went to lunch at Espos, and engaged in an epic battle for a churro.

As I approached the counter to get my chorizo burrito and churro, the churro was missing and a plate of sopapillas was there instead. Before I could say anything, the woman behind the counter said bluntly, "We're out of churros, so I gave you sopapillas."

I thought about it for a second, and realized only a churro was really worth the extra flab my friends would see at the pool that weekend, and told her, politely, I'd really just prefer to not have sopapillas.

"You just want your dollar back?" she barked, as if I had asked her to drive to the U.S. treasury to collect one. I said yeah, I just love churros, and don't think I need anything else.

She huffed to the register, grabbed a dollar, and handed it to me.

Now look, one doesn't want to be petty, but really, the churro (after tax) costs $1.26. As I looked at her face that was saying, "Why couldn't you just eat your damn sopapillas like I told you to?" it occurred to me I shouldn't have to pay Espos twenty-six cents for a churro I never got.

"I think it was a $1.15 on the menu," I said.

Oh man, now she was pissed. Saying nothing, she hit a few buttons on the register, "returned" a churro officially, and handed me $1.26.

All of that drama might be worth it, if the chorizo didn't taste as bland as watery ground beef. Sorry, Espos, I'll just drive to Someburros a block away.
