Very disappointed.  

The place looked fun and interesting but it was all a let down from there.

The hostess was cold and standoffish.  Flopped our menus on the table and left.  

The waitress was friendly but odd about drink options, offered tap water and left.   

The menu choices looked dismal.  Lots of good options for drinks, But that's about it.  No burritos or fajitas.  Tacos and odd plates only. N waited forever and finally threw down a few bucks for the tap water we didn't drink and walked out.

Headed next door for a delicious meal and good drinks.  

Will never go back.
