Since we really like El Pollo Loco we went back last night around 7pm.  The staff is very friendly, and it seemed that their was lots of management around.   But I just cant seem to get over the fact that the chicken the past couple of time was way over cooked (dry & deflated is the best i can describe it) I just cant recommend them at this time. So disappointed  cause we really like their chicken
