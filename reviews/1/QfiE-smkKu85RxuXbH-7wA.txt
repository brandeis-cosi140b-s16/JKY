Firstly, their salsa isn't good at all.  We eat at a lot of Mexican restaurants and have had a lot of excellent and some not so good salsa.  I'd consider La Hacienda's a 1 on a scale of 1-10, with 10 being excellent.  It looks like they coarsely chop tomatoes, cilantro, onions and some peppers, soak them in water and scoop it into a salsa bowl.  It is gross.

I drink water when we go out.  I drink a lot of water.  There are times, especially when eating spicy food, when I go through 5 glasses of water.  I waited over 15 minutes to get my water refilled.  I actually drank my wife's water after about 10 minutes and then 5 minutes later, I got up to ask our waiter to fill our water glasses.

To my dismay, he was eating his food at a table behind the cash registers, in plain view of customers.  I asked him if we could get our water refilled and he said, "Sure."  He wiped his fingers off on his napkin, came over and grabbed our glasses and refilled them.

WASH YOUR HANDS!  Wow...The nerve of that waiter.  To eat your food, wipe your fingers off on a napkin, then grab something I am going to touch.

Needless to say, this was my 2nd bad experience at La Hacienda.  I wanted to like it, but that won't be possible.  Fool me once, Shame on La Hacienda.  Fool me twice...
Well, they won't get a 3rd chance.
