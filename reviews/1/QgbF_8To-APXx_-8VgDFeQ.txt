Ok, here's the deal:
I read the mostly glowing reviews and got a buy one get one free that I can use for lunch. That's a deal!
BUT--------------
When I ordered, it seemed like a high ending price with tax for a $7 lunch special. The waitress' answer? I had to pay tax not only for the $7 lunch plate but also the entree I got free! So I paid nearly double the tax (ripoff) especially the tax for something I didn't order. How does that figure?
The food-got stomachache later on. The seafood tasted like plastic, like it came from a plastic bag or, worse, been in the freezer for a while. Only the beans had flavor.

Save your money and go to Taco Bell.
