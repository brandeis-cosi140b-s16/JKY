Picked up dinner with my mom on 8/28/13. The chicken nachos had a very long piece of black hair in them. She pulled it out right before my eyes. Totally repulsive. She called the restaurant & the guy offered to remake them. When she explained we lived about 30 minutes away and no one felt like eating chicken nachos anymore, not even an offer of a refund. Didn't even seem concerned that employees were sending out food with their hair in it! Gross!
