Watching someone break proper food safety practices right in front of you is utterly ridiculous! 

As I was making my way to the front of the line, I noticed the lobby was fairly empty and the line to order food was not big. There were 2 servers helping patrons build their burritos or bowls. There was a third individual who was handling some chemicals right by the bathroom area. One of the ladies serving food asked the lady cleaning by the bathroom to please get some lettuce, nothing wrong with that right?! Except that rather than wash her hands, she walked straight into the walk in refrigerator to get a large hotel pan full of lettuce and then proceeds to leave it right next to the stove instead of placing it in the temperature controlled food area. All the while she has been rubbing her nose and starts to handle money. Apparently it then dons on her that maybe she should wear gloves. She grabs a pair from the box, attempts to put them on and after handling them and NOT putting them on she puts them back in the box and continues to work!! Let me just contaminate the rest of my work area!

Suffice to say I'm never coming here.
