This restaurant has no idea what they are doing. We came here for dinner at 6:10 PM and they said they could not seat us because of reservations at 6 and it was a 1 hour wait. Ironically, they had 3 empty tables. What restaurant lets customers walk away when the claimed reservations have not showed up. They need to learn how to run a restaurant. I'm tired of poorly managed restaurants. The owners should go to NYC or LA to learn how to do things! Don't come here!!
