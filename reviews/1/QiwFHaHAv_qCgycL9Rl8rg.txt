"Oh my no!"  Is what I would say if someone were to ask me if they should eat at this Chipotle.  I came here and was hugely disappointed when all the meat I tried was dry, bland, and looked old.  When I mentioned to the line staff that the meat they're offering can only be compared to expired cat food, I was given a look as though I had no right to judge.  When I asked when will the items will be thrown away and replaced with freshly cooked meat, I was told it had to be sold first.  In the long history between Chipotle and I, I have never experienced such disregard for quality.  Shame!
