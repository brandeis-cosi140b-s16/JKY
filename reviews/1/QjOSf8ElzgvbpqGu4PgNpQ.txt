Decent tacos, piss poor restaurant.  

Lunch line was 45+ minutes.   They have 3 lines which is incredibly confusing.   No help from any employee, which would help the line move faster.    

Outside, in the 100+ degree weather there are no fans, no misters, no service.

Tacos were like $1.40-$2.00 each, and not worth the wait.    I'd much rather pay $15 for 3 tacos at CABO WABO that are made with much higher quality ingredients and taste a whole lot better.
