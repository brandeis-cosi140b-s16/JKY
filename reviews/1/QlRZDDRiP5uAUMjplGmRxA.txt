Let me start by saying I frequent Los Taquitos regualrly at their 16th St. location and love it. The airport location is terrible. I actually threw my food out. The beans where watery and flowed out across the entire container, the rice was bland and over cooked, and the meat was under seasoned. Do yourself a favor and go to LGO or one of the other places that is doing good airport food, and only go to Los Taquitos outside of the airport.
