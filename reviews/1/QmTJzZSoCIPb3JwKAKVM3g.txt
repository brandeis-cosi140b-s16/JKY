Yeah - cool name but the place sucks. The people that work there are ... I won't even comment. The place is just not good.

The food is NOT good, and they have non existent options for vegetarians. They are overpriced. The location is good, being that it is at the Scottsdale Waterfront, but they are located on Camelback Road and its hard to find parking. Once you do, you have to walk a ways to get to Pink Taco.

The only good thing about this place is they have outdoor seating. The downside to that is you have to look at and hear the Camelback Road traffic.

Go somewhere else if you want my opinion.
