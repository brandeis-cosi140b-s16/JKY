I used to come here often with my wife several years ago, and we decided to come back from a quick bite, as our memories of this place were pretty decent for quick and fresh americanized mexican food with decent ingredients.  Our most recent visit was anything but good.  Ingredients were marginal, 'assembly' of the food was very sloppy, and all was topped off with a baby roach at the salsa bar.

Portions were absolutely huge, but I would have traded 2/3's or more of the quantity of the meal for better quality ingredients and preparation - the whole meal just looked sloppy and like a mess to me.
