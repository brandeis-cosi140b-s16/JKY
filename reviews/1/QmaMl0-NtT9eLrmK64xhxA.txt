Overall the services was good but couldn't shake this feeling that the staff was not very fond me. I had the 3 shrimp tacos they were pretty good to be honest. Other than that I was very polite to the waitress thanked them even they did not acknowledge me. Asked all around the table for refills but did not ask me once.
Nice little place but rude staff. I will not be returning.
