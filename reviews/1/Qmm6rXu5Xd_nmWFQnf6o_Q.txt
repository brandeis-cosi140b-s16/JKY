Ya..this place is nothing to write home about. Very small place. No music, strangely quiet. The guacamole,chips and salsa were  amazing but the rest of the food was rather bad. I had the Shrimp Enchiladas and they came out with some kind of sauce not resembling enchilada sauce at all. The shrimp was fishy and the rice and beans were bland. Maybe I should give it a second chance before I write it off all together.
