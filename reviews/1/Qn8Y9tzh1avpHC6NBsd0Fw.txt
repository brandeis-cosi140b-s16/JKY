For someone like myself and tons of other people in Henderson that I know, we frequent this bar on a weekly basis. I have just found out that 2 of the 3 bartenders that make this bar even worth going to, have been fired! They also couldn't even be given a legit and satisfying reason. Poor management and non paying machines is what this place has, and now 2 more reasons why it's easier to not come here! Bars are a dime a dozen, good bartenders are NOT!
