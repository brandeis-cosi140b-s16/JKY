Wow. Went there last night with a big group of girlfriends from work. Before the waitress took our drink order she made a long appealing sell speech about this new tequila they have that they make themselves and that it's really great and we should all try it. So I said "sure I'll have that! Thanks." The drinks arrive and mine is a tiny margarita (all the others were in a tall glass double the size)...but I didn't think too much of that. It tasted okay...not nearly as good as my friend's who got a regular one. So then we eat our food (mediocre) and then we get our checks. Turns out my tiny little marg was $14.50!!!! The other ones with the "regular" tequila that were double the size were $7.50. I was sticker shocked...$14.50 is a price I'd pay for a fancy drink at the top of the John Hancock building...not at a suburban Mexican food chain. I asked the waitress if it was a mistake, she said no, and I said "I really wish you would have mentioned that when you were selling us on this!" In response I got: "we assume that anyone who cares enough would have asked the price."...I and all my friends were shocked by the response. Needless to say, there is zero reason I would go back there.


P.s. I've also never been to a Mexican chain that charged for chips and salsa. Much less $4! 

P.P.S. I'm not a cheapskate...it's the principle of it all!
