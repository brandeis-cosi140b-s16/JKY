My friends and I stopped at Rosa's for lunch after golf. This is the place we usually frequent when we are in the area. However, I ordered my spinach enchiladas as it is usually good. However this time it was not the same. I brought it to my waiter's attention and asked him if it was a different chef because I have had it before. His immediate response was that is the way we make it all the time. He did not offer to exchange it or if I would want sometime else. His attitude was " your tough luck" if you don't like it. He was rude and does not belong in the food service industry. I am surprised that a long time establishment such as Rosa's would have employee that represents them in a negative way.  We have decided to take our business elsewhere next time. Perhaps the management of this location need to be looked at by the owner.
