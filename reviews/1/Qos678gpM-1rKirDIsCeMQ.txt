Not so great first impression from this joint. My boyfriend ordered a carne asada burrito with meat, cheese, beans, and rice only. Of course, we get all the way home and it has onions and guacamole on it. He's pretty fortunate that I tried a bite of it first, since he's allergic to onions! So we took it back to them and they acted as if they expected it to be wrong. It was really kind of weird. Got a refund and went to Faustos instead.
