Warning!!! Watch your bank account after transactions. We through the drive thru at approx 350am. Ordered a breakfast burrito and the night shift guy over weight build wearing black rimmed glasses gave himself a $10 tip. Service was slow and he stated he was on the phone with the police. Best conversation I heard with the police. Beware!
