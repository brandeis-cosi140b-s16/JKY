I just wanted tacos. What I got was a place that has never heard of ground beef for use in tacos, (which really is the corner stone for all things taco). The restaurant was WAY too small. Enough to sit 8 small families? But every single table was filled and I had a line to the register, that was at least 30  people long. NO SEATS AVAILABLE. Decor was pre-industrial with exposed metal beams, rivets and cement/concrete floors found in a prison. The whole place looked dirty. Tacos are suppose to be hot (or at least warm), but mine were iced cold! Who eats cold tacos with hard, cold chicken meat? Nasty. Shocked so many people willing to wait in line for such crap food and restaurant decor.
