I'm with Moopet not sure why we ate here after reading the reviews but we did.  We got a green chili burrito which was pretty good but not great. Chips were good salsa is very strong oregano flavor which is not to my liking but my wife liked it. I got the fish taco which for $3 a expected more. The fish was a small once frozen fish stick and was topped with cheddar cheese, cabbage, and a chipolte sauce. Possibly the worst fish taco I have had. Beans are peppery pinto beans just like Rubios.
