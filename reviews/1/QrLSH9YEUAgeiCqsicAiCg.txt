Really slow service for very small portions of food. I had to ask the wait staff for more utensils because there weren't enough for our party. Also just no napkins, had to ask for that as well after waiting awhile for the waitress to show up. The food tasted alright but nothing great. Later that night and all through the next morning was crippling stomach pain.
