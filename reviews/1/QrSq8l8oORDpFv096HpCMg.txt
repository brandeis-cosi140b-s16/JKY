I was a bit dubious of this choice when I saw it but what the hell, outdoor patio, right? This was arguably the worst Mexican food that I've ever tasted. My enchiladas were lousy (I felt like the sauce was made with tomato paste) and even the high end margaritas tasted like a sweet mix. The waitstaff also seemed to be a bit out of it. 

I think the lesson learned is don't eat Mexican in Madison, WI.
