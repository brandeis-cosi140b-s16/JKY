I would have given this place zero stars, but since I had to give at least one...here it is.

The place was not busy but it was loud with the cook in the kitchen chopping the hell out of something..not sure it was meat as I didn't find much in my tacos. The TV's were blaring, making it hard to hear the person sitting next to me.  

I ordered 2 hard shell tacos - buy 2, get one free..now I know why.  The shells were either under cooked or old...tough and not edible.  The tacos were more like  lettuce tacos - it had an abundance of lettuce - little of anything else.

I found a hair in the radishes at the salsa bar which finished off an already bad meal for me.  The salsa bar appeared to be rather dirty..lots of drips and spills.

The girl taking our order asked if it was to go or eat in...even after stating we were eating in, she packed it to go...whatever.

Won't be going here again.
