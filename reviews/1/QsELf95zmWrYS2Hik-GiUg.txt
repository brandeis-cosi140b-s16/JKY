As I pulled into The Promenade I was torn between checking out two restaurants for lunch, so I did the flip of a quarter to determine my destination. And, I wish it landed the other way after lunch today. I arrived shortly after 12 and was greeted at the door at which time I said seating for 1 and the server pointed me to the booths in the bar & said "There should be a menu on the table". Okay, so I seated myself and was approached by Matthew, the waiter with no personality. I ordered my drink and was brought chips and salsa. The chips were cold, and very hard. The salsa was decent, however I had to add salt to both, very bland. 
I decided to order the lunch chicken fajitas, my staple item to test Mexican restaurants. 

After waiting over 25 minutes my food arrived, with a little bit of a smell & a look of fajitas right out of a frozen bag. The chicken was decent, but I think I make chicken better. The peppers and onions were pretty raw, so I decided to press them on the sizzling grill, hoping to cook them a little more. As for the rice & beans, disgusting, both! Refried beans should be mashed, these were like charro beans, ugh! And, the rice, cold and bland. As for the tortillas, very doughy and the cheese came right our of a package. 
The ultimate disappointment! I will definitely stick with the non-chain Mexican restaurants. They continue to remain traditional and serve nothing bland, out of a bag... Not saying that On The Border does, but it sure tasted like they do.
