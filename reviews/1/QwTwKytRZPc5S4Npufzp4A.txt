Wow, this place is  no good at ALL.  Very disappointed with cafe rio. I don't even know where to start. The tortilla's where not cooked or even heated up. Apparently they have never heard of carnitas! The tortilla was soaked in salsa. I picked it up, and it feel apart. The guacamole was missing salt and onion. Expensive for garbage! trust me don't go here! to top it of, there is no salsa bar. it's a bunch of salsas in a bottle u can get a grocery store. will never go to this place again. I don't even know how they can consider themselves a Mexican restaurant! they have alot of learning to do. trust me, skip this place. If you are looking for good mexican food go to taco y taco 
( in the shopping center of tropicana and pecos ) or El Panzon tacos y tortas ( in the shopping center on  sunset  and sand mill ).
