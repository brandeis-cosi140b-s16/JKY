This restaurant just opened a week ago so we thought we'd try it out, as we love Mexican food.  The decor is nice, but I would rate the food as sub-par.  First, this is primarily a buffet restaurant but is not advertised as such.  Not liking buffets, we ordered off the regular dinner menu.

Also being vegetarian we ordered one of the vegetarian variety dishes that came with a cheese enchilada, cheese burrito, cheese quesadilla, and taco.  I should have known something wasn't right when our food came out in less than two minutes of ordering it.  Everything tasted the same....extremely bland and borderline awful....very tasteless.  The cheese in our burrito wasn't even melted.  

I'm glad our bill was only $20 or I would have considered not paying.  Needless to say, I would not recommend this place to anyone.....but if you would like decent Mexican food, you may want to stop by the Taco Bell that literally is in the same parking lot as this place.  We left Los Arcos and drove three miles down the road to a superbly awesome Mexican restaurant, Don Pedros, which I give five stars.
