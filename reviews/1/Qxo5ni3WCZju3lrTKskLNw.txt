Our family has been visiting this place for a few years.  Although expensive the food was always fresh and the service WAS exceptional.  Now it is just another narrow minded taco shop that serves their menu only to their liking and not to their customer's liking.  According to the cashier the owner's now do not make changes.  Sounds like a disaster is happening, and possibly some infighting from co-owners.  And we all know what that means, it reflects in the taste of their food.  PS--the menu has now changed as well.........and not for the good.

Baja's- welcome to the BEGINNING OF YOUR END OF YOUR BUSINESS.

I know after today's experience we will never be back.  I cannot wait to see what business is going to occupy the place where you once existed.
