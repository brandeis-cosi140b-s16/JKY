Most terrible service ever, food is ALWAYS made wrong.
Literally they can't do anything right.
Every time i come in I get terrible service, even after I ask them to repeat my order to me they mess ALWAYS seem to mess something up, whether it's "forgetting" a few things on my order or they make my food all wrong. I keep going back in hoping that the next time will be better than the last, but it's been the opposite of that every time.They always cheat me out of my money, when I say that I mean, I see on my receipt that I did pay for what I asked, and when I get my food I see that I'm missing some food and when I ask for the missing food, they say I still have to pay for then even though I showed them that I already have. I always tip and I'm always the nicest to them, I don't do or say anything to deserve such horrible service. Obviously they need new employees.
Long and terrible story short, they are shit and don't go if you don't want a zesty spit dressing in your food.
