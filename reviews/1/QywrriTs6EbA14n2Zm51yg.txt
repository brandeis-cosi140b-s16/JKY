OVERPRICED! 

I was hoping id like this place...but i didn't. Well, i didnt not like the food but i didn't love it enough to want to go back... at least not eat. The drinks are good. ;)

In my opinion, the food is over priced. We had a chile guero appetizer thing; lump of crab stuffed chiles. Spicy! As they should be, but i was expecting crab inside the chiles. Then we ordered something described as being tortillas stuffed with azada meat n cheese and avicado etc..... it sounded good! But when it arrived it wasn't what i expected. Basically, in sonora this might be called a sincronozada, or a vampiro  Basically, two tortillas, and in between the tortillas there is cheese and taco meat. It wasn't bad, but overpriced at geeze, i can't remember if it cost 15 bucks or more....sorry. those are the only the food items we tried and we weren't knocked off our feet at all. I could get a quesadilla with carne at Yaquis taco stand and be much much more happy with it. 

We ordered a margarita and a chilada (beer with lime juice and asked rim) and those were good. The marg was VERY good, actually! We might be back for drinks... tal vez! Pero, lo dudo mucho.
