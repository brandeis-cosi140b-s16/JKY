I called in my order ahead of time...arrived at the restaurant 15 minutes later...and it wasnt made. I had to wait while they made my order once I arrived which in turn made me late back to work. The outer layer of the tortilla was sooo rough I couldn't bite it off with my teeth. I ordered a carne asada burrito, the meat had good flavor but with everything else...I won't be returning.
