Terrible customer service. I ordered for pickup and when I came in I didn't see the pickup area so I waited in the line that was all the way past the door. They redirected me to pickup after I had waited in line and it turns out my order hadn't even gone through. I understand that this was not their fault, however I then wanted to just order in store. I told her I didn't want to wait in the 20 minute line again since I had just spent the last 20 minutes doing that. She didn't say anything and just said it was up to me what to do. You're right, so I left.
