I went to el Santo on Sunday, which was Cinco de Mayo. They didn't have tampons in the restroom, which is completely absurd. I asked the bartender if he could ask the waitresses if they had one. He literally pushed me away from the bar and told me to "roll up a paper towel and shove it up there" and to "get over it." I will never ever step foot into this establishment again.  For an employee to physically touch a customer, and then to be so condescending and out right rude is not okay; I don't care how busy you are, treat your customers with respect.
