Currently having the worst experience I've ever had at Cafe Rio. The line was incredibly slow and the employees seemed to not even care (or notice??). The person putting the meals together didn't know what he was doing and the crew seemed to just be goofing off. The line was almost out the door! On top of that, every table was dirty and the floor was disgusting. Giving 2 stars because my food tastes yummy but other than that this has been a bad experience! Loud ringing noise (phone??) nobody answered the whole time I was in line and on top of that a guy was using a power drill on one of the posts of the line!! What????


Update: 10 hours later and I'm still annoyed telling my husband about lunch today so changed to 1 star.
