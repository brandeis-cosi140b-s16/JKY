Thought I would give it a second chance, should have listened to my inner voice telling me to drive a little further and go to Chipotle. The amount of the meat and toppings is a joke, they use just the corner of the spoon to scoop, maybe a third of the spoon if even that much. There more expensive also, the burrito bowls is more than a dollor more and when you pay extra for gaucamole you expect to actually get an amount you can taste in your food...Chipotle  gives a full spoon! Also for being a new location why does it smell so bad when you walk in, smells like bad chicken.Very let down by this restaurant,won't be coming back.
