Wouldn't even rate a one star, but it's the minimum rating to write a review. If you want to start a trip off with bad attitude, horrible customer service, wrong orders (even after verifying it several times), an over priced menu (even for the airport higher price normality)... Then go to Taquileria inside the LV airport.
