By far the worst Chipotle I have ever orderd from. Skimpy portions. Soggy Pico de Gallo, BROWN guacamole. Incorrect orders with pathetic apologies from a manager who seems to be a French fry or 2 short of a happy meal. I will not be patronizing this Chipotle ever again. In short? They blow. Suck. Don't go. Go to In-n-Out or Cane's. Don't waste your money here. You might get sick. If I could give 0 stars that's what I would do.
