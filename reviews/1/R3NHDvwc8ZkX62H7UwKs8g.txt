The worst customer service experience possible. Not sure how to explain the lack of fortitude or the service of employees who do not give s shit. After working a late shift the Bf and i where excited to make a late night run to Del Taco, 6 miles out of our way. 

First we order fries and fish tacos and "Julio" told us that the fryers were down for cleaning and we could not order anything fried they offered. Being kinda dead set on our cravings we asked when the fryers would be available to make our food....  Julio said 20 minutes. Having traveled all this way, hungry and tired we ordered crunchy tacos while we waited for the fryers to be cleaned,

Crunchy tacos were delivered cold and thrown together! Stale tasteless cheese and meat surrounded by a cold shell....... All the while we sit in the parking lot and watch three cars go through the service line without an issue. Now were kinda pissed, We wait the appropriate 20 minutes for the fryers to be "cleaned". We go back through the drive through and try to place our order. Again we are met by Julio, he says again that we cannot order anything because they are still cleaning the fryers and are now closing...... 25 minutes early! 


We ask what we can order and are suggested to order more tacos and crunchy tacos..... and guess what? THEY'RE STILL STALE!! 

The soft tacos are so cold that the tortilla is inedible.......


I understand that you may not have the best of jobs or even life your job,,,,, but that is not an excuse for lies and closing shop early. Those actions speak volumes of  the type of employeez Del Taco is willing to hire or want to represent the company.



No longer willing to go out of my way for this company
