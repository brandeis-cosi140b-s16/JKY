I went in today and wanted two gordida supremes and a loco taco.  The cashier was new so someone helped him which was fine.  I told the other employee what I wanted and she told me there was no such thing and there was only a crunch wrap gordida or a regular gordida.  She was very snotty when telling me this.  When leaving the register she tells the new employee if a customer says the name of an item wrong, to try to figure out what they mean.  I thought that was very rude especially when I know there is such an item and that I always order the same thing and have for years.  So when I get my food everything is wrong.  They gave me the crunch wrap.  I talked to the manager and told her I wanted the gordida supreme.  She knew exactly what I was talking about.  I told her as well that her employee was very rude to me and that was uncalled for.  She said she would talk to her employee and ended up giving me free Cinnabon bites.  I have been going to this Taco Bell since I was a kid but I will not be going there ever again.
