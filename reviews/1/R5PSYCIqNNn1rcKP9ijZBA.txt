We have given this restaurant several chances but this will be the last time we eat here.  We come Monday nights and sit in the bar area for happy hour.  There has never been a time that it was adequately staffed.  Often times it takes 20 minutes for the server to take your drink order.  We have learned to make sure you have your food order ready so you dont have to wait until your drinks come 15 minutes later.  Also it would be best to ask for your check as soon as your food is brought to you or you will have to wait another 20 minutes for them to check on you.  I hope you only want 1 drink because even 20 minutes after you slurp your last sip of margarita, they still haven't come back to see if you need another drink.  Here we sit 20 minutes after asking for the check and she still hasn't come back to get our card.  If you like to leisurely eat 1 appetizer and drink 2 margarits in 2 hours time this is the place for you.  Oh yeah...the food is mediocre at best.
