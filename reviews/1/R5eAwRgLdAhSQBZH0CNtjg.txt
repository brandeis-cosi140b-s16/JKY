minus 10 stars. This is the rudest restaurant vendor I have ever dealt with. Besides not having my phone in order done in 20 mins (I gave him that long to do it), he told me I was "late." And refused to refund my payment because it was not ready. He said loudly, in front of other customers, "YOU'RE NOT GETTING YOUR MONEY BACK."

The Mexican guy that runs this place is "Mark Marin" (like in Cheech). But he pronounces it as "Marine" like he's a military hero. His father owns the franchise.
Aside from that there was a woman working in the kitchen holding a baby in one arm and working with the other. 
I suggest everyone to check the conditions in this "restaurant" and report it to the City of Chandler Health Authorities.
