So this was one of our (Me & Hubby) favorite places to eat, until... One early morning we came to get some breakfast burritos that we thought would be delicious but were sadly mistaken. Instead we found long strands of hair throughout the burritos! How gross and we knew it was the cooks cuz he had a long ponytail WITHOUT a hairnet and our hair isn't the same type or length. Most of the Roberto's out here aren't the cleanest but you could still expect the food to be good. However this incident and bad customer service every time we went to a Roberto's has just turned us off completely.
