Ive always loved eating Wahoos in so cal and was excited when I heard one was going to open near me. Unfortunately, my recent visit was very disappointing. My food was cold and the service at the bar was very bad. Both bartenders seemed to only want to serve their buddies and ignore the other customers. I also had to ask for my check three times and still never got it (i just left my money on the bar.) Very dissapointing overall.
