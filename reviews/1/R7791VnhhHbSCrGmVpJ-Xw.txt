Two words: bug infestation. 

Prior to tonight I would have given this restaurant at least 4 stars because I have been to this location through their drive through a couple times and they got my order right, were very friendly, and the prices were always good because I receive coupons in the mail. After tonight though, I'll probably never return. 

My husband (this review is being written by Stephen's wife, Celeste, by the way) and I decided to take our two kids with us for an inexpensive family meal out, especially because we had received more great El Pollo coupons. Well we had never eaten inside the store and didn't realize we would be sharing our dining experience with hundreds of small and unwelcome guests. They were literally everywhere and even though I wiped off the table and chairs before we sat down my husband still had one get on him. He was so grossed out that he couldn't finish his meal (and he's not usually very squirmy about bugs).  All my 2 yr old son could keep saying during the meal was "bug! bug!" as he pointed at the floor or tables. 

The service was still very friendly, but our bag of chips was very stale (they did replace them when I mentioned it though), and the place was generally filthy. I really hope that their food prep area is a lot cleaner than their guest dining area, because if the dining area is any indication of the kitchen I'll be very surprised if we didn't ingest a few bugs. It's too bad because I think If they would just keep it clean they would get a lot more service (certainly we would be return customers if it were cleaner, but will not be now).
