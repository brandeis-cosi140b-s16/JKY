Worst experience I ever had I was sitting at the bar with a couple coworkers when a Caucasian lady comes in because I'm Hispanic demanded to me to teach her how to speak Spanish it was obvious the lady was drunk and I'm upset with Barrio queen who decided to keep serving this drunk patron who kept on harassing us. I strongly advise to boycott this location who allows this kind of behavior to go on in their restaurant.
