They were horribly understaffed when we ate there. One waiter had the entire patio. It took us 20 minutes to get a drink order, 30 minutes to order food and 50 minutes before we ever got food. Their problems clearly fall on management for poor staffing and poor training, as other staff did little to assist. To top things off one of our guests ended up in the ER with FOOD POISONING. We will not come back.
