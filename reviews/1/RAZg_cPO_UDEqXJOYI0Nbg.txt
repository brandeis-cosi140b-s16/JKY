Was just there! Tried to order our food but got caught off every time we tried to speak. Our food came out wrong. Proceeded to go inside and let the staff know it was wrong and they could care less. I have a dairy allergy and we specifically said no cheese and the lady inside gave the meal back and said oh there's a little bit of cheese in there. Basically if you want a surprise meal this is the place to go, cause you'll never get what you ordered. If you want Filibertos go to the one on Williamsfield and Val vista. They will take care of you.
