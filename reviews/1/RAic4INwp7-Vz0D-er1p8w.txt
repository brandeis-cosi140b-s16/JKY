Today i went to drive thru and listened while the guy talked about a customer while i sat there waiting to order. Once again, they cant figure out the ap. it wouldnt be so bad but the guy there was just completely put off by my asking about the ap. that doubled my aggravation level now because bad customer service is unacceptable. If you dont like your job dude...quit! I cant imagine paying this guy 15. 00 an hour to hand me a bag of tacos all pissed off. Plus i NEVER get all my stuff. Today jalisa gave me large drinks for the ones they forgot last time needed them last week not today. But that on top of them not being able to get my visa 50% off three times now... She suggested i go to another location. Good idea, del taco is across the street!
