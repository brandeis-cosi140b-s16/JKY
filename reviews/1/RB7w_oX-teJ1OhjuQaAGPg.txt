My wife and I went here for dinner on a Friday night and would not return. Service was incredibly slow. Even worse, a server dropped a drink and another server berated him in front of all the diners. Tacky. 

The atmosphere is nice, but the food took forever to arrive, almost 45 minutes! It was decent but not great and was pricy for what it was. There are much better options out there.
