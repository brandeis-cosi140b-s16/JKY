My family used to love eating here, but it's gone way downhill. Our last to-go order just wasn't cooked right and was un-appetizing. Not a huge deal, we'll just call 'em and they'll make it right.. right? The number on the receipt was out of service. After my wife finally got ahold of someone, they said they would have a manager call us back. Never happened, guess we will have to do a chargeback now. After reading this place is family owned, it makes me sad to see a once beautiful place serving delicious food lose all passion.
