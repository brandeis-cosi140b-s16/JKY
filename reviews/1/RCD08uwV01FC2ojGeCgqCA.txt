One would think living so close to Mexico that allll the Mexican food would be good. WRONG!  DO NOT GO HERE!!!

 My friend and I ordered 2 Cabo Wabo Margaritas.  The first round was decent but the 2nd round tasted like a nasty $2 house mix.  I brought it to the waiter's attention that there was a large stash of salt at the bottom of my drink.  Which I found odd that there was zero salt on the rim.  He took the drink back and sure enough attempt #2 was yellow, tasted like a mix and once again had a large pile of salt on the bottom with none on the rim.  In speaking again to the waiter he assured me that it would be right the 3rd time and it was a learning lesson for the bartender since they were new.  I stated that it was fine and I really didn't want the drink.  He then brings back the same thing.  My friends drink was just as bad.

The highlight was that when getting our bill all drinks were left on the bill.  My full $10 nasty drink was left, in which was wrong and I didn't want.

I will never return to this restaurant, not that it was my pick in the first place.  It is overpriced for what you get with bad service that does not care about the customer.
