This was the most God awful dinner I've ever had. The server was loudly yelling to the hostess about where to seat us. We all ordered off the numbered meal options, I asked for the #2 with chicken enchiladas and no one at the table got the meat they ordered. We all got cheese enchiladas. The rice had ZERO seasoning & the refried beans were like glue. Then we waited - no exaggeration- for about 20 minutes for our bill. At one point the waitress came over with a load of plastic chip trays (empty ones from another table). She - I guess- decided she couldn't carry them all because without saying anything she put one down on our table & walked off. Gross. It stayed there until we got our bill. Pass on this one. NOT real Mexican food & SO not worth it.
