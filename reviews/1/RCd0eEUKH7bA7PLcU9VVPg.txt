Burn this god forsaken Robertos to the ground, I will never eat here again because as I am writing this review I'm in the bathroom right now dying. These guys gave me a virus and now I can't even move. Disgusting to even think how I got the virus but definitely positive it is from the food. It was the last thing I ate and the only thing I ate in the past 14 hours, have not been able to leave the bathroom for about 3 now.
