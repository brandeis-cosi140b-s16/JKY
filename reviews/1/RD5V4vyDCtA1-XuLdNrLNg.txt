The first time I ever ate at a Filiberto's was at this location. I was a little hesitant and my girlfriend ordered for me because she's hispanic and has more knowledge about what is good. We got two tacos and a taco salad and it ended up costing like $25. Afterwards I thought it was weird that it cost that much and looked up the prices. What we ordered cost more like $14-16. 

The workers here overcharge you because they don't even speak english. It's kind of sad because I've been to a couple in the ghetto of phoenix and they were delicious and the workers are awesome over there. Avoid this location though. Go to the one on 83rd or on grand if you live in surprise.
