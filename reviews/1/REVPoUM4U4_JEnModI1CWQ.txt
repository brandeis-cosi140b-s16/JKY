I was in town visiting a client.  My colleagues and I read the really great reviews on this place.  And, all I really have to say is how sorry I feel for Charlotte if this is the best Mexican food around.  The salsa tasted like shrimp cocktail sauce.  The chips were stale and greasy.  The Margarita was obviously from a cheap mix and "top shelf" was Cuervo Gold.  Out of 4 meals, one was beef tacos that "tasted like eating dirt", chimichangas that were mediocre at best, combo plate was no comment, and my chili Verde was actually decent.  Avoid this place.  Do yourself a favor and eat at a crappy chain restaurant.
