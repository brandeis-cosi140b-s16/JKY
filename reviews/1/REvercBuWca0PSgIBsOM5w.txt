If zero stars could be given, I would. WAY over priced and quality was terrible! I asked the server which of 3 dishes was the best (tequila shrimp, fish tacos or the ceviche). She emphatically said the fish tacos. The fish was horribly fishy. The black beans had zero flavor. I've honestly had tastier beans from a can and I didn't even try the rice. The jalapeño cream cheese was literally that. Some jalapeños mixed in cream cheese. If that was the BEST choice of the 3....I'm frightened how bad the other two are! My husband hid his enchilada it was so terrible. He said the steak taco was decent. The kids seemed happy but one got chicken strips and the other got a ground beef taco. Hubby had a bite of the taco and said it wasn't very good either. We just moved to the area and decided to give it a try...without checking yelp first. That's where we went wrong. Will never go back. The server was friendly. That was the only decent thing. Bummer to spend $80 on 4 adult beverages and dinner for 4 (2 adults and 2 kids)!! We will never go back! That restaurant needs to be on Kitchen Nightmares...and stat!!
