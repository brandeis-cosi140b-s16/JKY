I live not too far from here so we stopped in since we always see it's crowded and assumed it must be good.  Not!  I'm hispanic and this is the worst mexican food I've ever had in my entire life.  Totally revolting.  We were amazed at first how quickly the food came out.  When we got our order, we understood why. Everything is microwaved.  The rice had dried out pieces from the microwave.  My taco was most likely prepared in advance and reheated since all the meat in it was dried out.  

Also, on the decor, they have the hostess station and cashier literally right at the front door.  So, if you're coming in, you are blocking the way of those trying to leave.  The restaurant is very dark, probably in an attempt to hide the filthy mouldering carpet, dilapidated torn seats and greasy walls.  It sure looks like they've never bothered to remodel once in the entire time they've been open.  Which is fine as long as you also clean and take care of damaged items; which unfortunately is not the case here.  

We left hungry and went to Alibertos down the street which, while not the best, is cheaper and fresher.  I was so mad that I paid for horrendous food.  I will not be going there ever again.
