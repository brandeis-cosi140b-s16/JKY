Went here the other night with my girl, worst filibertos I've ever been to. Chicken quesadilla and an arizona burrito took 20 minutes. 20 MINUTES!! The girl at the counter was rude and had this look on her face like she hated life and taking our order was just making it worse. The arizona burrito tasted like crap, I don't even know that it was carne asada. It tasted more like plain ground beef. The potatoes weren't fully cooked. The chicken quesadilla looked as if it was soaking in a pool of grease for the entire 20 minutes we waited. I will NEVER go back to this location, absolutely horrible. Stay away from this Filly B's.
