So, I feel the need to preface this by saying I am originally from southern California. I've been to a ton of "authentic" Mexican restaurants. I'm talking full on Mariachi band, goat burritos, and hand written menus. Mexi-Casa has got to be the "Whitest" Mexican restaurant I've ever been to.

Typically Mexican joints that aren't run by people of Mexican Heritage are surfer food, big fat burritos stuffed with everything but the kitchen sink. Unfortunately Mexi-casa does not fall into either categories.

I decided to get a burrito, I figure a Mexican restaurant that can't get this staple of Mexican cuisine right is NOT a Mexican restaurant at all. It's hard to describe the flavor of this "burrito" as it's honestly like nothing I have ever tasted before. If I had to describe it to someone, I would say they took a stir-fry, shoved it in a tortilla, poured on some hot sauce and called it a burrito. It's really the strangest combination of flavors I've ever digested at a Mexican place.

So, between the soggy overpriced food, slow service, no corn tortillas, and room temperature beer, I don't think I'll be coming here again.

Note to the Chef:
At the very least, melt the freakin' cheese on the burrito before you send it out, mine was still cold from the fridge.
