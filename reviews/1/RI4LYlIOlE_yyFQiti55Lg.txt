This is not like the Mattas I grew up with. Sandy Special was OK, cheese crisp was small and there wasn't chilaquiles on their menu at this location. Agree with other reviews, service was pretty crappy. 

Menu is limited and no happy hour specials. You order food at the counter and they bring it to you when it's done. You get your own drinks and refills. Couldn't tell if the kid with baggy Justin Beeber Pants walking around cleaning the tables and bringing out the food worked there or was just hanging out. Won't be back to this location.
