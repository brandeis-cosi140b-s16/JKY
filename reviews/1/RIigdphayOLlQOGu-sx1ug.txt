Overall I had a pretty poor experience with this venue. The staff seemed to cater to the "regulars" which seemed to just be the friends of who was working there. I found myself waiting for extended periods of time for service. When I was finally able to receive service the staff was very brief and more concerned with what their friends were up to.

 I would not recommend this place. I was able to get a cheap Corona this Thursday night but I had to deal with an incredibly uncomfortable atmosphere. I would say it's a much better idea to take your money to Four Peaks or one of the better reviewed bars off Mill Ave.
