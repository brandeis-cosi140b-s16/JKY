So disappointed. We have eaten at all three Tucson locations and have never had a bad experience. This location left much to be desired.
Our waitress was terrible. She started walking away before I had even finished ordering, repeating us back the partial order and it was wrong. We had to call her back to finish our order. 
The food was....ok. It did not have the freshness we have grown accustomed to like the Tucson locations. My refried beans looked like they had been sitting under a heat lamp for days. They were dry and crusty. The waitress brought my meal out before my husband's was even ready. It was so odd. By the time my husband's came out and we could eat, my meal was nice and cold. We definitely won't be back. It would be worth the two hour drive to eat at any of the Tucson locations.
