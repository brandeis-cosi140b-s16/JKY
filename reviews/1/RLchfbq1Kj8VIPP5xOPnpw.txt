I go to this place all the time because it's so convenient, right by my house. But almost every single time they somehow mess up my order. Mainly when I go in the morning to get breakfast burritos. My boyfriend hates when they are dry so he asks to put a couple extra things in them. If it's dry, he gets upset. Like today, we asked for a steak breakfast burrito with pico... We got a plain bacon burrito! Bacon! Not even close to what we wanted. I'm to the point where I'd rather drive further to a different one to get what I actually want, or just go to taco bell right next door. Now I have to deal with my upset boyfriend..
