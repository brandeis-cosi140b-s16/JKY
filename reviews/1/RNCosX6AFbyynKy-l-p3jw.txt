People who like food should not eat here. I had chicken tacos on corn tortillas. It cost 900 dollars, the tortillas were mush so I had to eat it with a fork, and the chicken was dry and tasteless. The salsa tasted like jarred old El Paso. Had they not made me needlessly wait for 10 minutes for my tacos, perhaps the mush factor would have been less, but the dry and tasteless problem wouldn't have changed. Seriously, I want my hunger back. I have wasted a good meal.
