My fiancée, a native of Phoenix, is a huge fan and has been coming here since she was a little girl.  Now that she's moved away, this is one of the first stops that she (and I) make during our annual Christmas visit to her family.  I'm from the east coast so I enjoy the the 'authentic' Mexican as well.  Not this year.  Our visit happened about 1200 yesterday (21st).

First off, they get our order wrong.  We ordered one chicken taco, one carne asada taco, one tostada, and two bean/cheese burritos-one with extra cheese.  We received everything but the carne asada taco-which came out as a burrito, and neither of the bean/cheese burritos had the extra cheese.  Not huge mistakes but annoying nonetheless.

The big problems came when my fiancée bit into her tostada.....ice cold refried beans that 'tasted funny'.  Same with the burritos,beans that couldn't melt the shredded cheese inside.  I didn't have a bite of either burrito because my fiancée couldn't tell which one has extra cheese (neither).  The biggest problem came a bit later that day when she developed food poisoning.  She was up all night dealing with it.  (My taco and carne asada burrito were good.)

While food poisoning sucked, she was a bit more upset that she can no longer go to Filibertos.   Can't go back.  Sorry memories.
