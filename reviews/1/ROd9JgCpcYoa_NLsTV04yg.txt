Went here with my daughter and service was horrible. When we walked in 2 girls sat behind the counter and just stared at us. I agree with the other reviewers the menu is tiny print, so hard to read quickly. We were trying to read the menu with both girls staring at us not helping at all making us feel completely uncomfortable. Seemed as they did not want us here, so we walked out. Sad because we were really hoping this place was good since we love Mexican food and it is right across the street. We won't be going back and have already let friends know our experience there. Advice: Don't stare at customers, welcome them and help out with what is good or recommended, act as if you want people to come in and eat.
