As die-hard fans of the classic, arguably brilliant, Barrio Cafe on 16th St., we decided to try Barrio Urbano tonight. The culinary experience left me wondering if Chef Silvana has even set foot in this place, let alone eaten there. While I truly cannot say enough good things about the original locale, I cannot say enough bad about this unfortunate spinoff. 

The ambiance at the Yard is great, but this is about the only thing Urbano has going in its favor. Picture Taco Bell's food quality with deceptively trendier branding, a menu at an 8th-grade reading level, a costlier price point by orders of magnitude, and voila, you have Barrio freaking Urbano. Yes, that's right--I left wishing we'd had our family dinner at the sister airport location, which is indisputably gourmet by comparison.

Save yourself the trip, wait the hour for 16th St., or opt for a short stack at Denny's in the smoking section, because any of these things would serve you better than Barrio Urbano.
