First let me say that I LOVE Chipotle.  Absolutely LOVE it.  However the location on South End is absolutely abysmal.  After going there just now at 8:15 on a Thursday night I finally realize that I need to write a review of this bastard of a Chipotle restaurant.

Ever since this location opened I've been appalled at how slow the staff is.  The first Chipotle restaurant I visited with regularity was in Falls Church, VA (DC area) and I was amazed at how a line out the door during lunch would process in 5 minutes.  Same case with the location in Crystal City (Arlington) near my job at the time.

The staff at South End are slow and beyond discombobulated.  There were 4 people on the front line tonight and 3 on the back line.  Everyone had to wait for black beans to be brought up to the line, and then everyone had to wait for chicken to be brought on the line.  WTF???

When I got home tonight and opened my bag of chips a lot of them were greasy and soft, i.e. not cooked long enough.  This restaurant blows, I wish it would close down so I will no longer forget to go to the location on Providence.
