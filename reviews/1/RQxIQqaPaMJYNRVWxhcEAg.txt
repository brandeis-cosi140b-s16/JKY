I just arrived at this KFC to order some wings and the line was so long we waited 15 minutes to hear that they are out of wings. 

I said that's fine and requested something else, just to hear the girl tell me that they are out of all chicken. I decided to go for Taco Bell just to hear that they are also out of ground beef. 

I asked the girl why she didn't mention it before she asked me for my order and she said because they are getting ready to close. By the way, this was an hour before closing time. 

The drive through is so narrow that you have to wait for all the cars to go in order to get out. All the cars in the drive through left empty handed. 

When we drove around we noticed all the night shift employees sitting in the dining area chit chatting to one another. Might as well close the place down if they dont have the proper ingredients to prepare their food. If they don't have any chicken then what can I really order, their mash?

Avoid if possible!
