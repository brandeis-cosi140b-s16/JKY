Anyone looking for a job who has a complete lack of customer service skills should apply here.  I'm pretty sure you're in.  Considering the fact that they make nothing per hour I would normally give them a little lee-way and not expect too much.

Stopped by late night to order something quick on the way home and went through the drive-up.  Had to repeat my order because the kid just wasn't getting what I wanted.  Apparently he thought he was and said "I heard you the first time".  Well, you didn't because it was wrong.  Glad I checked the bag before leaving and getting all the way home.

Next time, I'll get Taco Bell.  Idiots.
