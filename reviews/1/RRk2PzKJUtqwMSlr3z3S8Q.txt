Horrible service rude owners & staff they hire anyone at this place all employees look like gang members or can't even speak English place is falling apart has a weird smell soon as you walk in and the food is over priced for little portions they definitely changed the recipes the food just doesn't taste like it use to the burritos hardly have any meat & the meat is tough to chew & no matter what you order everything tastes a little like a dirty dish rag I would not recommend this place it's horrible! .
