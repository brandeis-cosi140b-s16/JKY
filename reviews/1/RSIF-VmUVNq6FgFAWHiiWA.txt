You'd never know this place was located inside doc holidays. The decor was awful. Place was empty at lunch, which came as a surprise considering all the reviews saying how good it was. The server must of been hiding in the back because after  using the restroom, I came out to a completely empty restaurant with NO help in sight. I went into the crappy little bar this place was in looking for help and the bartender stood near the register on the phone. Never asked if I needed help or anything. Terrible experience. Wouldn't recommend.
