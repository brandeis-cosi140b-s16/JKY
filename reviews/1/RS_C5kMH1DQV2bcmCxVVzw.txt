I love robertos, but this is the worse location in las vegas. I have visited this location 3 times total in hopes that they would improve. The first two times i was sent home with the wrong order. The 3rd time my boyfriend found a tooth pick in his rice. It was sitting at the bottom of the rice. Not only that, the rice smelled like fish and was mushy. We called the store and they wanted us to come by the next day and bring the food to them for a refund. we didn't even bother to waste any more time on this Roberto's location. I do not recommend this location. I'd have to say the best location in town is off decatur and Hacienda.
