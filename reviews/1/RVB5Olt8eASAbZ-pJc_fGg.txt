My husband and I had date night and chose to come here. We were greated with a very friendly hostess and sat us in a booth like we requested, we sat for a good 5mins before anyone came to our table and it was only to drop our chips and salsa off. We then waited another 5 mins we were already to order we looked around to see if anyone would come before we chocked on our chips, finally our server came took our order. Our server brought us our cheese crip pretty quick and then brought out our dinner all good. After our server dropped off our food we never saw her again till my husband was done with his food and I was almost done, we would've like to have more salsa and some extra sour cream, my husband wanted another margarita but no one came by so we couldn't ask. The chip girl came by right before our server did and she's the one who took my husband's plate asked if we were ok we said yes but of course we had already finished by this time. Our server came dropped off our check said have a good night that was it, thank goodness we had the exact amount, including tip, yes we still gave a decent tip, (we aren't those kind of people to stiff our server we normally are VERY GOOD tippers), but shoot if we were paying with a card or needed change who knows how long we would've waited. Just disappointed with our service, we did speak to a manager on our way out so hopefully he follows up with his server and the problem will be resolved.
