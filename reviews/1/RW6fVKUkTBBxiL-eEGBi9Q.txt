Ive eaten here atleast 5 to 6 times. And now im writing this review. The food usually pretty good but hugely INCONSISTENT the prices flavor and portions always change. They charge for additional $$ chips and salsa. The wait staff told us every restaurant in vegas charges for extra for chips and salsa. Ha!!! We've waited twice over an hour for our food. And the staff in general has been rude and not helpful. Ive had multiple margaritas I had to send back because they tasted like they were made with spoiled lime juice. The last time I was there I called ahead to reserve a table for my mothers birthday. When we arrived the had no reservation. The flan is good. Ill NEVER go back!!!
