GARBAGE... I don't understand what all the hype is about. I was born and raised in Los Angeles, so i think i know what Mexican food is suppose to taste like. I've eaten here twice because I was broke and starving and after both times I've regret it. If I want my food covered in oil i would have taken my plate to auto zone...
  Your better off going to Faustos Mexican grill. It's right down the street off of Rainbow and Robindale..
