My husband and I like to walk to Serranos for our "date" night. But tonight I'm sad. I ordered the chicken tostada. Simple, right?!?!  I received a bean tostada, hmmm?  I laughingly remarked that I'm missing the chicken. I should've know something was off when the server didn't take my plate to change it out. She brought back a bowl of chicken, what?!?!?!  I ordered a chicken tostada, not a tostada with chicken on the side. The best service we received was from the busboy!  Date night at Serranos was a BUST!
