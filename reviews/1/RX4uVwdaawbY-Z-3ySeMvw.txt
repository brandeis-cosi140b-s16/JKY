The shredded beef tacos were not that good. The beef itself was like one long piece of beef. It was like the yarn ball of shredded beef inside my taco. Usually you expect the shredded beef to be, well.. shredded. I'm sorry but if you can't get tacos right then you don't deserve to call yourself Mexican period.

The menu was orange and you couldn't see the pictures of the food on it cause the color of the food was orange too. 

The prices were reasonable. The other comment about the place looking like a clown went wicked on this place are justified.
