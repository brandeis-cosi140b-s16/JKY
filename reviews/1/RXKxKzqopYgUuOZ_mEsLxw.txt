Went there today to enjoy a lunch and almost walked out...A family allowed their kid to run around the place, screaming and  throwing a fit and they SAT THERE AND MUNCHED ON CHIPS....this kid sat on the floor and screamed...and they did nothing...Mom got up once, to show off her platform shoes and shorts so  tight, you could see the outline of her Vagina....Where was the MGR? He ran to the kitchen when the kid started to scream..NO BALLS...
We have been going there since it opened but NEVER AGAIN....

I will miss their great food, and service, but I DO NOT WANT TO BE ENTERTAINED BY YOUR KID!!!!
