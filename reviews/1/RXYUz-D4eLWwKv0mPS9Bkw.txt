Ate lunch here one time waiting for my car to get checked next door.  I can only say........Don't....just don't.  This place reminds me of one of the crappy Mexican places you find in the middle of Kansas or Missouri or something like that.  It's not good food....I'd rather go to Taco Bell across the street. We got Tacos Pastor and tostada and enchilada plate.  No flavor whatsoever.  No spice, no salt, stale chips, too much cinnamon in the horchata,  Service was fine...food no bueno.
