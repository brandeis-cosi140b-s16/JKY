This place should be called "Los Gringos " it was the worst mexican food I've ever had . ORDERED a basic cheese enchilada, they didn't even get that right , cheese was completely cold and not melted inside, ordered an asada  taco and the soft tortilla fell apart with the first bite. Cashier was nice but food sucked ass.
