Ugh I ordered a fish taco and they gave me a beef taco , seriously with only me as the mere being in their restaurant that one afternoon how can they mistakenly pull out an order. Nothing more would piss you off when you are so hungry anticipating a good fish taco and came home open your bag to a wrong order!!
