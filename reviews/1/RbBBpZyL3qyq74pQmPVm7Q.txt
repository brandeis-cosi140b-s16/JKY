Some co-workers wanted to order Mexican for lunch and passed around a menu for Picosito. I decided on the green chicken enchiladas (no lettuce, tomato, onion) with rice and beans. After the order was placed, I was informed that there was no green sauce so it would be red... Not my favorite, but okay. When my food arrived and I opened the Styrofoam container, there were some chunks of melted cheese that looked like curds. Kinda grossed me out and I promptly scooped them off. After reheating my food in the microwave, I tried the enchiladas. I didn't like the red sauce at all. Had kind of a smoky flavor that I didn't care for. The chicken wasn't shredded as advertised, but instead diced/chopped. The rice tasted so plain, it might have well been white rice. Was not impressed with the beans either. Very disappointed with this lunch and I won't be ordering from here again.
