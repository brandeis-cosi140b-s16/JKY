I wish I had read the reviews before we ate here. We were visiting Scottsdale and found this place. Our first clue should have told us something. We walked in and the place was empty! It was dinner time on a holiday weekend. 

We were seated and the table wasn't the cleanest. The staff were friendly but that's the only nice thing I have to say. The chips tasted like they came from a bag, not freshly made. The margarita's were horrible! Mine tasted like pure alcohol and it was supposed to be one of there specialties. We considered leaving then and should have.

We ordered an appetizer plate and the food tasted like it was frozen food that was heated up. I don't know if there chef has taste buds but if he does he needs to taste his own food. The whole meal was a huge disappointment.

Do not go here, turn and go anywhere else!!
