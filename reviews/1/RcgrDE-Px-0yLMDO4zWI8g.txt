This place is officially off of our rotation and we will never return! 

We spent a nice weekend in San Diego and decided on the way home we would have a Mexican lunch. Well we got here and were sat immediately which is pretty normal.. then we waited for 10 minutes before we finally asked for some service as we were still sitting without water and chips. So the hostess sat us somewwhere else.. we sat another 5 minutes with no service. We got up an left with a vow to never return!

By the way this place was filthy, dirty.. I'm still pretty upset about this and am hungry as we just came home mad.  Gawd I hate bad service!
