This is a happy hour review. 

This is an above average place for happy hour and people watching with a fantastic patio, great (and strong) house margaritas for 4 bucks, good chips and salsa, and $2.50 beers. One should expect this in AZ from most of the 500 choices of this ilk and Salty Seniorita North does this exceptionally well. 

I've been here many times (love the location), have great memories here, and I will come here again despite the crappy parking. Notwithstanding the crowd, service is good and employees are cute and fun (thanks William and Ayla).  

But... Mr. or Ms. Owner...

You need to clean the grease trap. The building stinks like throw up when you walk up and when we sat at the outside bar we had to move inside because we almost gagged when the wind changed. Moving inside is worse... the sinks stink up the place. What happens when we hit 113 outside?

Five star happy hour; minus five stars for stink-johnson-gag effect every five minutes. Ick. Sit at the edge of the patio if you get here early enough. Stink fazed our appetite so did not order food and can't even review it.
