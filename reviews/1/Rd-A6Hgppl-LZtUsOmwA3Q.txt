The star is for the unsweetened ice tea, which was good.  Although it did take a while for it to get to the table.

The chips were thick and tasted stale.  The pico de gallo, in the words of my spouse, was unseasoned and gross.  The house salsa tasted like tomato juice; even my ten-year-old hated it.

I'd like to tell you how the food tasted, but I can't, because after waiting for our meals in a nearly empty restaurant for almost 45 minutes, we left.
