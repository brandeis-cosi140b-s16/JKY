Why do people go here? I found the food to be I-can't-eat-this gross quality, and I'm no Mexican food snob. They cover almost everything in different "sauces" that taste like organic matter mixed with left-over Campbell's soup. The meat was dry. Fried things were soggy, and the only thing that tasted like something edible was my taco which was, of course, cold.

To top it off, our waitress was really...unusual. First, she bordered on flat-out rude as we tried to pick out a beer. By the end of the meal, she wanted to talk -- she spontaneously shared that she likes to eat a big combination platter after puking following a night out drinking. (Not something you want to head after trying to choke down some of that same combo platter.) Then she told us how she ate a 3 pound burrito on a bet.

Bizarre.

But, obviously, I am wrong. Because people seem to love this place and they vote it the best and they clean their enormous plates. I feel icky right now and am never going back.
