You would think a taco shop would have better tacos than Jack in the Box, but JIB wins over this place.  I had 3 tacos (one beef, and two steak).  The beef taco was incredibly greasy, malformed, and had little flavor.  The two steak tacos had a chewy mystery meat, and were also lacking flavor.....I won't be back.
