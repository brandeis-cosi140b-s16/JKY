Let me start by saying I love Chipotle. With that being said I was let down today. There were lots of staff who were 10 times louder than all the customers. You could hear every personal conversation they were having including ones about other staff with "buggers" on them and many colorful curse words (with kids in the restaurant). The manager was included with the staff and seemed ok or oblivious to the conversations of the staff. The food was ok but the service was horrible. 

Staff was noisy, crude and gave the feeling you were a bother by being here. All I thought about my entire meal was is where the buggers are were or will be. I finally gave up threw my food away and left.
