I was staying at the South Point and love Mexican food so based on reviews selected this place.  Everything about it was horrible.  The decor is cheesy diner/cafe style; there is no ambiance whatsoever.  The elderly male host was almost single handedly the most rude restaurant employee I've ever encountered.  The salsa was ok however the food in general was bland and the margaritas were watered down.  Complete waste of money and time.
