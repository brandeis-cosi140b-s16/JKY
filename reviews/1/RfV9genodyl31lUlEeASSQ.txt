Terrible place.

We visited with a group people. We had a good time in the resturaunt with Mo and after drinks we went in the back to play pool and chat. Eventually, a different, terrible blonde woman came back and complained that our group didn't leave a large enough tip. Our bill was $300 and the tip was $50. She was a major b**ch about it, too. 

Eventually, they told us to leave and the same awesome blonde woman called me a dick to my face on the way out. We checked our cards the next morning and they overchared our cards which is called fraud in most states.

Stay away from this place.
