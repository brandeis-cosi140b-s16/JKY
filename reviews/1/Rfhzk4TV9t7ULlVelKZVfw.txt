Now called Peppe's, same owner Jose.... it was a good spot. they have lost their way. the owner is a nice guy, but, his kids ALWAYS mess up the orders and don't care. after many chances i'm out, food quality has dropped dramatically and i will not tolerate rude attitude from his wife. never going back, ever.. I'm OUT!
