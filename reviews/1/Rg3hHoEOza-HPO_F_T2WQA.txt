This is not Filiberto's. It is Juliobertos and as an Arizona native I promise you those are very different no matter how similar the name may seem. Visit the actual Fili-B's on 17th Ave and Glendale and get the breakfast burrito available all day long or the shredded beef burrito with peppers and onions. Then message me and tell me thanks for the recommendation. :)
