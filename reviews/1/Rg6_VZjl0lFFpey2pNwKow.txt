I have written a bad review of this poor excuse for a Mexican restaurant before.  I went again today with friends who wanted to go.  I had  the #1 lunch special.  It came with a tostado and an enchilada.  I ate the tostado which had no taste.  It had a VERY thin smear of refried beans, a good inch of lettuce, and less than a teaspoon of grated cheese.  I tasted the rice and left it.  The enchilada was disgusting.  It had even less cheese inside than the tostada had beans.  I have literally been popping Tums since I got home.  
While we were sitting there, some kind of huge black bug fell on one of the ladies.  I am not sure how we even stayed at that point.  About ten minutes later, a lady at a table near us got up to kill a big bug under a nearby table with her shoe.  
ugh ugh ugh   
At noon there were only 3 tables with guests.  What does this tell  you????

This was my third try and my last.  I was hoping I would see what the few people that posted good was actually true.  It is just nasty there.
