Food was alright, but let's be real here...service is everything. The whole reason to dine out is to be served and taken care of. Bald dude with glasses clearly does not know how to offer this. When a table asks for something, you say yes and do it. No one wants to hear your excuses and your flat out no. Give the table what they want. Period.
