Horrible place 1st the manager/owner argued with the waitress in front of us. Then after the food came out they brought our utensils had to look at our food while waiting for them. We were the only customers there, that should have been our clue to leave. The manager/owner needs to wake up and figure out he shouldn't argue in front of customers. The food had no flavor, and their oil is on the edge of being rancid. Overall I don't recommend this place. No atmospher and ok food.
