I sort of like Chipotle, while they have good food, I often find that it is over priced for what you get. My wife and I ordered ahead online and was told our food would be ready within 30min. By the time I got my food home it was cold. That and I had to wait an additional 10 min in store for the pre-made guac, wtf. Chipotle is generally decent, this location is not.
