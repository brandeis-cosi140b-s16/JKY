I went to this place with a local friend around 8-8:30 PM on Tuesday, 1/19/10.   I had the Baja Carnitas (listed under specialties) and a margarita.  About 4-5 hours later I developed terrible stomach cramps, vomiting, and diarrhea---obvious symptoms of food poisoning.  I had not eaten anything else since noon so I'm confident it was this dinner that got me.  

I wasn't able to get around until about 3PM the next day.  At that time I went over to the SHOT Show to check in.  The registration person was a local who lived in the area of town near the Redrock.  After hearing my experience, she told me she spent a day in the hospital after dining at the Redrock's buffet.

This restaurant is capable of producing appetizing looking Mexican food.  However, they need to spend a lot more effort on keeping food either adequately cold or sufficiently hot.  Otherwise, food permitted to remain at room temperature too long will develop the bacteria that produce this sort of food poisoning.  

I'm sending a letter to the restaurant and to the Nevada governmental entity responsible for restaurant inspections.
