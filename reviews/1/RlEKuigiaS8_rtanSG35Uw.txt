As I'm sitting here waiting on my dinner I have already decided this isn't a place I would return to. The service is so confusing and our server is very annoying I feel like I am being yelled at and cut off everytime I talk. I asked for a water and I get brought a pitcher ... Um I'm one person one cup is fine! The salsa and bean dip is far from Mexican taste like it came from a jar. This place is very over priced for the quality and presentation of the food.  Oh and the server is yelling at all the other employees like they are the worst things ever, if I were them I would walk out. Poor kids
