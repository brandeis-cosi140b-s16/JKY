I was sad to see that El Picante had closed and been replaced by Taco Tio. But since El Picante was good and I was already here, I figured why not give this new establishment a chance.

Everything seemed really different inside. I suppose you could say that the decor is actually better now. It's much more authentic Mexican.

Sadly, the counter where you can see everything being made is gone. It is all now back in the back away from customer's eyes, which is definitely disappointing.

The menu is fairly simple - burritos, tacos, nachos, tamales, and quesadillas. And few options within each of those categories. But hey, sometimes simple is better.

I went with a burrito (wet style) and nachos with shredded beef. It was a little disturbing to hear the sound of a microwave in the background (never a good sign). And the staff wasn't exactly the friendliest.

When I got my food home (yes, take-out again), it all looked ok, but while it was edible, everything completely and totally lacked flavor. Yes, devoid of flavor. Literally, I could see the cheese on the chip, but there was zero taste to it.

Maybe things will improve with time as it seems like this place very recently changed over. However, it would take a lot to get me to go back here.
