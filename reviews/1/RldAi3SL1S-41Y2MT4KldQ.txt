This place is okay. It used be nightclub called El Sinaloense. It still carries negative baggage from the previous ownership. The food is not the best, its edible, bit not the best. The Marchi singers are great entertainment. The first time I was here someone  attempt to sell me drugs from underneath the bathroom stall. It was a baggy with some white substance. They could of confused me for someone else and they panicked and took off running. Once the Marchi band leaves then they start the "Banda" music after 7pm, that when all the drunks show up and start making fools of themselves. Please don't eat here.
