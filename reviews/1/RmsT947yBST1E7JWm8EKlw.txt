I wish there was a choice lower than one star. To put it simply, this place is horrible and not worthy of your time or money. Even if I looked past the bad service, poor food quality, I could not look past the long strand of hair in my soup. I ordered the small bowel of abondigas soup and cheese crisp ( what could they possibly do to a cheese crisp). The soup tasted like a canned tomato soup with mushy meatballs and some vegetables. It had no flavor whatsoever. The cheese crisp was nearly as bad. It was a cheap processed flour tortilla with too much cheese on it, horrible.  My companion ordered a hamburger for her grandson, it was dry and over cooked on basically meat thrown on a dry bun, nothing else. I could go on but why, save yourself and drive on by this horrible place!
