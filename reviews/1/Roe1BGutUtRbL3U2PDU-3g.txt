I don't care how good your burritos are, if you're going to sass me and make me wait 20 minutes past my scheduled pickup time. Once again, a franchised location devalues the America's brand. They aren't the same, and based upon the interaction with this gem of an employee today - the management doesn't care. If they did, they'd care about their hiring process more. No name tags - no care - no punishment. It's obvious. For the record, it's Scottsdale & you're at work, you don't need to get ghetto with me.

I loathe writing such negative reviews. Yelp is already full of them, written out of unfounded spite. I'm a lover of America's Taco Shop (I've hosted private parties at the old town location and given thousands of dollars to them - that kind of love) but this location isn't even the same brand. Shape up or shut your doors. Please.
