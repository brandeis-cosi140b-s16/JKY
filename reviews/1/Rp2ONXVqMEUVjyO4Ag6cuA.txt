Tried Americas taco shop today because the line at Chipotle was out the door. There was no one at the restaurant on Saturday at Noon. Ordered a carne Asada burrito and it was about the size of a banana. The ingredients weren't the issue just the lack there of. Next time I'll wait in line at Chipotle for a burrito three times the size for about the same price.
