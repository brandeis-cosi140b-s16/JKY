Ugh. Such a horrible place.

- The world's slowest service. A small group of us came here during happy hour to celebrate a co-worker's 30th anniversary with our company. We were seated in the dining area and presented with an underage waitress who couldn't serve booze because of her age. 

- It took (I'm not exaggerating) 30-minutes to get a drink because there was only one bartender working (who had a major bad attitude, by the way). After he would prepare the drinks, they would sit on the bar until another server could come by to deliver them to us. What a cluster-F.

- The food. It sucks. It's all "made" in the kitchen by scooping the pre-made food from various chafing dishes and then microwaving it prior to sending it out to the table.

- Zero parking.

Verona must be desperate for food if this place is still around. I just don't get it.
