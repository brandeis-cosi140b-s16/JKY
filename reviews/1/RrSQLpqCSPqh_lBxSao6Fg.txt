No one greeted me.
Took a few minutes to be asked for something to drink.

When my food was served I asked for a side of salsa. I waited 30 minutes, never even being checked in on once during that time . Finally I interrupted a waiter to ask for it again. By that time my food as cold. I've been waiting for another 30 min just pay my bill.
Food was good
Waitress tried.. But c'mon!
