Today out film crew ordered from this place. My salad was requested no onions per a SERIOUS allergy. My salad came with onions... So I called to explain to the manager as to why I needed a new salad. Ceaser Placed blame on our PA then hung up on me. Upon entry into the restaurant I was given dirty looks by the kitchen staff and not only did I not even get eye contact by the manager but he shoved my salad at me. Told him his attitude was wonderful and to have a great day... My salad is STILL wrong! They not only left off onions but EVERY SINGLE OTHER toppings!!!!!! I'm left with lettuce and shrimp for lunch. No money back, no customer service nothing. If this is how you allow your staff to operate I'm alarmed for this company.
