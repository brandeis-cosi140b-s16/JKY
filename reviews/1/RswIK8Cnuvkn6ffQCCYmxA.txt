Let me just start by saying, NEVER GO TO A MEXICAN RESAURANT CALLED DOS GRINGOS(Spanish for two white guys)!!!  It's plain and simple a bar.  We walked in and were greeted by an outdoor area where music was blaring.  There was birdpoop on the floor and benches!!! We had to ask 3 servers before one finally told us that we can sit wherever we want.  All around us people were smoking and drinking shot after shot.  And the servers were even worse!!! They were all girls walking around in practically bikinis!!! We had to ask FOUR different ladies for just a side of beans before one finally understood our request.  In the middle of our "dinner", we heard yelling and realized that just feet away from our table-with children-, the bartender and a bunch of customers were playing bar games!!! Completely inappropriate for a so called "family environment"!!!  Why have a kid menu?  With the food, we had to ask about pretty much everything because the menu was very confusing(half of the FOOD menu was a tequila menu!).  Half of my table had to order something else after finishing eating because the serving sizes are ridiculous( and the food was terrible)!!!  We all left starving with smoke in our nostrils. If you want to party at the bar, go here.  If you wan Mexican food, or have children, find somewhere else!
