Paying for chips and salsa at a Mexican restaurant is absolutely ridiculous, especially when nothing was that good. Maybe they charge because its in the heart of yuppy Myers Park. Tacos were at most ok. Margaritas were overpriced and not good. Service was ok. Don't waste your time with this place as there are way better Mexican places in Charlotte.
