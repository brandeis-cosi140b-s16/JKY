Qdoba on Rainbow needs to learn how to honor coupons that have no expiration date, and especially for not displaying any sign in the counter window that said coupons are no longer honored. Keeping the sign in the backroom because "customers who had those coupons have been in before and know that we no longer accept them, so we took the sign down" is not acceptable. On top of that, the employees at the counter could use a brush up on their customer service skills.

Righting a wrong with the coupon would have kept those in our party that went there for lunch today continuing customers. Instead, Qdoba just lost a direct few, and will spread the word to many more.
