The girl at the counter that was serving us our ice cream  was polite but she didn't speak English well. When I turned to ask for a taste, I saw a cockroach by their hand wash station. After that, I didn't want the ice cream anymore. I told her politely about the situation, and that's when she got mad because she had already scooped it. So all I did was walk out. 
How embarrassing.
