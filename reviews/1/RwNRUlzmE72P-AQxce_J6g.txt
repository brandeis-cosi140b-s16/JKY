When it's late I use the filters on yelp to determine what's still open. After finding Chronic Cantina listed as open around 1AM I decided to stop in for food. While walking in to the restaurant the cook signals that they're closed. So I turn around and start to leave. A man near the entrance then states that he is the manager and they are still open. Since I'm not interested in dining on saliva I decided to continue to leave. I will not return to this establishment... Unless I'm in the mood for eating another mans saliva.
