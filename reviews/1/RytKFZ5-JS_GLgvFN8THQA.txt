Terrible place for families w Young kids.  We tried eating here 2 different times...first time they wouldn't seat us or even acknowledge that we were waiting to be seated while taking groups who came in after us.  We have 2 small kids and were hard to miss, so we assumed the young staff does not like kids...(less drink sales?)
Second time we got seated and the host and waiter both left me standing in the middle of the room with a baby waiting for a high chair...they went over to other tables and totally forgot about us....while Im standing and looking right at them!

Maybe its not about the kids we had in tow, but service sucks regardless.  NEVER again.
