HORRIBLE SERVICE!! Just left this establishment, do not sit at the bar! the service was absolutely terrible. The bartender was careless and did not provide any type of service. 10 minutes just to get drink menus, another 10 to order, and 20 min to get chips and salsa. Got tired of waiting and canceled the chips. Just a terrible experience. The bar back was much more nicer at least. Its a shame, really nice decor and tequila selection but terrible service.
