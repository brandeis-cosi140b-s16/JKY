"The salsa came in 2 flavors: water and chunky water." Dave K., I salute you. You are so right about this joint. It's awful. 
While the front of the house is cute enough, the main dining room was just depressing. After we were seated, our waitress came over and scowled at us! No smile, no hello, just the ol' stink eye. To break the tension, I asked about the margaritas. After ordering drinks, we sampled the salsas, which were so bland and nondescript we ordered guacamole. Which was also flavorless--and not fresh.
There was virtually no distinct taste to anything--at least nothing strong enough to distinguish one dish from another. We ordered combo platters so we could sample a variety of things but the only variety was in the texture of the different items. The margaritas were salted with table salt and tasted only of bottled mixer--I couldn't detect any tequila whatsoever on my tongue or in my brain (16 ounces of margarita should provide a buzz!).
I will never stray from AZTECA again!
