I've given this place, not two, not three, but FOUR attempts to redeem themselves and yet they continue to fail me. They're a disgrace to the Chipotle family. I usually order in advance and pick up food for myself and several co-workers and these have been my experiences over the span of 7 months:

1st trip: I got 3 soft tacos with barbacoa: the meat was so greasy I managed to fill half a cup with grease.

2nd trip: got a burrito bowl with barbacoa: the meat looked and tasted as if someone had attempted to chew a fatty part of steak and then just put it back in my bowl.

3rd trip: got a burrito bowl with barbacoa, light sour cream, extra cheese and pico: received a bowl with so much sour cream, I couldn't see anything under it. Had about 3 strands of cheese on top. 

last attempt, today: got a burrito bowl with barbacoa, light sour cream, extra cheese and pico: meat was dry and chewy, no pico, no sour cream, half a spoon of rice and beans and so much cheese it was almost inedible. (and if you've read my reviews, you know how much I LOVE cheese.)

In conclusion, I don't know how this Chipotle is still in business. It's lacks flavor, attention and effort. Will never return to this Chipotle and discourage others from attempting to eat here.
