Kind of disappointed in the service today. Lots of people working, but had to repeat myself multiple times to multiple people because no one was paying attention/were running around doing other things...I don't think I've ever had worse service at a Chipotle and hate that it has to be at the Tempe Marketplace location, where so many potential customers may come into contact with them.
