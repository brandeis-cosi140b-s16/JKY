Avoid.  I've never wasted so much of my time or money in one place before- and I'm talking about a restaurant- not a casino!

It started with the 30min wait to be seated, when we were told it would only be 15.  My boyfriend and I were doing Vegas on a budget, but we still wanted to hit up a few of the more interesting places on the strip.  We didn't have any 5-star dining experience in mind- but a 2 hour meal that consisted of flour tortilla chips with bland salsa, $9 drinks, and a neither good nor bad burger?  Definitely not worth it.  We were pretty much ignored by our waiter, who had his head in the clouds, and it took us another 30min to get the bill.  The only good thing going for this place is the theme- even my burger came with it's own little plastic pitchfork :)  I guess even the hellishly long wait to get anything you wanted at this place fit the theme!  You'd be better off going to Denny's,.
