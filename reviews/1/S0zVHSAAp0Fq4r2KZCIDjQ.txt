Used to be a favorite place but has gone way down hill. Wife ordered beet salad which is one of her favorites. Came with bad blue cheese and wilted greens which ruined whole salad. Management offered to take $1.00 off for bad cheese which missed the point that the salad was ruined. I had 'Cowboy Sushi" and if i got more than an ounce of meat, I'd be amazed. Prices have gotten way out of line. The only saving grace is the outdoor seating area. My suggestion: bring a brown bag and enjoy the outdoor ambiance. Don't bother to order off the menu.
