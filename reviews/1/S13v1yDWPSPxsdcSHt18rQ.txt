Review is for CRAIG ROAD STORE.  I like El Pollo Loco and love their Tortilla soup.
This location is close to my daughters and I have given it more than enough 'tries', but they FAILED OVER AND OVER. It doesn't matter if I eat inside or go thru the take-out, this place sucks.

SERVICE AWFUL, you tell them something is needed, or not working or empty..NO RESPONSE, NO ACTION, NO "I'M SORRY".

FOOD, they are "out of chicken breast" !!! WTF? I think the drive thru kid was just too lazy to take an order.  Next time, "out of Tortilla Soup", (more than once) !!!
Next time, inside "dining" experiences consisted of: sloppy, not too clean looking,  the ice machine was empty. Staff notified (by each customer) no response.  So the show was just  watching people's responses to no ice, one at a time discovering this, hearing them tell staff..no response-ever.  Then- the tea machine shoots the tea out towards you, not down into the cup.  Again, no one cared or did anything about it. (they probably secretly laugh at each smuck that gets tea and jumps back from the spray) No sauce choices at sauce bar, no lemons, no straws, no sweetener.  (One kid spent about 3 min out back looking for sweetener...slowly walked back to me with ONE sweet and low! HAHA !!!  Where the heck did he pull that out of???  I gave him a buck for the 'effort'.  He was the only staff that in all my visits ever did ANYTHING service wise.
I drive across town to ANY other location and will NEVER GO BACK TO THIS LOCATION. oh, BTW...I wrote the company website, it's been over two months, I guess they don't care that one of their franchises SUCKS.
