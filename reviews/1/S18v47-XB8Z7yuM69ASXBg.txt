The food was alright, but the service was terrible.  Our first table that we were seated at had ants all over one side, and then we traced the line of ants to the floor where there were a lot more.  We decided to stay since we had already ordered so they moved us to another table.  45 min later our food arrived.  We received refills on our drinks only once after asking a different server who happened to be walking by.  

We won't be back.  Seriously the worst restaurant I've been to in a long time.
