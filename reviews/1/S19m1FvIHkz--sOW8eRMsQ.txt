The Sonoran Hotdog that I tried today was HORRIBLE! If I  would have eaten it there, they would have had to give me my money back. Puny ass hot dog in a big ass bun filed with dry beans and ingredients that not only left my stomach upset but a nasty after taste in my mouth.  I should have listened to the other yelp reviews,  but I was hard headed and had to learn on my own. Smh!. Definitely won't be back.
