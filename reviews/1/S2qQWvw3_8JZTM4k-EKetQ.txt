This place has really gone down hill. First I have to say that Tamara is awesome! Aside from that I work a late job so when I come to get food around 200 am they have been closed lately and they're supposed to be open to 4 am on weekends!? 

Also sometimes in the mornings their "computers aren't working"  I'm sitting in drive thru right now at 5 pm and it's been over 10 mins waiting. The order taker did say they were behind bit only because we mentioned seeing 2 cars leave the line after ordering. 

The previous issues we had where almost 98% of the time coming here...something would be wrong with our orders. YIKES people.
