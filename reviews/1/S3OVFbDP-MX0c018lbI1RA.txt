2/21/15.... if i could i would have left no stars.... very sad to say it's mexican... i order taquitos... in my life i have always thought they were chicken or shredded beef.... here they made me pick what meat... i said asada.. no flavor none at all.. the other  one was pastor still no flavor .... 

2nd issue........ we were a party of 15 and all they can put on the chip baskets was 5 chips per basket... i thought they were putting us on a major diet...

3rd issue.... the famous salsa.. wow that was a bomb ass salsa.... i wont give names but there were 3 people of my party that almost ended in ER ...for being in the restroom dehydrated. .... hour after hour of having major runs.... dam you salsa....
never again will i go here or recommend this place....

sorry to my 3 guest that had to sit on toilet
and wait and wait.... the toilet paper company made good money.....
