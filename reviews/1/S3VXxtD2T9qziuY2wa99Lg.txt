This place is not good at all. The only thing that is good is the chips and salsa (which they charge for). Ordered a Michelada and anyone who knows what a Michelada is knows that it doesn't consist of Lime juice and salt with a beer. The food was bland as well. Definitely not coming back here and I'm not recommending this place at all.
