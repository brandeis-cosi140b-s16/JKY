I just went in here and got some tacos for lunch.  I love taco tuesday, unfortunately, every time I go to this location, the tacos really really suck.  Hardly any meat, taco shells and meat are way overdone, not much cheese.  And they give you one sauce for 3 tacos.   I was in the neighborhood, and thought I would try it again.  I won't make that mistake again.  The FiliB's on Main and Dobson in Mesa is soooo much better than this place, at least 3 times the meat, tacos shells are crunchy without breaking your front tooth off, and they are much friendlier too.  Don't waste your time at this location, go to the one in Mesa, it will be worth your time!
