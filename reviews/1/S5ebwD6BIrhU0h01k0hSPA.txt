Servers were nice but the Worst chicken tacos I've ever tasted the server did warn us that wasn't their best dish but I thought, how bad can chicken tacos be?  I had a bite or two. Nasty, nasty. I'd even had a few drinks so was feeling good and still couldn't choke it down.  I see this place going under. Wonk wonk wonk.
