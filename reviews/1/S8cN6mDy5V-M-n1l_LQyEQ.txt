We heard about this place from a few people through social media so we decided to give it a try. 
When we arrived, the place maybe had 8 tables sat. Nothing 3 servers, a busser, and a bartender couldn't handle. We were sat promptly and shortly after the busser brought over some chips and salsa. There was nothing special about the chips, and the salsa was just ok.

We waited about 15 minutes for our server to come over to our table. When he finally came over, he asked us for our drink order. After the drinks were delivered, we waited again for our server. This is how our night went with the service. Extremely slow. I'm sure he is a nice guy but he is not a good server. If he was properly trained then he might have a chance.

The food was mediocre at best. Nothing special. 

There could be a lot of potential with this place if it was ran right.
