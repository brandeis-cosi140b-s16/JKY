I usually loveeee Chipotle's  and I order the bowl but this time I decided to order 3 tacos w flour shell, this was awful, they didnt wrap it individually it was all in one big foil, by the time it was time to eat them it looked like one big nasty mess, and wet from the steak meat, I had to throw it away after a couple bites, maybe the young teenage workers do not put much thought on the product since they are only there for gas and movies money right? oh well.
