This place really doesn't even deserve a star at all, I don't know why this place is still open. It doesn't feel like a Mexican restaurant one bit, Taco Bell food tastes better then this place. And the prices a marked up because there isn't any other Mexican food around the area. It's 4 dollars for a bean and cheese burrito and it's the smallest 4 dollar burrito I've ever seen. There is no creativity, no uniqueness to the food and I would rather there be a Taco Bell in this spot then this place, I think ASU Students deserve better prices and better tasting food. Put a Taco Bell in or even better a filibertos!!
