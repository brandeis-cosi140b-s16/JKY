My husband and I have lived in this area and have been going to this Rubio's location for several years. On each of our prior two visits for take out, our order was incorrect. Each time we called the restaurant and spoke with the manager on duty. The most recent time the manager offered to give us credit saying that they wanted to make it right and the next meal was on Rubio's and to just let them know the next time that we came in. 

This evening maybe not even two weeks since that visit, my husband went to get our usual takeout order and advised the manager that we were told our next meal was on Rubio's. The manager on duty, Oscar not only refused to honor this but became rude and argumentive saying that they didn't keep track of these things, that he needed to know the exact date, the name of the manager we spoke with and the exact meal so that he could go through all of the receipts for that evening. My husband explained that he didn't have the exact date and thought the managers name was Rick - Oscar said there were a lot of managers and he wouldn't honor the other manager's promise to make it right. My husband explained that we would pay this time but we would never be back and Oscar's response was 'whatever'. 

Very poor customer service this evening and even worse quality as of late. There are so many other places to eat near us, we have no problem never going to this Rubio's location again.
