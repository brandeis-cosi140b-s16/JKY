Zero stars if possible. Went there and saw 5 cars in the drive thru, decided to go in and order. 5 employees working, all focused on drive thru, no one acknowledged us for 5 minutes as I timed it. Ordered a Mountain Dew Slush and no one had replenished the mix, employee seemed bothered that they had to refill machine. Whole thing took 10 minutes and still no drink. Cancelled my 1 drink order, manager on duty had no clue what to do or say. Will never be back.
