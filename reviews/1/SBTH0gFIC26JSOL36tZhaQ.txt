The person helping me accidently put the "mild" salsa on my food. I asked her to remove it because of the raw onions. The manager was standing beside her. He was very rude, stating "my plate had cooked peppers & onions, why couldnt I eat the mild salsa/pico de gallo?".  I told him I cannot eat raw onions & would be picking the cooked onions off of my food, I liked the peppers. I was stunned a manager would act this way!  Even if I simply disliked onions, it wouldve been rude, but the fact is, onions make me sick.  Im alletgic to them or simply cannot digest onions.    On top of that, Im home w stomach problems today, and this was the only meal I ate yesterday!   I wont return.
