Two words: overpriced, yuck. Not great food. Cocktails are fine. Just not really my cup of tea. The Mexican food is not good at all. Chinese food items we ordered were much better! We are from tx after all--and this Mexican food is super nasty. Do not even step into this place if you're looking for good food. You won't find it here.

Overall: wouldn't ever step foot back in this place unless my veggie fried rice was free. Pretty disgusting.
