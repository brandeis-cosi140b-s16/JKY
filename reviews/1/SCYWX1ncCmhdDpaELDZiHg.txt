So sad...this place keeps getting worst every time.  All the food is saggy and over flowing with grease. And if you complain they give you an attitude. Over and over I keep getting my orders wrong and by the time I get home with the food I am just too disappointed to go back.  Called a couple of times and they don't care.  Yes I keep going back because it's the only Mexican food place in buckeye open 24 hrs...but I won't be back.
Can't wait for the one in Watson Rd. To open. Federico's let's see how your food is...
