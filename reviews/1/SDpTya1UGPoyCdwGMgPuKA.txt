The Absolute Worst Mexican Eats I've ever had in my life, and I mean it.  The staff was nice and service was great. . . Chips and salsa was good too, but the entrees. . . Yucky!

We ordered chicken burrito plate and I had cheese enchilada and chicken tacos. . . Chicken was without any flavor and super chewy. . .  Side of beans tasted an the sweeter side and almost as if had a glob of lard added, absolute ewe!  The enchilada sauce a failure, no flavor just some colored stuff thrown on it. . . The whole meal tasted like we were eating plastic.

Don't be tricked my so called "affordable prices,". Trust me go somewhere else where u wouldn't get disappointed, Taco Bell is even way much better than this place.

It was so bad that even now when we go to a Mexican restaurant, the yucky taste of this place haunts us!

I'm sorry to write a bad review but it was really too bad of a food.  We ended up leaving the waiter a tip anyway because I didn't want to punish him for the food.
