Their service is awful (waiters very irresponsible)!!! I have an allergic reaction to onions and I asked if they had any in one of the things I ordered...they told me no that they didn't, but guess what they did! Next thing I know I was covered in a rash....the thing is I asked... they should have been more responsible and made sure!!! Never going back again...I would be careful if I were you!
