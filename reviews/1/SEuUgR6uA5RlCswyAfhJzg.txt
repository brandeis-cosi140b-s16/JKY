Pay attention to the poor reviews on here, because they are spot on.

Our party of four had an awful experience. For starters the server was not happy to be there and not attentive to our table. There was a problem with the Coke, but he brought us out nasty tasting Cokes anyways. We told him that the Coke was off and he told us that there was a problem with the machine. That left us wondering why he brought us the Cokes when he knew they were bad. 

It only got worse from there as we waited forever for our food. It was seriously over an hour after we ordered before our food arrived, and when it did it was cold and wasn't made properly. We had to send it back because of that, but when they brought out the food again it seemed like it was the same food that had probably been microwaved as my friend felt the taco shell. It was really gross and we had to speak to the manager as we were not going to eat that. He disappeared on us for awhile, but he finally came back and apologized and removed the bill. We were still disappointed though, because it was a waste of time and we left hungry.
