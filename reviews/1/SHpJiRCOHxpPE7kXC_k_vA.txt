I'm absolutely APPALLED at this Taco Bell! I used to actually frequent it rather often, but went on a bit of a fast food hiatus. I had a craving for Taco Bell and thought, "why not?"

Oh, I found out "why not" in short order! First- the wait at the drive through was kind of ridiculous. Not just sitting in the line of cars, but once I'd placed my order, I sat at the window for quite awhile waiting for the food to be ready. When you're hungry and in a hurry, that's not the best thing. It is called "fast food" for a reason, right? Apparently not here.

Ok, food obtained. I get home, get settled, and go to open the mini chicken quesadilla. WHAT THE HELL IS THIS? First of all, the cheese is so melted that I can barely unrwrap the aluminum foil. Once I do get it open...my stomach lurched. The pile of BURNED, gooey, mess that is in the foil is absolutely disgusting. I can't believe that anyone thought it was a good idea to pass this off as food and serve it to anyone. I took (and posted) a picture, but it went straight into the garbage.

The chalupa was luckily in good shape, and the only reason this wouldn't get a ZERO star review. (other than the fact that we can't award zero stars here).  Obviously, I won't be returning.
