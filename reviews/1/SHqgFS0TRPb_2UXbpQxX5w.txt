I don't know what everyone is talking about... I have had bad luck at this place every time. Never going back... if you have a cheese allergy, beware! They will put it on your food whether you like it or not. Their salmon comes in a hard stick form, and they give you two shrimp in a 3 dollar taco covered in mass amounts of crap.  I actually went back because they gave me a free burrito from screwing up my order before. Then they gave me another bad order. Skip the free burrito and head to Baja Fresh for a way better meal.
