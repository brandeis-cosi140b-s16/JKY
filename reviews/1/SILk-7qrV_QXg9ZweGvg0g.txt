Worst dining experience ever! We went in and clearly ordered carne asada nachos and a NEVADA burrito. The cashier who was the manager also repeated our order back to us. We quickly noticed we didn't get a Nevada burrito and calmly told the manager that and asked for the right one. The manager quickly got angry saying that we order a carne asada burrito. We told him we did not and the manager called us insane and crazy. He was putting up a big fight with us. Arguing that we order a carne asada burrito. At the end of the conversation he called us "shitty" customers. We were so disgusted by this man we wanted our money back immediately. The manager REFUSED to give back our money. I  noticed a video camera on top of the cashier and asked him if his video recording had audio so we can prove to him that what we asked if was we ordered for. He said yes, but only the owner has access to it. I quickly called the other locations to talk to the owner and I told him the whole story. The owner told us if we can put the manager on the phone, but he refused to talk to us. So the owner called the store and talked to the manager. I hope this manager gets fired honestly. You do not call your customers shitty and crazy. After his phone call with the owner he quickly made the right burrito we order, even though I asked for my money. They're service was so disgusting it made their food disgusting also. We decided to leave after receiving the burrito because we were tired of all this bull sh*t. Never eating here again.
