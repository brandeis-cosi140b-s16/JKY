I usually love America's Taco Shop but this location is terrible. My $8 burrito was the size of a taquito and taste bland. It taste like nothing. Usually the Carne Asada burrito is huge and incredibly flavorful. So disappointed since I live right next to it. 

Stay away. Go to the other locations, they are actually great.
