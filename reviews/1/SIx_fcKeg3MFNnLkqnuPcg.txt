Wow. RAW CHICKEN. Yes, raw chicken and I am pretty sure I ate some. So I ordered two chicken bowls and the chicken was raw. I was so shocked I forgot to take a picture before taking it back to the manager. The worst part is that the manager did not even stop serving or change that tray of chicken. She just kept on ringing people up. That is not just gross, but a health hazard. Will NOT return to chipotle. This is probably not every chipotle and probably not everyday, but it's enough to keep me away.
