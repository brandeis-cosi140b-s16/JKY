I tried Qdoba again after some time off because I had several not so great visits in a row. Again, completely disappointed in this restaurant. Their portion sizes seem smaller than before and combined with the increase in price, no longer feels like a decent value.  I ordered the Pick 2 with the gumbo and 2 tacos with chips and a drink. My food was barely at room temperature and the chips were stale. The service was also pretty cold and not welcoming at all. $13.42 for less than par, small portions of food? No thanks. 

Considering the fact that it wouldn't take much more effort, I think I'll eat at Chipotle where I've never had any problems and stop giving Qdoba my business.
