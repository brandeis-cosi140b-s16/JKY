Had high hopes for this place.  Made reservations for 7pm, got a table at 8pm.  First thing I ordered was out.  Waiter recommended something else.  The food was horrendous - not just bad flavor, fundamentally inedible.  This place is typical for Southpark restauarants - crowded and very marginal food.
