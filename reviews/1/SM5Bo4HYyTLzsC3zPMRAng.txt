Just left the place. Now I wish I would have asked for the manager. The teenager Mexican girl decided I was done adding food to my order and closed my bowl. I told her I wasn't done and she rolled her eyes at me! Then when I asked for salsa she shot attitude at me and asked "which salsa?" That caused the teenage girl next to her to start laughing. The eye rolling teenager then said "well I don't know what fricken salsa they want. They have to tell me what they want." I can't believe this girl has a job here! She then turned to me and said "I already put pico and corn in the bowl. That's pretty much the same things that's in the salsa." After putting salsa on the side and paying for my food I am sure kicking myself for not getting her name or speaking to a manager right then and there.
