Bad service, the waitress could not answer any of our questions. Two of the three items we decided on they were out of at 5:30 pm. I then ordered the enchiladas which were dry and flavorless, we also ordered the chicken Fajitas  there were 5 tiny pieces of meat. The chips were store bought and the salsa tasted of pure smoke.  The food was poor at best and over priced. Not a place i would recommend.
