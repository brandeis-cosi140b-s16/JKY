Dont bother. We got takeout and we were dissappointed by the entire experience. 

*There were about 10 people working but they all seemed to just be hanging out.
*We were ther an hour before closing and they were out of everything.
*The enchilada sauce was extremely thick and mushy
*The food was cooked in a pizza oven which melted the cheese but left the insides cold
* There are plenty of filling options but they are all mediocre, the quality just isnt there.
*When you order food to go they just wrap the hot open faced container with paper and string, the paper rips and sticks yo your food, you are unable to stack the containers, and your food is cold by the time you get home.
* Theres no beans! Or rice!

Needless to say we will not be returning, we would rather have chipotle or Cafe Rio
