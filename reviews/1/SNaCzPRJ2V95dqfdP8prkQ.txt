I travel to Tijuana 3+ times per year and my favorite food of choice is street tacos.  When Tacos el Gordo then Taco Tijuana opened I was ecstatic! But alas, I was so dissaopinted with Taco Tijuana.  I usually ordered the Adobada tacos, you can't go wrong with Adobada, however time after time it was utter dissapointment.  The tacos were dripping with grease, I know, normal in tacos, BUT TO A POINT! When you open the tacos you can see liquid grease pooled in the bottom, about a tablespoon worth.  The meat is a joke, they also have about a tablespoon of meat in each tacos.  

If you need to get your Tijuana street taco fix, skip this place and head towards Charleston, if you want tacos and are on a tight budget go for Taco Tijuana for their 2Ã—1 tacos...
