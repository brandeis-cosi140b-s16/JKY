Never again will I go back to sandbar. I got there at 5:30pm looking to eat with my friends after the PGA tour. We knew we would have to wait for a little so we went to the bar. There were a ton of open tables that said reserved no big deal. We noticed that one said reserved at 6pm so when 7pm came around we asked if we could take that table....nope shot down real quick. So we waited a little longer still no table available but there were 5-6 tables empty around us. The staff did inform us if we wanted to order food at the bar we could hold our plates.....so we ordered some food and took our plates to the table reserved that said 6pm. We order just about $100 worth of food and the waitress said when the party arrives we need to leave it is the owners table Let just say the party never arrived and I will never give them my business again. I give them one star because the only thing good was there stale chips and salsa.
