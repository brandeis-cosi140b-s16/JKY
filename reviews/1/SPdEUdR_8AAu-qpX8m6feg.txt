Just bad. Tortillas were dry. Beef was chewy and the chicken was dry. Just moved to the area and wanted to give them a chance.  Tried a variety of the tacos, nachos and a gordita.  The only thing memorable was the gordita and that was barely. Drive an extra 5 mins down Charleston and hit up los tacos or tacos tijuana instead. WAY better. Also the place needs a nice mopping. They also charge a buck to use card and its not cheap. I won't be back.
