Mediocre service was the highlight.  Seriously.

Let's start at the beginning.  We were seated in a booth, and given menus.  This wouldn't be at all odd, but my preschool aged kids were also given menus, and not the kind you can color on--adult menus.  Odd, but you don't lose any points for that.

After sitting for what seemed like a really long time, we had the opportunity to order beverages--the kids had chocolate milk which arrived in a styro-cup with a lid intact, but no straws.  We had to actually ask for straws, and then watched as our confused waitress visited every table in our section straws in hand, trying to figure out who needed them before solving the puzzle.

The food came and it was atrocious to put it mildly.  I burned my elbow against my plate, which would have been somewhat my fault, if I didn't have a taco salad.  The lettuce was hot, the tomatoes were hot, the cheese was hot.  I suspect they cooked the whole thing, plate and all in an oven.  I might have gotten past it, if the beef weren't swimming in soup at the bottom of the soggy taco shell.  

I also ordered chicken tacos, which had dry flavorless meat, cheese which tasted like processed mozzarella string cheese, and nothing else.  Bleh.  I didn't finish either dish.

My wife ordered steak ranchero tacos, which came with a decent presentation, but my wife said they were also flavorless.  She offered me her last taco, but I'll take her word for it, that it was bland.

After trying to coax my kids into eating their quesadillas, I decided to take a bite myself, and wanted to cry.  Picture melted string cheese encasing a frozen chicken strip.

Next time we are craving decent Mexican, (which is almost always, since we are California transplants), we are driving the extra 10 minutes to Tequila in Rock Hill.  The place looks like a dive inside and out, but the food and service has never disappointed.
