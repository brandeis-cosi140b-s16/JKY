Um... I didn't like this place. I thought the food was bland and the taco shells were so wet and mussy they sell apart when I picked them up. I got fish tacos. The beans and rice were terrible the beans looked like dog vomit. I went with a friend and she said it was amazing and pretty authentic. You really can't get what you want because the girl at the counter can't speak English. Well I didn't like this place I would rather eat at any Mexican restaurant. But if your looking for an authentic California taco place this is it!!
