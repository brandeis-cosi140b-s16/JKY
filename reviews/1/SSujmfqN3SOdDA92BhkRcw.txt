Ate here while in Vegas. Do not listen to the positive reviews, you will be highly disappointed that you spent 35 dollars on food. I got the chicken tacos and my girl got the cantina tacos, the food was almost inedible but we did not feel like complaining. Maybe they expected everyone who comes in around 10 to be wasted so they serve them any crap they want. Who puts Parmesan cheese on Mexican food? Enough said. Eat here at your own risk. Only thing I liked was the friendly host with the glasses and vest.
