SCREW THIS PLACE. WARNING ALL CALIFORNIANS THIS COMPANY SUCKS. Apparently vertical ID's are not accepted because some nitwit of a waitress wasn't smart enough to notice fake IDs and the employers don't know how to properly train their employees. It's Vegas, CHECK MORON. and we are not accepted to drink here. So unfortunately corporate decided that people loose their jobs for serving vertical ID'd 21 year olds. This place doesn't deserve a star. 

Just a horrible, ridiculous company. I hope you loose more good paying customers.
