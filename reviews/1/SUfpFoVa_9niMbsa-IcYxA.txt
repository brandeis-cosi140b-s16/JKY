*note: the one star is only given because of the look of the restaurant.

My partner called and made reservations on November 19 at 9pm. 
The hostess was told that it was my birthday dinner and to make sure that the server knew. 
We get to Javier's and not only do they have us waiting 20 minutes after our reservation but the hostess was some snobby girl who barely acknowledge us probably because we are young. 
We get sat and notice that there was a lot of Latin Grammy directors/crew/etc. we were sat right in the middle of the restaurant but the servers seemed so very attentive to the people to the Latin Grammys that they forgot about us. Seriously? 
*IF YOU LOOK LIKE YOU ARENT RICH OR YOU ARE YOUNG, THEN mOST LIKELY
YOU WILL GET SHITTY SERVICE* 
we finally get a server to get our drink order, then we have another server bringing our drinks and then had another server take out food order. Like who are we supposed to tip ? 
We continue our "dining experience" and hope that the food is at least good considering that it is considered pricey Mexican food . 
My best friend orders a shrimp quesadilla. She looked past the $30 PRICE FOR A QUESADILLA CONSISTING OF ONE LARGE TORTILLA. MONTEREY CHEESE AND RUBBERY SHRIMP. she clearly wasn't happy but didn't make a complain.
I then order an Antojito platter. 
Not only was the server too rushed to tell me what kind of meat the items came with (because the menu doesn't say) but the mini quesadillas CAME WITH SHRIMP!!!!! THE SERVER NEVER TOLD ME AND I ONLY FOUND OUT UNTIL I BIT INTO IT. I AM ALLERGIC TO SHRIMP AND MY LIPS STARTED SWELLING UP . 
we told one of the servers and HE STILL DARED TO ASK ME IF I WAS REALLY ALLERGIC OR I JUST DIDNT LIKE IT. THE NERVE.....
what's the worst was they just brought me a regular quesadilla with less cheese, no apology, no nothing. AND to think I was excited about celery rating my birthday here. 
We finish eating, the food honestly could've been better and tastier from a hole in the wall off the strip or from Cabo wabo cantina at planet Hollywood .
And for a lower, lower price. 
The server didn't ask how everything was, was just pushing more drinks on us and we just wanted to go. 
We got the check, THEY FORGOT IT WAS MY BIRTHDAY (Which we were told they would bring me a little something and sing for me) but nothing. 
He dropped off the check, picked it up and then made a point that how could a beautiful lady like my best friend be paying for me ! 
MAYBE IF YOU WERE REMINDED THAT IT WAS MY BIRTHDAY OR EVEN ACTUALLY BOTHERED READING MY ID WHEN YOU ASK FOR IT ( which clearly you didn't even read how old I was) but YOU WOULDVE KNOWN WHY MY GIRL BESTFRIEND PAYED FOR MY FOOD. 
We left with an unsettled stomach based on the food and the experience. 
And to top it all off. The check came out to about 125 with taxes and we left well above 20% just to laugh at these servers faces who thought we didn't have money. 
I'm sure they need that 25% tip way more than we did. 
Definitely never coming back here and letting all our friends/family know since this was one of my favorite restaurants before .
