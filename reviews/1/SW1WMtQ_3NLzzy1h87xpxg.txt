Save your money, the good reviews here are fake. Worst mexican food i had in a long time. As others have said they use a microwave to cook food and to top it off me and the wife both had massive stomach pain and wife felt sick 4 hours later, possible food poisoning. At this point any chain fast food joint would have been better then this place. Try it yourself if you want but i wouldnt advise it..
