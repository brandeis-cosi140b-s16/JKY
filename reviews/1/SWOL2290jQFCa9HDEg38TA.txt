Fooled by the good reviews and some commercial they are playing on one of the free local TV channels... my husband insisted we go... Ok - we go... Saturday night 8-ish we walk in and there is literally no one in the restaurant.. Not a good sign.. We walk up to a counter and are greeted by the somewhat shy waitress telling us we can pick any table... literally any table - they were all ours.. 
Decor is nothing spectacular - typical local mexican joint decor maybe with a little more artistic touch on the walls... sat at a booth like table and benches - really uncomfortable seating..
Did not take too much time to order - were served stale chips (really hard!) and hot and hotter runny salsa - did not care much for either, but had to keep us busy while our food was cooking.. so had to have some of it... No pico de gallo or any other salsa - we asked.. 
So - the food... If you like real mexican food - don't go here!!! Took a while to cook, so we were thinking it will be some good fajitas... well, were we wrong? If you want your fajitas NOT sizzling hot and served in a little melamine oval bowl (I wish i took a photo!) come here... pay $12+ for a stingy portion and leave someone hungry and definitely not satisfied - that would be the place to try... I think returning to spend our time and money here will not be something we'll do.. I could not leave 0 stars - leaving 1 star for the waitress being nice and looking after her only customers..
