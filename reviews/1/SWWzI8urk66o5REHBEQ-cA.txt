This place was pretty atrocious.  I had the fajita burrito and the beef was so touch I could hardly get it down.  The food was exceptionally bland.  It's like whoever cooked it had never heard of salt, onion or cilantro.  My friend and I both left extremely disappointed and didn't even take our leftovers.
