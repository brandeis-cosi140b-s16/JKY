Food was awful.... totally tasteless. The server we had was terrible. And.... we just looked at our credit card statement.... they have added $1.00 to our tip. Obviously not worth disputing, but if they are doing this to everyone, knowing that it isn't worth disputing, just think of how much money they are making in extra tips. Believe me, the $10 we left the server on our $62.00 bill was well more than she deserved in the first place! AVOID THIS PLACE. Go grab a burger, you will be better off!
