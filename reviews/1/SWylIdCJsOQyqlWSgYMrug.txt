Horrible service....Pulled up to the window at the drive thru and waited 3-4 minutes before i was even greeted. I ordered Carne Asada fries with everything on it.  I opened it up, and it had soft soggy fries and the meat with minimal cheese. I took it back inside, explained the situation, so they took the fries they gave me, put everything on it, and refused to heat it up, it was cold upon serving. They could careless about customer service. will never return, worth it to drive further for a different place.
