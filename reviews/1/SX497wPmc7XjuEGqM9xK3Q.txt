Just left.   Ordered a 3 Sauce Chicken Burrito WITHOUT ONIONS AND PEPPERS.   Had 1.5 glasses of Coke and Chips.   20 minutes later I get my lunch prepared incorrectly.   I can't eat onions and peppers.   Paid $2.91 for the coke.   No free Soda when you lose 20 minutes and you can't wait an additional 20 minutes for the correct Burrito,  when they prepare your lunch incorrectly.   No manage apology.   Not real busy.  There might be a problem.   No reason to go back.
