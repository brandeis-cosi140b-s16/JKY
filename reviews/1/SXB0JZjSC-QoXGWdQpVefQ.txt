Well... I just returned from the ER. 

The only thing I ate yesterday was the chicken quesadilla which tasted good at the time but wasnt worth the throwing up and food poisoning pain for the last 6 hours. I dont know if it was just a chance incident but  frankly I do not care. I will never go here again even tho i live across the street. 

if i were you i would keep on looking, go to taco bell or something, at least you know u can sue a big corporation if you get sick.
