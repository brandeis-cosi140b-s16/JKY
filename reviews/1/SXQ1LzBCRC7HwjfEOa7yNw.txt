The customer service is so so but I don't care. The food is what matters. Since moving to Arizona I have yet find a place that makes good chorizo. This place definitely doesn't. It tastes like a white person who never heard of it and made it. I'm white but I really love chorizo for the morning. But I tried other food they made, not impressed. It doesn't take a lot to impress me. Get my order right and make good food, I'm happy. Thing is, it wasn't good. Bland. Been here twice, no intentions of going back.
