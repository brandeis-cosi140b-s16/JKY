If you want bland food. Eat here! We decided to try the place due to the great reviews. But the food and service was terrible.  First off we ordered tacos. My tacos came out with one corn tortilla and meat on it. Nothing else. No cilantro or onions. Nothing. So when we asked if there was salsa they said it was in the salsa bar. Nothing in the salsa bar except cucumbers carrots and jalapeno sauce (green spicy sauce). The meat tasted super bland like all they used to season it was pepper. We also got a burrito. Same thing beans cheese and Carne esada. Very bland.  No seasoning. They finally brought us some Pico DE Gallo for the tacos but at that point we were done.  And it wasn't even good. We ordered chips and salsa. We got no salsa and the chips were rubber. So terrible. Will never go here again!
