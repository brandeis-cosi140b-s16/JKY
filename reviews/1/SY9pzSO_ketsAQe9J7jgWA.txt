Was so disappointed. Normally love their food, this particular place what a let down. Traveled here for business, was excited to eat some El Pollo Loco after a seven hour drive only to be disappointed by dried up chicken, tortillas were so hard my teeth could not penetrate them. I ordered the two piece chicken, breast & wing, the wing was so dried up that it was meatless. The Mac & Cheese was so old that it was discolored and looked funny. 
If you eat here, good luck.
The staff is friendly.
