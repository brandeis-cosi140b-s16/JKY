My first impression of this restaurant was awful. The employees were horrible... Worst customer service, especially in a place like Vegas. They didn't smile, and they gave me a hassle to add sides to my steak and shrimp burrito. (It's pre-layed out) The food was good, but I deffinately won't be eating here again. I actually created this account just to post this, that's how horrible the customer service was.
