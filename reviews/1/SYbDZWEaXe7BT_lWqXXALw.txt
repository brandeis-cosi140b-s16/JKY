I wish I could give a better review, but because we sat there for 20 minutes with no service, we left. Multiple servers and managers walked by with not one word being said to us. All we wanted was a good lunch outside on a patio and that seemed too difficult for this place to deliver. When we went to leave,  I let the hostess know we received no service and it seemed to not have really mattered. I've been in the food industry as a bartender for 8 years, and this was one of the worst experiences I've had. I know the 20 minutes sounds like an exaggeration because that's what customers do, especially when hungry, but I only knew because we started actually paying attention to the time tick away. I would never ever recommend this place to anyone, in fact I would go out of my way to tell people not to go there. Get it together Carlos, this is Vegas. Step up your game a bit. But then again, because it is Vegas, they don't have to care about one persons review because people will go there no matter what because of the name. Unfortunate for those future customers.
