Food is terrible. Chips were stale and the salsa tastes like it came from a grocery store brand. Tried the quesadilla for an app and burrito for dinner, neither were very good. Decent happy hour but if you're looking for restaurant option based on food taste and quality, I'd recommend skipping this one.
