We visited a few weeks ago.  My daughter ordered a kid's meal, which was actually served on a school lunch tray and was just as flavorful.  My husband ordered 2 street tacos which were greasy (they had been grilled with cheese unlike most street tacos) and served with mediocre sides of black beans and rice.  My meal was the most tolerable, but only because I requested no cheese or dairy of any kind.  I had to wait longer as they remade my meal, because they made a mistake and originally put cheese on it.  I also had a margarita, which was watered down.

Given the poor food quality, I don't expect this restaurant to last much longer than others that have been at the spot.  But if you are at the mall and looking for "Mexican" food, I suggest Rubio's - it's much better than this place.
