Tres Pesos.....not even worth un peso!!!!

On Cinco De Mayo 6 ladies were looking for mexican cuisine and got no utensils to eat any of it with!!  To not be able to serve us any drinks the entire night and have to wait so long that we were about to get up and walk out (some people did) was a disgrace.  We finally had to get our own drinks, own utensils and had to find our own food!  The manager said that he'd 'take care of it'....what that meant was get us a "free drink" that we ended up having to pay for in the end!  They could have made a lot of money out of us if they had only paid attention to our empty drinks.  Half of our food was not brought out but of course they tried to charge us for it.  Then when we wanted to pay and get out it took them an hour to put it together.  Of all days the manager decided to train the girl on our bill.  Then to add salt to the wound we were charged an 18% gratuity with our bill...and this may have been because they knew they did not deserve it and would not have gotten that much had they let us decide what to give them.....un peso.

In all honesty the food was worth about 4 stars but the service is not even worth one!  Service is what makes the experience and this was the worst.  Azteca was busier than this place and we probably could have gotten a seat, had awesome food and left the same time we ended up leaving this place.  I would avoid at all costs!
