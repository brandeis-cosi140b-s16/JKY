I came here for lunch on My brake and I was disappointed with the food. I order some carne asada fries and the meat on it was cold and without seasoning also I ask for extra salsa and the cashier lady told Me it was extra charge. I think I had paid enough money for My food to be charged extra for simple salsa.
