This place sucks.  period.  The food is low-end, soggy, overpriced crap.  The service is a joke - you should not come here if you have plans within even 2 hours of entering this place because you will probably still be waiting for your check.  Oh yeah and the best part?!  They dont "do" change.  SO basically if you dare to pay for your meal with cash - don't expect any of the change they owe you from YOUR money.  Probably to save for their pathetic servers because I doubt they actually get tipped anything.  This is quintessential Charlotte BS built for use by the culture-less yuppie zombies that are slowly taking over this city.....beware.
