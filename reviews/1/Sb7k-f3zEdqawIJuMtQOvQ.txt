one star.  yes, that's right.  i went in for a quick bite on my lunch break.  7/14 4:48 PM.  i ordered tacos.  brown rice, black beans.  (i still don't eat meat or dairy)  i wanted lettuce and the famous guacamole BUT, they were almost empty and the lettuce had drops of sour cream and the guacamole had shredded cheese in there.  GROSS.  yeah, i know cross contamination is bound to happen in restaurants BUT this is just unacceptable.  so i left with just rice and bean soft corn tacos and some salsa.  i drove back to my desk ready to dig in and low and behold: the rice is not cooked all the way.  FML.  i'm starving.  i'm crunching on the rice as i type this.  i doubt i will EVER go back to this one again.  the dinner rush hadn't even started yet.  i can't imagine how that's going to go down.  uncooked rice.  i'm very disappointed Chipotle.  ONE STAR!
