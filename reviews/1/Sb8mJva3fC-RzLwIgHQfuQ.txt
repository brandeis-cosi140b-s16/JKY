If I could give negative stars, I would.....poorly managed (not even sure there is one)....unbelievably dirty.....food disgusting....staff unattractive and rude....over-priced..overwhelming odor of urine...basically, the worst experience i've ever had.....whoever is the owner obviously doesn't live here or just doesn't care...would be surprised if they were open this time next year...
