Talk about shitty service. They would have to get better to be consider bad. Talking to the bartender was like talking to a brick wall, it won't talk back and it doesn't understand. I for sure won't be going back the food was over priced, the service was awful, the atmosphere sucked, and getting a root canal would be more enjoyable. P.S., this really needs a thumbs down button. Save your money and go elsewhere!
