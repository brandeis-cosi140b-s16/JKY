Wanted to check this place out ever since I went in to pay for gas but never had time to stop in and order food. I finally made the stop specifically to try the food with such high reviews. Unfortunately the service leaves much to be desired. There was only one guy behind the counter and after he served the two people at the counter he didn't look my way or acknowledge me in any way. Still I gave him the benefit of the doubt and waited...and waited some more. Nope I had to leave. My meal was not going to be free, no handouts, so I expect to be acknowledged and served. I took my money and my business elsewhere. I will not be back.
