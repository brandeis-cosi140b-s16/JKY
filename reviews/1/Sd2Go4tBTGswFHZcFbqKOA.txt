Labor Union Edit:

La Hacienda is currently in some deep water regarding their hiring practices.  Back wages haven't been paid, etc...  So for now, they're down to one star as you don't cross a picket line.

Open late with pretty consistent food, La Hacienda is a pretty safe bet.   It's not going to wow you or impress your friend from San Diego, but its close to downtown, the service is friendly, and the prices reasonable.

Try the horchata, a favorite of mine.
