Came here Saturday 8/23 around 6:20pm.  One other family was in the lobby so it wasn't busy.  Waited at the counter for about five minutes before being acknowledged.  We could hear the employees talking and laughing in the back.  The reason an employee finally came up was due to another customer at the receiving end of the counter, that complained about waiting for his order. Which they admitted to him was accidentally deleted.  We finally got our order in.  Went to get drinks and the floor mat and surrounding area were sticky.   After getting our food and eating, more customers came in and dealt with the sticky floor problem.  During our visit, two employees walked over it without a care in the world.  We saw one lady's flip
 flop come off of her foot because it was stuck on the floor.  Saw another customer complain about not getting their order in a timely manner.  Same problem as the earlier guy, deleted order!  Our food was fine, but the customer service and dining area were terrible.  I've been there many times in the past and I have never seen it this poorly maintained.  We will not be visiting this one again for quite some time.  Hopefully, they will get a manager and employees that have some pride in their job and in maintaining their establishment.
