I went here as part of a company dinner while we were in Vegas on business. The guys swore by it, saying they had been there each year during this particular trade show and it was terrific.

Everything about the restaurant was pretty unappetizing... The condiments on the table consisted of chips, a watery substance that I think was supposed to be salsa, and a grey paste that I think was supposed to be bean dip. I ordered a chicken quesadilla, thinking that would be safe enough, however it tasted pretty bad and I only ate about 4 bites of it.

However, 4 bites turned out to be enough to cause the worst food poisoning I've ever had, which kicked up around midnight that night and lasted until noon the next day.  I spoke to the other person in our party who had ordered the same thing as me, and sure enough, she had gotten sick too.

Needless to say, I will not be going to this restaurant ever again. Ever.
