Thought I'd give this place a try. I love Taco Bell and heard this place was comparable. Well, I think I'll stick with Taco Bell. At del taco you have to order sour cream and pay extra on your taco. The quesadilla was a greasy mess, the tacos were bland and their sauces definitely have nothing on taco bell's. 

For fast food and the cost. Stick to what you know. This isn't my place to go.
