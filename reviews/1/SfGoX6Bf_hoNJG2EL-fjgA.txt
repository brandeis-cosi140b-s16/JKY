My husband and I decided to try Little Sombrero for lunch a few days ago, because both of us love Mexican food (burritos are probably my husby's favorite meal). We were not expecting anything much, and sadly, we got even less than we were expecting. I should have known something was wrong when they didn't have carne asada or pico de gallo, but we were hungry, so we gave it a chance.

Both of us ordered burritos. I ordered mine with a lot of extra stuff on it, because I love taste and spice (I had a chicken burrito with green chile sauce, tomatoes, cheese, beans, lettuce, and sour cream). I asked for pico de gallo, but they didn't have it. My husband got a regular chicken burrito. He asked for guacamole, but they forgot it. Everything was BLAND, BLAND, BLAND! Although I could see the green chile sauce, it didn't taste like anything. The chicken was tasteless, the tortilla was soggy. All of the ingredients tasted like someone went to Walmart, bought a bunch of bulk canned food off the bottom shelf, and then slapped it into a factory tortilla without adding any kind of flavoring, not even salt. Absolutely disgusting. I've eaten better hospital food.

We paid $13 for a plate I took home and fed to the dog. We will definitely not be back.
