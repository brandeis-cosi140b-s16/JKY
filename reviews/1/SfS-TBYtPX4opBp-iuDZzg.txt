This review is for the location on Decatur & Cactus. I went through the drive thru to order a carne machaca burrito & when I got home, I did not have carne machaca in my burrito. I had shredded beef (wet). Carne machaca is a dry, finely shredded beef meat. I went back to ask for my money back and the girl at the drive thru told me that there was carne machaca in my burrito and I got into a short argument with her. I told her carne machaca was DRY and she rolled her eyes and closed the window to go tell someone else. Another lady comes to the window and asked what the problem was and once again, I start arguing. She claimed that anywhere I went, I would get WET shredded beef as "carne machaca." Which is ABSOLUTELY ridiculous because I have had REAL carne machaca at the Roberto's on Buffalo and Charleston. My whole family is from Sinaloa, MX & we know what real carne machaca is. Don't claim to have carne machaca on your menu when you DON'T! 1st & last time I ever go here.
