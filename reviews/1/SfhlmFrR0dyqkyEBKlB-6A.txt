We went with a group of 9 of us girls.  I requested a "little" bit of sour cream on my tacos and they wanted to charge for a bowl. Really?  Who eats a bowl of sour cream on a taco? I also requested a few peppers and they too wanted to charge for a bowl of them.  My butt would be on fire the next am if I had a bowl if peppers and you want to charge me for the discomfort, good lord!!!...I requested to talk to management... His response was rude and advised me that even if I wanted a dab of sour cream or 1 slice of pepper they would charge for the bowl and to deal with it.  Total charge would have been 4.95.  I sent my entire plate back and said I guess I won't be paying for a dinner then or my margarita.  They could have made 20.00+ off me, but rather made zero.  The manager name is Usiel Molina.  He's rude and seriously should not be in customer service let alone management.  The others were not very pleased with the food.  The only thing this place has going is the patio environment.
