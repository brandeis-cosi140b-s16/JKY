This was my first time at Sol Diablo for taco Tuesday. Needless to say it'll be my last. After 15 min of sitting at a table in a restaurant with 4 other tables a girl finally greeted our table. We gave her our orders after looking at the little flip page of specials we never received menus. After another 10min I spotted another server who was also behind the bar and I walked up and asked if we could have some waters since we never got anything. Our original server brought them over after mine had a bug in it and no I'm not making this up. I flagged down the 'bartender' who then got the original girl to bring over a new water. Finally after 25min we received our food which was not good but at that point I was so hungry I ate my 3 mini tacos. I asked the server if I could have a napkin which I never received so I walked over to a table and grabbed one for myself. We then asked for our bills which took another 10min to be ran through and brought back. I have been a server for over 6 years and still am part time now and I can honestly say I'm more patient with servers because I understand how hard it can be. However honey if you can't handle 4 tables at 12:30 on a Tuesday in a slow restaurant maybe you should find a different job.
