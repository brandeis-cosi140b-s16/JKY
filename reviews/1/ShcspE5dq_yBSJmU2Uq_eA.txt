Worst Mexican food chain ever! The places are clean and nice, but the food is so generic and overpriced its not funny! If you think this is Mexiacn food, you'd be better off dining at Taco Bell and saving some $$! I can't stand this/these places... Been to them in Fresno, San Francisco, and now here in PHX, and they are all the same... BORING FOOD.
