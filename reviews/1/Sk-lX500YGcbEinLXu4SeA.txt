I came to Don Tortaco expecting it to be a slightly better version of Robertos. I was wrong. The decor might be better, but the food is a notch below. The carne asada fries lacked flavor and had chunks of fat in it. I've never seen such large chunks of fat in any Robertos I've ever had.  The meat seemed to lack flavor, didn't remind me of the carne asada fries that I love.

The staff is a whole other story. Hard to find anyone to order from. Lady at the front desk is extremely inattentive and will literally run away from you to the back so she can play on her phone and play music. My girlfriend walked up to ask for a cup of water, after the cook sees her, he runs off to the side and starts chatting with the cashier. Most unacceptable behavior I've seen anywhere in a long time.


There are too many Robertos nearby that are much better for the same price. No reason to ever come to this place and their insultingly rude staff.
