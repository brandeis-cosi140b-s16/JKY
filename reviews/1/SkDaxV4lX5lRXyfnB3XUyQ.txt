When Villa's first opened, we ate there at least once a week, usually for Taco Tuesday. The quality and quantity of the food was excellent. After I moved out of the area, I only went there about once a month. About 6 months ago, I was there for a taco and a burrito around 1 in the afternoon. It took over 20 minutes to get my food and there was only 1 other person in front of me. The food was barely warm, the burrito mostly tortilla, the taco was not very tasty with a lot less meat than they had served before. Yesterday, my son stopped and got tacos and a child's plate to go. I could not believe what they made up - the tacos had less the 1 TEASPOON of shredded meat in it, it was more of a pico/cheese taco (we ordered them without lettuce). The rice was absolutely tasteless and the cheese on my grand-daughter quesadilla tasted moldy. Horrible food and service there now. Will not be going back.
