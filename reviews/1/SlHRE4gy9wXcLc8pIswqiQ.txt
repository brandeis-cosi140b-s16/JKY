I just returned from Sylvia's La Canasta and will NOT be returning.  I have been going to Sylvia's for at least a decade now and have seen the decline of the resturant mostly due to the lack of good servers.  The food is good but I can always get the same thing down the street at Las Compadres with better service.  When I have ordered on the phone been told that it would be 10 minutes and get there about 20 mintues later the food is not ready and they have to put in another order.  I always ask what's the point of calling in if I have to order when I get here again, always no answer.  

Today I walked in didn't bother calling, because well what's the point.  Ordered a #10 got home to start working again and started opening my food, they forgot the rice and beans.  That might not seem like a deal breaker but with all the other crap I have chosen not to go back.
