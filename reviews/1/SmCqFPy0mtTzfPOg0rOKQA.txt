I was so excited to see Chipotle in that spot many resturants have tried that location and nothing stays open. Not thinking this will either. The staff was unfriendly almost rude. They acted like they were being bothered to help and like you should know the menu by heart or something. The food was made so sloppy that my tacos has more sour cream on the outside of the shell than the inside. I only had to drive 2 blocks home and they were complety soggy, cold and gross. The taco meal which is 3 tacos, and a kids cheese crisp cost just short of 12 bucks. Way to much considering more that half of it went in the trash. Yuck, will never go back. And when I talked to my mom that lives near by about it she said the one time she went in will be the only time she ever goes either. Major disapointment.
