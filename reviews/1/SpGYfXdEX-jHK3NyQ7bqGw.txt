Giving a one star is very generous. Ate there last night for one reason, the fabulous location. To start off there was a 45 minute wait and the restaurant was half empty, that was the first sign something was not right. Second sign, the most rude bartender on the face of the earth and we still stuck it out. Finally got to our table and the bad adventure begun. To start off, the tortilla chips were just covered with salt and seasoning spice, you have to clean them off, one at a time. The salsa is nothing but tostitos southwest sauce they've sold for years, just garbage. As for the service, after the 6th time the waitress telling you your food will be right out and 1 hour and 10 minutes gone by, who really wanted to eat ? We should have walked out and headed to Taco Bell for a better meal, enough said. As for the Superbowl visitors, I'm from Phoenix this is a no go, don't ruin your night.....................
