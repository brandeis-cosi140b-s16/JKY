I always say I am going to do a review on this Taco Bell and never do, mainly because I am too busy trying to get other food together for the kids since they have ruined my order yet again. 
They are rude when you order and act like they are doing you a favor. Every single time our order is messed up. Their drive-through always takes forever (we just waited at 7:30 at night over 13 minutes),  they are always out of everything and they never participate in promotions. I have literally never once got the correct order from there. A couple weeks ago they gave us somebody else's order, and the worst thing about it is we didn't find out till he got home! 
I always say I will never go back and this time I mean it.
