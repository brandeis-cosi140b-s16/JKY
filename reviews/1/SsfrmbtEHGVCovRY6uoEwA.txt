Have you ever had to wait 30 minutes in the drive through? Neither had I until I went to this hell hole. The obese woman who takes your money had a look of emptiness in her eyes as if she knows her life has peaked. I'm sure the cook was sleeping or getting high in the bathroom while I was waiting for my order of one burrito with two cars in front of me. I can't believe it took literally 30 minutes from when I drove up to when I was given my receipt and not even thanked for paying them to give me diarrhea. Screw that.
