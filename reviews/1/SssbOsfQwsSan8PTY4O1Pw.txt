We went there on a Tuesday night for a family dinner. Granted we had 14 people, but the receptionist Was very rude. Don't think he wanted to be there that night. He told us it would be a very long wait. Yes they were busy but he was very rude and not helpful. We ended up leaving and went to Macayos. Got seated right away.  Had great service and the food was. Great. Unfortunately I missed out on la Pinatas great hot sauce.
