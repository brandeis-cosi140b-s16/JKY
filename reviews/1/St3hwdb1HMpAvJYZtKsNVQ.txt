Ordered three Las Vegans...got turkey burgers. Sat for twenty MORE minutes, in addition to the original twenty we waited for wrong orders, and not even an offer to refund or discount. One cashier even tried to play the blame game. Eat at your own risk. This place has really cheap prices and it's because they couldn't care less what they're serving you as long as they already got your money.

!!!!!!!!DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!!!!!
