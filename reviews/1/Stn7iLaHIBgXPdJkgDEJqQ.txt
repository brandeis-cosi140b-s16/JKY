We have loved this restaurant since it opened. Not so much since the renovation. We ate there Friday night. Not sure if the waiter was bad at the job or if he couldn't hear us over the very first loud music. We had to repeatedly ask for things. My husband put the his empty drink glass on the edge of the table, the waiter passed our table several times even stopping to bring us things. We were given one refill, only after we asked for it.
