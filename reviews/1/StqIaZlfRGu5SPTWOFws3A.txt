So upset. I ordered chips and cheese (thinking it would be melted queso cheese like every other restaurant) but it was just shredded cheese on top of a bunch of chips. I even asked the girl if it was queso and she said yes. Oops, language barrier. I also ordered a bean and cheese burrito and it was SO nasty. The beans were like canned bean dip, I had to add sour cream and a ton of other condiments to make it edible. I asked if I could get a beef burrito without the red tomato sauce and was told that it's all pre-made, so no. WOULD NOT recommend.
