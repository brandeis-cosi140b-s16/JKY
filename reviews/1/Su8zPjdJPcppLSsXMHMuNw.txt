Very disappointed in this restaurant. We came here after a friends' recommendation. The restaurant itself is in a strip mall which that in itself takes away a bit of the ambiance. The outdoor seating is much nicer though. Our waiter was very awkward and second guessed every word he spoke. He seemed really shy....kinda felt bad for him. I ordered a blended Margarita....and it was terrible. It tasted like a very cheap mix, and the blender didn't even blend all of it. As for the chips and salsa....the bean dip they give us was salty, and the salsa had no spice. The green salsa is actually sweet. Onto the food, I ordered the special chimichanga with Carne Asada. It was covered in a gross (cheese sauce?) That was supposed to be spinach cream sauce. The meat was so salty I could barely stomach it, and the meat was all I could find in the chimi. So plain but they just salted the crap out of it to make up for it. All in all I will never return here.....taco bell is better....and cheaper.
