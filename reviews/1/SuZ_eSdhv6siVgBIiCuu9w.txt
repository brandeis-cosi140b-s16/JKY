We should've walked out the door when the waitress said it was her first day, but we unfortunately did not. Drink order was slow, but we were patient. We ordered tableside guacamole and the kid making it said it was his 2nd time doing it. I assisted in the making and improved it after he left adding my own salt, lime and hot sauce. It still had 0 taste. But we were hungry...waited another 20 min to see the waitress. When we did, she was getting cussed out by a patron and that family of 5 just got up and left. She disappeared for at least 20 min. When she came back she was crying and had to go to the ladies room. 5 more min. I went in to calm her down and then she came out and took our order. 30 min go by, no food. Our children are losing it bc we've been there 2 hours now. Ask to get it packed up to go. My husband and I leave to get the kid out of there while they wait for the food to go. Another 20 min, apparently they are "packing up the food". Long time to do so. They go to pay after all the waiting and nothing is comped off the bill. And trust me, they know it's been a total disaster. 

When they bring the food back, the fajitas had no tortillas, the taco salad was inedible. No taste of seasoning whatsoever. The shrimp looked and tasted canned, and smelled foul.  

I wish there was 1 place to put blame but the whole experience was a disaster between the waitress, guac maker, chefs and poor response by mgmt. 

I'm hungry. Going to hit Taco Bell.
