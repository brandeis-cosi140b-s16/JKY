Went to Chuy's 2 days after the re-opening.  New kitchen staff and cashiers. Service was awful, the cashier stated they were brand new, and it showed.  The food was atrocious, over cooked and the salsa bar looked like it had been sitting there for hours without being restocked with fresh salsa. The place was dirty and the whole vibe was a downer.  I've been going to that Chuy's for at least 4 years, but I doubt I will be back....
