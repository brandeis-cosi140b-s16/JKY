This place had  a nice write up in the North Las Vegas View and we love Mexican food so we were pretty stoked to go. The decor is fun, I like the tequila bottle chandelier - but my admiration for the place ends there. My husband ordered Enchiladas de Camarones, but when he bit into it, there were no shrimp to be found, just a gooey cheesy mess. We asked the waiter, thinking maybe they had given us the wrong order, but no... it was the correct dish. See, there's a shrimp, right there! Are you kidding me? The shrimp specimen in question was like one of the tiny little shrimps they put in cat food, and even then there were only about two whole pieces of shrimp. The other "shrimp" were chopped up into mystery meat that didn't look or taste like shrimp.

 I ordered some sort of salmon dish, hoping for something healthier. I ended up eating just my beans because the fish was so soggy, stinky and fishy tasting! We also mentioned this to the waiter, but he just shrugged apologetically. The manager couldn't be tracked down and we were out of luck, and a lot of money, just like that. We thought about writing an "angry letter" but I was afraid I'd end up with a gift certificate for the restaurant that I'd have to pawn off on unsuspecting friends. 

I think we ended up going to Robertos after we left...
