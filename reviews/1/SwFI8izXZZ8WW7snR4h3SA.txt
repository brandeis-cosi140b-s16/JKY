I tried the one on Eastern. My second time...the first and last !  I have to say that the food was just like my mother used to make....now you know why I ran away from home at age 12.   Not kidding about that. Will someone please explain to me why this chain is so popular....even the St.Rose hospital has better food.I 
Should know I was in there in Aug for 17 days. At best I would classify Chipotle's as industrial toxic waste.
