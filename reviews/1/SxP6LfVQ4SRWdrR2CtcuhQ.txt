I just ate here with my family and so far, as I write this, my wife threw up twice. My eldest son ordered chicken nuggets from the kids' menu and they gave him two (2). My youngest son ordered the 'mexican pizza' and said, "I'm not eating this, it smells funny." I was supposed to get three shrimp enchiladas. They buried it under lettuce and there was one, cut in half and the shrimp was not cleaned. The guacamole appetizer was a complete disaster and really an insult with few chips and poorly prepared. This was the worst Mexican food I've ever eaten in Las Vegas. The service was somewhat friendly, but incredibly slow.  This was a shock to me because friends enjoy this place. There is so much better in Las Vegas. Don't take the chance.
