I cannot even begin to explain how disappointed I was with my meal today. My rice was dry. My beans were overcooked. My beef clearly have been sitting there for about three hours before I arrived Because the top was that ugly shade of red that meet turns one it's been sitting under a heat lamp for three hours. My stomach basically felt like a brick was laid since I ate there and I thoroughly regret the decision.
