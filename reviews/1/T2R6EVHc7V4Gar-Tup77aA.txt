I ordered an item that was listed for $3.69 on the menu but was rung up for $3.99 on the screen. 

When I advised the person taking my order about the discrepancy he firmly and rudely said that he could not change the pricing on the system which was set up by corporate.  

I gently advised him that this would not be honoring the posted price and asked to speak to his manager, the gentleman advised me that he was the manager.     I drove up and spoke to 'Quenten' who had the title of "Shift Leader" on his badge.    He gave me the store number and advised me that his boss Sandy would be in on Tuesday.   When I advised him that I wanted to address this manner sooner he told me that he was only doing what he was told before he gave me the name of his district manager and we wished each other a good night. 

This is the first time I have ever experienced an issue at any Taco Bell Resturant and I suppose that perhaps it would be a tad lofty to think that certain individuals may care about the big picture as a drive thru employee.   However, I do find it that it is a resturant's duty to charge the posted price and/or post the correct price to prevent any misunderstandings.   In summary be on the lookout for pricing discrepancies when at this Taco Bell restaurant.
