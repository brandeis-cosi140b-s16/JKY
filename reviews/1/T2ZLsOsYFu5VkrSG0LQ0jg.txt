If I could give no stars, I would have. Coming from Texas, this place is a disappointment. It just sucks. They have real Mexican's working for them, yet they can't even make an even tortilla. They are always puffy, misshapen, to thick etc. Most of the food comes out cold and doesn't even make sense. Disgusting!
