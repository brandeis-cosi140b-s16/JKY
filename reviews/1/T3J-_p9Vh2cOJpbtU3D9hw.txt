Horrible service. I attempted to have Lizeth, one of the counter employees, take my small catering order. She immediately threw her hands up and said I don't know how to enter that. She called her manager "Nate" to take the order. He was openly annoyed as "I'm busy doing something" was his response as he glared at me in annoyance. I was baffled that he was rushing to take my order and when I asked if they had bottled waters he angrily checked the fridge behind him and retorted "were all out." I wasn't offered anything else and frankly was stunned at his continued annoyance toward me.
I was told the order would take 5 minutes to be set up.... I returned after 15 minutes and my food was ready to go but not bagged. There were no other customers in the restaurant. I could not believe the lack of professionalism by a manager. There are simply too many places to choose from and mistreating customers is unacceptable.
