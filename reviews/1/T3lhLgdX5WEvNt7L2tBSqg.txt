Horrible horrible service. I don't know if it's because it's phoenix or because the crew and management just suck but I had a horrible experience at this chipotles. They tried to load my burrito up with rice and didn't drain the beans making my burrito a soggy mess. But the worst part is that they gave me less meat than the previous two customers so when I pointed it out they guy just said he'd have to charge me for double meat. I said no, I just want the same meat everyone before me got. They either didn't get it or didn't care, either way it's a bad way to do business. I will NEVER go to this chipotles again.
