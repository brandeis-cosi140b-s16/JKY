I live very close to this location of Julioberto's and I have eaten at this location several times. The food has always been fast and good. However my experience last night changed my opinion of the restaurant. I am solely basing my review on this experience. 

Last night I went through the drive-thru and when I came to the window, I noticed individual styrofoam cups sitting on top of the soda fountain. A few seconds later I saw an employee drinking out of a styrofoam cup. He took a few sips, and then poured out the rest of his cup into the soda fountain drain below the dispensers. That freaked me out a bit, but not as much as what happened next. 

He then rinsed out his cup using the water dispenser on the fountain. He sloshed it around and then poured out the contents. The contents splashed all over the dispenser and into the ice maker that was just below the drain. He then placed his drinking cup on top of the dispenser with the rest of the styrofoam cups. Water was still dripping off the side of the cup and on to the fountain.  A second later another employee started filling my cup with ice from the same ice maker.  

When I expressed disgust at what I had just observed, I was told, "It is okay."  I am not sure that she understood what I was trying to tell her, because she was confused as to why I no longer wanted a soda. The lack of hygiene appalled me. I won't be back.
