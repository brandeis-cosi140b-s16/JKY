We went here on a Friday around 5pm. We sat in the bar area and waited about 5 minutes before anyone greeted us. Once our waitress took our drink order, it took 25 minutes to receive our margaritas. The drinks themselves were average at best. The food was ok but we waited another 2-3 minutes because we didn't have silverware. In the hour that we were there, we watched 2 tables of customers leave angry due to poor service. Add all of this to the fact that they advertise themselves as an Alabama Football spot, yet have zero references to Alabama Football in the place.
