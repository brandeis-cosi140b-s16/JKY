This place was awful, slow, and the bathrooms were disgusting. It took me 68 mins from seated to check to get a root beer, tea, soup, side salad and fajitas. Took the waitress about 15 mins to get me lemon and Splenda for the tea. The chicken tortilla soup is basically chicken noodle soup with tortillas and avocado. Thank god my company paid for this meal. Gross.
