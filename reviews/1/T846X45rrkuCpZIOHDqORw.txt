I honestly don't know why people rave about this place. First time I came here I had high hopes it was going to be as good as people have said, I was wrong, I've gotten better tasting tacos from food trucks, the meat had too much fat and the guacamole was disgusting, tacos had no flavor whatsoever, I tried really hard to eat them but I just couldn't, I wanted to gag, ended up throwing them away and eating at McDonalds, total waste of money and food, very disappointing! Their competitors next door "Los Tacos" are better in my opinion but to each their own!
