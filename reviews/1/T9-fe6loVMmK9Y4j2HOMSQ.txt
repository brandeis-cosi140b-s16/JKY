What an unfortunate dining experience. Instead of serving with tinfoil, the food should be served with a strainer (or wet vac... shamwow... an entire roll of Bounty). I felt like I was eating wet slop.

I went with 3 friends.. all had the same experience. Soggy, wet crap. The sweet pork has more sugar than a 12 pack of Mt Dew.

How does this place have 5 stars? How can anyone say its even remotely comparable to Chipotle?
