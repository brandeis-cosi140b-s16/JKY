Ate dinner while in town for a conference.  I assumed Mexican food would be safe but I was disappointed. 

The service was good and my waitress willingly accommodated special allergy requests.  

But I ordered tableside guacamole and was told they couldn't serve it due to the avocado shortage.  Which is news to me; every grocery store I have been in the past several weeks had plenty of avocados.   So they brought me a serving of awful guacamole like you would buy at a gas station. I should have sent it back but didn't. 

Surprisingly my tacos had a small side of normal guacamole that was acceptable.

My wine was so-so the chips were mostly small broken pieces and the fish tacos were decent. 

Upon more thought it was a bad experience and I would definitely not go back.
