PROS:
Polite Service
Original Building from the 1940's...

CONS:
PLACE looks like it's closed, dark, small (which is fine), and horrible lighting.
SUB PAR is a nice word to describe there food - My friend had the #3 and the burrito was bland; salty chicken wrapped in a wet tortilla.
TACOS-  a step up from taco bell. You're choice of meet is ground beef, shredded beef and chicken. What happened to Carne Asada and Al Pastor or the typical cilantro, onion & lime? You get copious amounts of lettuce, sprinkle of tomato and cheese, all Americanized.
RICE- are you kidding me?!! it's boxed rice...that is NOT actual rice, it's boxed and  every spoonful is a taste of the over seasoned, MSG, sodium laden, processed product.
BEANS- have some flavor but very dry, I've tasted better.
SALSA- we had two salsa's. The one that I am assuming is supposed to Pico de gallo looks discolored and old..the taste, like stewed tomatoes with cracked pepper. The second, assuming salsa roja, tasted like canned crushed tomatoes. There was no flavor and would be closely compared to a spicy marinara sauce.
CHILE VERDE- not sure where to start here. I am guessing people who ate this were hung over or haven't developed their palate yet. 

Everything is over priced for, I hate to write this, below mediocre food. C'mon, one serving of chips? I don't blame them, I wouldn't order a second. Only one refill on a flat cup of soda...no thanks. LOL, and MARKET PRICE for a LEMON? SERIOUSLY?! 

I see there are loyal followers but then again, if you haven't had anything else...you wouldn't know any better. I wouldn't suggest this to any one and the food isn't that great. We were caught in wanting to leave and just giving this a chance. We should of left.
