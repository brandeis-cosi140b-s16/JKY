***UPDATE 7/27/2010***
I workout at the 24 Hour Fitness next to Chronic Tacos and came out to find Chronic Tacos flyers on the cars in the parking lot, including mine (see pics).  That's lame, taking to sleazy nightclub tactics to promote the business....blech!  One more reason not to go there for me.

***ORIGINAL REVIEW***
I passed by this place yesterday after having lunch at Upper Crust Pizza....it was very busy and looked cool, so I said I would try it the next day.

Well....I stopped by for lunch after a workout at the gym.  It was 12:15 pm and there was a big line of about 20 people.  I decided to wait it out and see what everyone was waiting for.  While I was in line, it grew to about 30 people.

The place is decorated like a teenager's bedroom.  The walls are made of plywood and you are encouraged to tag up the walls with whatever (see pics).  I think the owners are MMA fans because there were MMA magazines all over the place and the guy who brought out my food had a MMA T-Shirt & hat.

Food - I was going to try a Carne Asada burrito, but I wanted to try 2 dishes, so i opted for the Nachos (no meat) and a Carne Asada Fatty Taco.  It's a typical setup like you find at Qdoba/Zaba's/Chipotle where you order your food and you move down a line of people to add the toppings.

The Carne Asada Taco ordering process went smoothly, but the Nachos didn't....they forgot to make it as they rely on someone in the back who's not part of the assembly line to make it.  They yell out the order and I guess someone is suppose to pay attention and make it....well, they didn't.  No big deal at this point, it's only Nachos and it doesn't take a long time to make those....so, they told me when I paid that they would bring it out.

I had a pretty good workout and built up a huge appetite, so I scarfed down the Carne Asada Taco while I waited for the Nachos.....it was pretty good, not great but good....nice flavor but it wasn't "authentic".  i guess growing up in SoCal makes you a Mexi-Snob when it comes to Mexican Food.

After a few minutes my Nachos came out....I was surprised to see that there was only cheese on top of chips.  Normally at Baja Fresh/Qdoba/Chipotle/Zaba's nachos are fully loaded with all the toppings....hell, I even paid extra for guacamole.  I asked the guy who brought them about it, he apologized about the guac and said he would come back with a cup of it....but he said that's how the Nachos with no meat are prepared, with just cheese.  What a disappointment!

To make matters worse, the cheese is shredded cheese that they melt on top of the chips....that in and of itself isn't that big a deal....what was really a big deal is that the cheese wasn't fully melted, just the top of it so it didn't stick to the chips and it fell all over the place because it was still cold and shredded underneath (see pics for details).  The guacamole was bland too.  I still ate it because I was hungry.  What a bad meal....I should have went somewhere else.

The place was crowded and the majority of the people in there were younger (early 20's and teens)....I guess they like the atmosphere.  Since I don't follow MMA at all, it didn't appeal to me.....and the years of writing crap on the walls are decades behind me.

I would have rated the place 2 Stars if the line was shorter...but because the hype was built up and it didn't deliver, I gave it 1 Star.  It's the 1st 1 Star joint I've rated.

Will I return?  Nah.....unless someone else was paying the bill.
