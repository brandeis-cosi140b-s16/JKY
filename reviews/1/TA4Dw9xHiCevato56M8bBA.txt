Worst service of all Chipotles I've ever visited and it's a consistent thing with them. Not only are they slow but they never give good portions like all others I've been to. If you live in surprise there aren't a lot of food joints to choose from so standing in line for half hour is worth it when having a chipotle craving. I've lived here for 4 years and it's never improved. It's annoying when the lines not moving and you see everyone standing around talking or not knowing what they're doing. Cashiers are rude and aren't personable. Catch up surprise chipotle everyone knows your store is the worst in the valley
