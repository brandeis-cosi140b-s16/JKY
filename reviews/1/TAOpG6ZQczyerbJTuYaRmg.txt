I'll just say this.  Theres a Chili's thats right next to it.  Do yourself a favor and go to Chili's.  Trust me, you'll be so happy that you did.  I'm not sure what these other reviewers had or about their taste buds but the food was horrible!  I ordered the chimichanga and the person I was with ordered fajitas.  We were both very disappointed.  Besides that, the service sucked and the place is filthy.  That was definitely my first and last time there.
