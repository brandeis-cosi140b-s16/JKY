My typical rule of thumb is that I need to have 3 negative experiences at a place I typically go to before I stop going there and think about writing a negative review. I gave this place until the 5th negative experience because I work the graveyard shift and it is one of the few nearby options I rely on on a consistent basis for my lunch-break meal in the middle of the night. 

What pushed it over the edge this time? A simple order, two chicken enchiladas. What was inside could be best described as cold and uncooked. My vegetables were barely cut up (green pepper chunks bigger than the size of your thumb and what looked to be a quartered tomatos) and were still fresh and crisp, as if they never even entered a warm pot at all. The entire dish was slightly above room temperature. I will still go to other Roberto's locations (and switch to the Don Tortaco that's an additional 3 miles away if I'm really craving it), but I will avoid this one at all costs.
