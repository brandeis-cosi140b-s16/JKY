This place was such a disappointment. Many people have talked it up for sure. I always passed through it and it looked like a pretty good place. I went in with my family and the person taking the order was so rude seriously the worst customer service. I ordered a torta de carne Asada and my sister orders the flautas. Now the flautas were pretty good no complaint there. The torta was one of the worst, it had more lettuce than anything. The meat looked like it had been sitting there for some time. Big disappointment. The rest of my family was not please as well. I sadly will not be returning to eat here. I wanted to like it but the energy of the entire place was just so down. Maybe it's the day and time we went but I expected more.
