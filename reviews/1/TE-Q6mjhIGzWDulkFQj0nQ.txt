Waitress was good. Got our food & didn't really like it. I tried to eat it but barely touched anything but the rice. I was full on chips and didn't feel like I could eat another dish. When I asked for it to be taken off the bill (which I NEVER do), the manager YELLED at me. My boyfriend and I were appalled. He was being beyond rude, so much my boyfriend almost lost his cool and had to ask the manager to leave the table. Needless to say.. we will never return. Nothing was resolved and we paid $35 for food we were grossed out by.
