Wow all I can say is disappointing! Alan the bartender was the worst bartender I have EVER had!! I now know why there was only two people in the bar for happy hour.  Also the food was just bad Taco Bell would have been better, my five dollar burrito was bland with about two tablespoons of beans all tortilla, old lettuce and what looked to be shriveled up tomatoes, I was to scared to try those though. Chips were not even cooked properly and tasted rancid. The only thing that was ok was the salsa.  I did ask for more of that but never got it, also never got a check up by Alan. Please if you have a couple extra bucks do yourself a huge favor and DON'T! Go to this place!! Thanks Yelp rocks!
