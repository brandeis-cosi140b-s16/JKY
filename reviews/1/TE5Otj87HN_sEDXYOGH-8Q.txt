I'm NEVER coming here again!

When I first came I was waiting in line forever while the security/bouncer let several people ahead of me. I didn't see them check anything off a list so they couldn't be VIP or anything like that.

Then, I finally get in and the service just ISN'T there. I wait and wait and finally the bartender takes my order, and gives me a very weak drink! HELLO? I DIDN'T PAY $7 FOR A GLASS OF COCA COLA!! I ASKED FOR A JACK AND COKE!

Don't believe the hype, this place sucks!

Also El Hefe claims to have amazing tacos... I've had better tacos from a taco bus back home in Seattle, Washington.
