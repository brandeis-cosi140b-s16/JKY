This is not the place to go for good Mexican food.

For me, it was the first available place to throw something down my throat so I wouldn't rip someone's head off from starvin' like marvin' after a day of walking around in the sun. It is sustenance. It is food. I chewed, I swallowed, but I did not enjoy what I tasted.

I had a chicken taco. The chicken was not grilled, only boiled & had zero flavor/seasoning. The bf & I shared carne asada nachos- we left 75% of it right on the plate- cheese was not melted, carne asada was bland & the chips were stale. 

Service was slow & every surface (counter, tables, floor) was grimey. I will not be returning. I don't advise people to eat fast food by any means, but I would have been happier had I just gone to the Burger King next door.

I'd like to give them the benefit of the doubt & say we just caught them on a bad day, but we came here last year & it was just as awful.

P.S.-the bf had 3 tacos & said the only good one was the carnitas; Carne asada & al pastor were flavorless & disappointing. 2 out of 3 bad meats--thats a terrible ratio & therefore 1 star.
