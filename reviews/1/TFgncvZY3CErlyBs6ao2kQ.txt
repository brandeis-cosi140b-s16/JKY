I went into taco bell today Oct 28, 2015 between 2:30 and 3:00pm one by meadows mall.  I asked the cashier for two boxes of tacos with the cool ranch an mix tacos. Before I removed my food off the counter I told the manager who gave me my food and the cashier my order was wrong. Apparently they didn't care about customer service. So I want your Cooperate number because here at the taco bell you  service customers what you want, you didn't listen when I told  you the order was incorrect the tacos are not the same you telling me they are. A manager an the cashier customer service unprofessional. My incorrect order was $40 dollar's and some cents.

It's a shame I have went to Taco Bell today 10/29/2015 and spoke to the supervisor Miss Rita she was RUDE know better then the employee that was getting rid of me yesterday when I said my order was incorrect. Apparently it was a problem rita "tells me why you didn't ask for yesterday"  I said excuse me why your employee didn't listen and just change my order? know response, your cashier rung up what i ask for you employee should have check it again are apparently wasn't able to read that we'll. And Rita had a problem she had to stop and whisper something in another employee ear. Rita didn't apologize didn't try to fix the situation do everyone there have bad customer service? We'll I place a call to cooperate let's see what action takes place. That was money wasted and bad customer service both days

Well the supervisor don't care either one call she didn't apologized and another supervisor never return my call
