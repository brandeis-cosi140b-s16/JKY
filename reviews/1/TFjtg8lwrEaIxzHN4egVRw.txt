We were out doing some holiday shopping at the Waterfront and famished, decided to try Gran Agave out. My husband loves Mexican food so he was very excited to try them. 

We arrived with our daughter in tow - she is in a stroller. They did not seem terribly happy to have to accommodate a stroller - they place is fairly small but at 2pm on a Sunday it was maybe half full.  We were seated and given menus and a basket of warm chips and what is presumably house made salsa. Both were outstanding.  I ordered a taco salad with beef tips and black beans and my husband ordered 3 beef soft tacos. The portions were huge - neither of us finished our meals. 

He really liked his tacos well enough whereas my salad was pretty mediocre. The bottom of the tostada was completely soggy and the beef tips were in some thin, bland liquid that pretty much just felt like water. The whole thing was fairly bland, saved only by the salsa that I scooped over it. 

We paid for our meal - very reasonably priced and went on our way... then a few minutes later we both felt absolutely horrible. My husband felt like he had lead in his belly and both of us felt completely nauseous. I turned to him and said I just wanted to vomit to get it out of me. A couple hours later when I am writing this I am still feeling very sick. I we agreed that is was easily the worst meal we'd ever had.  I'd not recommend this to anyone and will never go back and I am also really surprised by the number of positive reviews for this place.
