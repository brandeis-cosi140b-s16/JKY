Took 20 minutes for store bought chips and salsa. Enough said. 

I posted the previous 2 sentences approximately 30 minutes ago as a tip and am still sitting here waiting for my bill (had to hunt down the waitress for it). The place is maybe half full and there are 3 others tables in the same situation as us. There is a table with dishes and half eaten food that hasn't been bussed even though the patrons left half an hour ago. 

Seriously. Awful.
