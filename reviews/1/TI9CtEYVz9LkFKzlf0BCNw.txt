Grabbed Roberto's the other night for dinner... Much to my disappointment the California burrito no longer comes with guac or sour cream! If it doesn't have at least one of those ingredients than it's not a California burrito you penny pinching cheap b^$+ards!

No thank you, never again. There are way too many better options for similar prices.
