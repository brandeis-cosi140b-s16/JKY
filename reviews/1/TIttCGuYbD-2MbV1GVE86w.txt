Great food try the food hands down the best Mexican food I've had since I've been in Arizona other than the giant Cock roach crawling up the wall . So I whispered quietly to the host because I didn't want to make a scene or interfere with the other guests. When i mention it to the hostess he actually got an attitude with me. He didn't comp us at all with free drink or anything I would never go there again !
