I was going to give this place a good review. The service was good, the food came out fast (we went through the drive thru), and the price isn't too bad. But half way through the meal my wife found a wire mesh (like the ones on the faucet in a bathroom sink) in her tostada salad. Not only is this level of neglect dangerous, it is just gross. What if that had been in a child's food? I don't think we will ever be eating there again.
