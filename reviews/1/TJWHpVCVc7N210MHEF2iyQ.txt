This is my girlfriends favorite Mexican food place and I finally had It and IT WAS DISGUSTING! I'm Mexican so I know good Mexican food and this was not it. Their horchata gave me a horrible stomach ache and the torta had no flavor beans were cold and the rice tastes like plain old white rice even though it was orange like Mexican rice. I had to smother my torta in salsa for it to taste a little bit better. White people just don't know Mexican food. I recommend pepes tacos
