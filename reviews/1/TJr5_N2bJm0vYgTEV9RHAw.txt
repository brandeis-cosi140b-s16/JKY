The staff is the kind of staff that wouldnt be hired at a 24 hour Dennys. The place is a dive, it needs a remodel. The happy hour prices are what brought us in. (Margarita's) but once you are in you are shoved to a cash register where you have to keep going up to buy your drinks. The staff gives dirty looks and its the kind of place you think, I wonder what goes on in the back. We didnt dare eat appetizers like we normally do and we watched closely as they made our drinks.

Bummer, its close to home and we were excited about it.
Its too bad.....
