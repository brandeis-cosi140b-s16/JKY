Never going back!
My margarita had zero tequila! I'm not exaggerating; zero! It cost me $6.00 when the sign says well drinks during happy hoyr are $4.00. When I asked about it, they told me "well" drinks ARE DRAFT BEER! I said no, it's the crap tequila, vodka, run, etc. in the WELL!
Not that there was an ounce of tequila in the drink!
We were handed a sheet of specials. We each ordered the burrito combo marked at $5.99. I asked for chicken, hubby asked for pork. We both got chicken. Ok, thanks! Not sending it back in a place where there's an obvious language barrier. 
We're charged $15.98 for both our plates. Again, I ask why? I'm told the prices on the specials ended at 3pm. So why even had us that sheet? She points to the fine print on the bottom that says prices end at 3pm. My bad! I assume since I'm handed the sheet of specials, then there's some specials! 
The food was terribly boring and I bit into an incredibly hard, black thing. I showed it to my husband and we couldn't figure out what the heck it was. At this point, I just want off this ride!
My biggest regret of the day was walking past the Filibertos in the same parking lot to get to this place. I would have at least enjoyed my meal, gotten better service, and paid quite a bit less. 
Please take me back Fili, I won't stray again!
