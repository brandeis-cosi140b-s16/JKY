Finally had a bad meal in Las Vegas.  My wife and I ordered a taco and enchilada combination for lunch.  The chicken in the enchiladas was cold.  We sent both orders back.  The waiter replaced both lunches and astonishingly the chicken was still cold so we gave up on the food at that point and had to settle for liquid lunches.  Will not be returning here and cannot recommend it.
