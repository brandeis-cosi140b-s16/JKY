Has to be THE worst burrito I have ever tasted. The chicken was so salty I found the entire thing inedible. If the 12$ burrito unfit for human consumption wasn't bad enough the staff topped the cake with their rude attitudes. I love burritos and if you really want to know it's pretty damn hard to mess one up.. Congratulations 360.. Job well done on screwing up.
