What in the world happened here?? This place used to be good, with the usual and expected full menu of American-ized Mexican takeout food, including beef, chicken, pork and other options in tacos, burritos, tostadas, enchiladas. Today, their only choices are beef or bean. That's a weird choice (or lack of choices) for a Mexican Grill like this. On top of that, they don't accept M&G (the currency used by ASU students who have meal plans), their CO2 was out so their soda fountain wasn't working, they had no bottled  water and the water cup I was offered never materialized. The decor is lacking (practically non-existent), and this place doesn't deserve another try. Sadly, I suspect they'll be closed and replaced by something more appropriate for the traffic in due time!
