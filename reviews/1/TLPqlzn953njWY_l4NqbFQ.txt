THE BAD: The workers were loudly talking about "this girl who wanted to show how nasty she could get;" there wasn't any other patrons (7pm on Friday) which isn't a good sign; and no whole wheat tortilla. 

THE GOOD: the taste was decent but it could have used cilantro; it was fast since no one else was there; I was able to customize my order (half serving of rice/beans). 

HOW TO FIX: be more mindful of your employees actions and offer a whole wheat tortilla. if those two happened I would give this place 4 stars.
