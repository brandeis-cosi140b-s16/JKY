I wish I'd read the Yelp reviews prior to stopping in to Pepe's. The super burrito was anything but "super". The carne asada was more like tiny minced meat and the size of the burrito should've been listed as puny, especially for the price.

The wife's breakfast burrito was no better and she could barely eat it. Never, never, never again.
