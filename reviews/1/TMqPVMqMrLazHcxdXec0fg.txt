We went in for Dinner and were forgotten about! 
 
We ordered drinks and were left alone for 45 min! Watched the waiter intentionally dodge us.  Finally had to flag down the chip man to make our waiter come over to us but by the time he came over we were full on chips. Too bad cause the food did look pretty yummy

NOTE TO WAIT STAFF : customers dont love bieng forgotten about lol
