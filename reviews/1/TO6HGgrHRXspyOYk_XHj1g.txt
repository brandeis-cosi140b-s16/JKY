I hate to do this, but I'm very disappointed. My steak was cold and chewy, like it had been sitting out for a while. And half of my bowl was green bell peppers. Yes I got the corn salsa stuff, but I've never had so many green peppers in it. I love Chipotle, but I'm not sure I will be going to this one again. I ended up ordering from another place because I just couldn't make myself eat chewy steak.
