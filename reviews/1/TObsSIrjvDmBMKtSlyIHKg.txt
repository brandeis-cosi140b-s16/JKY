Went for lunch a twice. First time was ok guy told me tacos are 1.50 but they were on special for 1.25 a week later I go and order tacos again and now they're 2.00$ definitely not worth it. Doesn't even have any meat on the tacos. Tortillas came out burnt and hard and it took forever!! I go for lunch not to dine. At other places take out is a priority. I would not recommend this place to anyone. Defiantly needs a lot of work with staff and prices. Try another place this is not worth the time or money.
