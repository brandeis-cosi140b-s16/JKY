Just went today and it has definitely changed. Food is not the same. The menu is small. Ridiculous that I ordered the combo and it does not even include rice and beans. It also tasted bland. I miss the old food, menu and ambiance. The restaurant was pretty empty after 5... that tells you something. Will never return!
