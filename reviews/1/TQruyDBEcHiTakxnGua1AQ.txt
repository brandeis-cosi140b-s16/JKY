I have learned my lesson -- DO NOT go to a restaurant that rates only 2 stars on Yelp.  Yes, it's possible to screw up even basic nachos.

Service was fine, but the food was literally inedible.   It was like soggy chips with day-old, watered down Velveeta and questionable, unseasoned chicken pieces.  

Stick with beers here. In terminal 3, your only option for food is Wendy's before your flight!
