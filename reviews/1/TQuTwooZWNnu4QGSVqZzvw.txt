Yet again they let us down and now we remember why... We knew we had not been back in awhile. While we love the cerviche, (we get the one with the abalone/oysters/octopus/shrimp/clams) YUM! ut all we like... The rice is yuck with corn and carrots in it, beans are not much better, chips,, blah... nothing special... but after ordering a margarita special... Serious??? Thats a margarita?? Pretty watered down and flavorless...(it was not the .99 cent special ) When I spoke to the waitress she could have cared less... We shared THE ONE sppon that came with our cerviche for over 5 minutes till we were able to wave down someone for anotehr spoon... Sorry to put the waitstaff out.. next time I simply will not bother coming...
