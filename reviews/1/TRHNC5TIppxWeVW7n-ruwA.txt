Re-visited Pasqual's tonight for dinner with a co-worker, and we were seated next to the kitchen, where we had a full, un-fettered view of the kitchen works.

Our server was friendly and prompt; chips and salsa were good, as usual.  A Dos Equis Amber (from the tap) was crisp and fresh.

What bothered me was watching the food preparation process. Nothing is made fresh.  They have chafing dishes and refrigerated containers that contain all of the "pieces" of your meal.  

Depending on your order, they scoop from various containers, assemble, plate, and then cover with a plastic lid.  From there, it's into a microwave - they have a bank of them - where your food is nuked until warm.  Or, in my case, until it's still refrigerator cold in the middle...

I'm sorry, but I don't feel it's fair to pay $10 for 2 tacos that are improperly microwaved... 

I watched as *every single* entree was processed through the assembly line like this.  I could describe to you in perfect detail the steel-grey microwaves, the greyish-colored lids, and the workers that were cranking out the reheated food plate after plate... I saw several entrees that had sat too long after being nuked go back into the microwave for a second reheating before being presented to diners.

I won't be back.  Hell, Chipotle prepares its food in-mass prior to serving, but at least it's kept warm/hot and served relatively fresh.  And, it costs about 2/3 as much.
