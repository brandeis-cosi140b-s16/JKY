Horrible food, only slightly more Mexican than Taco Bell. Also pretty much identical to Chipotle, which might be slightly better. Their meat is dry, burritos are flavorless, and the salsa doesn't help in either category. Not worth the price. Also the lines at lunchtime can be ridiculous, which is sad.
