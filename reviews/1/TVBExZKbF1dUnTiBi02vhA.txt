Well apparently if you order food or drinks 10 min before happy hour ends...your out of luck. You see...per the Manager that was on duty(younger gal, glasses, brown hair, ponytail, very rude)...So Cal's clock on
the register is 10 min ahead. So...that's the customers problem why????? I was absolutely in shock. My husband and I brought our 2 friends that day to show them how great this place was and this happened.   Not like we all just rolled in at 5:55....we already were there for over an hour and ordered lots of food/drinks. Oh yea...also 6 mini Coronas turned into 5. Took 20 min to get the 6th Corona. Oh and...menu says 3 rolled tacos on HH...we were brought 2. Menu changed and we were never told. So Cal...you just lost 4 customers.
