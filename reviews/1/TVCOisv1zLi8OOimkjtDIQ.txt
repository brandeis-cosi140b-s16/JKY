Foods not that good at all; Rito's is much better. My issue is the thick, black, curly  pubic like hair I found in my beans. Fortunately, I was in the kitchen when I opened my styrofoam container. Had I opened and consumed them in a darker room or it been wrapped in a tortilla... I may not be here. I only saw Latin people working here so it wasn't hair from the scalp. Disgusting.
