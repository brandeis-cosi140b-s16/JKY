They are the rudest workers. Always pissy with customers.Food isn't as good nor can they get an order straight.  Oh and if you go at night, beware they try to add money to your order hoping your too drunk to notice.  Ordered a $5 burrito tried to charge me $15, thinking i would be too drunk to catch. Sorry, not drunk.
