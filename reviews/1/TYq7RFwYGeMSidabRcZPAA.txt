I get that restaurants don't have to post drink prices, but to charge $15 for a tiny, weak, insipid margarita was a bit over the top. My lunch was interesting, though not really Mexican. My chicken tasted like it had a sweet barbecue sauce on it. 
Service was okay. I was glad my waitress didn't ask me how my meal was after I watched her uncomfortable reaction to another customer's dislike of his meal. She tried to find something he liked to talk about, while offering no discount.  
There are some really good eateries in CLT. This isn't one of them.
