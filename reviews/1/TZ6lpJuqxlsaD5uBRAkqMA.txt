We had the same experience as Ashley.  Retried beans out of a can would be far superior to whatever they are serving. Ashley pegged the nasty rice; plain old Uncle Ben's would have been better. My wife ordered fish grilled. She received fried fish that was so bad, I was surprised the dogs ate it when we got home. If this place does not turn some serious attention to the food production, it will not be around by October. Renee, my advice is to Quit hanging with your friends in the dining room and singing, and get your behind in the kitchen to see what is being produced. It is awful!
