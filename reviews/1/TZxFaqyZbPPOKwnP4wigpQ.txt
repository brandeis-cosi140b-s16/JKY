Why have the app to order, confirm it will b ready in 30 min then start making it when I get here??????? And it's not busy? Offer me a fountain drink to wait? Poor service experience. 
I'll go to another one next time.

Ok so I have to update the worse part. I get home with 3 bowls, and my husbands had a paper towel/napkin buried down inside!! Totally grossed out, he brought it back & all 3 bowls were refunded. I would have expected no less of course. I guess the lesson is 
1) don't use their app (at this Bell Rd. location anyway) thinking you will save time. 
2) that way you can go down the line and watch what's going into your food and won't have random non food items in your bowl! 
Disappointed in this location, but still love Chipotle!
