Not impressed in the least. This place used to be good years ago but last few years has taken a turn way down hill. It has gone from very good to disgusting. No flavor at all, I prefer Taco Bell over this place. 

The interior is filthy, bathrooms are like broom closets and stink really bad. Stay away, go elsewhere!
