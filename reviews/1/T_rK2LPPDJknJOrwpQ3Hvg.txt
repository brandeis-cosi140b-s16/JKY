I went here the night of Oct 28 at like 2am. Now granted, this is not prime evaluation time for any business, but not much is open. A couple of things you might take into consideration before judgement is rendered:

1) In general, my reviews are overwhelmingly positive.
2) I really like Del Taco
3) I am fine with indifferent service/minororde r issues
4) I eat a lot of fast food because 'Merica.

The guy in the drive through exuded "f*ck you" from the moment the speaker came on. He said everything he was supposed to, but it came loaded with battling quantities of creepy and douchey. Real simple order with a no ice drink. Clarified specifically no ice (in a very nice way). Got drink with tons of ice less than 10 seconds later. Food came out shortly after and the body language/tone coming off that dude was nothing short of a master's class in hostile and condescending body language. He ended with the worst "have a wonderful night" I've ever experienced.

I went home, inspected the food for spit and fed it to the dog. It might just be one terrible employee, but I wouldn't come here late at night when management isn't around.
