Arrived to order a shrimp from taco, and a steak taco. The steak taco came with guacamole , I asked that could be switched out for sour cream, however that would of incurred an additional charge..  the food lacked flavor, and the shrimp taco was nasty. DO NOT ORDER IT!  honestly 9.00 for 2 tacos is high. found this place hoping for a little shop with some authenticity and left feeling rather let down. was more like a burger King meets Chinese restaurant. ... in a Mexican joint
