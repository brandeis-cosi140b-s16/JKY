We arrived at this location after attempting to go to the freedom drive location which was closed almost 30 minutes early. Yes we arrived close to closing time. We was trying to figure out what to order and a guy rudely gets on the speaker and rushed us saying have we figured out what we wanted that we have 11 minutes and that they are trying to get home.  Then gets right back on to ask if we figured it out. I find it rude. I hate being rushed.
