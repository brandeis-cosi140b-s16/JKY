I've never had a "bad" experience at chipotle cause seriously, how could you go wrong at chipotle? Ever?! Maybe it's just my unlucky day. The dude who was making my order just seemed like he dreaded working there. Now I understand that when you're having a bad day, it might be hard to smile and act friendly, but don't take it out on my food!!! I'm paying $8 for this piece of **** so make it right. He was being so stingy on EVERYTHING he added to my bowl, from the rice to the veggies to the corn, I had to repeatedly ask him "could you put more?" ...which I've NEVER had to do at a chipotle. Awkward as it already is, when we got to the end he asked me "anything else?" And I'm like, no I think I'm good, thanks. And then he's like "are you SURE??" What on earth! Now I'm getting attitude?!?!!! At a damn chipotle? Jeez!
