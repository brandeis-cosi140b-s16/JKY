The service in this place sucks. The Mexican guy that manages the place - Mark Marin is a complete a-hole. I used to order take out from them because it was "express." He deliberately did not prepare orders on time because I asked them to have stuff ready when I came for pick-up. Last time I gave him him an extra 15 mins to do his job and got a lecture  from him that I was "late," and refused to refund my money because he's a lier. He's had many complaints about his service. What a jerk, my advice: GO SOMEPLACE ELSE.
