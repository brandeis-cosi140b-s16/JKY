It gets one star only because I have to give it something to allow me to review this dump. Everything happened in this order... You walk in and it's humid/muggy, turn on the AC. Flies flying around everywhere to the point that I had to get a menu to swat them. Salsa was good but chips were cold and stale. Roach about an inch long crawls along the side of the table and as I jumped out of the booth three employees run over to me to try convincing me the roach didn't drop into my purse that was wide open on the bench right under the moving roach. After I cleaned out my purse I was handed a 14.47 dollar bill. Did I really have to pay for our two sodas and empanadas?!?! Disgusted! While waiting to pay we noticed a few more bugs on the floor (crickets and upside down roaches)
