First visit here at Papas tonight. The worst food and customer service i've witnessed in a long time. Girl at cash register was rude, the tables were dirty, floor dirty, and we watched my wife's taco's prepared by cook with bare hands, a clear violation of the health code. This place won't last six months, terrible food, terrible service, not sure where all these great reviews are coming from.
