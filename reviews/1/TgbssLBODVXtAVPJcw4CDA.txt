Unfortunately, I'm going to have to revise my review in a downward fashion.  Our most recent visit to this restaurant resulted in overly oily and greasy food; heavier than necessary food tastes, which could have been avoided with more careful preparation; sub-par service and an overwhelming feeling of bewilderment as to why I gave this place four stars to begin with.

The answer is simple:  I hadn't much experience with other Mexican restaurants in the Valley and didn't know any better.

But on top of all that, Raul and Theresas has simply gone downhill, with slow service, less than sparkling clean silverware; smaller portions not matching the menu descriptions and prices, which simply don't justify what you get.  Perhaps I would've been more forgiving had the food been tasty.  Sadly, what the server DID bring -- and even that wasn't correct --- didn't leave me wanting what she forgot to serve.

Sad
