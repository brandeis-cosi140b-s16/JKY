Every time we go there to eat  there is a new bartender. Last time, the margaritas
Are very weak we both had 2 "jumbo" margaritas $10:00 ea  and they tasted like no tequila in either, the food was just ok this time.
We quit going there in the past for the same reasons, but decided to try again.
I wish this place was better because it is right by my house. Most of our friends agree with us they quit going also.
