Unfortunately I think our luck has ran out here. What used to be a great place that we frequented has went down quite a bit and I need to update my review. We were there on Jan 17th and ordered. My wife ordered the chicken wings and I ordered the quesadilla. Our service was very slow and inattentive. Her wings came out raw in the middle and still cold on the bone. We sent them back and a manager came out to assure me that chef said they were fully cooked. Lol! Ok, I cook, I eat and I know that chicken is not red when cooked let alone the bone was frigid cold. On wings that just came out if the fryer? Lol! Nice try. My quesadilla was full of poor quality meat with full pieces of gristle and a piece of an artery. Yes, artery! 

We may stop by some other time when we are in town, but I doubt it. There are so many other amazing places to eat there, why suffer through this again. Tom's Urban at NYNY is awesome btw.
