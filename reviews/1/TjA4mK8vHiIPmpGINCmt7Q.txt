Totally CHOKED.

Food - good, hot, fresh, as I expect it.
Service - friendly & efficient.
Meets expectations?  NO!

OK, so the worst thing a chain can do is dump consistency.  Rubio's advertises Fish Taco Tuesday ($1/taco) "at participating locations" and every one I've ever been into - and that means all over California - honors it.  But NOT Red Rock!  As if I knew that....

So when I plug Rubio's into the GPS on a Tuesday in response to my man's fish taco craving, drive out of my way, leave him in the car waiting while I enter a casino & play hide-&-seek to find Rubios in the back corner in a food court (all the while in cycling gear while I dive amongst rows of slot machines I might add - as in hubby really had a fish taco deal craving), order & then discover I'm being charged full pop because they don't participate?  I'm ANNOYED. Now I'm hungry, and my SO will be profoundly grumpy if I don't return with fish tacos.  

HUNGRY, ANNOYED and GRUMPY!!!

Seriously, folks.  If you've bought a franchise or opened another company store under the Rubio's banner with the Rubio's menu because you want the Rubio's reputation, ya better freakin' offer the Rubio's specials.  

Choked with you. True, I place this same order any day of the week that a craving hits regardless of the price, and loved my non-greasy carnitas street tacos and he had a craving satisfied.  Difference is I'll NEVER repeat a visit to this location because when it's Tuesday I want the discount.  Your brothers-in-arms will win out.
