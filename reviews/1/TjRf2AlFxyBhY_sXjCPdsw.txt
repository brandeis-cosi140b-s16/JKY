I'll start with the positive.  Tortillas are made on site & super fresh. Unfortunately that's where it ends.  This was my first visit so I wasn't really sure what to order, had the pork burrito (rice & beans inside).  The gal preparing my food looked super annoyed that I took more than 10 seconds to choose between green or red sauce, talked so low I couldn't understand her, and once I selected the red sauce she put so much on my burrito it's all I could taste.  And it's SUPER sweet.  Not my thing.  If the meat, beans, or rice were good or not, I have no idea.  Tried my brothers shredded beef burrito, same thing.  All one note and super sweet.  Guess I'll go back to Moreno's if I want real Mexican food I can taste.
