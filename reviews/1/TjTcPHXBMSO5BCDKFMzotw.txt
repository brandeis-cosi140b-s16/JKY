This was not a great experience. The service was kind of slow, especially to refill drinks. We were with a small group and we ordered the cheese dip with spinach and the other group ordered regular cheese dip. The cheese dip was extremely runny. We made a huge mess because it just wouldn't stay on the chips at all. And the spinach cheese dip was really bad because the spinach was cold and it was just really long strands of spinach. It should have been diced up and mixed it. The entrees were ordered were very bland and my chicken was dry. The beans were also a little on the runny side as well. The rice was amazing. It was the best part of the meal. I guess long story short is this place is edible, but there are a lot of better choices close by. I doubt we will be returning.
