Disgusting! Ordered Guacamole & chips, though the guacamole was green that was the only resemblance, flavor was horrible. Pork for the taco was similar to the consistency of baby food but flavor was so bad my boyfriend actually gagged when he tasted it. Food was cold, not even room temperature. Will not go back! No stars are warranted for this place.
