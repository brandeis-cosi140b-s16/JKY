I keep trying to love this place because it was a daily staple for me back in CA...always the answer.  But this Chipotle with blasting music and sloppy delivery is not the same.  I have come 3 more times, trying something different each time hoping I can get back to that special place with Chipotle.  Each time the meat tastes as if they spilled the seasoning on it.  and they make little football shaped burritos that they rip EACH time and then offer to double wrap it with an additional tortilla.  I want an unripped burrito shaped burrito that tastes like the Chipotle I am used to.  Please!!!
