I placed an order this morning for a delivery. After an hour, I checked on the status of my order, and was told that it was out for delivery with the driver. An hour later, I received an email, saying that my cancellation request was processed, and I will be refunded in 2-3 business days? I was then told that the restaurant has no drivers for the day, and therefore is not making any deliveries. 

Extremely frustrated, and will be taking my business elsewhere.
