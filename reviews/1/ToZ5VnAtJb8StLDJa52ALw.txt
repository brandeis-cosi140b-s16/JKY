I thought the food was decent. What pissed me off was a .75 cent debit card transaction fee. Come on man! Cost of doing business people. Are u gonna charge me for salsa too? Its 2015 guys. Plus it doesn't cost 75 cents for a merchant for a typical  debit charge so they are ripping people off. Way to guys....

Never again...
