We went here after reading the reviews on Yelp with high expectations, we ended up being pretty disappointed. We got there and were seated promptly and seen by a waitress right away. The chips and salsa were pretty good, although the bean dip could have been a little warmer. When the waitress came to take out orders I asked her what Gecko grill was known for and she advised us that most people come for the seafood dishes. With the advice from the waitress my wife ordered the Crab Relleno Burro and I ordered the Seafood Grande. My wife thought the Burro was OK but nothing she would come back for. My order, the Seafood Grande, was pretty disappointing. My biggest problem with my meal was the the "Pepper Jack" cheese that was melted on top of my meal was actually processed Pepper Jack slices, the taste of the cheese really took away from the meal. The beans and rice served with my meal were also pretty blah. 

As a side note to the food, we were seated in viewing distance of the hostess at the door. She could barely be removed from texting on her cell phone to do her job. Apparently the hostess is responsible for making the utensil set with the napkins, which I watched her set the clean utensils on the dirty podium where the rag she used to wipe down menus was also sitting. She texted and wiped her face/hair while making the utensil sets, not once stopping to wash her hands.  This was a pretty big turn off.

I try really hard to support local businesses, I hope my experience was an anomaly, but I will not be back.
