First time in today. And the service was not all that great and I have a high tolerance for that I used to work in the food biz so I know what it's like to be on the other side of the intercom. Me and my girl friend are native to California with a strong Hispanic background. When we ordered we asked for no pico de gallo and when pulling up at the window made sure one more time because my girl friend is allergic to onions, and still the torta had it. For all you Non Hispanics with a taste for Mexican food don't be fooled this place stinks. And the only reason I'm saying that is because if we didn't pay attention to our bag of food we would have been missing some items. This place is just not worth it! 
This is not Mexican food i would rather go to taco bell this not authentic.
