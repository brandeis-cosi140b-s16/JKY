Came in for some good after a long day at work. Some of the food I wanted wasn't ready, and I understand that, but the employee Bianca refused to tell me how long to expect for my good and instead rolled her eyes and walked away. I come here a lot and the staff is always sweet but this girl acted as though I was coming to annoy her personally.  I'll be going to Mexican restaurant at Highland and Center from now on. Also couldn't find a table that wasn't covered in trash and food and wound up going home to eat instead. My hard-fought meal will have to be eaten cold
