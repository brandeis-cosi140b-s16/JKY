I am completely and utterly confused about these reviews?!! For years I have heard about how great the food is and how people always by the salsa and chips. 

I ordered a burrito of some type and cut it open and then water yep..water poured out of this burrito. I was like WTF?

I regretly tried a bite and it was dry flavorless and the little flavor it did have tasted like fish!!! 

The water must have been from it being premade and frozen, Or almost rotten and frozen to save it a few extra days.

The chips were stale and thick gross had a strange flavor. The salsa was so gross it was unedible. 

What is wrong with you people, did you drop acid before you ate here?
