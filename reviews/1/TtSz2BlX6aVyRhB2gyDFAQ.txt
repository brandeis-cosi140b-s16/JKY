Four of us just  finished eating. A few things here include "love" as an ingredient.  I'm pretty sure the rest are made with a healthy dose of dispair. I asked each one of my compatriots how they would describe the meal on one word:  disgusting, dirty, bland,  and sad. We ordered margaritas; I think they forgot the tequila.  We also got the carnitas, fish, pork belly, carne asada tacos and chips and guac.  The tacos were miserable. The fish, pork belly, and carnitas tacos were super bland; which  itself is somewhat impressive. The worst of the lot was the carne asada which had the texture of chewed gum and the flavor of silly putty rolled in the ashtray of an chain-smoker. The guac was good though : nice and fresh.
