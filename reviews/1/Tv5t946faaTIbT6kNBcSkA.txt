My co-worker and I, both vegetarians, wanted a quick bite at the office. So, we trotted down to the Queso Good truck in the parking lot. 

Big mistake.

Our identical orders (Shroom Zilla) took 30 minutes to make, 20 of which were wasted waiting before being told the truck was out of mushrooms. That would have been handy information when we ordered.

So, we opted for quesadillas with black bean hummus, guacamole, onions and tomato. We would have gone with refried beans, but the staff didn't know if the beans were vegetarian.

Anyway, their first attempt at our vegetarian quesadillas wound up having carne asada. NOPE.

They tried again, but this time but refried beans in them. NOPE.

Finally, I just asked for a cheese and guacamole quesadilla, and I got a sad and flat meal I could have made at home for $1. In all, it cost $7.50 for a little cheese and a microscopic dab of guacamole on a tortilla. And a side of grocery store tortilla chips.

In all, it took more than 45 minutes to get my food. Complete fail.
