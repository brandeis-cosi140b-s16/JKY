And now I get to write my very first negative review. Much like with my first review, I thought for a bit about who I'd rant about first, and it had to be El Hefe.....so where to begin?

When you're inside the atmosphere and ambience is about as welcoming as I'd imagine the inside of one of the breast implants of their servers would be (you know, large, inflated, empty, and possibly a little gooey). The one time I went I believe we waited about an hour from asking for our check, waiting for our waitress to figure out how to split it up as we asked, and then royally effing it up in the end anyway (yeah, I know that can be annoying, but if arithmetic isn't your strong suit, just tell us - it's not your fault that the blood isn't flowing to your brain at the correct speed because it was thwarted at the Hoover-like circulation dam that are your boobs....well actually that is your fault, but still we won't hold it against you). The tacos aren't good, the drinks are over-priced, it's full of your typical Scottsdale douchebags, whose unfortunate existence ensure that the type of waitresses that populate these types of bars continue to get hired, and its in the middle of a bunch of better options.

Also, they should really spell Jefe right.
