Horrible service.  Menu states clearly that kids menu item receives side of small chips.  Lady claimed "not for the meal I ordered".  Come on lady, I just want a small side of chips.  Why not just make a customer happy and give me the small chips.  The menu clearly states that I will receive it with my order.  I hate when places make up rules on the fly like this.  I'll never return here again...you had your chance.
