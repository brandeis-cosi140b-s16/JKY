When you have to stop the waiter and ask for a glass of water, you know the meal is not going to go well.

The food was uninspired: under-seasoned, underwhelming. The only saving grace of the meal was the guacamole, but even that lacked even a scintilla of uniqueness.

Our waiter was relatively attentive, but especially as slow as the restaurant was I expected far better service. 

Barrio Urbano was half the meal I expected at twice the price. I love the Yard, but I will not return to this disappointing experience.
