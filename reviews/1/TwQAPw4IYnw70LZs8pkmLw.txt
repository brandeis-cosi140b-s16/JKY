Oh, Manuel's.... It is with much regret that I didn't write this sooner. For many years your Glendale location has been our go to favorite for celebrations, family dinners, date nights, and just because.  Not sure why there has been such a downturn in your service and food in the last year. I keep returning with hope that these repeated disappointments were just a particular server or circumstances. Sadly I say, "No more." We will be finding a new go to favorite.
