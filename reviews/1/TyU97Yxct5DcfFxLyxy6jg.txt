I would pass on this establishment. The food was just OK, meat was undercooked for sure. What really stands out is the lack of management's service, I tried this place with my wife for lunch with a Living Social voucher. When i went to pay with it they said it was for dinner only. No where on the voucher is the word dinner. NO WHERE. We had a great server, Ashley, but management el suckos. There is much better Mexican food in Matthews than this joint as well.  UPDATE after management response ....nowhere on the voucher is the word DINNER mentioned. NO  WHERE! I don't want free food, I make more money than you and have no problem paying for meals. All I wanted was for you to honor the voucher. The voucher isn't for free food either jackass, it's $30 for $15. If I never paid for it how would I have it in my possession? If I never paid for it why would Living Social refund my money for it after you refused it FOR NO REASON? You don't have to be Mexican to be an idiot. Check your new Living Social voucher that went live today too, guess what? THE WORD DINNER IS NO WHERE ON THERE EITHER!   Your business won't last long because of your lack of service and attitude. I can give you a list of restaurants that do offer service not attitude if you would like some lessons.
