This is probably the worst Mexican food I have ever had. When ordered queso first and it was watery and strangely solid white...no chilis, etc. Once the entrees were served they smell coming from them was strange and off putting. My daughter and I couldn't eat more than a bite to try and see if we could push past the smell. Mexican is our favorite and we have been to more Mexican restaurants than any other type of restaurant. This place really disappointed.
