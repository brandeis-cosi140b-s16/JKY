I see there's enough bad reviews but geez. It's really bad. Ordered a 20$ CHICKEN. Taco salad . Came with no chicken. So. The remedy after waitress disappears for 15 -20 minutes is well take $5 off. Lol drinks are advertised at 2 for 1.  So one marguerita is 33$ lol beware. Lol.  And a beer, one beer is $23. Really. Stay the ***away. Go to a high end restaurant enjoy yourself and pay less. Horrible experience for Vegas. Don't waste your time on a stupid frog.( and sadly I Love frogs:/)
