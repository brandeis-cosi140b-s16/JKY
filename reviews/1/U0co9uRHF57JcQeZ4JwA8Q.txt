I know that sadly this area is changing over the years but the Wendy's that was originally here should have probably stayed open. Heck the Arby's next door is only open until 10 at night so clearly the chains that have been here for decades aren't as busy as they once used to be. They need to work out how to order here at Taqueria El Buen Pastor. I walked in and they have a menu board that says "express line" under all the menu items which would lead anybody to believe that's where you order. I mean it was right there in plain English and I was still confused. I had to go over to a girl and give her my order and pay then wait for it to be brought out. I din't have any problem with that but come on don't plaster "express line" all across your menu board if that isn't where you order. 

I got asada tacos and this place charged me .50 cents per taco to have flour tortillas instead of corn tortillas. WTF?! I know a lot of the chain restaurants do this but not usually these mom and pop type run places. I can go to Sinaloa (just down the street on Decatur near Lake Mead) and also Tacos El Gordo who both have the best tacos in town and they never charge me for wanting flour tortillas instead and even if they did, I'd gladly pay it because I know I'm getting a legit taco. The asada tacos here were way too fatty and overcooked. All I tasted was charred fatty meat. The tacos also only came with meat and tortilla so again I say WTF?! They do have a salsa bar but come on most places put onions and cilantro on the tacos at least! Just not my type of taco joint.
