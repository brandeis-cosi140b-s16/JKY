NORMALLY A FANTASTIC FOOD.. lately it's gone down hill. Paid $$$ for their Carne Asada Super Burrito.. The first couple times I ate there the burrito was HUGE and great value for the money. Well the people must be having gambling debt or something because the last couple times the burrito is half the size and you pay $$$$$ for these "Super Burritos".

 The guy had a really bad attitude today when picking up $30 worth of lunch for me and co-workers. 

 Sad this place has gone down hill. We won't be eating Stupid Burrito again. Sorry!
