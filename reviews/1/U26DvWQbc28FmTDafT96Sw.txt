I have been a customer of this filibertos for years, and it disappoints me to say that I will never ever return to this establishment. I have worked in the food industry for years and I have never seen such bad customer service. I would give this place -5 five stars if I could! I would never advise anyone to go to this place. P.S I hate you stupid cashier with bad eyebrows
