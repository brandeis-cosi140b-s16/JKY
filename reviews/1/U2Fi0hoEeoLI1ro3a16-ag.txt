If you call this authentic Mexican food you are probably not Mexican. I really hate giving bad reviews but this was one of worse restaurants I've been to.  Food is disgusting, more specifically it is bland, greasy and low quality. The place was also pretty dirty. It looked like they hadn't mopped in weeks. I would only recommend this place to my worst enemy.
