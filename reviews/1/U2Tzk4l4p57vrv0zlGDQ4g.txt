Food and service sucks, Dan Dan mein should change name to salted noodle, portion is tiny. I am not expect a huge one, but at least should more than a cup of instant noodle. Busboy gave wrong order, and very rude to clean my table. How's price? For this service and food, hehe... What u think? Only one thing I like that is decoration.
