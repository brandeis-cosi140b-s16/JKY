First time to eat there, experience was horrible. Casher had no flexibility at all, Cashier were  unable to change my order to cevichetwo minutes after placing it. Cashier added that she will provide a small sample to try. We received our order but the ceviche is still being worked on as the cashier indicated. I asked again after a good 20 minutes , she said "they are still chopping it".
Ordered shrimp quesadilla, shrimp was very rubbery with half way cooked huge chunks of tomatoes, onions and green peppers just not pleasant to eat.

We left and the poor cook was still chopping the ceviche..
