So this is our 3rd time here, and last one.  Both previous experience were awesome we are Mexican and the flavor was so authentic, today it was a whole different story, the food was plain, and the quantity was very less. I ordered the Cuban sandwich and I even heard the waitress tell the cook put whatever you have.. If they don't have the ingredients please don't serve it. We showed a previous picture to the waitress and she mentioned the cook was different and that explains everything. I wouldn't recommend it. Now I want to figure out where the other cook went his food was awesome!
