I ate here this past weekend and 1 star in generous.  The lady that took our order wasn't the nicest of people. We had to ask for every extra.  Can I please have sugar or cream with my coffee.  Your coffee dispenser is empty.  Can I please have napkins.  Plus, the tables are not cleaned between guests using them.  The food didn't fair any better.  I ordered a personal pan pizza.  My pizza had no flavor!  I would highly recommend the McDonalds in Circus Circus over this place!
