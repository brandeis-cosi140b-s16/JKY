We went out to have dinner for my brother's birthday about 2 weeks ago. I thought all would be well since we made reservations in advance, and I noticed that the restaurant was empty when we arrived (there was maybe another small group or 2). We were seated and the first round of drinks came out pretty fast. Everything after that went down hill. It took forever for them to get the requested drinks out and even longer for us to get our order. We ended up eating an hour and a half after our arrival. Once we began to eat our dinner, we were told that we had a few minutes to add anything since the kitchen was closing. I tried to be understanding since we did have a big party, but they should have been prepared since reservations were made. Not impressed. At all.
