You ever heard of hole in the wall? Well this place surpasses that and then some. If a buddy of mine wasn't performing here then I'm sure i would never step foot in this place. The bathroom are disgusting. I don't think they've been clean since New Year's Eve 1999. (That would be last century for some people who might've not gotten the joke.) I'm going to the nearest urgent care after i leave here to get a tetanus shot.
