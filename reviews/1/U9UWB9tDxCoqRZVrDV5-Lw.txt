The food  there is bland except for the salsa, to salty & very spicy.  I usually like the salsa from mexican restaurants but this was to much.  Husband & I had the shrimp cocktails, $12.50 Each! Sorry they were good but not that good. Had chicken burrito, and 3 soft mini tacos, 2 iced teas. We had No alchol. over $41! the service is good there,but  it is not a place to go if you are on a budget or have a family trying to save some money. We will stick with Roberto's.
