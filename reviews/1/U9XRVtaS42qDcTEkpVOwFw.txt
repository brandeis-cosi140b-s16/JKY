I am not the type to leave a bad review but what I experienced today at lunch is simply... unacceptable.
First let me say that I am a big fan of Jose Andres. I ate at Bazaar and Jaleo multiple times and love it.. so I decided to stop by China Poblano for lunch today.
I sat at the bar and my waitress was very friendly. I had the agua Fresca based on her recommendation and it was delicious. I also tried the Lemon Drop and it was very nice. I quickly ordered a Gazpacho and the quail... And it went downhill from there.
Let me first say that the place was NOT busy at all... 
It took at least 25 mn to get the gazpacho. My waitress apologized and I told her that it was not a big deal and things happen. Now, call me difficult but if the first course took much longer than expected, you would think that they would make sure that the next course doesnt? Wrong.. Bottom line is, I placed my order at 11:45am.. I received my second course at 12:25pm. During the whole time, no manager approached me nothing, I finally lost patience and asked one of the waitstaff to check on it. He did but came back behind the bar without saying a word to me... So I asked him again and without looking at me said " it is going to be a few more minutes... ". I pointed out to him that the couple next to me came later , ate and was already gone. The brought me chips and salsa. 
And the quail? Well, no one really checked on me to see if I was happy with it.. some of it was raw. For most part the dish was pretty boring. A piece of dragon fruit in the middle and 4 small pieces of fried quail. Big deal. Obviously I am upset. I think that they missed the mark as to how to handle guest complains. I quickly asked for the check, paid and left. Won't be back. I was planning on ordering more food but the attitude from the guy behind the bar really pissed me off so I went to Comme Ca on the third level and finished my lunch and it was great...
