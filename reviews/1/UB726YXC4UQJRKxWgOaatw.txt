All I'm gonna say is that I HATE THE SANDBAR.  I really do, probably  for personal reasons:  I am always dragged there by the dumbest, most immature people I know and sand sucks unless you are actually at the beach.  If you must go, fine, but just don't ask me to go with you. 

I'm glad I got that off my chest.  

In their defense, I have never had their food.  So, that could be great and I could be missing out... but, I doubt it.
