Loyal client for over 7 years!! I have always loved the taco salad bowl as well as the quesadilla. Unfortunately, due to a very STINGY manager/owner I will no longer be returning. Don't know her name but I can tell you she has short dark black hair and light, pale white skin. 

I ordered a half chicken and half steak quesadilla with pico de gallo. I literally had only 4-5 very tiny skimpy square pieces of meat in my tortilla. It was almost ALL steak no chicken.  

To make matters worse, I had a "free chips and queso" coupon. She answered the phone and kept me waiting instead of putting them on a brief hold and finishing up my transaction. She did so only when I made mention that I'm in a hurry and have to leave. 

Very unprofessional, disrespectful, rude and stingy!!! I would rather drive to another location where they're not feeding me just tortilla!! I have never written a review before but felt the urge that I needed to - to warn fellow clients old and new!
