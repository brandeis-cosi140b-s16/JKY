I went to order my food the girls serving my food kept talking to the cashier and not paying attention to what I was trying to order.
The music was loud and the other two white ladies were complaining about the music and the Mexican man told them to deal with it very unprofessional. 

As I'm trying to decide what to order the girl then
 goes on talking with the other girl about a meeting coming up and they and talked about this while I'm waiting to finish my order which I had to ask for more serving because of the very small portions then she was putting on my tin foil plate after I'm done 

I go to the cashier I told her I ordered the special and that the drink I want it then she tells me that it's going to be extra 
I told her  the special comes with a drink her being the cashier you would think that she would know.
 At the drink station they have syrup to go into your drinks they were empty and sticky.
 when I asked for help to refill them the girl who was the cashier said she didn't even know where to get them so I chose a different drink 
Chipotle I will be back many times over and over sorry I went to the worst place ever.
Another thing that aluminum bowl or dish made it hard to warm up your food at work in the microwave inconvenience.!!
