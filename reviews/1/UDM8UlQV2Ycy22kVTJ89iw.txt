I wish I could give this place negative stars as it seriously needs to go out of business the way it treats people's orders and their management talks to customers like they're idiots.

After waiting almost 20 minutes in the drive thru, i was served a custom combo burrito in a half way unwrapped piece of tin foil, falling out into the bag it was presented in.  I noticed that the drive-thru person was touching that lose food prior to putting it into my bag after touching a register to ring someone up behind me, touching the counter area, touching his face and head, then giving me the food.

They initially refused to refund my order, and blamed me for the loose food in the bag.  I spoke with a female manager who didn't provide her name and again, tried to blame me on their error.  She eventually provided the refund but refused to provide a receipt to prove this. 

I guess it was against my better judgement to give this business a second chance, but I will not be returning, ever and advise you, if you value food safety, quality, and cleanliness to avoid this location like the plague.
