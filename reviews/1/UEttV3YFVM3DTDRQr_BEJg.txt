The food is horrible!  Yelpers are normally right on and I rely on them when trying a new place. I personally rarely review restaurants but felt compelled to write one because I want others looking for good Mexican food to avoid this place. The staff was pleasant and accommodating but that could not make up for the bad tasting food!  I'm in town from Los Angeles, so not sure if the there is a regional difference in Mexican cooking but if you're used to good Mexican food in the likes of LA stay clear from this place. The beans were dry, the guacamole was made with cheap tasting avocados, the albondiga soup was tasteless and the chorizo and eggs plate was made with some type of meat that tasted nothing like chorizo. I feel bad writing this review but if you're in town and its past 9 pm on a weekday just go to Taco Bell ( never thought I'd say this!)
Oh and when we got the check we couldn't read the chicken scratch on it. As it turns out it was done on purpose as the waitress added her tip into the tab, but she never told us she did. Had we not asked the host to review the check we would have left her a double tip- tricky!!!
