I was so excited that a Mexican food place was going in so close to home! However all three times that I have tried it, the food has been awful! Although I have several complaints, my biggest is that the food is incredibly bland, the salsas are terrible, and they do not even have a true red chili sauce. If they could learn to make a breakfast burrito like Rolando's, I would be there every week
