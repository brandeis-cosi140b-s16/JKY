The whole time I waited for this food I was looking at Taco Bell and was like should have gone with what you know. The amount of American cheese used is gross, also, American cheese for Mexican food, that is so gross, my quesadilla was greasy and soggy, my burrito was sub par. It was a breakfast burrito, and the amount of plastic cheese made we toss it half way. This was an underwhelming experience and would not recommend to anyone I like talking too. Service was cold. I'm sorry I'm inconveniencing you by paying you money. Maybe you should choose a different career path
