RUDE!!!! 1STAR CUSTOMER SERVICE/5 STARS FOOD, went in tonight, ordered some take out, you have to practically SHOUT your order because of that glass shield! I had trouble hearing them asking me what I wanted on my food. At the end of the line near the register, The short guy asked me something, couldn't hear, I said "what" the tall guy employee next to him said "she doesn't want that." All because they were BUSY! He was just trying to push me out of the line. I realized what he said by reading his lips. Hey, just because you're busy doesn't mean you have to be RUDE!!! Called the store, asked for the manager, spoke to Simon. He was nice and said he would take care of it. Very good food though.
