Service was terrible, he didn't know what a torta was when I asked him, I looked online and it looked like a sandwich so I asked, "is it a sandwich?" He didn't know. Then I asked what types of tamales they had, if they were different meat or sauce? He didn't know. Then I just ended up ordering one taco (el pastor-pork taco) 2/5. My fianc√© ordered 2 carne asada tacos and a tamale and I'd give it a 1/5. Also had to go inside and look for a drink menu because the sign board read, "now serving alcohol" found the cooler and had to ask if I should help myself or what? 

Overall: service was really bad & food was bad. Really disappointing because I am obsessed with Mexican food!! Good thing Chocolate Shoppe was down the road
