Stood in front for 5 min nobody greeted me another 10-15 min sitting down nobody acknowledged my presence. I saw another table being waited on. Then my wife had to ask the bartender who was too busy flirting with other customers for a waitress.  Ooh and they don't serve after 10 pm which is displayed nowhere on the website. Worst service ever. I understand if the kitchen is closed but taking 20+minutes and no waitress visits my table is utterly ridiculous.
