The last time I checked, a California Burrito has Fries in it, not a shitload of grilled onions and rice. Using shit thats just laying around to put in a burrito because someone is coming to the Drive-Thru and you know the odds are they wont notice until its too late to come back, shows just how some locations can be compared to Del Taco rather than an authentic restaurant.

Will not visit this one again!

This location's performance will also contribute to it's falling in the rankings on LasVegasBestTacos.com when the new rankings are released!

Stay away from this location!
