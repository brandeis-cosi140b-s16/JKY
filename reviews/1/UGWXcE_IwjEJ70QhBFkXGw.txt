I went here after work ordered two tacos and two chicken quesadillas through the drive-through. When I got home. I discovered that my tacos did not have taco shells. Called the store no answer no return call also they closed shortly after I left. Emailed my experience to Taco Bell. They ignored my calls and emails. This place is garbage. Even more so then the food they serve.  The manager needs to be fired.
I have gone here a few times where they did not have food properly in stock. The time before this incident they literally were out of hot sauce.

Drive the extra mile and go to a different Taco Bell or better yet any anywhere else.
