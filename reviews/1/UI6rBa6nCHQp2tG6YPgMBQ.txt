We went here three times in the last 6 months, each time hoping it would be better and more like the location on Indian School and Dysart where we had previously visited. It wasn't. I got a combo platter each time and each time parts of the plate were literally unedible. The tamale was overcooked to death. The chile rellano had nothing in it and was dried out. And for over $8, it should be much better than that.
The last time my husband complained of an upset stomach that night and next day. We will not return to this location.
