Possibly the worst Mexican fast food ever.. I really tried to like their food but it was just terrible .. I had the fish taco and it completely  fell  apart on the first bite, somewhat cold corn tortilla couldn't hold it together . It was bland and just zero wow factor to it , also had the home made queso and chips, the queso was way too thick and lacked flavor, the chips were just  so so, the best thing I had was the coke zero... I won't be back.. I was expecting more and just wasted good money on subpar food! Yuck
