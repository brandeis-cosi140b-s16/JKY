I feel bad giving a Chipotle one star because in general it is my favorite "fast" food restaurant, BUT this particular location is the wooorrrrsstttt!!!!! Easily the slowest service in Las Vegas, possibly of all the Chipotle restaurants I've ever been to. A few of the previous reviews warned not to visit during the weekday lunch hour, but it is always slow any time of day, whether there is a line or not.  Tonight I walked in at 9:15 pm, there were 5 customers in front of me, and I did not walk out with my veggie bowl until 9:30!  All due to slow customer service.  Then they had the nerve to have a tip cup by the register, really?!?  Unfortunately it is the only location any where near my home, so I don't get to have Chipotle as often as I would like.  I still give it a chance every once in a while just hoping one of these times it will be better, still waiting on that day!
