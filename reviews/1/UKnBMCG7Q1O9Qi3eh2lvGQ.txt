Ordered through Grubhub, I was excited to see a Mexican restaurant delivered in my area so I gave them a try. Our order got here fairly quick and driver was nice. He handed me the bag and I swore something was missing as it was so light. When I opened the bag it seemed all was there. My order consisted of two crispy taco and one soft taco meal plus an order of tortilla soup. The soft taco meal according to the menu on grubhub comes with two tacos, beans and rice, it did not have beans or rice and the so called tacos were a few pieces of carne asada on tortillas a bit smaller then a rice cake, the little meat they had was good. The crispy taco meals were a bit better, you get three as opposed to the two in the soft taco meal. You cant see them at first because they are cover by lettuce and a tiny tomato with a few shreds of cheese (there must have been 10 pieces of cheese, ridiculous only reason I knew was there was the contrast in color). The tacos themselves were so thin with very little anything inside, unlike the photo on the page, a jack in the box taco has more meat. The beans were very spicy and more like soup then typical refried beans although im not sure that's what they were supposed to be since most spilled into the rest of the container. The rice was very very bland and the grains were hard as if not cooked long enough plus had this greasy texture, it had NO positive attributes. Finally the soup, a little too spicy for me but don't pay to much into that but mom liked it. With all the great Mexican restaurants in Phoenix and even in the area one that delivers could have been a slam dunk but felt was a complete waste of $30, if I had walked to Fediricos on 35th and camelback I would have had enough food for days and it would have been good. I can not recommend Tacos and Tequila and don't see them being in business very long well without the tequila part at least
