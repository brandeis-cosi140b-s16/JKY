Uugh.  I too hate giving local businesses bad reviews, but the food there was simply terrible.  I ordered tacos and they served them up enchilada style.  I mean it was actually funny that all they had to do is give me tacos and instead they plunked massive amounts of cheese over these tacos and served them up enchilada style!  So I tried to eat them, and truthfully even if they just served me the tacos the food tasted terrible and it was overpriced to boot.  Finally, I know this is terrible to say, but the server girl in line had so many piercings on her face and in her nose it was kind of disgusting.  I get that people want to express themselves with piercings, but when I'm buying food from you, I don't want to see metal drooping out of your nose.  Just saying...
