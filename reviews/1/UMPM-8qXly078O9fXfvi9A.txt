Overpriced, sub-par food can be forgiven if the service is decent. I've been in the service industry for a long time and understand what rude customers and being in the weeds is all about. When a restaurant is nearly empty and servers are standing around, there is no excuse for bad service. They make minimum wage, customers' tips are their bread and butter, if they are at least nice or pretend like they don't hate their job. Our drinks were not refilled once, dirty dinner plates and long finished appetizers were on the table when we left, after dessert. The thin, dark haired manager (if that's what they call him), is the worst!!! Managers are there to smooth out situations, he made ours worse. He was uncaring and argumentative, then stood at the door smirking at me. The guy desperately needs Customer Service 101 training. Thanks for ruining our rare night out Arribas !
