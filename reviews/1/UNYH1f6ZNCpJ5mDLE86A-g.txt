Do not eat at this location. First off i was suckered in due to a groupon deal i seen. After my dinner i showed my groupon and was informed they did not want to expect it. I was stuck with the bill and very dissapointed due to the quailty of the food was not worth the outrageous price. Chk quesadilla was watery and greesy . My friend ordered some dry steak tacos with no flaver if it wasbt for hot sause. The drinks were  11.00 for quevo margarita . Which they advertised as top shelf.  Not authenic mexican food at all. U are better off going elsewhere for your mexican crave . Unless u are into expensive water tasteless food.
