I like the ambiance at this restaurant.  However, the service is poor!  My sister & I  went in on Saturday, November 30 & it was not busy.  We ordered a couple of cokes & nachos.  It took over a 1/2 hour to get the nachos - when they were served to us it was served on a tiny plate.  I'm thinking really??  this is $9?  This is the 3rd time we've been there & had lousy service.  The woman who was at a table next to us had also ordered nachos & her plate was huge!  Not recommending!
