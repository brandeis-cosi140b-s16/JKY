I am giving one star because of our really ugly experience here yesterday! The food was good, I had the lobster taco and that's what one star is for. Plus the ambiance is really nice and clean. But If only I could give negative feedback about the server I would, and I wish there's separate ratings for food and servers. 

Our server was the black haired Latina, didn't get her name because we were just gonna let her attitude go. Anyway, she was so rude and pushy with us ordering alcohol, we didn't want any but still kept pushing. And when I asked if I can have options with the drink that I got, she just got too bjtchy. She was acting too cool and not even treating us like her customers. Me and my friends thought that she didn't deserve any tip because of her attitude and bad service but we still left $3. 

Leaving the restaurant, she chased us with a really bitchy attitude. "You're gonna give that much tip, for that much amount of food? So did you wanna get your change back???? Is my service really that bad?" Said that very rudely. So my friend ended up giving her $10 so she could just leave and go. Ughhh, most terrible service I've had in my life . I really can't believe her. I even called the manager about her. 

I feel bad for this restaurant for having her. She deserves to get fired and just quit and have a different job that she actually like and hoping she could read this and realize how bad her service is.
