This is the WORST chipotle I have ever been to...(and like the rest of you I love chipotle).  I have had more than one horrible experience....try 5 bad experiences.  You may ask yourself "why do you keep going back"?....well I live in the area and I would haven't possibly imagined that a chipotle location could be this horrible.  If your trying to order online..don't bother!  

I ordered online twice now, and when I got to the location not only was my order not ready (after 20 min)...but there was no one there.  On top of my order not being ready...there was no chicken left... Talk about being reactive at 7pm????   The staff tried to apologize and give me the meal for free, however I already paid for it.  I then said that I would take Barbacoa instead, however the manager wouldn't give it to me because it was .70 more!!!   The staff is lazy and very rude!!  I recommend NEVER going there!!!
