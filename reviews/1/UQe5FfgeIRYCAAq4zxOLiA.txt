You know what differentiates a lot of tomato based Mexican food from fucking Italian? Oregano and basil, both of which were in your "hot" salsa today. I put quotation marks around that because I guess it was supposed to be spicy but it tasted more like sloppy joe mix than chiles. I didn't ask for a freakin' Mexitalian burrito.

Consistently the worst pseudo-Mexican food in the business. 

The best thing that can be said for it is it'll form a turd. Pure fuel, not food.
