Great atmosphere, food is not good. Salsa tasted like a metal can. Taco meat was awful. Guac was just ok, queso was ok but a little lumpy..this was my second visit and will be my last and it is a shame because I love sitting up on the roof:( they need an overhaul on their recipes.. Worst Mexican food I have ever had and Mexican is my favorite
