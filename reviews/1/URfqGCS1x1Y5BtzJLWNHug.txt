I just left this place today 12/19/15 with the worst experience ever at this restaurant. First off I've been coming for the last three years and it was one of the best and my favorites. But as I continue to to come I become more and more dissatisfied and today topped it off. Lately the cleanliness of this place has been going down the drain, dirty kitchen floors salsa bar is not up to healthy standards anymore etc. One of my favorite dishes was the menudo, it used to be the best in town even better than the one at the lindo and bonito michoacan and more authentic also. But today when I bough my usual large size order that usually costs about 8 bucks. I noticed that they dis not put enough meat, there is a reason why I order a large portion, so I took it back, and I was served a new one. Well I don't know if it had been sitting for a long time but it tasted liked old wet rag!!! Keep in mind that I always ask if they still have menudo left as it is popular dish a and has to be eaten within a certain time. The cashier today said they did have menudo, well she forgot to mention hat it was more ready to be tossed out. To all the Poole I've recommended this place to, do not eat here, quality and cleanliness is no longer served at Tacos La Mexicana!
