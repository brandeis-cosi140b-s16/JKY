If you're hungry and stuck at the Airport, it's ok to eat here. But drinks are off the chart.  I had one margarita. I did not sense any Tequila in it, but I decided to let it go.  They charged me 12.95 for the damned thing!  The bill said 'DB Margarita.' I asked the waitress what that meant and she said, it's a double.  We only serve doubles...!
Well there may have been the scent of tequila, but thats all. Either way, 12.95 was about 5 bucks too much.  
Rip Off!
Also, she didn't want to serve us coffee. Seems they don't want people hanging around the restaurant waiting for flights. But it wasn't that busy... No coffee after dinner? She actually said we should get it in the terminal!
