I used to come to this store for lunch when they first opened years ago. 
I haven't been in awhile and wanted fish tacos on Saturday. I picked a couple up to take out. 
This place "used" to be good. 

I do not know exactly "what" it was..the fish or the tortilla, but it was just a mouthful of mush. 
The fish was a little tiny sliver of breading with fish in it (supposedly). 
I spit it out and tossed it in the trash. 
Tried the second taco...same thing. 
Had I been at the store, I would have demanded my money back. 
I do not know they are this disgusting on just the weekends or if they consistantly serve this substandard crap throughout the week.

I will never know because they lost my business!
