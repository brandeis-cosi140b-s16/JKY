I love Chipotle. However, I absolutely hate coming to this location. 1st: The parking is awful. There is never anywhere to park. 2nd: this location is so slow. The workers are more concerned about socializing, eating, or standing around. Just recently, I went during rush hour dinner time. When I was walking in, there were 2 workers on the patio talking about how they are going back to work late. Then as I'm standing in the huge line, I see 3 additional staff get in line. There was 2 people making the food and one person checking out. Those making the food were so slow and could care less about the line. 3rd: The staff is so rude. At all other locations, the staff greet you as soon as you enter and again as soon as you get up to order and again when checking out. At this location the staff say nothing. When you get up to order, they stair at you till you talk. When you ask for something, it's always done with eye rolls and moans. During the same visit as discussed before, there was a lady behind me with a little girl under 5. The lady and her little girl waited in line for over 20 minutes. Mom kept telling the daughter they had to get this for dad and couldn't leave. When she got up to order, she asked the girl for a kids meal to go. She asked for it to be put in a bowl because her girl couldn't have shells because she has a gluten allergy. The server began to fight with the lady refusing to put it in the bowl. Some guy came from the back, who I assume was a manager, and continued to fight with the lady. In the end, they made the lady pay for an adult bowl.  These staff members do not care about the customers or anything but themselves. This is the worst Chipotle ever. DO NOT GO HERE. The BEST Chipotle is only a few miles away on 59th Ave and Northern. Drive the few extra miles to this FABULOUS Chipotle!!
