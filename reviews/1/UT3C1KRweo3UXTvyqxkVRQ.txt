Dear Taco Bell on Decatur, 
As much as I love your crunch wrap supremes I feel the need to yelp my experience. We visited your drive thru on Friday 1/2/2015 @ 7:40pm and the young boy was rude and didn't respond to our conversation with him and after we ordered $30.57 worth of Taco Bell we did not receive our 4 crunchy tacos and cheese sauce for our nachos. Sorry but I feel cheated. 

Yours truly, 
Crunch wrap supreme lover
