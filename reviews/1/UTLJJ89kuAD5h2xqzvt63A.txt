My wife and I stopped in there for a quick lunch on the way to a movie.  The initial service was OK but ultimately slowed to a crawl making us dash to our movie.  The decor was like it was when I was in high school (20 years ago) and desperately needs some updating - making the entire dining experience feel dingy.
Now for the food - the food was served on vey hot plates (which I think covers for improper cooking) and came relatively quick.  No sour cream on my burrito as ordered but we'll move on.  My food was extremely bland; ground beef rolled in a flour tortilla does not a burrito make.  I couldn't even finish my meal it was so boring and tasteless.  My wife had pretty much the same experience with her chimichanga but the black beans saved her meal (a little).  We paid and bolted for the door (partly to catch the movie but mostly just to end the experience).
The place would do well with some aggressive management, quality control out of the kitchen and a remodel/deep cleaning.
