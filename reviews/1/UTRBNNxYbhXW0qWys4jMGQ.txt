Give me a break!
I went to this place because of my fellow yelpers' very positive reviews.

Was it better than Roberto's? 
Was it better than Baja Fresh? 
Was it better than Chipotle?
Was it better than Agave?
Was it better than any of the Michoacans?

No! Not even equivalent!

The worst part of it is now I'm suspect of what gets posted on this site. It's a crisis of confidence! Sigh.
