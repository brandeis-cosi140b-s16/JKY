Short story: Terrible service, metal filing in food.

I'm a big fan of Chipotle and eat there semi-regularly. I usually go to the one on Eastern in Henderson. This one on Sunset is closer to me so I went here for the first time.

The place is clean and sterile, like all Chipotles. The first server, who prepped a chicken burrito, acted like a robot, zero personality, and after scooping the meat immediately turned and walked away.

The second server ... nothing noteworthy, seemed nice.

The cashier, wow. No eye contact, rude demeanor, yanked credit card out of my hand, swiped it, handed it back with receipt and promptly turned away without saying a word throughout the entire transaction.

I will not be re-visiting this Chipotle location again.

And then when I get home, halfway through the burrito my mouth begins chewing on a half-inch black metal filing.
