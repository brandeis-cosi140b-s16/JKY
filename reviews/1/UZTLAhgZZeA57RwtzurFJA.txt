This place just gave me the worst food poisoning I've ever had in my life!! The shrimp burrito did it to me, awful!! Nonstop vomiting, and stomach issues I will not mention for the past 2 days, and still not over it. It would be interesting to see what kind of health inspection report this place would get. Stay away, or you will be sorry.
