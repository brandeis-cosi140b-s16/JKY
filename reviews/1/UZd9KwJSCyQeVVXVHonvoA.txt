I wish they didn't have to charge for lemons and jalape√±o , and also someone needs to keep the men's restroom clean it's always dirty and full of graffiti. Is this to much to ask for? Anyway the food is good. Also it wouldn't be bad to replace all the light bulbs that don't work.... This restaurant is located in a nice area in Chandler, yet it seems dirty. Maybe is time for a new crew leader? Or maybe the owner is just a stingy asswhole :) good day
