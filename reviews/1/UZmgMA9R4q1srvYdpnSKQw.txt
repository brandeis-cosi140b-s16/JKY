Hard to review the food here, we never got served! Came in Sunday afternoon, probably 5 tables. We sat down ourselves, as the sign said, however we sat there for a good 10mins. No one came to our table, no greeted us, nothing. There was a woman and an old man walking around aimlessly, I assumed owners?!? 

We just moved to this neighborhood and we were hoping to find a good Mexican place. But no luck with this place. We walked out after waiting and waiting! 

I'll drive to La Pi√±ata over this place any day!!! Go try them at 7th Ave and Missouri, great attentive service! And the food is outta this world. The atmosphere is so much more too. Lo siento El a conquistador!
