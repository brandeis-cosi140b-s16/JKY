This place is like Qdoba, Moe's, and Chipotle. I would say that the food might beat Qdoba in my opinion, but not the other two.

This place is overpriced. You can go to an actual Mexican restaurant and order off a lunch menu and come out cheaper and with a better quality of food that tastes better. Here, an entre, a side of chips and dip (queso, quacamole, or salsa), and a drink cost around $10.00 or more.  

It is convenient if you don't have a lot of time and want something to go. It is better than Taco Bell. 
Lots of people love this place. I'm not the biggest fan. 

This particular establishment has overcharged me.  I have sent an email to their headquarters on 2/18/15. I can update this review if called for.

UPDATE: 3/9/15 It has been a few weeks and I never received a single response. This plays blows. Make sure you watch what they ring up, as for me, it did not even come close to matching the menu price.  A small burrito was listed as $5.49 from the menu I took from there that same day. It was a veggie burrito, so it shows to subtract $.50. That's $4.99 for a small veggie burrito. They charged $6.99 and I didn't notice until I got back to work. They did not return my email about this. I will not go back. It was a bunch of apathetic kids working there anyway who looked like it was an inconvenience to serve my food. 

I'm normally laid back about places to eat, always try a place twice, and am easy to please. This place is a bad experience even for me. I'll just stick to Chipotle, they taste much better anyway.
