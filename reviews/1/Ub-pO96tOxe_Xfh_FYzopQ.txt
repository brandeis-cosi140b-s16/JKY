Yuck! The chips were okay. Some of them were straight white. Im not sure if they're not cooked or what but they were chewy and not good. The salsa was alright too. Not bad. I ordered a beef tostada and a beef taco. I took one bite of the tostada and couldn't take another. So gross. The beans were nasty. Not the refried beans im used to. I could have bought a can of Rosarita and been better off. Also, Idk what it was but something on there was really mushy. Almost a fish consistency actually. I was grossed out. The taco was OKAY...but I had about two bites of that as well...I thought I was getting ground beef but it was shredded. I gave the plate back and they didn't charge me for it. I also tried the chicken in my boyfriends enchilada and that was disgusting as well. I wanted to spit it out but i just dealt with it. He didn't like anything on his plate but the chicken inside of the enchilada. Sauce was gross, etc. I'm not going to come back. Super friendly staff though!! Great service and if you like mariachi bands they're live every Friday night.
