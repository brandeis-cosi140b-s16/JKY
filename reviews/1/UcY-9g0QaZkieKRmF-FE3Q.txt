Decided to give this place another chance and I was beyond disappointed I went through the drive thru. I order my food and I pay with my debit card. As I pay I ask the lady if I could have a horchata. As they where handing my food I ask aging if I could get an horchata and at this point it was a different lady handing me my food and said she needed to see my i.d. I ask her you need to see my i.d. for a horchata she said yes I need your i.d. at this point I was beyond irritated since no i.d. had been required to pay the meals I got with my debit card and it  was not sign on the back and it was clear I was going to pay cash for the drink I had ask for. I told her to forget it and I left. Never aging going to this place. Sadly I can't rate them lower if I could I would. Wish I could of talk to a manager but aging I'm sure no one would of done nothing about it. Makes me feel worry now that no i.d. was ask for my card. I would have to keep and eye on my bank account now.
