We ordered three dinners here tonight. Two were delicious, and one was inedible. 

Each of the three of us tasted this meal, and the fish was BAD. It was the pescado tacos (I had ahi tuna tacos, which were great). The pescado taco dish is $17, and consists of two tacos, rice, and beans. Obviously, the beans and rice were eaten. It was.busy, and the tacos were GROSS.  Half of one of the tacos was gone, if that, because all three of us tasted it.The manager refused to credit us for the meal, giving us a $7 credit, and stating that "most of the food was eaten, but we'll make it right." 

Really? So, we paid $10 for a puny side of rice and beans? Refusing to credit us for the whole meal, and then begrudgingly and half heartedly offering to "make it right" is very low class, El Zocalo. 

I pointed out that we were there on St. Patrick's Day, sober and polite, waited patiently for our food, and recieved bad fish. I told the manager he can keep the $10, as at that point I was planning to leave a bad review on Yelp anyway. 

For the record, we tipped our waiter well, as it was no fault of his, and he clearly felt badly about the whole situation. Additionally, I personally will eat just about anything without complaint, and even I could not stomach that fish.

If they were to get a new manager, I would have had no complaint. The food was just average. Occasionally, some of the food is going to go bad; it happens. In the face of our politeness, the smarmy attitude of the manager was totally unacceptable. Thumbs down.
