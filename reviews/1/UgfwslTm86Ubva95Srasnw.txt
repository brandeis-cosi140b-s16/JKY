What has happen to this location? It's been a few years since I visited this location. When I would frequent this location over two years ago the staff was excited and took pride in what they were doing. Unfortunately the last two times I been here the staff looks sad. The appearance of the food looks like it's been sitting for sometime. We were in line not acknowledge for over 2 minutes. We actually just walked out this time rather than go through the bad experience. So sad and sorry to see.
