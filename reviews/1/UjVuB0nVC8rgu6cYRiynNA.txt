I'm sorry, are these people idiots? I always go here because this is the closest location to me. I ordered a 5 layer burrito and a Chalupa Supreme. I got a plain taco and a 2 layer burrito?? It wasn't even busy, I don't see how my order is always screwed up somehow every time I come. It's just ridiculous.
