Both my daughter and I got to spend a fun filled Sunday sick to our stomachs, retching, plus all the highlights that go along with it.  Interestingly enough, Saturday night, we both had bean and cheese burritos with guacamole here.  I'm not saying we got food poisoning from Filiberto's, but it is definitely suspect.
