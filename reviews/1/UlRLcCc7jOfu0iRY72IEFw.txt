We decided to give this location 2 chances.  Don't ask me why.  Of all the MX restaurants in the area it was just stupid to think it would improve.  Poor service, poor quality of food (bagged lettuce preserved with only god knows what that caused itchy palms on my hands), very little protein with salads, entrees, over priced, kitchen can't follow orders or they just ignored what and how we wanted our food prepared.  If I don't eat cheese, sour cream, tortillas, refried beans but want extra protein and veggies, make it plain and clear (come on now, how hard is that??), and since I hold so many things I'm not paying extra for what I want.  I'm polite, mannerly but I'm the customer.  If you want my business you'll do what you can to accommodate me needing to be dairy/gluten free.  These aren't foreign situations that they don't have to deal with on a regular business.  I shouldn't have to ask for the manager for the staff to figure it out!  if I could give zero stars, I would, yes that bad!!
