We had not been to PL for over 10 years and tried it again a few months ago on a Sunday morning and were their first customers,,,it was clean...the food was fresh...and very good...could not wait to come back...but went on a long summer vacation and was just able to return a few evenings ago....the front was dirty from ground up to the roof on the outside...it continued inside with trash all over the place...and one single man customer (so they were not busy and it was around 6pm) We ordered...the food came helter skelter...the greens were not fresh...the avocado salad had two skinny slices and did not resemble the picture...the condiment bar was beyond a MESS and not supplied and did not get cleaned or filled while we were there.  No more patrons came in until we were leaving but that man was still there and looked like he was not leaving until he consumes all the salsa on the condiment bar.  I am sooo disappointed...it was so good the first time.
