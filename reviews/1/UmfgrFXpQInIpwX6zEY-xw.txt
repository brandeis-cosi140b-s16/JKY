Disgruntled and uninterested is the best description I can give to the services provided by the bartender/waitress at this location of Garcia's.  I was sadly disappointed.   Maybe you'll be more fortunate if you come at a different time.  I showed up for happy hour on a Tuesday at 3pm.  The food was decent but not good enough to overshadow the unhappy, unfriendly server.
