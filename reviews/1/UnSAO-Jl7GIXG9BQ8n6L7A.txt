Quesadilla, located on the 5th floor of the Imperial Palace Hotel & Casino, is nothing more than spectacular that say, an average Hooters. They're almost the same kind of restaurant too. Both have women wearing very little waiting on you with the emphasis on cleavage, but very little emphasis on making the food remotely pleasing. Unless you have some kind of voucher that gives you free food from here or severely discounted food, at least, then you should probably check out places at different hotels. There's a lot of better options, I'm hearing. 

Unfortunately, I paid for everything. As I was signing the bill, the waitress moves down to expose her cleavage some more. I understand that this is the vibe of the restaurant but wow, I almost wanted to take away some of the tip that I was about to write in. They weren't the most flattering tatas in the first place. Definitely not sexy, I'm sorry. Anyhow, I bought the half chicken entree; I forgot the name of it but it has some fancy name, and the baja shrimp quesadilla. Neither of them had any real distinct flavor, tasting as severely bland as the restaurant's name.
