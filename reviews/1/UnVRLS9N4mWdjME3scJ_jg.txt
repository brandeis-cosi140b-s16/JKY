PORTION SIZE!

I just left Some Burros thoroughly disappointed.  I placed a telephone order for a bean and cheese burrito with no issues and advised my total would be $4.46.  My order was completed in ten minutes as promised.  The burrito was about the size of a 99 cent FROZEN BURRITO from the grocery store.  I have seen larger burritos at Taco Bell.

There are many other options in the area.  Go somewhere else and don't get ripped off.
