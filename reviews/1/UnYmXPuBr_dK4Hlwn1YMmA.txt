The food was okay, so what would be a 3 star-ish review, was turned into a 1 star review by the non-existent, terrible service. Five of six people sat with empty water glasses for over 20 minutes. The waitress eventually brought two glasses of water to the table and just ignored the other three people who had empty glasses for another 10-15 minutes until she finally came back to the table, and even then we had to bring it to her attention.
