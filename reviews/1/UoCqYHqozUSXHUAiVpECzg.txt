I just moved here about a month ago and me and a friend decided to try out old pueblo .. being a mexican i had pretty high expectations and yup when we got our carne asada plate we were very disappointed.. the meat still had blood on it. The meat was very tough and it was served with a bunch of chile and tomato hardly any meat thankfully though since it waas still oozing out blood.. the only good thing was the sprite we drank.. customer service was great though.. but it deserves no stars .. sorry
