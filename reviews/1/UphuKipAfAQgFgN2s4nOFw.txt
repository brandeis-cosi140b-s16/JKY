My family of 4 went into Lalo's and will NEVER go again! The food was tasteless, the salsa was decent, but I could buy the salsa from any supermarket around, and when I went in, there were 4 other tables there, and from start to finish we spent about 1 hour and 45 minutes there mainly waiting for our food. Keep in mind, my husband and I ordered just about the same thing and my children got one order of chicken fingers and fries. There was one server (who wasn't the friendliest person) and I'm assuming one chef. When we received our food it was supposed to come with guacamole and pico de gallo and came with neither. The only "pico" I got was a bed of lettuce with about 10 cubed tomatoes on top. The main dish was carne asada and it had ZERO flavor, Spanish rice was no different, and the refried beans you can taste it came straight from a can. On top of everything it was expensive for the quality. My husband and I frequent quite a bit of Mexican food restaurants and this is not even in the ballpark of being decent. There was a funny part in the menu that did say "para los gringos" which means "for the white people" with a list of burgers and fries. I found it funny, but I'm sure it's bound to offend someone. Worst restaurant I've ever eaten at.
