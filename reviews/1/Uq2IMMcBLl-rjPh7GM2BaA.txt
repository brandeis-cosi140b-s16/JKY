This location has gone downhill quickly.  After jacking up their prices substantially a few months ago, they apparently decided at the same time to just do away with service.

Cruised up to the drive through at 5:30 PM yesterday (a Saturday) and the place was deserted.  I've noticed in recent months there are rarely cars in the parking lot and almost never any cars in the drive through when I drive by... makes you wonder how much longer this location will be in business, but after my experience yesterday, I can certainly see why people are avoiding this place.

I ordered a half order of super nachos with shredded chicken and a bean burrito with cheese and onions.  I was charged an extra 50 cents for the onions and the drive through person repeated the entire order over the loudspeaker correctly (even though I had to repeat it three times for some reason).  The receipt also showed the order exactly as I had indicated.  

Instead of super nachos with shredded chicken, I got super nachos with carne asada.  My bean and cheese burrito came with NO onions.  Even though I paid 50 cents extra for them.  Both parts of my order were incorrect.  How hard is it when there are no other customers, inside or in the drive through, to get the order right for one person?  In addition, I was made to wait about 5 minutes at the drive through window after ordering before I was even acknowledged. 

I might (MIGHT) have given a pass had this been the first time, but the exact same thing happened a few months ago with the nachos. They gave me carne asada instead of shredded chicken. They simply don't care.  And their prices are no longer affordable for the quality of food you get.  Go to one of the dozens of other establishments that serve varieties of Mexican food in the area.  This one doesn't earn your business.
