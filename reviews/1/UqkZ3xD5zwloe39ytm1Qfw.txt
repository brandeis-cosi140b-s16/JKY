I was there last week with a group of friends for a birthday.  The service was very, very slow.  We ordered a pitcher of margarita's.  It wasn't until after we ordered it we noticed that there was no price on the menu.  We figured how expensive can it be for a station casino restaurant.  The food was OK, nothing special.  When we got the bill we almost died, the price for a pitcher of mediocre margaritas was $40.00 we had ordered 2 pitcher's is and was OUTRAGEOUS.  The last pitcher that was brought out was all ice hardly any liquid in it.  We had to ask the waitress to add more liquid to the pitcher.  To top it all off we had half a pitcher left and who would leave it.  The waitress brought out clear to go cups to take it out.  You CAN'T take out alcohol and we told her this.  She then brought us cups that were not clear.  What a total rip off. When asked why there was no price on the menu she just looked blank (like a deer in the headlights).  I'll never go there again.  If I am to pay that much for a pitcher of margarita's I'll go somewhere a lot nice than this dump.
