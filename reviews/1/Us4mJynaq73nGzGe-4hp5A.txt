Worst Serranos location. Will never go back. Horrible service, cold food, and terrible customer service by the management. 

Took over an hour to get our food. Food came out cold, some of it was luke warm, but most was cold. The server argued that it couldn't be cold and walked away. Manager came over and said we are taking care of your meal and walked away. Didnt even offer to fix it. The six of us would have preferred to pay for a hot meal. We sat at the table for another hour eating and waiting for any acknowledgment and got none. 

There are plenty of other much better restaurants out there. I suggest that you try another location or another resaurant all together. Serranos is not worth it to me anymore. They have been going downhill for years.
