On the Border is to Mexican Food as tofurkey is to turkey... it's gross... seriously, don't come here. Go to Taco Bell... or Del Taco.


Are you still reading this? Ok, well, I must admit... my expectations were a bit higher than they were received. One the Border is honestly like a "Mexican" Applebee's... no seriously, it's very very generic.
We had chips and salsa, also known as half taco shells from "The Bell." They were chewy and weird... but tasted ok if you could get past the texture.
We also ordered the stacked nachos... don't do this. Nothing about these nachos were stacked... as the bottom was dry and baron. The chicken flautas left nothing to be desired... they were boring and a bit dry.

All in all, icky food... like, super icky. Tasteless and about as close to "Mexican Food" as Hot Pockets are to Italian Food. Word of advice, don't do this... don't come here if you want good food.
The only reason for my "uno" star is because our server was great. Very attentive and friendly... just wish he would have talked us out of ordering more than just booze.
