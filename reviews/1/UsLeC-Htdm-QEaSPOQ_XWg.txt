Came in and ordered a quesadilla and a burrito. 45 mins later and other guest getting their food first we asked the lady why it took so long for our food to come out and she just said I'm sorry, the cook I noticed the whole time was just taking his time and when she asked him about our order he just shrugged. I really don't appreciate having our time wasted waiting for an order that wasn't even made. We got our money back and just left. If I didn't think he'd spit in our food I would've asked for our meal to be free but I was just upset and hangry and was over it. Terrible experience. The cashier lady had good customer service, this was all the cooks fault. He literally skipped our order and made everybody else's. So disappointed because I love Roberto's, I never want to go to this location again despite it being down the street from our house. If I could out zero stars I would.
