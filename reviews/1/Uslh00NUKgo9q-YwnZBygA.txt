Went to this joint while passing through...how can you get Mexican food SOOOOO wrong?!?!  This place absolutely sucks...the place is huge but run-down...there is nothing authentic about this place...my kids and I absolutely hated this place...very, very, very disappointed...no wonder the place was absolutely empty...I think this place used to be a Carl's Jr., it has the same set up as the ones built in the 80's...I wish it was STILL a Carl's Jr., I would at least have had a decent meal...avoid this place at ALL costs...
