We heard a lot about this place and were excited to try it but once we were there we couldn't wait to leave. I don't like very spicy food and everything on the menu had a chili pepper next to the name. There were maybe two items without the chili pepper. We ordered anyway because my boyfriend loves spicy food and we were already seated. My blue corn? tamale was inedible, my rice was a mix of newly cooked and old, dry, hard rice as is they scraped it off an old pan and mixed it in with the new. The carne adovada was nondescript. We left most of our food on our plates and still left with heartburn from the overbearing spice.
