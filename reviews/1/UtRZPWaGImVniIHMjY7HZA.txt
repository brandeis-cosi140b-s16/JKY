I actually did like Las Glorias on occasion.  Unfortunately, I got burnt on the handle of the fajitas (don't they know its hot before they put it down right under you).  Had a scar on my arm for months. No apology, no ice pack-nothing.  If that wasn't bad enough-they accused me of skipping on the bill that night and then charged me for both times the next time I came in, even though I didn't sign the second charge.  Owner/manager is a real piece of work. Not going back
