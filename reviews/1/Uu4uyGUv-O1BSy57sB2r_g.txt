I only been to Verde only one time and it looks like it will be the only time I walked thru its doors.   The staff was observant and showed patience as I discovered their menu.  I never thought I can take so much time deciding what to get from a limited menu.  I believed there was like 5 combinations to choose from, well of course, with rice and beans.  I got the red chill beef.  This plate was looking good when I got it, until I put it in my mouth.  The burro was like ugh.  The beef was stale and they compromise by over seasoning it.  I couldn't understand they would waste an awesome tortilla on this dish. The rice and beans were just okay.
  
Their price I would say is slightly over priced (under $10) only because I felt so unsatisfied.
  
One thing that I really liked is they make their tortillas on site.

I Left unimpressed, unsatisfied and frustrated with their "white people's" Mexican food.
