What a disappointment!  Walked in and the decor is nice and place  was clean.  Figured we would try the table side guacamole since people were saying it was good.  It's ok, but nothing special besides the fact that it's made table side.  Ordered the carnitas con chile verde. Carnitas were far from a delicious dish. Just because you throw salsa  on some meat, warm it up and lather the meat with it does not mean you know what your doing .   Tried the enchiladas and it's hard to screw those up.  So they were ok.  Rice was good and beans not to shabby.  tortillas were not good, not that they have to be home made , but at least heat them up correctly.  Defiantly needs help with at least these two dishes. I would like to say I might give it another chance , but as of now I don't think I would go back.  The chips were at least good and served warm.  The red sauce served with chips was basically bad tomato puree or ketchup. The green salsa however was the only thing out of everything that was delicious.   Not only is this as of now in my opinion and from what I tasted far from authentic it is in need of a lot of help.  If you want a good meal this is not the place. If you want chips and amazing avocado salsa with your chips then come here !
