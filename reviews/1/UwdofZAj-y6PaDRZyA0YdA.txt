Unfortunately it is impossible to give a lower rating. We did not try the food because the restaurant was so hot we had to leave. The AC was broken and apparently has been broken for some time, which made the restaurant extremely uncomfortable. The staff was very attentive and very apologetic but it just couldn't make up for the fact that the restaurant is essentially a hot box with no AC.
