Went here for lunch today as the line for Chipotle (which is across the street) was out the door and I didn't have time to wait.  It was roughly 12:45 and there were maybe 2 other tables of people at ATS. Ordered a regular carne asada burrito with "hot" salsa. Here is where the experience turned south.  The burrito came out within 5 minutes and it was much smaller than I was expecting given that with tax it was close to $7. The "hot" salsa was mild at best and the burrito was not even remotely warm. It was also probably the worst tasting carne asada burrito I've ever had (and i love me a carne asada burrito!). I love the other ATS locations but there is something off about this location.    I would have been better off at Taco Bell or waiting in line at chipotle.  Hell, if i want cold lunch i would have been better off at Subway. Do yourself a favor and do not waste your money or calories eating here. :(.
