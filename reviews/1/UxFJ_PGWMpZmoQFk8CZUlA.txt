It makes me so sad to say this but I have given up on you Juliobertos.

I ordered my last bean and cheese burrito from there yesterday and was SHOCKED when I found what resembled to be a PUBIC HAIR in the spillage coming out of the bottom of my burrito.

So disgusting, I am never going back. I used to eat there ALL THE TIME too. Makes me shiver to think what else I could've eaten there before.
