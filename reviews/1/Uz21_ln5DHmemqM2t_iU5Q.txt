By far the worst Mexican I have ever had and Mex is my staple. Sat down to a filthy fork on the napkin.  We both ordered the chili relleno ala carte.  When they brought it it looked like a platter of soup along with "tortillas" that looked more like greasy large pancakes. My first bite was so hot I could not feel my lips.  The  unskilled waiter came over and I told him my delema, his response was the menu said it was hot (which it didn't)  I told him neither one of us could eat it and he said that everything on their menu was super hot including a machaca taco.   I again told him we could not eat this fire on our plate so he proceeded to produce the bill charging us full price for everything even tho neither one of us had a full bite of food.   I have never experienced anything like it. Great customer service!  By the looks of the limited lunch crowd I don't think we are alone on the opinion of Los Dos.
