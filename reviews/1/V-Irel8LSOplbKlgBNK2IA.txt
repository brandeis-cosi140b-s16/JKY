I've been to Cucos once before. At that time it was decent, nothing special but when I went back tonight I was very disappointed, as were my two friends that were with me. My friend and I both ordered combo meals which included a cheese quesadilla, a chicken "enchilada", and something that was supposed to be refried beans. The entire meal was very small for the cost. The quesadilla was just a tortilla made with shredded mozzarella cheese, not even Mexican cheese and no spices or anything. Extremely bland. The enchilada was quite bad as well. No flavor whatsoever. The refried beans were extremely watery and as weird as it sounds, they had a coffee taste and my friend agrees. I'm not one to write reviews, and am usually very happy with meals at restaurants but this was not good. My other friend ordered a taco salad and said it was okay but nothing special. The service wasn't wonderful either. Our waiter didn't seem all that friendly, never asked of we needed more chips or water, and forgot a side of sour cream we had ordered. I would not recommend this restaurant. It's a waste of money.
