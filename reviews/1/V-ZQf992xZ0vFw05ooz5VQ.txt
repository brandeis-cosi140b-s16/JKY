This place is awful. They are a tequila bar but don't even offer a cocktail list. They don't even list the price of the house margarita ("like 11 and change or something" when i asked the bartender) in the menu. The food is terrible. This is the only bar in terminal 3. I suggest you get a camomile as a nightcap when trapped in this abysmal terminal.
