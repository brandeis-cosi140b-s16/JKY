The service was absolutely awful. We arrived with only one other family in the restaurant. We ordered and nearly an hour later we where told they ran out of one of our dishes and we would need to place another order. They also neglected to bring out one of our dishes and still had the audacity to charge us. 
I personally ordered the chefs specialty, what I got was dried up (and really dry "beef jerky" esque) skirt steak. Thrown atop a wilted pile of lettuce, the steak has me sweating and sick to my stomach. I hate writing a bad review for a place, 4 years ago I would have given them 5 stars. But the service and quality of food was so poor, I made an account just to voice my experience today. Hopefully this will be seen by the management, please get back to your roots. I really used to enjoy quality Hispanic food here.
