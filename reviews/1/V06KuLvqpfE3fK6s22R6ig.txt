My in-laws recommended that we try this place. If you've read some of of my other reviews, you may know that my wife is pregnant and is craving authentic Mexican food. We went there with our son and ordered a cheese crisp and bean dip as appetizers. The beans tasted different to me so I didn't eat it. We finished our food and ordered sopapillas for dessert. As soon as the dessert arrived, my kid began to vomit. Being that my wife is pregnant, she threw up as well . The waitres ran to get some napkins for us and was amazing in making sure my kid was ok. While my wife and the kid were in the bathroom cleaning up, the manager approached me and stated that there was a lot of food today as there was a wedding party tonight and that he wasn't the first person to throw up. The waitress brought over a cup of water to go and a different waitress brought me our check. I left a 30% tip for the waitress as her service was great. I couldn't have asked for more from her. I am giving this place a 1 star rating because I found it unprofessional for the manager to tell me that he wasn't the first person to throw up and that it could have been because they prepped a lot of food for a wedding party. Overall, I didn't see myself coming back.
