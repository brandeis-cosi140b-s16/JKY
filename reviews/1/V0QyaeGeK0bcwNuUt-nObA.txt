Horrible service, very dissatisfied. The company tries to upsell you on every thing they can get you to pay for. Chicken quesadillas don't come with salsa unless you want to dish out an extra two dollars. The woman working the register was noticeably bored and rude. Cheap meat. Unsatisfactory food. Someone needs to start managing this place or watch the business die.
