Waited for 20mins on grill chicken , my friend finish his meal and the chicken was never ready , I was told it would take like 10mins . I got up after 10mins and told me another 5mins . I waited and nothin . I left across the street to aloha kitchen . Friendlier people and cleaner restaurant . Very disappointed , I was looking forward for my chicken salad .
