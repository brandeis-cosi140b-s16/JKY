Overpriced Bad food, bad service, bad attitudes. The restaurant is very dark and the decor is very bad. The relleno was very soft and mushy which made a soggy mess on the plate. Ordered a taco al a carte and requested that they put a little more cheese and the waiter totally ignored my request. They charge for everything extra. What ever happened to good service? They could do so much better if they wanted to. I will never go back again I gave Los Dos uno Dos thres chances.
