Just went there with my family. Sylvia's used to be such a nice place. Wasn't spectacular, but it was reliably good. The service tonight was sub-par, and we got charged for every little thing. If you want the fried flour tortilla chips that used to be free as part of the salsa bar that they no longer have, that will cost you $3. Margarita pitchers are $25. They have a salad bar that is free with an order, however it is the saddest salad bar I've ever seen. The high point was when a giant insect started crawling up my leg. At first I thought it was a roach, but thankfully upon closer inspection it turned out to be a huge beetle.

The place has gone downhill since it changed to a full-service restaurant. It is a shame, and unfortunately we will probably never go back.
