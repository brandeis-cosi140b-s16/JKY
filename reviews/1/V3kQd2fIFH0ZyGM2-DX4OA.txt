You let me down, Yelp!

For the first time ever, Yelp has been way off on this one. Like some of the other reviewers, I too am obsessed with Upward Projects restaurants. Which was why I was even more excited to see this new place getting great Yelp reviews. And as we walked in, the ambiance got my hopes even higher. Here's why we are never going back:

-Over 30 minute wait, and they don't serve anything but chips and salsa in the cocktail area. It was even more frustrating to see empty tables inside during the entire duration of our wait. Poor service on the patio.

-When we were seated, no one greeted us for 5-10 minutes. Very odd, a server finally came up and asked if we were "still doing alright?" Umm since we've been here for over 45 minutes, were ready to order. 

-Food came up quick but was mediocre at best. A beer I ordered when the food arrived wasn't brought until everyone was done eating. Attitude from the waitress when I sent it back. 

-At some point during our meal, a waiter approached us confirming he had given the card back from our tab on the patio. We told him he hadn't so he said he would look for it.

-While waiting for our bill, at least 4 people asked us if we wanted more chips and salsa. No, but wed like the bill! It finally came but the waitress didn't even make eye contact so we couldn't tell her they still had our card!!! Another 5-10 minutes we finally flag down another server and ask her to find our card. She brings it and takes it with the bill. Several minutes later we see her arranging a table for a large party and wonder where she put our bill. Then our waitress comes and asks where the bill is, and as were pointing out the other server a 3rd server drops it off. This place is certainly some kind of ride! What a mess. Won't be going back.
