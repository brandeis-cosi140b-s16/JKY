I arrived at this Taco Bell at noon.   Placed my order at 12:13pm and got my food at 12:33.  I came to try the new cool ranch taco and received  regular Doritos taco.   When I tried to tell the man (he looked like the manager) who have me my food he said "this looks like yours".  I said, "I ordered the cool ranch taco box".  He replied, "you want a box?".  I said forget it and walked away. When I sat down to eat my food, it seemed as though it had been sitting for awhile.  The bottoms of the tacos were soggy and falling apart and the food was cold.  Don't get me wrong, I have realistic expectations for fast food at Taco Bell but this was pretty horrible even by those standards.
