Our last time here! We are Gold Canyon residents and want to support local businesses. We used to come here but stopped because of inconsistency.  Friends said they improved. First time back about a year ago wasn't bad, but the next two times the enchilada sauce was like colored water and had no taste!  So this time I tried the tamale - dry seemed like a few days old. Food was hardly warm. My husband had the steak -- gave me a bite and it was nasty!  Our friend ordered the guac. and my husband thought it tasted bad so didn't eat it. Turns our all three of them are sick this morning. He gave them some of his steak and they all ate it. I thought it was rancid! And maybe it was. 
That's it for De La Cruz!!!
