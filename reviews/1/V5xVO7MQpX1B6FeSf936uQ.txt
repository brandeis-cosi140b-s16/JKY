Loco Patron should be renamed Bebido (Drunk) Patron (Boss). This place needs a "BAR RESCUE" we left after the self admitted owner stated he was drunk and wanted to get F'ed up doing shots with patrons. The customer service is terrible at best, the cook likes to wipe his hands on his pants as he prepares food while not wearing gloves, the chips are stale, the beer is room temp. I was absolutely convinced we were on a episode of "Bar Rescue" and the cameras were going to come out and shut this place down! No luck, as my stomach started to gurgle after eating the chips and salsa I had to race home to sit on the porcelain throne!
You got me good Loco Patron!!!!
