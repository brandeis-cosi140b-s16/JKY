Yes I know its almost taboo to review a fast food place, but when a yelper gets annoyed, she's gonna yelp.  Loud.  I worked and ran errands from early morning to almost 3 pm, without breakfast or lunch on Sunday.  I figured I need something right now, so Taco Bell it was (plus I like to jack some extra fire sauce packets for my kitchen drawer---taco night 
is coming up ;-D  Anyway, I walked in and the music is just blaring, I mean sure Im not 18 anymore and certain volume levels bother me now but this was deafening!  So I shout out my order to the very arrogant and haughty register boy who was busy admiring the glossy paint on his nails.  

Apparently, they dont like non-meat eaters because they charged me .50 extra for my simple dollar menu burrito.  My only crime was asking for the meat to be replaced with beans.  It was also supposed to have 5 layers of sauce, cheese, etc, etc.  Mine roughly had 2 layers: one was beans one was cheese..........so I shouldve just ordered the bean and cheese right?  Why Im annoyed is because they were capable of messing up a simple, no-hassle order so royally.  I mean I just wanted a burrito for my hungry stomach (yes, and the fire sauce packets too)
