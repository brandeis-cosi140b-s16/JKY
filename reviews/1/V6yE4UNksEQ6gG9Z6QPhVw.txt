I don't know why this place is still in business. When I prefer taco bell over a Mexican restaurant, that's bad. The enchilada sauce tastes (and I suspect it is) like canned enchilada sauce from the grocery store that I use to make enchiladas at home. Unacceptable.  Their spicy food has way too much spice without the flavor. I love spicy hot food but flavor is what makes the spiciness good. The service is fine but my goodness...you're a restaurant! If I wanted amateur Mexican food which requires store bought canned goods, I will buy it myself and make it at home. Period. This restaurant was definitely a waste of money and I didn't even finish my food it was so bad.
