WARNING: This is the worst chipotle ever. I went in tonight at 9:30pm. The smell was repulsive. I should have taken it as a sign and gone else where. I should also mention that right before he toasted my tortilla he used another tortilla to wipe off the press. Once again, that should have made me rethink my decision.  Instead, since I was very hungry, I decided to get my normal order to go. I live within 1/4 mile. When I opened my bowl, EVERYTHING inside was completely cold, honestly frigid including the chicken and rice (mind you, I had barely any sour cream or cheese). I have been other times and disliked my meal but this was the worst. It was inedible. 

I just find myself questioning how this specific store can ruin something that I like so much and eat so frequently. 

Do not eat here. Go to the 101 on indian bend. Their staff is great. Their food is 10x better.
