DONT COME HERE!

I stopped by to pick up some mexican sweet bread this past sunday. WORST MISTAKE.
got maybe around 10 pieces of bread MAX, and i asked if they had green chicken tamales and she said let me check went to the back and then yelled from the door asking how many i wanted i said 6 and she says okay rings them up and then says oh but by the way they are pork not chicken..... um okay i asked for chicken so i said nevermind i can't eat pork i was looking for chicken...

rings me up tells me the total is $10 and some change. i had her my debit card and she swipes it and gives me the reciept and says oh we also charge 50 cents for debit transactions..... well thanks i guess you could of let me know before to see if i had cash.

i check my bank account monday moring and they charges me $18 and cents. WTF!!! i gave them a call and said the owner would call me back.... nothing! i called a few times after that and nothing. its now wednesday and still havent heard back....

WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GO SOMEWHERE ELSE OR THEY WILL RIP YOU OFF!!!
