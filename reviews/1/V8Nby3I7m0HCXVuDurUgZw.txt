Wow. Okay, so I'm an asu student, and frequently I go to the local eating establishments when I'm here. Now I see myself as a foodie, often branching out from name brands and trying most of the local food places around here. 

And let me tell you, this place is sub par at best. 

The menu is limited, most of the meats on the menu ranging from beef to, well, beef. As it was my first time here, I got the beef tacos with guac with a canned coke. Prices were average, but no receipt was provided or even asked. The attitude of the cashier was mediocre, mostly with a face like he didn't want to be here seeing how he was frequently walking back to the tv, even answering his phone and holding a conversation while providing my change.

The food itself was presented average for a traditional Mexican place. Two tacos, with meat, guac, lettuce, and diced tomatoes (I had requested no cheese) with a side of their red salsa. After the first bite, it was down hill and disappointing. The meat was poorly seasoned (which was a disappointment seeing how it's the only meat featured and not written on the whiteboard), the guac tasted like mashed avocados with no flavor, and the lettuce and tomatoes mushy and easily disposed and forgotten. Their red salsa was tasteless - not spicy or savory, tasting vaguely like tobacco briefly before disappearing all together. 

Honesty, with places like bowl of greens right next to this place, whose flavor and presentation exceeds here by ten folds , you're better off just going there.
