We took our kids to see the Christmas lights and, against my better judgement, ate here for dinner. We waited an hour for our food (I think there was only 1 waitress so I felt bad for her and gave her a pass), got the wrong order (again, gave her a pass even though she didn't fix it or give us a discount) but the icing on the cake is when me and my husband got horrible food poisoning. Fun times! I hope the cooks get chile in their eyes for the rest of eternity.
