When we went there, it was crowded,  so we put our name on the list.   They kept calling names, but not ours, 25 minutes later, we walked up to check, they had crossed our name off, like we had been seated, but we were never called. The person standing there said, oh I can seat you right now. No, I'm sorry, or anything. Okay, so we got a table, it didn't get better. Waiter came after 10 minutes, No water was offered. He took our order, and turned to walk away, we had to tell him wait, can we get a drink? No salt\pepper on the table. 
The salsa was not good. I make better salsa at home.  
I had tamale plate, I will say, it was very good. My husband had Chicken enchiladas, he said they were good, but Chili's are better.
The noise was way over the top, it's definitely not a place to go and relax after a long work day. We went once to the old location, 8 years ago, we didn't go back, it wasn't good. But, gave the Gilbert location a try, won't go back. 
We'll keep going to La Parrilla Suiza, they have never disappointed us in 8 years.
Sorry to say, but your Hostess people are incompetent.
