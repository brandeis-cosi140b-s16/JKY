What a disaster from start to finish. 

#1, it took forever to get our initial drink order. 

#2 Had to literally yell in the waitress' ear just to order my food because it was so damn loud in front of the stage.

#3 The annoying host guy(the Spanish or black guy with the mic) makes us all get up and dance promising the whole place free shots but says whoever is not standing has to buy everyone a shot. Of course, we all get up and do our ridiculous shimmy and low and behold when it's all done NOBODY GETS FREE SHOTS as promised. WTF am I asked to dance for if I'm not getting a shot for free like promised? Joke.

#4, The food was overpriced and not that good. The chips were terrible and the salsa wasn't much better. The blackened chicken burger was OKAY but certainly not worth the $18 they charge for it. The sweet potato fries were cold and overcooked.

#5, It took FOREVER to hunt down the waitress to come give me the check and then another lifetime for her to come back and run my card so I could get the hell out of there before the next shimmy-fest started. Good gawd, what a DISASTER!!!!!!

Terrible, terrible, terrible.
