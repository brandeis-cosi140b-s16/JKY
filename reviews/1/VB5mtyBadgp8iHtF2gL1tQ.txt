PROS: Decor is warm and pleasant and the blended margaritas are pretty good.  Fried ice cream dessert was yummy.

CONS: The food. I selected the Chef's Supreme Combo, which came with a chicken chili relleno, seafood enchilada and a carnitas taco with the standard rice and beans. I assumed these dishes were the chef's specialties, due to the name of the plate, but apparently the chef took the night off.  The relleno was a combo of dry chicken inside a dry coating that tasted like a dry biscuit with no cheese and very little sauce which was also bland. The seafood enchilada was supposed to have shrimp, crab and orange roughy, but it only had shrimp and was boooooring with very little sauce and no cheese. The carnitas taco was the least offensive, but the carnitas was also very dry and didn't have much flavor on its own. The rice and beans were bland and boring. I didn't realize that Mexican food could get this dull. I even had to ask for more salsa so I could counteract the dryness enough to get the food down.  My date had the chicken/steak fajitas, which he said were just OK.

Another negative ... Only 1/3 of the glass was rimmed with salt on both of our margaritas, so I know it was done on purpose.  I suppose its an attempt to save money, but it just came off as shoddy service.

Bottom Line: Not at all impressed and I won't be giving it another chance.
