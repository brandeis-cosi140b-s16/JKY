Six years ago Filibertos were springing up everywhere. They were monopolizing the fast food mexican trade and putting all the polibertos, rolibertos, and Humberto's out of business, or at least that was the game plan. Today I am back in AZ and am saddened to see how much of a big player filibertos has become. With their streamlined business model, professionally designed identity and logo, and their official website, they have turned a personal relationship between taqueria and taco eaters into a perverted faceless business venture. Give me back my taco truck on the side of the road, not this futuristic look into the big taco machine. All conspiracy aside, the experience true taco lovers were accustomed to is all but dead, the flavors have become bland and the exchange is no different than driving Through a jack in the box or del taco. Socorro and Conchita are no longer hanging out the drive through window yelling at you in Spanish, the cook isn't also the owners cousin and landscaper on the weekends. But worst of all the Horchata is watered down. There are a few things I can look the other way for, but watered down Horchata is just not one of them. People, just because a restaurant looks new and clean and their drive through speakers work doesn't mean they are up to par. What are you willing to sacrifice for a uniform big box feel and convenience? You aren't getting lower prices, you are only getting lowered standards when it comes to taste. I don't need my drive through lady to speak perfect English and I don't need for the cook to wear a shirt when he's frying the meat, what I do need is true authentic flavor, nothing can ever come before that.
