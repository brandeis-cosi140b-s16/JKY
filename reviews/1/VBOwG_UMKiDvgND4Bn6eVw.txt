This place really does suck!

It's kind of pointless having 2 sides to cook food on and you're only operating off of one with only one person working the line. Then on top of that because you're running one line with one person everything piles up and it takes forever to get your food when it should only take a few minutes at the most. Even better is the fact that they constantly mess up the orders over and over again. I mean sometimes I just want Taco Bell and sadly this is the closest one around my house unless I want to drive forever down the road. 

To top it off the sanitary in this place is horrible!! Constantly food all over the floor and your feet stick to it. Yet it never really looks like anyone cares to clean. Because of that I'm scared to even go into the bathrooms. 

If there was another Taco Bell around Id never go to this one again.
