Terrible service  and one of the worst dining experience . Our servers didn't seem to care or were interested in taking care of our large group of 6 adults 4 teens. The soup were served without spoons took a good 15 mins to get the spoons by which time the soup was cold. Gauc was made table side and had no flavor. Over priced and lousy service ruined a great family get together during the holidays. Wouldn't recommend to anyone. 2 stars for good -10 for service and attitude! !
