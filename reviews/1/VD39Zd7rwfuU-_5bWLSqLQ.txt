At first I was excited about trying this place. Unfortunately I will never be back. Slow service. Poor guest service by manager as I asked to speak with her and instead got ignored and Server came back with a check discounted telling me the manager was in the phone. Absolute BS!!!! This is a poorly run establishment. Nachos were great but the margaritas were weak! Do long Nacho Daddy. You lost guests that live less tan 1 mile Away!
