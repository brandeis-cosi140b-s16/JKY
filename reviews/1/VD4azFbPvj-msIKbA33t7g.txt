Not sure where to start. Poor service, food and drinks.

My wife and I went there today for lunch. Our waiter made our cocktails because "the bartender sucks." Well, the waiter sucked at making ours too. At a slow time (like 3pm), tables were messy and service was slow. 

Their salsa is like spicy, smoky ketchup. I had the spinach enchiladas and they were bland. My wife had the fish tacos and I think the fish was kids' fish sticks. 

Blue Agave is that bad. Don't waste your time.
