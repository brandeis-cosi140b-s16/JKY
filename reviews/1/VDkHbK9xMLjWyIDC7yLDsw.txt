I love the food here and frequent Rita's for lunch. Eight of us went to happy hour and much to my surprise completely different from lunch. with 2 tables occupied we sat down and waited for our server. she came over after about 20 minutes, we ordered drinks and then we waited for an hour, we then asked where our drinks were and we found out that no one on staff was old enough to serve alcohol. just a kid and what looked like her boy friend were so called working. Terrible experience and i will never go back for dinner/happy hour. This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in Phoenix, I was shocked with the terrible experience. The management must change their evening operations.
