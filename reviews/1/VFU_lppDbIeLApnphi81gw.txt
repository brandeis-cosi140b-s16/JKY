This place is a serious joke, the portion size for the price is rediculas they have portion scoopers that are tiny little itty bitty spoons. I would have to eat at least 4 of these tiny burritos to get full. This will be the last time that I ever go here. They need to close this place down. Chipotle is defiantly the place to go not here.. Save your money and time
