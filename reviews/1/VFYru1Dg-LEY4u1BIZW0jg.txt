I used to go the this restaurant, when it was a Moe's.  Moe's went out of business, and Filiberto's does what Filiberto's does.   It took over a defunct restaurant, and started selling cheap Mexican food there.  I had never eaten at a Filiberto's, or any other 'berto's in the Valley, so I begged my lunch group to go there.  Entering the restaurant, it had a rotting seafood smell.  I don't know what it was from, but it detrimental to the experience.  I ordered the red chili burro, it is my benchmark food for Mexican restaurants.  The red chili was chewy, under cooked, and lacking in flavor.  My other lunch mates did not have any better experience than I did.  This place is a definite "NO !!!" in my book, and in the minds of the other members of my lunch group.  

There are other restaurants at that strip mall.  If you find yourself there, do yourself a favor, go to Pizza Roma, or Haiku Grill, or Sami's Gyros, or Port of Subs.  They are all superior to really bad Mexican at Filiberto's.
