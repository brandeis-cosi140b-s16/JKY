I have been a fan of Los Favs for years, and recently moved close to this one here in Mesa. Tonight I was craving my all time favorite, a carne asada burrito. When I arrived, it didn't seem busy at all. When I got home to take a bite out of my burrito, I could tell that my meat had been sitting there ALL day. They didn't even bother to make it fresh. The steak pieces were hard as rock and completely cold. This was hands down the most disappointing Los Favs burrito I've ever had. You would think if they aren't busy the least they could do is give you fresh ingredients. Not sure if I will ever visit this location again. Beyond disappointed.
