This place ripped me off, they charged me $13 for a bean and cheese burrito wet (ala carte). Just beans cheese and red sauce. I know I probably should've asked the price before ordering but it typically at most restaurants it's a cheaper option. I thought that they made a mistake on our bill so I asked them about it and they seemed to think that is perfectly fine to charge that much for a not even that big burrito all by itself. Up until then the service was good though.
