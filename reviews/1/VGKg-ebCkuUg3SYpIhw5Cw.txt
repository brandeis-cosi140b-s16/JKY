Stopped here for dinner the food was below average as was the service. I would have liked to have desert but since a waitress would have been required to order it I was out of luck as she never showed again after the food was served.

After waiting forever for a check we finally went to the register and asked if we could pay. 

No tip was left which is rare for me.
