I almost never go back to a restaurant if it disappoints me the first time.  This place will not get any more of my money.  There are just way too many better options for the price, even in Surprise.  It's a little more expensive than Macayo's and not even as good.  Then there are several small Mexican restaurants in the area that are much cheaper and way better.
