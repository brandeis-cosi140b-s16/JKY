It's amazing ever time I go into this fast food establishment cleanliness is far from being existent.  First impressions go along way in all environments but when I see every other table dirty and trash cans overflowing that sends a very sound message.  I have to ask myself what is it that I don't see especially in the kitchen.  Even after complaining to the corporate office nothing has changed!  Most of the employees are young and can be seen laughing and gathering in the back room while tables are dirty, garbage cans are over flowing and ice machine is empty.  Epic fail!
