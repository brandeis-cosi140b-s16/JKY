When it comes to cleanliness I'm super strict about it, and the fact the one of the workers had his hat on the grill while he was ready to close was kind of nasty. Dandruff travels as well as hair. It could have easily flown on my burrito.  Sick. Plus I got sick from this food. My night was a nightmare!
