Where to start.. Decided to check this place out during happy hour with 4 people. Food and service was great and loved the atmosphere. HOWEVER.. We decided to take our family of 10 there for a birthday dinner last night and it was the.worse.service.everrrrr!!!!!! Don't get me wrong the food was still very good but our waitress was rude,ignored us, was lazy and had a bad attitude. Never did she tell us that only the FIRST round of chips and salsa was free and they charge every time after, then she wouldn't even bother to come back to refill our chips, salsa or water. The bus man was the one taking care of us most the night. One of our guests came late and she was aware of that and left him hanging for 10 min without coming back to get his order. And lastly, she refused to split our checks. We all were in couples and wanted it to be split per couple. She just threw down our 1 check and said "we'll get this figured out" and again left our table! We asked for an order of churros for dessert but wanted prices on them first, she said she didn't know off the top of her head but "they aren't that expensive" turns out it was near $11 for one order!!! Never bothered to tell us that and we ended up ordering 3 of them.. We tried to talk to the "manager" about how poorly our service was and he failed to even comp the churros or my brothers birthday beer that was spilled since the tables were ALLL UNEVEN! Needless to say the food was good, but paying almost $70 for fajitas, 2 tacos and churros is just ridiculous to me! There's no excuse of why she couldn't split our checks and even comped at least 1 order of churros. So disappointed!
