Although I absolutely love the chicken and great taste of everything at el pollo loco... This particular location is ALWAYS.... Out of stuff! Everything from.... Cilantro dressing to marinade for chicken to sides to actual CHICKEN!!!! How do u run out of chicken!!?!? And that has happened to me twice! The manager and owner really need to get ahold of the demand for service if they want to raise revenue... Or maybe they are ok... Just serving who they can with WHAT they have. Plus service is a joke! Most employees think it's funny that they are out of supplies! I don't ! Especially when u have already waited in their drive thru for over 20 mins to only hear.... "Sorry ..we r out of chicken AGAIN!!!
