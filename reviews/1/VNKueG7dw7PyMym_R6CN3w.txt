My first visit to La Paz was last Sunday during the panther playoff game. My friends and I were looking forward to having a good time but the service we received made it worse than the panthers losing! There were only 2 servers working so it took a whirl to get our order taken and after waiting 20 minutes for someone to acknowledge us we had to go to the bar and order there.  When the server finally came to take our orders and we had devoured out chips n salsa due to hunger he rushed us to get them. To make matters worse after 30 minutes our food did not come so we asked the server to check and he never came back and we had to take  repeated trips to the bar to get our own drinks. Another 20 minutes passed and our server reappeared saying that our order was up next. We waited another 20 minutes and the order never arrived and when we inquired we were told that the kitchen must have messed up but by then we were so upset that we told him not to bother. Let's just say we will not be returning to La Paz!
