This was a good place to eat but is going down hill fast- we where in there last Sat. for the broasted chicken-  we started with wet salad and ranch drsg that was just mayo- the sad part was the waitress knew the drsg sucked. The ice tee was straw colored water- the waitress knew that too- no flavor. We saw another couple get their order of the chicken - it was so over done it was black- so we changed our order. He hardly ate any and they left very soon. The fajita meat was over cooked and over seasoned. The management needs to really step up and train the wait staff- the one guy on the floor was annoying to say the least - I'm here to help you babe- was his catch phrase-  the waitress we had was terrible -rude and unfriendly. I won't be back.
