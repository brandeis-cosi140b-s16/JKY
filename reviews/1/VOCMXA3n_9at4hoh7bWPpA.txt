Food was absolutely terrible. It looked like a child made it. We also were missing food as well. Spent $30 worth of food...called them and asked for a refund and they put me on a long hold. Definitely will not be going back. Was my first time going there and will be the last. Luckily after talking to the staff they took care of it. Make sure you check your food at the restaurant before you leave.
