Disappointed!!!! This place used to be a great value for the price, I used to get a 3 tamale combo for 5.49, as of November 1st it is now 7.49 for a 2 tamale combo...the place is not in the nicest of neighborhoods, always some sort of questionable individual out front, but I didn't mind, good food, good value. However now with the 2 dollar increase with less food, I wont waste my time, I can find a better value without being subjected to meth heads.
