I get the same thing everytime I go to Rubios. Chicken burrito especial enchalada style with the green sauce, never red. I ordered this here for the first time. The girl had no idea what I was talking about. I had to explain it. Not only did it take forever to get my order ( and people who ordered after me got their food first) but when I finally got my food, it was wrong. Then the lady proceeded to argue with me about my burrito.  Hello, I know what I want to eat!  When she handed it back to the cook, the cook said very loudly that my cashier rung it up wrong... great! It still wasn't the right order. the chips were way over salted!! I had to put half aside due to one whole side of the chip covered entirely in salt! Don't go here!
