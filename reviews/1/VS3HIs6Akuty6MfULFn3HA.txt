If I had the option to give them zero stars, I would do it in a heartbeat. Their food is great. The last time I was there, the girls were very nice. I just left there not even ten minutes ago. The girl there had a horrible, bitch of an attitude. She made me not want to go back. I'm not sorry for my French, nor am I sorry for interrupting her session on her phone. And when she took our order, she was very very unpleasant. If you don't want to be there, LEAVE! People like her ruin my experience at any restaurant.  So I won't be giving them another dime. I'll be sure to let people not go there either.
