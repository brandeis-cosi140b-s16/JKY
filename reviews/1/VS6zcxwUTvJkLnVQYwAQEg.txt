They have terrible customer service, specially with their walk-ins. They will Not sell any single orders right now, so save your trip going over there. You have to pre order 2-3weeks in advance. I went there to taste them with my daughter so I could see how good they were before I ordered them. However, I practically had to beg them for 2-3 tamales to buy and eat right there since I had driven all the way from Chandler, but the greedy manager only gave us 1.  They took the menu down and wouldn't sell to anyone. I wouldn't have ordered from them anyway, they were very undercooked and lacked flavor (good thing I got to try them). They were all in such a rush to make them, I guess. I did order mine from a Phoenix place, but just a bit more expensive and lthey were more delicious. To the people who don't know, if you do preorder and don't pick up in time they will sell them to someone else.  They are rude over the phone if they answer, but when I was there they were just letting it ring and ring. How are the customers going to make changes to their orders or know that they're not accepting walk ins if they don't answer the phone!!!
