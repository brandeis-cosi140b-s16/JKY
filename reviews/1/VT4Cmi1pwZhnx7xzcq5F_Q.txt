Went to dinner here at the chandler location tonight and was served curdled sour cream that tasted like rotten sour milk. 3 of my family members ate a few bites and started talking about how it tasted and that it was bad. When brought to the servers attention he went in the back area and came out saying it was a brand new container. We then asked for the manager whom wanted to argue for 15mins about how it was not bad sour cream, but seasoned and garlic in it. At this point my sons stomach was cramping and we had all lost our appetites as we sifted curds out of this "fresh, brand new" sour cream. The manager wouldn't eat it herself in our presence. As the manager wanted to debate that the sour cream was fine for 15mins...we all got up n walked out. Poor service and majorly poor management with bad customer service.  We have eaten at 2 other locations for many years and never have experienced what we did tonight!!
