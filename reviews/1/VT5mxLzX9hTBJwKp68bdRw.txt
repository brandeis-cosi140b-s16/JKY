Wow what a horrible experience. Right from the start I should've walked out. Our greet took over ten minutes, the server didn't know anything about their tequila menu. I didn't even know they had a separate tequila menu until over half way through my meal. Then the prices on their menu were not the prices of their tequilas. The manager dropped off the food, after twenty five minutes, said nothing and didn't even try to clear our appetizers that were obviously finished and just clutter on our table. The tacos were served in tin foil, looked terrible and were not anything worth ordering, the fish tacos looked bland and tasted the same. The steak tacos didn't look or taste like anything resembling steak, it was some sort of beef but not in any way should it have been called steak. The final straw, no pun intended, was when I took a drink out of my water and felt a weird texture on my straw. I stopped and looked at it and found lip stick caked on the outside and inside the straw, luckily I had paid my tab so I was able to quickly leave my table and go outside to scrub my mouth out with my shirt and hope that it would prevent me from contracting herpes from the incident. Pretty much the worst experience I could imagine, I know they are new and you should give them time to figure it out but I would never go back or recommend it to anyone.
