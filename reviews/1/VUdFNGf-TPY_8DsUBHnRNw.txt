Ordered a Bean and Cheese Burrito the other night in the drive-thru, didn't know I mistakingly ordered the Lard and Cheese Burrito. Three of the worst dollars I've ever spent.

As far as drive-thru Mexican places I've given a try in my day (and I've given a few too many a try), this might be the worst.

I've yet to find a really good dirty taco shop around downtown, but the Filberto's by Glam is a lot better.
