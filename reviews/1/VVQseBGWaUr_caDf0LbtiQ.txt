Make sure to check your bag before you leave. After ordering the large chips and salsa, I made it home to only find the large bag of chips. After calling and speaking to the manager. I received the response "We'll hopefully remember next time to put the salsa in the bag" No apology or offer to refund the missing items. (This is not the first time this has happened) Revo lost two regular customers today.
After completing this review, I discovered my roommates order was also messed up. Her burrito had pico de gallo which we expressed we did not want. After the second call of the night, the manager Kevin did say he will refund our burrito and salsa by promptly hanging up on me afterwards.
