Very rude. I ordered for delivery and it took them an hour and a half to get a burrito to my house. The food was cold, and when warmed up it was lacking at best. Very little flavor and bad texture. When i called to contact the manager, the owner answered and hung up on me. Just go to Dos Reales if you want good Mexican food with friendly service.
