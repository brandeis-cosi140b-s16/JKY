Came here for breakfast and it wasnt good. Got 2 egg burritos, 2 bean cheese 1/2lb burritos and bun taco. The flour torts were dry and hard one cracked while biting into and sauce squirted out all over shirt. The bean burritos were NOT 1/2 lb and hardly any cheese and the bun taco the bun was dry and hard/crumbly and the meat tasted old!!! No reason for this on the food they werent even busy!! I will second guess before coming to this location again. This is the second time this has happened and all that is said to us is OH..
