Really disappointed with today's visit. We arrived at 205 pm. There were about 10 cars in the parking lot. The hostess told us it would be a couple minutes to sit in the dining room. After 10 minutes of waiting our party of five was seated In a nearly empty dining room.  The waitress came over and took our order and said she would be back with our chips and salsa as well as our drinks. When she returned she brought a bowl of chips and a small bowl of salsa. She stated that she would bring another bowl of chips. I immediately asked her for at least two or three more bowls of salsa. She returned with another bowl of chips. She then took our order. She refilled a drink and still no additional salsa. We waited for 45 minutes for our food twenty minutes after being seated a party of two was sat within 10 minutes they had their food. They were exiting the restaurant before our food ever came. After receiving the check we ordered an additional entree to go. We feared we may be there an additional hour; however it took seven minutes. The salsa was very runny and it is usually chunky. I ate the salsa with a spoon and broke chips on top because it would run right off the chip otherwise. The waitress had an attitude. She made faces every time I asked for something including salsa, chips or drinks.  She seemed bothered by our being there. It is a shame this is my go to restaurant.
