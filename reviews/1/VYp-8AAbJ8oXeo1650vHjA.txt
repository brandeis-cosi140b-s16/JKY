Good God, I hate this place.  Its one thing to dork out about your product, but to go over-the-top with it is just unnecessary.  What I mean is, they  make their food so fucking spicy, I want to punch myself in the balls in an attempt to disperse the pain throughout my entire body rather than letting it linger in the locus of angry hornets that have nested in my mouth.

And yes, I love spicy Mexican food.  I grew up in a border town for Christo's sake.

This IS NOT Mexican food.  Its a gimmick.  Genuine Mexican food is supposed to be subtle in heat and grow throughout the dish.  One should be able to taste the layered spices and complex ingredients.  Mexican food takes a lot of effort and time to make and should be complimented by a thorough savoriness by the consumer.  

Their food must suck, but you'd never know it because it is so fully disguised by the Dos Molinos people, who drop a nuclear bomb on your head and ask you if you want to order another Dos XX.

My only compliment is the patio and the fact that they serve Mexican beer, which we all know is the cure for radioactive exposure.
