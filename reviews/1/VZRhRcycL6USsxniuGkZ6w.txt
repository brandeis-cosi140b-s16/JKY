Gross. The spanish rice is gross - bland with what appears to be canned mixed vegetables in it. The ground beef in their beef taco salad is like finally ground cat meat = low quality. 

Just low quality food that most white people, who are none the wiser as to what comprises good Mexican/Tex Mex food,  will eat. 

Today I found bug legs in my salad lettuce...later after I had left the restaurant and was munching on leftovers. 

Prices are reasonable and food is served quickly. The tall dark stocky dude that is always in there when I come in on weekdays during is not personable and kind of a an ass.
