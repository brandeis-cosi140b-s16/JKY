I go to Chipotle all the time, seriously, once a week. I am a true Chipotle addict. I have been to many Chipotles and have given the Tempe Marketplace one more than enough chances, but after so many disappointing experiences I will not be returning. Multiple times, they have ran out of guacamole and chips. The meat is always cold and chewy and the portions are very inconsistent. I have heard from multiple other people who share my same opinion that this Chipotle does not compare to others.

I LOVE CHIPOTLE, but trust me, it is worth the extra five minutes to go to the one on Mill Ave instead.
