I hate to give Chipotle a bad review because we love eating there. We have only eaten at this location twice but got sick both times. 

The first time we thought it might be a mistake, so I went back six months later because I love Chipotle (summer 2011). Got sick again. I suppose I should have called the health department. I was conflicted because the young girl was nice to my dog and gave him meat in a bowl and water. 

I eat at other Chipotles and never had a problem. Won't eat here again.
