Had one of the daughters and a couple of her friends in town so at my wife's suggestion, we headed back to America's for happy hour.  As I've said before, the best part of happy hour is that the tacos ($2) are only 50% more than they should be instead of the usual double. A decent street taco should be $1.25, $1.50 tops.
Once again, although the place was almost completely empty, it took about 25 minutes to get 2 tacos al pastor and a taco carne asada; once again the meat inside is chopped so fine as to be unrecognizable and consists entirely of charred exterior with no meaty interior.
My daughter, a lover of both sangria and margaritas, ordered a "sangrita".  Obviously not a popular drink as the staff had to look up how to make it and the result was awful.
To top off the experience, they have now have moved the happy hour singer indoors for summer and somehow found one ever more warbling and horrible than the previous one.
Simply put, we are done.  No more.  Los Taquitos is too close to put up with this crap.
