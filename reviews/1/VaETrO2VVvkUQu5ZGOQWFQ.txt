My girlfriend and I came here, as she came here years ago and said it was alright. A lot of commentators are saying the food is really spicy. It's okay. The chili is watered down and the food is very very bland. I've had authentic New Mexican before in New Mexico, and this restaurant...at least at this Mesa location, is definitely not it!! While the bartender/bus boy was nice, the waitress was a real pos. Just horrible service, horrible attitude towards my girlfriend and I. Not sure why either. 

So if you want to enjoy a night of eating bland mexican food while being insulted by a hostile and confrontational waiter....stop on by! :)
