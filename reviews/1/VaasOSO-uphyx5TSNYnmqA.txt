Terrible! Don't waste your time (we waited over 45 minutes for our food) and your money (overpriced). When the waitress finally showed up we ordered margaritas. It tasted OK but barely had any ice (rocks) to keep the drink cold. We ordered chicken fajitas, a kids meal with chicken strips and fries. The fajitas were so over cooked that the onions were black, charred and petrified. The chicken I could have put a dent in a wall if I threw it and the rice and beans weren't even warm. Assuming the microwave was broken! Now for the kids meal.. How do you mess that up? The strips were almost black they were so over fried, AND neither the fries or the chicken was even warm .. COLD AGAIN.... It gets worse from there. When we told the waitress about the food she apologized  and said that they are so busy and that so many things were broken in the kitchen and that we were even lucky to get our food when we did as orders were so backed up. We never saw a manager coming around to see how things were. Especially given the fact that it is a new restaurant you'd think you would see a manager. Our waitress offered to send he food back but after waiting 45 for food, we just wanted to leave. We paid our $50 tab we left and will never be back!
