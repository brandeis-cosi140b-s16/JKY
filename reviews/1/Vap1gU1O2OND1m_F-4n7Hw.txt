We really wanted this place to be good since they reopened because it is close to home.  Perhaps we made bad food choices or it could have been an off night but we were very disappointed.  The fish tacos had small chunks of greasy fish in an oily taco with a little cabbage in the bottom.  The tomato salsa on the side did not help.  Black beans on the side were dry, flavorless and undercooked.  The pork carnitas special ($19.99) were very tough and chewy and the re-fried beans served with it had absolutely no flavor.  Most of our food was left on the plate.  The server was excellent and the chips were good but this does not make up for the bad food.  Sorry but this restaurant is off our list for good.
