Well this was their last chance for us with the hundreds of Mexican restaraunts in the valley.  We've had subpar service here in the past but this time takes the cake. We sat down and were served chips and salsa but thats where the service stopped.  Several of the wait staff walked right by us without acknowledging us. After 15 min we decided to leave on the way out no one to lodge a complaint with so we called and let them know on the way to another restaraunt.
