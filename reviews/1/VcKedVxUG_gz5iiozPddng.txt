Dishonest employee, and a not so good Taco Salad.
I felt compelled to write my first review on any restaurant from my experience tonight.
First off, my taco salad was horrible but I didn't complain & just ate the rest of my husbands burrito which was good.
Upon arriving home I couldn't locate my cell phone so I called Nacho Daddy's to see if I left it there. They said they did not have it. We used the locating device to find it & it showed it was there. When calling Nacho Daddy's back & telling them that we located it there, of course then they found it. This was approx 45 minutes after leaving the restaurant. What an awful experience! Yes, I shouldn't have left my phone on the table but they have some dishonest employees. 
I will not go back there!
