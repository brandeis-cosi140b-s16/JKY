A group of us went there for lunch yesterday Service was slow. Half of our party had to leave because it took so long. We watched other tables be served that came in after us. When we tried to say something to the owner her response was "try doing what I do" I WOULD NOT recommend this place. The food here is comparable to Taco Bell. I'm being generous by giving one star
