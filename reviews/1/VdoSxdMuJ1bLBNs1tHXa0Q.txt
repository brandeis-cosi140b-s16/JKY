NO!! BAD ROBERTO!!

We should not have eaten here.
There are many good or at least decent Roberts' in Las Vegas. This is possibly the worst i have been to.

There were no customers, no music playing and no employees at first.
One guy was on the phone, talking to a friend in Spanish and gave me the hand guesture to wait a minute... then must have assumed that I do not understand Spanish, as he carried on his inappropriate conversation.

The food was bland and boring. 
HOW DO YOU F UP BURRITO'S?? 

I miss the place that was here :(
