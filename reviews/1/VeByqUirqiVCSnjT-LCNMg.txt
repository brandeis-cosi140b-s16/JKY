Quesadilla was like molten lava, chicken taco was ice cold. Had lettuce when I specifically asked for no lettuce. Brought it back and they had just tried to take the lettuce off, but failed miserably as there was still lettuce all over the taco. Their lettuce is soggy and tastes like dirt most of the time. The guy at the front acts like he is the busiest guy in the world when he's got 3 people in the whole place. Doesn't care to speak English to customers. (Or just doesn't care to learn)... Anyway, there are much better Roberto's locations than this one. 

Solid 1 star.
