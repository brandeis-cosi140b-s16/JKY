Pedro, if I could give you negative stars I would. Steven L from MA, said it all. This is rated as Best of Madison?? It shows what is going on in Madison and how very little the people of Madison know about food or quality thereof.

This place is disgusting! The food is abhorrent. A black bean and cheese burrito with no cheese?? The black beans tasted like they came out of a can of Bush's baked beans. Pedro, you owe me $20.00 back. Seriously. A wet steak burrito that had NOTHING but six strips of steak and a lot of horrible sauce inside a tortilla shell? Are you kidding me? I can get more authentic Mexican from Old El Paso.

Just avoid this place at all costs. There is nothing good about Pedro's, there is nothing Mexican about Pedro's.
