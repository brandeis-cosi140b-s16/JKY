I was a big fan of Chipotle a few years ago when they first came to town. Unfortunately the quality of their food, particularly their meat, has slipped to the point where I have vowed never to return. First the steak started getting more and more fatty then it was cooked rarer and rarer. When I went in for lunch today, the steak was so rare that blood was dripping from it. It looked like it had been seared 15 seconds on each side before being cut. 

If you're a vegetarian then I'm sure the food is still fine for you, but personally I feel safer eating almost anywhere else.
