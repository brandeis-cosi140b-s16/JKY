Went for Sunday Brunch today. The food was pretty good. But I was very disappointed in the service. We could hardly get someone to refill are drinks. But the worst was when we received the bill. They charged $6.98 each for the buffet for my 2 year old boys. And added an automatic gratuity of $11.23 for 5 people. $11.23 when we served ourselves and were only able to receive one refill on my water. Ridiculous!!! I only gave one star because the food was pretty good. We won't be back.
