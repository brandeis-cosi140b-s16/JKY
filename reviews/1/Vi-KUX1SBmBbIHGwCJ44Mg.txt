I've been here numerous times and they have been excellent. Today, I am totally shocked by the flavor and quality if the food. The salsa (which was one of my favorites in town) was soupy, runny, like water consistency. It lacked flavor. 

When I brought that up to the worker, she just shrugged her shoulders like saying... Who cares. 

We had steak tacos and we had to pick through the fat. There was so much fat in the taco, it grossed me out. 

It's really sad, because this was my go to place for street tacos. 

Not any more.... Regretfully, Morenos is off my list!
