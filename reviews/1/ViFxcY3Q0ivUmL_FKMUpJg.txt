I guess I'm just spoiled from living in New Mexico my whole life (best mexican food EVER).  This place had been recommended to me by pretty much everyone when I told them I was looking for NM style Mexican food. We finally made it here & I was stoked! The girl behind the counter kept answering the phone while we were ordering, another worker was walking past us cursing at another employee...awwwwwkward. Now I'm willing to look past all of that IF the food is good, sadly disappointed doesn't even begin to cover it.  

I ordered a carne asada chimichanga & my husband ordered the chorizo & potato combo plate.  The food came out quickly & my husband couldn't figure out what he was looking at on his plate.  It was just ground beef on top of mashed potatoes. Every place he's ever been has served it with fried potatoes & actual chorizo. Is this normal for AZ?  He didn't even want to eat it the food was so bland. I cut into my chimi & couldn't believe the meat that was coming out of it...boiled dry hamburger meat.  This was absolutely not carne asada. I gave it a shot thinking that at least if it's flavorful it won't matter. Nope. Bland, dry absolutely NO flavor. The guacamole on top was great & the tortilla wasn't heavy from being fried, it was nice & light.  But what's a chimi without yummy fillings?! I couldn't even finish it, we both had weird artificial aftertastes in our mouths as we were leaving. Blech. Sorry, but this is a huge "never again" for me.
