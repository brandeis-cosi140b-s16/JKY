Beware. Run, do not walk from this restaurant. Never thought I'd say that about a restaurant, but the cook might be better as a garbage collector 'cause she did an excellent job scraping up the slimy gunk that might have formerly been lettuce on my club sandwich tonight. 

Any recommendations for food poisoning ERs?
