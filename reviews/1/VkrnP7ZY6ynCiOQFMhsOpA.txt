I hate to be a negative Nel but this place sucks! 

A friend of mine suggested I try this place for lunch, the ratings were just ok but gave it a shot anyway. 
I ordered a carne asada taco salad, you know the kind with the crispy flour tortilla bowl? Needless to say it was a mini-me version of something that wanted to be worth the 9 bucks I paid! 
The cook didn't even take time to slice the flavorless heap of meat that sat sadly on my iceberg. The person at the table next to me had a similar complaint except hers were tacos. 
This place is frequented by lots of locals 
I can't figure out why...... is there a Gold Membership we don't know about????
