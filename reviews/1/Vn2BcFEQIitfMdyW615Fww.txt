Ran in to use the restroom because we were getting sandwiches at Capriotti's, which does not have a restroom.  There was a grumpy old guy guarding the restroom, who insisted that I buy something.  Ok I get it, they are there to serve food, but I kind of felt pushed into buying something. I got a medium fry to eat with the sub and all I can say is yuck!!  And I'm really a fry junkie, I can't turn them down.  Never had them from del taco before, and I will definitely not do that again.  They were soggy and room temperature. I think a McDonakd's fry that's been under my seat for a month would still taste better.
