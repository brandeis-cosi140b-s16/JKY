Super Burrito should be Sorry Burrito.

We had always seen them around town with their van and had stated we wanted to try to the place. When they opened up the location on Tropicana it was definitely time to try it out.

It's a walk up/drive through location. So we walked up.

The staff was pretty friendly. The guy had asked if we had ate their before and after our answer of no, we were treated to some samples of their meat. 

I decided on carne asada super burrito and the man went with chicken super burrito. 

We waited in our car for our food and they were kind enough to bring it out the car for us. 

The man was anxious to try his food so he immediately went in the bag and kept pulling stuff out asking me what else I ordered and where was his burrito.

Much to our surprise, our burritos were there. Just not so super. They were flat, not round at all and filled with mostly filler. There was maybe 1 and 1/2 oz meat in each burrito. 

I had just spent a little over $30 on two burritos, a cheese quesadilla, drinks, and chips and salsa. Can I tell you how pissed off I was???????????

I will never try another Super Burrito in my life.
