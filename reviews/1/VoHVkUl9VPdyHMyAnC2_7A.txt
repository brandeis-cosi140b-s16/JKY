I would go to many fast food chains with happy hour and had no issues with paying happy hour prices for takeout. Unfortunately, not at America's Taco Shop on 16th and Camelback.  For two carne asada tacos and one order of chips and salsa-$8.09. My first time here in the city coming from another state,  and for that price, I thought a burrito was a better deal. I had to change my order right away.  The guy taking my order was not happy that he had to "delete everything" and a bad attitude went with the deleted order; talk about terrible service and understanding from someone who can speak good english. I would understand if the place was busy but it was empty. I had to leave that place QUICK! Never felt that uncomfortable being in a fast food restaurant and I would certainly not want to try the food after that experience. I can take my money elsewhere!

 After reading the reviews on yelp, so happy I didn't try it and went with a healthier option. And the guy who stood at the cashier  happily shouted as I walked out the door, "Thanks Annie!" How condescending can he be, and its not good for customer service. He really sucks. Never coming back. Stay far away from this place.
