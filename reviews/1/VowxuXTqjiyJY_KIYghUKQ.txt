Maybe it's because I'm accustomed to service in another city.... But I can honestly say these people took twice as long as the longest it's EVER taken to get my order ready at a Chipotle. They even jumped two people in line in front of me. Wowsa.

Edit:
This also marks the first time I've ever gotten BURNT food from a Chipotle. I just bit into a bit that was rock solid. Not cool guys, not cool.
