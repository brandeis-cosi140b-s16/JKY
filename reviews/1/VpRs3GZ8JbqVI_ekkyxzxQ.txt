We have eaten at Manuel's many times in the past and have enjoyed the food.  Last Sunday we went for lunch ~2:30pm and found the "greeter" standing at the bar talking with other patrons.  He came over and greeted, and sat us, then returned to his conversation at the bar.  That was the last employee we saw during our 15 minute wait - all within view of the greeter.  We finally left without ever being served - very disappointed and not sure if we will ever return .
