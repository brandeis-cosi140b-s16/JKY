Currito is a nice alternative to a typical Mexican-themed burrito place, as they provide you with many healthy options to creating your burrito.  They also have a tasty smoothie station in which the employees will grudgingly prepare for you.  And along with that note, this restaurant provides the worst customer service I have ever experienced.. period.  The servers are either extremely rude, or merely spaced out.  Either way, it has been a terrible experience every time I have eaten there, and wouldn't recommend it unless you like to be patronized (or ignored) by the worker "curreating" your burrito.
