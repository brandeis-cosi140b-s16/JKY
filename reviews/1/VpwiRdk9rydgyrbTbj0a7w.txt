I have lived in the area for seven years and have been to DP's numerous times. I have only gone back just to give them another chance to redeem theirselves because it is close and I want to be able to enjoy dinner that is close. 

So far they have disappointed me every time. 

The food is edible but is no way authentic, those that think it is probably are from other states and don't really know any better. If Filibertos is real Mexican food to you then this is the place for you. The food is comparable but with less choice. 

My real big problem though is the service, or should I say lack there of. They are horrible. 

I want to like this place because it is a nice looking place but don't be fooled. Try it at your own risk, hopefully your experience will be better but for me I have yet to have a good experience. 

I will say the bar is good if you need a place to hang though. 

The one star is because I can't give it no stars.
