I've been here twice.  Not happy at all.  This most recent time, I had to wait a very long time in drive thu for chips, salsa and side of refried beans.  Only to get a "side of bean with rice".  So disappointed.  The rice really isn't that bad, but the beans were awful.  The first time I ordered chips and salsa (which is too exensive) it came with the salsa on top in a Styofoam container.  WHAT?  I think it might have been to save a container.  Why soggy the chips with the salsa?  This yucky food does not live up to taco shop standards.  Go to Poloberto's on Glendale and 43rd Ave.
