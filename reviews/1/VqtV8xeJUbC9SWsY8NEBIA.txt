Horrible, they nickle and dime you for everything. This is the first "Mexican" place that charges you for chips and salsa! Even just salsa they will charge you. Incredible, they need to learn from El Torito, where you can get not only pico de gallo but more creative salsas on the house. I asked to complain to the manager and nobody showed up. They don't deserve any business.
