For those of you that are not aware Macayo's has a new 'concept.'  It stinks!!  The menu is different, the chairs and tables are different, the signage and paint on the exterior is different however the carpet is the same the old tile is the same and the restrooms are the same.  A very half assed attempt.  When we asked to speak to a manager about the changes we were met with aggression and zero empathy.  As a result, we paid for our cocktails, refused the food and left the restaurant.  Even though my family and I have been going to Macayo's for as long as I can remember we will never return.  My family tradition has been ruined!
