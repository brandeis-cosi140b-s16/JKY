The bean dip was good.  That was it.  Everything else was just bad.  To be fair we showed up for an early dinner, 4pm on a Saturday, which is pretty much the worst time you can go to a restaurant.

The service was slow, but I expected that due to the time we arrived.  What I did not expect was way overcooked tamales, cheese enchiladas that were somehow actually bad.  Beef tacos that were inedible.

My shredded beef enchilada was decent.  I know this is not supposed to be super amazing Mexican food.  It is supposed to be OK americanized and somewhat boring mexican food.  After we left, I told my wife that half way through the meal, I wondered if I was going to get food poisoning.  She remarked that she had thought the same thing.
