If I could give this place negative stars I would. The food is disgusting. The Mexican Pizza looked like they dumped a can of Alpo on a tortilla. The breakfast burrito - welI let's just say I couldn't find the egg in the pile of crap they put on the plate but in all fairness it was probably there when they made it, it just disintegrated from all the grease.

Four meals and not one of us could muster up so much as an enthusiastic "It's mediocre!" It was just awful plain & simple.

I usually try to give a first bad review a second chance but I don't think I could stomach my way through this disaster again.
