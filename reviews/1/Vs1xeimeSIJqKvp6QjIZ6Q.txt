We heard a lot about this place from a friend who swears by it so we went there last weekend.  The place is a stand alone building but that did not deter us. Got seated right away, placed our order,  the food was at the table in less than 10 min's.  Oh the salsa for the chips, hot and hotter.  I had the chili relleano which was prepared correctly, meaning the skin was pealed from the pepper, but that's all i can say about it.  Rice was dry and crunchy, beans tasted stale.  My wife had the carnitias which were tender but had little taste and nothing to rave about.  The real fun started that night, i had such a bad case of heartburn and diarrhea that i could not sleep, and going #2 was brutally painful. The wife was  also sick, vomiting ,shaking and still, almost 3 days later has no appetite at all. Don't think we'll be going back for a repeat performance.
