I have no idea what crack-smokers rated this place highly (no offense - everyone needs a little help getting by some days.)  Wife and I stopped in post Christmas shopping at about 1pm on the 24th.  Sign said they'd be open until 3pm...

Ordered our food and sat down.  But it's a bit tricky because we couldn't find a clean table (and there were only 2 tables taken in the place.)  We get our food and the first thing we notice is the stack of napkins (that had been put there by the friendly employee) are all stuck together with well-dried salsa (not some on-the-tray mishap, no this had plenty of time to set up crispy hard.)  Wife NOT happy.  So I hop up to get more.  Only to find the stack in the self service area (along with most of the self-serve stuff) has also been lightly drizzled with various salsas throughout the day.  Awesome!  Dig out some from the bottom that appear untouched but things are looking bad.

Sit down to my beef burrito and it's, ummm, disgusting.  I don't know what beef they use but it has no flavor - the whole concoction tasted the same (if you got beef, sauce or cheese, didn't matter - one flavor and not a good one.)  The beef itself had that mushy consistency that you get with over-processed frozen dinners...  And in the spirit of healthy flavoring, there wasn't a fresh vegetable (onion?  cilantro?  Oh no, that would be muy fancy!  There MAY have been beans but we couldn't tell by looking and you certainly couldn't feel them in a bite.)

Can't remember what my wife had but we didn't finish either meal.

And the customer service?  Ten minutes after we get there, the counter help takes down the "Closing at 3pm" door sign and changes the time to 2pm.  We left before 1:30 and they had already locked the door.  As we walked out, two other couples tried to walk in but were told the restaurant had closed.
