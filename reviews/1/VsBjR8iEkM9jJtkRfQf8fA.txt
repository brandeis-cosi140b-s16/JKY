According to their listed hours they are open until 11 p.m. Mon-Thurs but they closed the kitchen at 9:30 with no warning, ruining our plans. Super unprofessional, like just about all downtown establishments, but that's beside the point. This is downtown Las Vegas; why do you close at 9:30? Given the other reviews and my own experience, I won't be back.
