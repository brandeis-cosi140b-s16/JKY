If it were not for the chips and salsa, I would never return to this restaurant. I have been going there since I was a kid. In the past year or so, the service has gotten so bad, I wouldn't even believe it is the same restaurant. I only get carry out now, and that is only when I am craving the chips and salsa. 

Even their carry out food service is terrible, unfortunately. My past 4 visits, I have called over 30-45 minutes in advance to my order, and upon arrival nobody has prepared it. During one visit (The Friday before 2012 Superbowl), it took me 45 minutes AFTER I arrived for them to get me 2 bags of chips and 2 portions of salsa. Another woman had been waiting there longer than me. We were both waiting on chips and salsa ONLY. That should never happen.

My last visit was 3/3/12 and again, I called 35 minutes before arriving to order chips and salsa for a party. I walked in and waited 7 minutes before being greeted. The hostess then went to "find out" who took my order and returned and told me I had to go to the cantina/bar to pay and get them. Once I got in there, I stood for 15 minutes trying to get the attention of someone walking by so I could get my order. Finally a man brought it to me. I was so fed up. I do not think I can return. I am sick of being treated like they don't need or even WANT my business.

I have never received an apology from any of them for taking so long, and not having my order ready, even when I gave them plenty of notice AND the orders were simple.
