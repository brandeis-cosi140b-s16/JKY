If I could give 0 stars I would on the food and the wait time.  We came at 4:30 on a Sunday and was told it would be an hour wait when there was clearly many tables available.  Once we were seated the only good thing was our waitress Cassie E.  She obviously knew what she was doing.  If I could make one recommendation she should get a job someplace else. The food lacked flavor. Especially the guacamole.  The only thing I'd give 5 stars on is the pressed coffee.   Oh yeah by the way there was a bus boy that looked like this was the worst job he's ever had.  Yawning and walking around like the most unenthusiastic person I've ever seen. Don't waste your time.
