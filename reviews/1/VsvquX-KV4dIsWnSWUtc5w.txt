NO!!! omg... wish i'd eaten at the burger king next door (and i hate fast food!)  this place is just awful.  worst margarita i've ever had.  we ended up sending them back. disgusting.  food was a low level of mediocre.  service was as bad as the drink.  

i hate when people say it's "airport" food, so you should have low expectations.  that's nonsense.  i've eaten plenty of airport food, and some of it is excellent. in fact, some of my favorite places to eat are in airports. location has nothing to do with quality, and having a restaurant in an airport is NOT an excuse for garbage food and bad service.  this place stinks. period.
