omg. worst mexican "food" ever.

looking for a mexican food place on the way home from the cave creek area, we happened upon this place's relatively good reviews and decided to give it a shot. i ordered the chile relleno plate and my date ordered a chicken quesadilla. apparently the chicken quesadilla wasn't bad. but of my two chile rellenos, only one of them found it's way to the microwave, since the bottom was cold, and the cheese was hard. the beans were gray they had so much lard in them. this plate was hard to look at, let alone eat. i will not be coming back here again.
