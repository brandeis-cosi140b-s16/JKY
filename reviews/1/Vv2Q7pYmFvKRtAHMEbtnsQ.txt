I don't know if this place has gone downhill since the last reviews or if the people involved are used to lack luster "authentic" Mexican food. Party of two last night, just me and the wife yet it took the staff at least 10 minutes to set our table with menus and ask us about our drink of choice. (- 1 star) I ordered a #12 (Red chili burro, taco, R & B) and my wife ordered the Carne Asada plate. The food prep took 40 minutes to get to our table (-1 star), and the only exciting thing was watching the tables next to us get food in 15 minute intervals and by the time one table is finished eating the next received their food. My red chili burro had tough meat and the sauce was clearly out of a can and the wifes Carne Asade was far from par it was a tough double bogey. (-1 star) The place was packed so I gave them some slack but when the waitress says they are out of ice while another is putting ice in a pitcher that's where I draw the line. Horrible service from the majority of servers, with only one working hard (-1 star). Nothing like waiting 10 minutes for a refill or more chips, and the whole dinner for two was nearly 1.5 hours long for a hole in the wall cafe. I normally gives places a second shot, but it's a slap in the face to a real good authentic place in other parts of the valley I.E. Pedro's in Glendale, or Rita's off 43rd ave and the I-10. I will not be back :(
