Do you want to dance? Do you want to sit on a table? You better spend $400 or more to be treated like a human being....you better believe it!!!! My husband and I are salsa dancers,  but we left like there is no tomorrow...this place is NO place to spend your money! Trust me...better go out and gamble! You'll be better off
