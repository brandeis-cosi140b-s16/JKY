If I could give this place negative stars I would.

I came in here hoping to prove most os the yelp reviews wrong, boy did that not work out.

I ordered a Chorizo and egg burrito.  First off, there were barely any eggs in it, unless their eggs are brown.  Second, this might have been the greasiest thing I have ever eaten.  I could barely pick the thing up without it leaking juice from the bottom.  Finally it tasted like absolutely nothing.  It literally tasted they just threw in cardboard and grease in a tortilla.  Awful!

Also about an hour after eating it, my stomach felt awful afterwards.  I had the worst stomach ache until I used the bathroom.  

All in all, subway is right next door to this place.  You'd be much better off going there.   

AVOID AT ALL COSTS!
