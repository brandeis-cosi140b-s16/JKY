First let me say I'm a huge fan of Filiberto's, however yesterday was my first time going to this location. The cashier never gave or asked if I'd like a reciept or told me the total,, but I thought nothing of it. When I arrived at home I looked up my order, on the online menu (Carne Asada fries & a cheese quesadilla) $8.50+$4.50=$13.00+tax. I was charged $19.56, which my bank app can verify. I called the store and asked to speak to a manager, after a long wait he picked up saying "What?". When I explained the situation, his response was "Forget you, followed by more obscenities. Needless to say, Filiberto's has forever lost my business and respect.
I will be seeking legal counsel.
