I was excited to see Los Taquitos at Sky Harbor Terminal 4 I been going to the location off 16th street for a long time and I am a big fan of their tacos and homemade salsas.

I even saw a sign on the wall last time I was in the 16th st restaurant talking about opening in Terminal 4

This is nothing like the restaurant this is different from top to bottom and disappointing to say the least

The other reviews and pictures are spot on so I won't bother posting more very very disappointed
