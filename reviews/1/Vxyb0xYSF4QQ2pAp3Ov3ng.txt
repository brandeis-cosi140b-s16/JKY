I'm giving this place one star only because I HAVE to.  Our waitress was the worst I have ever seen. She asked my kid about a drink that was not included in the kids menu--without our knowledge.  The kids meal was supposedly free with each paid adult meal. We both ordered entrees, the food was cold and disgusting. We sent it back because it was just too nasty to try to eat.  We got a comp meal at the manager's request.  I guess because we were forced to send our food back, they decided to charge for the "free" kids meals and when I asked about an extra drink charge, we were told my daughter (who is 5), had a drink that didn't come with the kids meal and we were charged $3 for that too.  The waitress had no customer service skills whatsoever.  She could not care less that our food was cold and hard. I will never, ever, ever (Shout out to T-Swift) go back to this dump.
