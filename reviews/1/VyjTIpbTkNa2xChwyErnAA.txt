I WILL NEVER COME HERE AGAIN!! NEVER!! the employees are extremely rude and don't ask you if you want certain additions to your meal for example I ordered two burritos for my mom and I. They barely gave us any sour cream and when my mom asked for a little more the employee had a pissy look on her face. Then the other employee didn't even ask if we wanted lettuce or guacamole. She had to unwrap my burrito to add those, my mom didnt even get the chance to say she wanted lettuce and guacamole before the employee had her burrito wrapped in foil. 

I've been to the Chipotle on Maryland Pkwy and had the best experience. I was asked if I wanted extras and they were not stingy with their portions. For a great Chipotle experience I would recommend going to any other chipotle!! AVOID THIS ONE IF YOU CAN!!
