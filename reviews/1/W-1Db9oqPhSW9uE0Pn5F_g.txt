I love you Del Taco BUT!!!!
If I pay near THREE DOLLARS for a burrito I expect it to be bigger and better than Taco Hell's $1.69 disaster.
Also, THE WAIT even inside is grinding on my very SOUL.
There's always just TWO PEOPLE working.
Sorries don't cut it if EVERY TIME I HAVE TO WAIT AGES even if there's only a few people ahead of me! Take a lesson from 3rd Street location.

April 2013: GOD DAMN YOU. I was the only person in the place, there were 2 drive through orders, and I STILL HAD TO WAIT FOR AGES!! 

AND my tacos were crammed with lettuce.

STOP IT!!!!!  

You just got degraded to ONE star.

WHAT
THE
F*&%

April 23/2013: See what happens when you have a manager as an extra person to help out? YOU BUST YOUR ASS THAT'S WHAT!!! I had my order in a few minutes.
Thanks and keep it up or I'll start complaining to Mister Manager.

April 25: I nearly keeled over in shock. SIX PEOPLE WORKING.
I had my order in under 2 minutes.
Tacos are now 49 cents.
We shall see how this new plan plays out and maybe you get a star upgrade.
