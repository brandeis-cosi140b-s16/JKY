When reviewing a Baja or other franchise, typically the review is how it goes for that specific location.  This location of Baja Fresh is awful, whereas most other locations I have been to have been outstanding.

The wait times are absurd, the staff are rude, the place is dirty, and portion size compared to other Bajas is BS.  Yes, I am nitpicking on this (isn't that what Yelp is for?) but the amount of chips they give you while you wait here is terrible in comparison to other locations - and I came here 3 times to give it the benefit of the doubt over the past 6 months or so.  

If management here could get it together, I'd become a regular as I am in the area frequently.  Until that happens, paz!
