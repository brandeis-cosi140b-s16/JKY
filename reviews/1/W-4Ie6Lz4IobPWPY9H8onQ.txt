Gave this place a second chance.  Walked in and could not hear the counter gal since the echo in the place is like being in a tunnel.  I had to repeat myself several times as to what I wanted on my burrito since no one can hear one another.  Not only that, the attitude I received from the high school drop outs that work there.  When I started my order they were giving me the vibe I was annoying them to just be there in there restaurant.  Then, the owner/manager comes over at the end of the line and with her "bare" hands mind you, folded my burrito.  Paid for my order, cashier gave me a condescending "have a greaaaat daaaayyyy" as I could feel her eye's rolling.  Took my burrito home, rice was way under cooked ~ again, bland ~ again, and given very little meat that tasted burnt.  Oh don't forget!  A a table spoon of guacamole is $1.75????  Never again........
