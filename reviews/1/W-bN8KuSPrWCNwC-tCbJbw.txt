The owner cancelled a group reservation yesterday that I had for tomorrow night, and proceeded to tell me that he didn't want our group in the restaurant. He wanted us to rent the private dining room and select group menus, but Open Table or the Mundo hostess I spoke to on Friday didn't tell me that. I told him that he could split us up in to multiple tables, but that it would be an inconvenience -- but he told me that we'd just end up 'taking it out' on his staff and didn't want us there. I've heard from multiple people that their service was horrible, but this takes the cake. It's too bad because their food is good and it is walking distance to the Smith Center. I was a regular customer before the shows, but I won't be returning.
