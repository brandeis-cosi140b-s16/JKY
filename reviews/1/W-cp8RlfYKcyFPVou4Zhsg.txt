This was the worst food I ever ate.  I did not even give it to my DOG... We got the chicken burrito the chicken was hard and chewy.  We also had the carne asada french fries the steak was all fat and we could not even chew it... That was a HUGE waste of $12.  Oh did I mention that they charged an extra $1 for cheese on the burrito that had a little sprinkle on it.... DONT EAT AT THIS LOCATION
