I've driven past this shop always curious, so I was excited when I finally remembered to try it. Saturday night at 5:30pm, and no one is here. I walk in and there is no music, and employees come out from hiding. I order a chimi and when I try to be friendly and say "I've never been here before so I am excited to try this place!", girl sounded very unamused and said "you'll PROBABLY like it".
I sat down to wait for my food and listen to the machines running while noticing the decor made no sense.

Disappointed before even trying the food and I can't even bring myself to eat the third bite of the chimi because it tastes flavorless and I rather just wait in line at Los Taquitos and have something I will actually enjoy this Saturday night.
