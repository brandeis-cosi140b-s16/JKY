Dirty, terrible service, and hugely over-priced. My boyfriend and I decided to pop in for a quick marg or two before our flight. We immediately notice the grime (slippery floors, dirty tables that we had to wait 5 minutes to have cleaned off, and bad smells). The margaritas were overpriced, $32 for 2 regular margaritas. We ordered them with no salt because I have a mild sodium allergy. Though they brought them with salt I drank it anyway, because my allergy is mild and I really wanted a marg AND our flight was only 45 minutes away from departing. Once we finished we had to ask 3 waiters for our check. We explained to each one that our flight was boarding and that we needed the check right away. After waiting 15 minutes, I approached the manager. He briskly told me I must wait for the waiter at the table. We made our flight, but this placed killed our buzz. Choose somewhere else!
