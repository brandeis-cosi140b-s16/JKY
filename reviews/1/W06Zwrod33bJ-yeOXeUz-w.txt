After being contacted by someone at Moe's who was not happy with my review (and didn't seem to comprehend it either) I agreed to disagree and decided to just let it sit.

Today, however, I took a closer look at my Yelp messages and noticed something interesting.

My first message was from a yelp user named John J., however, it was signed by Alisha, the Moe's supervisor!

Okay, she's using an alias. I guess that's fine. But what happens when you click on her/John J.'s reviews???

What???

Just in case she/John J. deletes their reviews (which they most certainly will), I'll sum them up below.

Moe's Southwest Grill (6910 S. Rainbow)

5 STARS

Moe's Southwest Grill (W. Maule Ave)

5 STARS

Moe's Southwest Grill (10965 Lavender Hill)

5 STARS

Seems a little biased to review a company you work for Alisha/John.....

But wait, there's MORE!

Cafe Rio (4830 Blue Diamond)

2 STARS - "Was not happy! Waited 20 minutes for a quesadilla, A joke... I have discovered a new concept from the East Coast down the street. Moe's Southwest Grill. It was great. Quick service- I had a Billy Barrou! It was really good. I have found my new lunch spot."

Pieology Pizzeria (10965 Lavender Hill) --- Right Next Door To Moe's

2 STARS - "We stopped in when my son decided that he wanted a pizza instead of a burrito. We were all outside eating our meal and he refused to eat. I thought he was just being picky until I tried it. The crust tasted old and burnt, the toppings were dry and the marinara sauce
taste bad. The weather was nice outside, and that is the only reason I gave it two stars."

Seriously? So you make up positive reviews about the 3 Moe's in town and then you trash your competitors? Seems like bad business Alisha/John!
