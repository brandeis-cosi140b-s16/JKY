This place constantly rips you off, from missing items to shorting you on the meat in your tacos, burritos, chalupas, whatever. 

The last chalupas I got from here had the thinnest layer of beef in them and were filled halfway. I'm talking about a pen sized thickness of meat, and only halfway through?! Come on guys. You clearly don't give a s*** at this location as many of the complaints are the exact same thing. Are your employees shorting orders to steal the food at the end of the day or just WHAT is going on here?
