Yep 4 stars to 1 star... new owners need a dose of reality. 
If the Burrito Bandito website has your store number and address on there still you would imagine that they are the same owners. I guess not. The new owners have different prices different menu items and different customer service skills. 

As I mentioned in my previous review, I have been eating BB since day one... the day they opened. Yesterday was my last day there EVER... 


Me: "Do you deliver still?" 
Her: "Pssshh.. we have for the past 9 months!" 
Me: "bummer the website did not mention that" 
Her Blank Stare 
Me: "Can I have the 3-way chimi, not the combo, with guac? " 
Her:Rolling eyes.... "That would be a burrito" 
Me: "I would like it deep fried, Unless the Chimi combo is cheaper? " 
Her:Rolling eyes..."Huh.... ummm... its a few cents cheaper" 
(burrito is 4.99 chimi combo is 6.99) 
Me: "Ok I will have the burrito deep fried with guac on the side." 
Her: blank stare 
Me: "I would alos like the kids meal taco" (supposed to be a mini taco, 2 banditos rice and beans) 
Her: blank stare 
Me "I would also like the #6" 
Her: Huh...what else? 
etc.... 
4 more customer come in and order and she was as rude to them as she was me. Not a smile the entire time. 

I get home: SURPRISE 

The chimi had no guac on the side... it was inside and the kids meal had NO banditos...So I call... 

Her: The kids meal does not come with banditos. 
Me: The website shows...and I read it to her. 
Her: That is the other store only. 
Me Then why is you phone and address on there? 
Her: The owner will not remove it... 
Me: Ok but you still shorted me my...nevermind....CLICK 

YOU JUST CAN'T FIX STUPID!!
