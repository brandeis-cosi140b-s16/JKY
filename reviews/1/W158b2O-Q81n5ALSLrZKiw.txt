I went last night. I wanted to order two items. One California burrito and one carne Asada fry with a side of shrimp.
First no one spoke any English. And couldn't understand what I wanted. Both my items together should have cost no more then 15$. When she tried to charge me closer to 30$, I was confused bc and also added on their that I wanted a shrimp burrito. When I said no I didn't, she couldn't understand what I was saying. Then the phone rang, and she left me, and took the phone order, gave it to the cook, then did something else, then came back to me. And she kept trying to charge me for things I didn't want. And the cook was of no help either. So I left without ordering anything while I had to wait for her for like 20 mins. 
Worst ROBERTO'S ever.
