we ordered togo, there was just us and another couple eating there. we waited 25mins and still no food! i finally went up to the cashier and asked how come our food is not ready yet?!? she looked at me like she didnt take my order and asked for my receipt! she talked to the manager and everyone else.. They forgot to do my order!! i was so pissed i asked for my money back!!! they gave me my refund and also my order for free! so... food was pretty good, a bit salty for my taste, and service was bad! will not go to this one again.
