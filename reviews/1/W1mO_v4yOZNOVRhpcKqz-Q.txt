Please do not come here the food is all frozen and it taste old the taco shells were so old it took me a long while to chew my jaw hurts. The chimichanga I asked for no onions when I got home they put onions when I called and asked about it she told me that the food is "seasoned" with onions when I order the same type of meat in my tacos and those did not have onions ? if that's the case she should of been smart enough to tell me that my son is deadly allergic to onions I am not happy I paid 40 dollars and it taste like Taco Bell I asked for two tacos on the side she gave me a meal and charged me as a meal! The beans are nasty I could go to Walmart and get the value beans in the can it would taste better. I always love to try new things and this was definitely new and I would NOT recommend anyone here NASTY!! This is my opinion I grew up eat authentic Mexican food when you claim to be a MEXICAN restaurant you should make everything from scratch I was trying to figure out why it would only take 15 minutes. When you have a restaurant you need to love food enough to make it not give people old frozen food and try to rip people off
