Im giving this place one star based on the food and customer service. Our server was crabby as hell and my food was disgusting. I ordered a chimichanga and it wasnt even fried it was like a burrito with disgusting pot roast in the middle. To make.matters even worse my son ordered taquitos and one fell off the plate and the server picked it up with her hands and.placed it back on the plate. I wasnt gonna let him eat it after that. All around disgusted with my experience here.
