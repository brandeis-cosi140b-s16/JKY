Hate to but wish I could give zero stars!!! I love Robertos but this is by far the worst visit ever!!! If you want carne asada fries don't go here!!! I asked for extra gauc and cheese, got charged for both and got neither and hardly any steak. I don't care if it's 12pm or 12am you should always be giving 100 I'm a server and work till 1am and we always strive to put out awesome food no matter how late or tired we are. From my experience here, they could care less. Also paid for 2 tacos and only got one. 
Probably won't risk a another trip here.
