WORST SERVICE EVER!!!!

My daughter and I came here to try it out.

Came in and got seated quickly and that's where it ended.

15 minutes wait to have a server come to the table
15 minutes wait to get the drinks we ordered
15 minutes wait to get a refill on water
15 minutes wait to get our food
15 minutes wait to get a "to go" box after we ate
15 minutes wait to get our bill

....and only took us 10 minutes to eat.  

All this waiting made the food suck.
Calculate the TOTAL wait time (and I'm being nice with averaging 15 minutes):  It was over 1 1/2 hours of wait time.

And what makes this even worst is that it was slow night...not much customers were there when we came.

It sucks that Restaurant.com forces an 18% tip.  I wouldn't of gave anything!!!!!
