The hostess was GREAT & the atmosphere is trendy!  However, my immediate impression was how EXTREMELY unfriendly my initial waitress was.  Bluntly asking what do you need & not greeting us with a Hi or Hello.  I told her we needed a few mins since we'd never been in before.  So WHAT DID SHE DO ... she took my 15 yr old daughters menu to make room on the table!  How was she supposed to make her MEAL selections?  I waived down the very polite and kind hostess who sent over the manager.  The manager offered a VERY half-hearted apology.  I can see why her team thinks its ok to be rude to PAYING patrons.   The replacement waitress was NO BETTER per her nails were unkept with chipped nail polish and lent in her hair.  We ordered ceviche, 3 tacos & corn that came on a husk that needed to be chucked!  If I wanted to chuck corn, i'd eat at home.  I saw other patrons with bowls of corn & she said I didn't order a bowl.  My mistake, who knew.  She also told me it isn't that hard to chuck & instructed me on how to do so!  The food was sub-par & the manager did her good deed for the day by waiving the cost of the ceviche.  NEVER again...avoid this place at all costs!  Read the other reviews...rudeness is their signature service.  I've NEVER written a review but felt compelled too.  Enough said...
