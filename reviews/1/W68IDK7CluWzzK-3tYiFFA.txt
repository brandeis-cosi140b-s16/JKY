I really want to like La Paz.  I really do, but I recently went there for the first time in about a year and was really disappointed.  I've heard it's under new management so they may still be working out the kinks.

1.  Disappointed by the food.  From the looks of it, this might have just been my dish.  They've updated the menu from the last time I was there and I was hoping to get the delicious nachos I had last time.  I ordered the nachos, but what came out was a plate with eight (8) chips, with a singular strip of chicken, some cheese and black beans.  I think it was $10.79 for that...so it equates out to $1.35 a chip.

2.  Disappointed by the atmosphere.  We went on a Friday night and were seated in the back of the restaurant, thankfully.  There was a small band brought in, but it ended up more like karaoke.  We heard everything from James Taylor to Jimmy Buffett to Dave Matthews.  And it wasn't good.  Would expect more of a latin theme throughout the restaurant, this came across as cheesy.

3.  Disappointed by the wait staff.  Given it was a Friday night and we had a large group, but we were sat at a table that wasn't big enough for our group, wait approximately 10 minutes for drinks after sitting, 15 minutes for salsa to go with the chips and got our food before some people had silverware.

Like I said, I want to like La Paz because it's closer than Cantina, but I'm not sure if I would go back at this point.
