What's worse than greasy Mexican food? COLD Greasy Mexican food!  I ordered the super nachos which were slathered in cold beans and unmelted cheese. Gross! My man ordered the cheese enchilada, which was also cold and full of unmelted cheese. In general, the food was cold and not satisfying. We would have given them 2 to 3 stars, since they have a salsa bar and lots of cheap combo plates. But the a/c was broken, making our dining experience even more unpleasant. Heck the restaurant was hotter than the food!  Pass it up, folks.
