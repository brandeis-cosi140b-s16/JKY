Food was just ok. We were very disappointed that they had a sign up that said margarita pitcher special ask bartender. We asked our waitress and she didn't know anything about it. We ordered a pitcher of watermelon margarita's thinking it was going to be some kind of special. It was. It was $36.00 for a pitcher that had no alcohol in it. Won't be back.
