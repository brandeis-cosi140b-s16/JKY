bought a groupon for 2 of their giant cups of mixer with a thimble full of alcohol, we had to go to the bar in the casino and get some tequila to doctor them up....of course they offer to add shots to their giant slurpees for extra $$$....What pissed me off was they charged tax, based on the retail price of $56 for the 2 drinks. We thought our groupon covered everything, but in the fine print (which shows up after purchase), it did say tax not included, employee was snarky and quick to point out the term, as they no doubt did to rip off many other groupon buyers. Only good thing was groupon reimbursed us the full amount and gave me credit for the tax we paid....thanks groupon, don't let these food court scam artists sell anymore overpriced, awful tasting drinks to anyone through you.
