Absolutely terrible. I would give this place 0 stars if I could. I was with a group of 6 other people and none of us enjoyed our meal. The chips and salsa (a staple at any Mexican food restaurant) was a far cry from pretty much any other restaurant in the valley (Mexican and otherwise). As for the cost, I would put these entrees (and lunch specials, even) on the "expensive" side of the scale. The service was acceptable, although I can only suspect the wait staff expects large tips from their hugely inflated bills. Sadly, they may not get any return customers with the quality of their food the way it is.
