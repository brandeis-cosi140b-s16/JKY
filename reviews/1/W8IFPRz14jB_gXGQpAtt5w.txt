Uncomfortable seating. chips were greasy and paper thin with almost no flavor. We were seated quickly but were there for an early dinner so there was no line.  I ordered shrimp fajitas and when my plate arrived the tails were still on the shrimp and the whole thing was covered in cheese. There were even two tails with no shrimp attached to them. Sent it back and the second order I received the shrimp were rubbery and there were fewer of them and NO peppers in the mix. We didn't even receive a discount on our check and we paid for two margaritas. Management was nice about taking my food back but never checked in on us again. I mean we didn't go there looking for 5 star dining but we expected better then mediocre. Don't waste the trip.
