I've gone here a few times the food is just ok for the most part.  What I don't like is the upcharge they add on things and never tell you about until you look at your receipt--has happened twice to me.  If you charge extra for certain things let me know about it first.  

Another issue is the attitude that you get from the workers there.  Ummmm $10 for some crap that you call tacos and served with a side of attitude? I will NOT be returning.
