Absolutely nasty nasty food and terrible service. I ordered an avocado shrimp salad and after biting the first shrimp I found it a bit sour but thought maybe it was the dressing so I took another bite without the dressing and same sour taste. I let my husband taste it just in case my taste buds were off and as soon as he bit it he spit it out. We told the waiter and all he said was did you want to order something else. No apology or nothing. I asked him if all the shrimp was the same and he said he didn't know but would give me time to think about what to order. I didn't end up ordering anything, not because of the shrimp being bad but because this waiter's lack of interest in the issue. I'm not sure if this waiter is the owner or what but he does seem a little arrogant and careless about his customers for being a "waiter". Our bill still ended up being like 78.00 which is reasonable if this was a good Mexican restaurant but it's not!!!! Do not go there. Still, when we left I expected some sort of apology for ruining my Friday night dinner and nope nothing. We just left from there and I hope this yelp review prevents a lot of disappointed customers.  You have been warned. Oh the waiter wears glasses if anyone is curious on the waiter I'm talking about.
