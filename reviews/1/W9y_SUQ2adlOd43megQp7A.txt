Cabo is fubar. My experience there was fubar. 

We went on an employee appreciation night, so it was pretty packed. 

In the beginning, I thought our server was crappy and I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt since it was employee appreciation night. I thought maybe she was just getting crappy customers and crappy tips all night long. By the end of the night, I was just convinced that she was a crappy server. 

When we got to our table, it smelled vaguely of vomit (I'm not sayin' someone vomited there ... it just smelled like someone vomited there), there was a huge puddle of something on the ground beneath the table, and my chair was sticky. We asked the hostess if we could get the puddle mopped up. They very politely obliged. 

After we got seated, our server came by to take our drink order. After that, there were unacceptably long intervals between her visits. 

The food was really bad, not seasoned well, hardly Mexican. Maybe Mexican inspired. For the food and service we got, we should have been paying Del Taco prices. 

If you order a double size of any margarita, you get to keep the glass. Classy.
