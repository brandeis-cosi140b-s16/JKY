This place used to be amazing! Quick service and very prompt with your drink/food order! One night (about a month ago) I took family here to enjoy a birthday. After I paid and made it to my car the hostess ran out like I never paid at all. They ended up charging me for the wrong bill.... So in addition to paying the bill they charged me they recharged me for the right bill.....It is now almost 25 days later and they charged me the amount they were supposed to charge me 25 days earlier.

There's one thing that you need to look out for with "quick orders" and that's making sure everything's cooked... Not cool when you get sick an hour after.....we will be taking a casa Don Juan brake.
