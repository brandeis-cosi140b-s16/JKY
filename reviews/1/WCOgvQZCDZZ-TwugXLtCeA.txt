Just left nacho daddy Downtown we walked in and were told I had to go outside to finish my beer I paid 7 dollars for I was the only one who had not finished there drink of the four of us.   Did you really think we would not order another drink and spend at least one hundred dollars on food and beverage.   Instead you kicked us out and we are at town square at millers ale house.   Your loss pretty sure no one cares
