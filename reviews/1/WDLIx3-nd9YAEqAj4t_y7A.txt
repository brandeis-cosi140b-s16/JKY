Very disappointed,  I've been going to ajo al's for at least 6-7 years now for their ugly enchilada which was what got me to go there in the 1 st place when it was featured in the AZ republic newspaper.  I just tried to order it to go and was told it was a specially item and they are out of mole so I could not order it.   Wow,  they just lost a loyal customer for life and a walking advertisement which I once was.   Didn't seem like they cared either
