I have been a long time lurker of yelp and it's sad that I break my lurking not with an extraordinary dining experience, but a very lackluster one.  This place is probably the worst mexican food I've had at a restaurant.  

I grew up in southern CA  and am married to a Mexican wife that is an excellent cook, so I feel confident that I have been exposed to really good Mexican food and this place is the furthest thing from it.  It may sound like I am being harsh, but when the restaurant has signs that say "Authentic Mexican Food" and "Arizona's finest Mexican Food since 1968" it does raise some level of expectation.  

I'm not sure how they can claim any level of authenticity when there's no aguas frescas, the cheese they use for enchiladas is cheddar instead of queso fresco, and  most of the menu resembled stuff you could get from taco bell (no mole, no chilaquiles, no chile colorado).  Even if it was "Americanized" I would be fine with it if the food tasted good, but the rice was burnt, the beans were overly greasy and the burrito had the flavor of a Costco frozen burrito.  My wife had the plate with a taco, a flauta, and an enchilada and thatt was worse than mine.

The only thing worse than being let down with bad food, is waiting a long time for bad food, which is what happened to us.
