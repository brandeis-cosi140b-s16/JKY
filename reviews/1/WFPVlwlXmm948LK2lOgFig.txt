My friends and I had a decent enough dinner earlier in the evening. Our server had hyped up their karaoke lounge that started at 11, telling us each singer would also get a free shot. And indeed, there was a sign in front stating so. We came back and it was a mess... The karaoke DJ lost my friend's slip, went on some extended break where he just stood there, maybe checking his email or bidding on an eBay auction. I did sing a song and when I asked the KJ where to get my drink, he handed me a slip and told me to take it to the bar. When I did, the bartender gave me... a cheap, plastic EMPTY cup with the Yolos logo. When I asked him what he was going to fill it with, he laughed. And the I said, "no, seriously. Where's the shot?" and again, no laughs. I can afford to buy my own drinks but don't advertise something you're not going to deliver. Shady and cheap.
