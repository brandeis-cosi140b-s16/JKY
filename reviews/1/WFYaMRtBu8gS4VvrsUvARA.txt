First time here, arrived at 5:30 and only one other table has customers. The interior is very quaint and appealing and the patio really is nicely done but the good ends there.
Sat down, waited for someone to come by (even though we basically the only ones here). Wife ordered the house margarita, terrible! Watered down no alcohol.
She orders the empanadas but 10 minutes later the waitress says "no empanadas today, what else do u want"

Still waiting ...... Where is the food??

Food arrives- it's so hot it's obvious it was microwaved.  Come with....side of lettuce leaf and two tomatoes. Did I order a burger???? So we ordered a side of rice and again comes out boiling hot from microwave 

My burrito was fair but my wife's green chile enchiladas were deplorable. 

So for a burrito, enchilada, side rice (since it's all ala carte even though they call it "plate dinner" and water down marg $32 plus tip nearly $40

Poor waitress was very sweet and we felt bad since she probably makes no $ in tips as nobody goes here.

Oh.. And the dessert I saw at Fry's grocery store. Trying to pass that off as homemade? Seriously.


Overall,This place is just a disaster and will be out of business shortly. Don't waste your time / money as its apparent nobody else does either.

Rough review? Yes but deserved. Not a care in the world on quality and client satisfaction.
