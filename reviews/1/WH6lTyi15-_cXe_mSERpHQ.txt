Had dinner at Sir Veza and I have to say review of this place is 1 out o f 5.  The food was not very good, margarita was very weak, rice tasted like it came from a box. No flavor in the Carne asada tacos, shrimp was good. My sons chimi very dry and bland. The waiter was not customer service friendly. Never again will we go, only positive thing was the manager discounted 22% off the bill.
