I ordered a burrito from here and the sour cream was literally curddled into a cottage cheese looking substance. I got a couple bites in before I saw it, and I immediately almost vomitted, along with everyone around me that saw it. Never again will I dine there, you don't even get the chance to make a mistake like that again in my book. I did not get sick, thank God, but still, gross.
