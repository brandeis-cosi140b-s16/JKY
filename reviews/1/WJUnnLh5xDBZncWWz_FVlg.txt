I just ordered from here on grub-hub, despite all of the reviews posted. I am a firm believer of seeing things for my own eyes, in this case tasting it for myself. I ordered the Chicken Crisp which was horrible, It was soggy and absolutely inedible by the time it was delivered. I also ordered the plain cheese crisp. It was a pinch of cheese in between two 4' corn tortillas. I'm not going to even write about everything else I ordered, as you can tell where this is going. But I had to give them a 1 star because the best part out of this experience was the delivery driver, not only was he punctual he was also very polite and friendly. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone based on my experience but feel free to try it for yourself.
