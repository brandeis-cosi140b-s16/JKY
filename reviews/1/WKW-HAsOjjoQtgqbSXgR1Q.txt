Ordered 2 salads and a chips and salsa. Got no salad dressing and no salsa. It was 6min before they were closing. i love chipotle this is the first time ive had a problem like this. im sure its just the location, they need to up there standards and keep this kind of stuff stocked. cant eat a salad with no salad dressing.
