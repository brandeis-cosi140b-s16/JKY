I LOVE CHIPOTLE!!! 
Just not this location -_____-
I feel horrible giving this place a one star but even Steve Ells (Chipotle GOD) would be appalled to see the long, stagnant lines in this place!! I mean 30 minutes to actually get your order in and another 10 minutes as you go down the array chipotle goodness... 40 grueling minutes just get your food! All due to inexperienced, always flustered, untrained staff... BYE FELICIA. 

*take note I usually go here around 230pm and 8pm... Not really peak times for it to be crowded. 

It's like this location messes with my emotions , I get so pissed waiting almost an hour for my chipotle bowl ... But once I take a bite out of that chicken... I fall in love with chipotle all over again.... Ugh! Management please do something about how your staff is trained !

And PLEASE teach your staff to change their gloves,,, wiping your nose and touching food is only okay if it's your own not for customers ......
