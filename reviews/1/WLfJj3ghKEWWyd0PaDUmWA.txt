Worst. Service. Ever. 

I usually frequent this location for taco Tuesday and ALWAYS get soft tacos for 99 cents. I decided to bring my family in today and could not get a worst cashier. No greeting, but instead a hand gesture telling us to wait and then she disappeared to do other things without even a greeting. When ordering, she was rude and outright insolent when SHE made a mistake while taking my order. I left without ordering. Want a good Mexican restaurant in the neighborhood? Go to the Choice gas station on Rainbow.
