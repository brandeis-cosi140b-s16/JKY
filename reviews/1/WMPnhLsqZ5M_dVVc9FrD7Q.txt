I decided to try this place with my family and the service was GREAT! Sergio and J.P. were our servers and made sure that we had a good supply of drinks, chips and salsa.  When our food came is when it went all down hill... the food was TERRIBLE, my 3 year old wouldn't even eat it, he eats everything. I had soup and the meat was HARD.... and well the broth was greasy. My g/f had the fiesta plate (she was sharing with our son) and there wasn't anything special about it at all, some of it tasted like plastic!
The only reason I gave one star at all was the service, chips and salsa. We didn't end up  paying and went and ate somewhere else. Such a disappointment this place was, and over priced too.
