Seriously this was terrible, a real shame as I had heard that the original location had some of the best Mexican food in Phoenix.  My husband and I love authentic Mexican (not just the cheese and sour cream loaded places you find around town), so the menu looked promising,

BUT...don't waste your time here.  My chicken was inedible and my husband's soup was really watered down.  Plus the service was atrocious for a place that was not busy when we were there. Shame.
