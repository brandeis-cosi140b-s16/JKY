Reading thru the latest entries, it's no surprise that my visit here was unmemorable bordering on tragic.  The cashier was rude, and kept looking at me with that "hurry up", eyes-open-wide gesture that infuriates me.  Sorry, Madame...it's my first time at this dump, forgive me if I don't have the menu memorized or know what's included in each dish.  If I could use one word to describe the dining area, it would be "sticky".  The floors, tables and chairs all needed a good cleaning.  The food I received was not great either.  The chicken chipotle burrito had way too much cilantro in it.  A little of that stuff goes a long way, and I had to (discreetly) keep picking cilantro stems out of my mouth and out of the burrito.  For a burrito that was completely standard in every respect, some cold tortilla chips and a small drink, the total came to $8.xx.  The only reason I stopped here was because it's on the way from Phoenix to MCC, but from now on I'll spend my money elsewhere.
