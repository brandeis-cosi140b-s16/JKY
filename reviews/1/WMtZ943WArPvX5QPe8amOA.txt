I recently visited this Arriba and let me say, I have never had such a horrible experience in my life. My girlfriend loves cheese, I would say she's somewhat of a connoisseur, so she ordered the queso fundido. The waitress was great, she lit the plate on fire creating a cool little show, but when we ate the cheese I nearly threw up!!! The cheese tasted rancid and sour. I thought maybe it was the everclear they added to create the wonderful light show, so we asked for a new plate without the light fire show, but when we tasted the new replacement queso fundido the same rancid taste filled my taste buds. I ordered the cheese covered chimichanga and although it tasted alright, the meat inside was not cooked completely. It's as if they threw it in the microwave for 3 minutes. The food literally took 5 min to come out from the moment we ordered it. I feel that had alot to do with the poor quality and taste of the food. I would not recommend this place to anyone.
