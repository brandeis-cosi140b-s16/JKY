I don't say this about many places, but this place was disgusting. I got the chicken enchiladas and the entire plate was drenched in their medium chile sauce that tasted like sweet and sour sauce, making it inedible. After eating what I could of it, I had a bad stomachache the rest of the day. 

Save yourselves and head over to Chipotle which is in the same plaza.
