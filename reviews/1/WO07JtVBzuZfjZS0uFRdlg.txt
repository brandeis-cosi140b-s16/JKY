This is the longest wait I have ever had at to get wait at a taco bell. They gave me a discount because of the absurd amount of time that I had to wait. 
 She failed to give me my receipt so I have no way of knowing what the discount was or what the discount was said to be for. I will never be returning to this establishment and may rethink going to any of the franchises.
