Thought I'd give this location a try from the one I usually go to in Surprise but I have to say it's even worse.
Despite it being a little more spacious than the one in Surprise, the eating area wasn't well cleaned by staff with food on the tables and floor (-1)
The food in our orders looked as if it was tossed up in the air as it was all on one side of the bowl (-1)
The food contained numerous bits of burnt ingredients (-1)
The portion sizes was lacking in comparison to other locations and there was little of everything like rice, etc (-1)
Guess I'll have to look for another alternative location.
