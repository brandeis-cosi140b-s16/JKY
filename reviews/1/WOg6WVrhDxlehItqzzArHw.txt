If you would like to be treated rudely overcharged and ignored this is the place to go! After we sat down we waited 10 minutes to get anyone to pay attention to us. I flagged down a waiter and asked him for some water. Your server will get that for you he answered in a snarly voice. My friend replied really we been here 10 minutes and haven't seen anyone. I said your server will have to get that for you he snarled. I got up to the bar and asked to speak to the manager who came to the table. When I began to tell her about his treatment she said oh he's only a busboy. I told her I didn't care if he owned the place that was no way to treat a customer. She apologized and asked for a drink order. 10 minutes later my friends Margarita was still not anywhere to be seen. I looked in the bartenders direction with an exasperated look. He pointed at a drink sitting on the bar and pointed back at me I nodded and said yes that would be ours! He brought it over to the table. When the check came we were overcharged by two margaritas.  I told I waitress Jennifer who was the only nice thing about the place and she comped my beer. The management did not extend any courtesies no comps and no further apologies for the horrible time we had. Service can make or break a dining experience and this one broke it. Don't hire teenagers with attitudes higher people like Jennifer who go the extra mile and while you're at it at some flavor to your food!  You not only lost a few customers tonight I am going to make sure and tell everyone I know about our horrific dining experience! I know I'm not alone since I see many similar comments on Yelp!
