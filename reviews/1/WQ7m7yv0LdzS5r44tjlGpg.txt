What is up with this place?   I have been going to La Paz since it was in its first location, even before it was on South Blvd.  It really has gone downhill.  I keep giving it a chance, because it has always been my go to Mexican Resturant choice.  They have amazing queso.  The last 5 times that I have tried to give this place a chance it has been out of whatever I want to order, their machines are broken and once the whole kitchen was closed.  There is never more than two parties in the place and the service is extremely slow.  One server is so timid he acts like he is afraid to approach the table to take your order.  When you ask him any questions he acts like he is clueless to whatever you are saying.  I may give it one more chance, but doubtful.  Clearly the management doesn't care!
