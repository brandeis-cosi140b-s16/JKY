Store# D212063 fast food??? I think NOT!!! I pulled into the Drive thru tonight at 7:07 pm and did not drive off with my food until 7:36 pm. Almost 30 mins for 1 order!!! 12 mins of that time was from when I ordered my food to when I drove off with my order! I knew that this store always took a long time to get orders out but, 30 mins?!?!? I could have gone to a sit down restaurant and got my food faster! I do not plan to ever return to this store again!!!
