Terrible service. It took 20 minutes before we saw our waiter. 
My wife's shrimp dish was cold, and had to be sent back. 
My Chile Colorado was tough and stringy. The flavor was marginal at best. 
There are many decent Mexican restaurants in Pittsburgh and a few really good ones. This is at the bottom of the pile.
We will not return.
