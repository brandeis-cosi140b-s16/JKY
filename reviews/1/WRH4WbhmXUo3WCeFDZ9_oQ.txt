I had been interested to try El Pollo Loco for some time, as it looked like a better alternative to Taco Bell. Nope, this was not the case.

I went through the drive- through. Even though it was only 11:15, the order taker said, "We're out of fajitas". How is that even possible? I asked for a little time so I could think of what to order, and then someone a different person took my order. Based on the way he dressed, I think he was the manager. I watched him put a container of macaroni and cheese with a moderate amount of sauce dripping down the side in the bag. So all containers, napkins, and foil wraps in the bag were covered in sauce while he handed it to me; I could SEE it all through the bag. I just grabbed everything and left. How can I complain to the manager when he is the one who did it?

As far as the food goes...the beef torta was super soggy; I only ate 1/4 of it. The macaroni and cheese was ok, but I couldn't differentiate between this and Chinese buffet Mac n cheese.
