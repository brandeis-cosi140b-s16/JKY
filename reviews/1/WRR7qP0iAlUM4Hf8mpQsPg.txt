I come to America's strictly for their beans but want to stop coming here because of their staff.  This review is several months in the making, I have a 30 min lunch break so time is of the essence when it comes to getting food.  I will place an online order 30+ min in advance, only to get there and find it has not been made or even started cooking yet. Queue a 10-20 min wait while they prepare it and most of my lunch is down the toilet.  My coworker has even resorted to typing "please make sure food is ready on time" in the special instructions notes on the online ordering form.

Besides the long prep time, orders have been incorrect, items have been left out, it takes 4 or 5 times of repeat spelling of my name for them to start my order (S as in Sam, E-R-I), and most recently the to go lid was loose on my beans and most of them ended up inside the to go bag.  Wait you say, wouldn't gravity stop the beans from leaking?  Not when the server places the to go container on its side in the bag instead of right side up.  I now have a nice oil stain on my front seat from the leak.  The place is hardly busy so being in the weeds is not a plausible excuse.

Either better train your employees, or find competent staff.  Tacos are not Rock Science.
