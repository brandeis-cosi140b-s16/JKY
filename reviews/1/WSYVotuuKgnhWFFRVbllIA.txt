My husband always goes to this location, while I frequent the horizon ridge location.  I think today was his last trip here. The last two times They can't get an order right causing him to go back for it to be corrected.  They charged him .50 for a debit transaction when the sign states credit transactions would only be charged and I found a tooth pick hiding in my rolled tacos (which had no meat) and I almost choked.  Yes it's not fine dining but you are spending hard earned cash.  This place is a joke and gives the Roberto's  name a bad rap.  Buyer beware!
