I went here with some friends for happy hour and I really wish I'd spent my money elsewhere. The atmosphere was awful, the chips tasted like cardboard and it was constantly difficult to get the waitresses's attention. The place was packed and we were stuck in a booth in a back corner which was FREEZING cold. I was not a fan of the crowd, the music, the location, the food. I've experienced worse, but this was pretty bad. I will not be going back.
