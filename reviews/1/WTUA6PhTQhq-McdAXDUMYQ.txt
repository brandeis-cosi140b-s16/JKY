Came here on a whim with my bestie. They couldn't get an order right. I wanted my order of nachos without onions and add chicken, and my vegetarian friend ordered just the nachos. Gave me onions and no chicken, and her no onions with chicken. Took those back, and second time around I got onions on my plate. I ended up just not eating. Server guy was a little douchy, and I didn't even give him a hard time about it. Like "Na dude, I'm just going to chill while she eats. No worries." Won't be coming back. Also, chips were oily.
Bye La Fondalesha.
Confirmed douchiness of the waiter. Just complimented my review. "You're cool." Thank you. Also, here's a tip* since I forgot to leave one on the table. Find a new occupation.
