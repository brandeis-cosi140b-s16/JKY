This is the location inside Arizona mills mall. My wife and I ordered a couple two item dishes and shared them. Nothing was good here. Chips and salsa are bland. Tacos, tamales, and enchiladas were all flavorless. Even the rice is weird and left an awful after taste. We didn't finish anything, didn't take our leftovers to go. Paid the unbelievably high bill and walked out never to return. Yuck.
