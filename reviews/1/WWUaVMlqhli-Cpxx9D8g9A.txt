I'm only giving this restaurant 1 star for the food being edible when hungry, but aside from that avoid it at all costs, completely deceiving. It may look nice and modern from the outside, but the food is too pricey, and tasteless. I had the beer battered fish tacos-the fish was too fishy, the tacos overall had no taste that not even lime fixed them. Then I ordered the tortilla soup that was 8$-2 oz, completely overpriced! After, I had a margarita that hardly had any alcohol; it was okay, but definitely too pricey, as well. When going to the Linq, go somewhere else if u have a real appetite for food!
