Came here for dinner on a Friday night with wifey.

In summary:  Value just not realized.  Sat outside with heaters and Christmas music which was the highlight of the visit.

Food and drink way over priced.  For a place with the name of TQLA, I would hope to taste it in the $10 margaritas.

We will be back for a happy hour....maybe.  never again for dinner.

Pass.
