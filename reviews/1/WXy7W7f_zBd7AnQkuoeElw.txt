Alright, it hurts me to do this, but after today, Poncho's is dead to me. I was a faithful customer for years as I grew up in the Laveen area. I returned today, excited for the same quality and feeling a little nostalgic. 

Bleh. It was incredibly loud and every table had a crying baby. Don't get me wrong, I love babies, but every reasonable person has limits. Also, our waitress was awful. I'm not usually too picky, but she didnt once come by after our food was dropped off to ask how everything was. She was morose, made no effort to engage and everything we wanted, we had to chase her down for. 

And we arrive...at the food. The zucchini appetizer is off the menu, big disappointment. My beef tamale was awful. I would have sent it back had my waitress ever returned. My chicken enchilada was edible but tasted like one of those frozen entrees. The salsa is still good, but I'm not about to drive down to south Phoenix if everything else sucks. 

Sorry, Poncho's. You used to be high on my list but you've really lost a lot of flavor and character since my last visit.
