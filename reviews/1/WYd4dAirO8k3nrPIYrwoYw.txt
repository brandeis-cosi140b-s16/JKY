Worst service at a restaurant ive ever had. 25min just to get my food in drive thru. Then I realze my order is wrong. Took then another 5min to fix it but they screwed it up in another way. So 10 more min to fix it again. Drive thru and inside full of waiting people. Slowest crappiest service ever. Food not bad but not worth my lost time
