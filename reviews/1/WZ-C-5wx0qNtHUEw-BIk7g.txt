not sure what has happened to Macayo's but it's definitely not the restaurant it used to be. Food was gross. Not near as tasty as it used to be. stale chips no hot sauce. waitress was  terrible. Had a toddler at NO TIME did she ask if we needed a high chair. We had to chase her down to ask. she acted like she didn't want to be there. had a family member come in from out of state for some she always used to get there and the food just gross!!1
