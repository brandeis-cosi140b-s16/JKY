Someburros food is quite flavorless, to the extent it doesn't seem possible. The pollo fundido simply tasted like a bland fried tortilla with chicken that had the right texture, but no taste to speak of.

It is really a miracle that they could made such boring mexican fare. Even the hot sauce, which had the right color and a tad bit of heat, lacked evidence of taste that it may have come from chili pepper.

The one redeeming feature of this place is the staff was very pleasant. But the food certainly is not worth the visit.
