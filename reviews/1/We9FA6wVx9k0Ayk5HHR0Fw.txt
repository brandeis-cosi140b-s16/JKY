Worst Service I ever had! Our party waited over an hour and a half for food to arrive, we waited 20-30 minutes for chips & salsa and even for them to bring us drinks!! When we complained about the long wait the manager and owner did not want to hear it! It was obvious they don't want to improve their restaurant by listening to customer suggestions. They were rude and flat out did not care to insult US paying customers for letting them know their food took too long!! We will never go back, good Mexican food can easily be found anywhere and this place was pricey and the food was mediocre,  so you won't be missing anything by skipping this place and going somewhere else were customers are valued!
