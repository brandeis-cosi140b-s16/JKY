I picked up a couple of tacos and when I got home there was a live bug with wings in it, I was very disgusted. I took it back and there were no apologies and the staff actually laughed about it and then offered me another taco, I declined and asked for my money back which they did give me. I understand that bugs can get in food from time to time but I felt like a sympathetic apology was in order, very disappointed!
