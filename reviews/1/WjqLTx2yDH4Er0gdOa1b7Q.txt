Seriously awful ,   I had a burrito which was plain and tasteless, chips were junk and salsa was a joke. Really too bad this place will fail like others in this spot. What Mexican joint serves ravioli? I guess hacienda is trying to redefine but with no success. Go to rubios and you'll get better taste.
