After reading through other reviews to see if my experience was a freak accident or not,... I see that DD&D might have gotten this one wrong. My boyfriend was excited to share this place with me, and has brought friends here in the past with great experiences. Ours, however, was not.  
We went on a Saturday evening and they were already out of about half of the options (including the cookies). The food was ok, and nobody was sick later (hence the one star). The floor was filthy, Seriously, the worst part was when we were told they were closing, sodas were shut down, and we were basically escorted out.  Getting belted in the parking lot, we noticed that the official smoke break began almost precisely 30 seconds after the doors were locked.  Obviously their paying customers are their priority.  
Hopefully the owners see these reviews and return to the good food that DD&D and my friend expect and have raved about.  What I experienced?.....nah.
