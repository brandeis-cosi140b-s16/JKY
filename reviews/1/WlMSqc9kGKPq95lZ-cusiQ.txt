I think I must've missed something with the reviews so complimentary on here. When we walked in we didn't understand what to do(you have to walk in back to order). The order took awhile and they misunderstood when I said I wanted 1 taco not 2. Then I got the taco and the shell was soggy and gross and the meat was meh.
