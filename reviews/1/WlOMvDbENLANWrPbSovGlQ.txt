My girlfriend and I stopped in to grab some food to go on Cinco de Mayo. We placed our order and chatted with some friends in the meantime. After about 45 minutes our order was finally ready. When we were leaving we realized we had not gotten our chips, so we asked for them and a few minutes later they returned with a bag of chips with a container of salsa in the bag that was open and dripping out of the bottom of the bag. When we got home we discovered they had left out an entire entree of fish tacos. The food we did get literally tasted like an ashtray. I'm not sure how this is possible but it had a smokey, rotten taste. My girlfriend called to tell them they had left out part of our order and gave them her name so they could locate the order. They were rude to her telling her "name-dropping doesn't work here." We won't be going back....
