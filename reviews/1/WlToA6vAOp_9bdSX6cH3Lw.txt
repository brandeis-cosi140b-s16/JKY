We visited this place today for the first time.  We've driven by it countless times, on our way to Target, or Chipotle.  We had an Entertainment Book coupon so we decided to check it out.  BIG mistake.

The service was really terrible.  The ladies behind the counter were pretty rude, and obviously did not want to be working there.  The salsa bar was disgusting, with warm salsa (!) which had little to no taste, if that's even possible.  We ordered a barbacoa burrito, a bean and cheese burrito and a kids' quesadilla.  Only the quesadilla was edible.  We are Mexican food aficinados, but this was truly gross food.  (I have an iron stomach and got extremely sick within an hour of eating the barbacoa burrito.)

The icing on the cake of our visit, so to speak, was the cheap wicker type seats on the chairs.  Two nasty splinters became embedded in our young daughter's knit pants/rear end, causing her to cry in pain.  Nice.
