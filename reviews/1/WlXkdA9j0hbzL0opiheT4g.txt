I thought I'd try this place again, but that was a bad decision! My salad had watery brown lettuce, brown watery guacamole and was honestly just gross. It is over $10 for a salad here and that is crazy to me since its neighbors are Gadzooks and Chipotle where I can get 4-5* quality for at least a couple of dollars less.
