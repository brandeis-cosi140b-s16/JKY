I've NEVER been to a restaurant where they can't serve over half of the items on their menu 30 minutes before they close because they CHOOSE to stop making food! We arrived at 8:30pm on a Sunday, and they have a close time of 9pm. We waited in line for 12 minutes before we were next to be serviced. The employee told us there were only some ingredients left for certain bowls. I've worked in retail and food service, and I've never closed up shop over 30 minutes early without being able to support customers for that remaining amount of time. Otherwise, we would close early so that we don't waste customers time standing in line! Wtf
