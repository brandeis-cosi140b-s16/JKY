Hated the food! Hated the stomach issues! Hated the prices!! 12 bucks for tacos with no flavor and rice that......well cant explain that one. Thank god i did not have the beans also or i may still be on the toilet. I saw many reviews on the party vibe and they are right. If you want to come for the drinks with friends this is your place. My wife and i thought after seeing the menu to bolt but we didn't. And both of our stomaches and wallet payed the price.
