What happened to this place.

Ordered 2 California burritos and it was disgusting. There was no taste and the meat was debatable.

Ordered Carne Asada fries and it tasted like mush as well. Fries were soggy and everything else was lacking flavor.

Worst part? I WAS DRUNK WHEN I THOUGHT IT WAS GROSS.. SO YOU KNOW IT WAS PROBABLY PRETTY BAD! AND HOW DID MY BILL END UP BEING $14 FOR 3 ITEMS?!

Nachos from Taco Bell would have been a better choice.. damn it. Don't eat here.
