Blech. Similar to some of my other Vegas reviews, this place will unfortunately be subject to scrutiny over the one thing I ordered from it. My friends and I all got the $20 giant margaritas (which are about 17" tall, for those curious), and we all regretted it. Extremely heavy on the syrup and not heavy at all on the liquor. No one finished their drink, and we all stopped taking gulps of grossly sour slush at about the same point in our enormous souvenir cups. And the sad thing was, we weren't even buzzed in the slightest to show for it. So even though you see folks strutting around with their huge margaritas...your money is better spent elsewhere =).
