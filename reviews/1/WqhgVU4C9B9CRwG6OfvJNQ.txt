6461 Boulder Hwy.  Las Vegas, NV 89121 Taco Bell sucks so bad.  Just went through their drive thru and it took 25 minutes.  After being annoyed with the delay I decided to take their survey.  AND I CAN'T.  My receipt doesn't include the survey code, it says it's a reprint.  Probably given out like that to avvoid getting bad surveys due to taking forever on their drive thru time.  This Taco Bell is so awful!
