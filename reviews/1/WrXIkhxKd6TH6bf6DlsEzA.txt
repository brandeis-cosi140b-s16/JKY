We tried this place a couple of years ago and weren't impressed.  Thinking perhaps we may have just hit them on an off night, we decided to give them another chance last week.  Sad to say, we should have stayed with our first impression.  After we were seated, it took nearly 10 minutes for anyone to acknowledge we were there and at least get some water.  This was just the beginning of extremely poor service.  When our food arrived, mine was wrong.  I had ordered beef enchiladas and received chicken.  When I pointed it out to our server, he offered to take it back, but being that my spouse had already been served, it didn't seem fair for their food to go cold while waiting for mine, so I just accepted what they served.  As before, the first time we were there, the food itself barely made mediocre.  Mexican cusine is one of my absolute favorites and this one repeatedly falls short.  There is no life in their plates.  The food just sits there begging to be taken away.  It is bland and unimaginative and very unsatisfying.  I understand that this is one of three or four locations Michoacan has in the greater Las Vegas area.  This one has runied the brand for me and I most assuredly will not be returning here or to any of the other locations.
