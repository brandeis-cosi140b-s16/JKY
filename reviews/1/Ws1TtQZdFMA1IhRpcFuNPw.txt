Ok let me prefect the fact that I never write reviews on yelp.  I also am the most sympathetic individual to restaurants due to the amount of time I spent working for wonderful establishments throughout my service career.  

My colleague and I walk into LaPaz, and there is probably 5 people in the restaurant, but it takes 5 minutes to even see a worker (who quickly looks away as she doesn't want to have to deal with us), and then another 2 minutes to be greeted.   We seat and a few minutes later, and are greeted by our server. We try and order guacamole (avocado, pico, and onion) only to be told the food preparer came in late and that would not be available.  When To  we tried to order... Tamales too would not be available.  The only two things I ever get here would not be available. 

My colleague went to the men's bathroom and there were no towels, typically one could deal with a lack of towels, given the high end hand dryer.... This didn't work either.  Icing on the cake.  

I hate when reviewers go on rants, and I just can't relate. So take this with a grain of salt.  My colleague and myself live for a good restaurant, and we used to love this place.  It used to be amazing, even after they moved from south blvd.  At this point I am exceedingly disappointed, probably will not be back.  The only difference between LaPaz and Taco Bell is warm tequila at best.
