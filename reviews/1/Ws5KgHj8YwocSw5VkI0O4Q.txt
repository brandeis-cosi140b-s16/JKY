I had their CA burrito combo for lunch on a Thursday 

- A CA burrito without fries? Big time FAIL. Disappointing. 
- Red sauce was good.
- I think this is 'nuff said. Take it off the menu if you can't make it right. lol. 
- Don't come here for Americanized Mexican food. Great for people that never had SD Mexican food.
- Their hard shredded beef tacos were tasty.
