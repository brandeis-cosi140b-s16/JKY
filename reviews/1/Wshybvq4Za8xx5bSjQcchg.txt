Here's the thing. I'm a server. I am very understanding and don't ask for much and I tend to tip much more than necessary. I had been looking forward to trying this place ever since it opened down the street from me, only to be infuriated; the funny thing is is that we left before we even got a drink order.

When my boyfriend and I arrived the place was empty (there was only one party there, and they were checking out). There were two servers there. They saw us and didn't greet us until ten minutes after we had been standing there. One of them was literally doing nothing and was too lazy to walk from the bar to us. The other was serving her table like we weren't there. Once the party leaves, one of the servers FINALLY came over to say hi, she just said "Oh yeah just sit anywhere.". Not only that, but she watched me as I gathered the menus right in front of her. I had to gather my own menus? Really? I was extremely upset by the time we sat down, but I was really excited to try out Jorge's so I decided to try and stick it out and give the server a chance to redeem herself. Once we sat down we waited. And waited. And waited. We were the ONLY party there in the restaurant after the other party had left. The server had gone and disappeared! We had sat there for a good 5 minutes until I finally said "Screw it. I'm pissed off and I'm not going to enjoy this whatsoever.". And so we left. Without a server even coming to our table or saying good bye. Nothing.

Whoever worked Tuesday (4/21/15) at around noon really screwed up. I don't think I can even return because now it will just piss me off remembering that incident.
