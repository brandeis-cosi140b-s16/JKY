The food here is edible but not much better than that.  I have gotten food delivered from here and have eaten in the restaurant and have never eaten the food and said man I gotta order that again.  The tacos use lettuce instead of cilantro which I am not a fan of.  There are far better places to get Mexican food in Madison.
