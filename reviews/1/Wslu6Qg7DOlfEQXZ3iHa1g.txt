My friends and I went to Taco Haus today for dinner because I was told by a classmate that it was new and it was good...Well I am thinking that he has never tasted good food because it was very far from good. We went because we like trying new places but the food lacked something...and not just 1 or 2 items but everything we had lacked something. First the chips, salsa and guac. The salsa was way too smoky and in reading different reviews I was disappointed to here that there was a green salsa as well as the too smoky brown salsa. The guac was good and so were the chips..and that was about it aside from the soda. We all order Carne asada tacos and the meat was very tough, there was wayyyy to much pickling on the tacos. I ordered the columbian rice as well because I usually like columbian rice. However in the past the columbian rice I have had has a little spice to it but this rice was so gross. It had absolutely no flavor what so every. We then got the chirizo empanadas and the best I have to say about them is the outer crust. The chirizo lacked something and I have tasted better chirizo back in my hometown of Milwaukee. Overall a huge disappointment for the price. Chipotle is much better for mexican. We will not return for sure. So disappointed too because I really like the brat haus
