There are 2 soap dispensers in the bathroom,  but they're both completely empty.  Are employees washing their hands? They certainly aren't washing the tables - every single one is filthy.  Two of the employees have been on their cell phones since i got here.  Now i understand why this place always looks deserted. Really,  you don't have to try HARD to have a successful Roberto's in Las Vegas.  But you do need to try.
