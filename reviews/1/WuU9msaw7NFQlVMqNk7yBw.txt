While I was there, everyone's orders were getting mixed up, and instead of being apologetic, the employees were just getting angry and had major attitude toward the customers. I had 2 separate orders. One of them got lost and forgotten about while I reminded them every time they looked at me like, what are you still doing here??  The other one, I was told to wait on, because the pico was being made... but a different employee was really angry about me waiting for the pico, wrapped up my burrito and told me to forget the pico, with the worst attitude ever... All the customers seemed like they were trying to walk on eggshells, in hopes of ending up with some kind of food that wasn't what they wanted, but hopefully end up with something in the end! All in all, my $8 burrito was comparable to a $6 Chipotle burrito, but without the toppings that I had asked for. The meat was tough, as it often is at chipotle.  I should have gone to a berto's, and paid $4-5 for what I actually asked for, in a much shorter time frame, without all the negative attitude. I won't be going back. I have never taken the time to write a yelp review until now. This place really motivated me to!
