I'm a disable vet and my friend wanted to try this place. I walked in with my service dog and the girl behind the counter told me that the dog could stay but she would have to be under the table and quite. I asked for a manager and he was not there. So they sent out the kitchen manager. She could not speak english and when a gave her my ada card on service dogs , she could not read it.She said that she did not think the dog should be there because she does not have the license for it.So she stood over the table watching us eat and the dog.I dont know if I should contact the ada and let them know about this place.I called the other tonys and asked for the manager and he wqas not in , so i asked for the general manager and they dont have one.
