We went there yesterday for lunch. I had a gift card and had asked them to see how much was on the gift card. They said they would check and never did. We then ordered our lunch. I had the chicken wrap, and my friend had a burrito that was supposed to be in a blue tortilla. The chicken wrap was TERRIBLE. All it was stuffed with was lettuce. I told the bartender, who was also our waiter, and he actually agreed with me, and said yes there was lots of lettuce in them, but this is how they are supposed to be made. WHAT?????? He never did any apologizing or tried to make things right. My friend got her lunch, but  never was served her blue tortilla. I have been to this place 2 times in my life and both times was not good. I would not recommend this to anyone.
