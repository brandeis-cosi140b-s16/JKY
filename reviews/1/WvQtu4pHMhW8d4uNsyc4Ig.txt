Don't waste your time.  Blah food, horrible service, the waiter was very nice but seemed way over worked.  The salsa had zero taste, my daughters cheese quesadilla was dripping in grease, they never brought her sour cream, but charged us for it.  My husband and I shared fish tacos and they were BLAND, the menu said they came with "special sauce" but when they came there wasn't any sauce, we asked for it but never got it.
