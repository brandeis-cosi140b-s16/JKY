I moved to AZ two years ago.  Unfortunately this is the closest Taco Bell to my home.  I have given this location 5 opportunities to fulfill one wish - burrito supreme NO BEANS.  5 times I've ordered, 5 times I've received a burrito with beans.  I've tried ordering it by simply saying "no beans" - came with beans.  This last time I said "no beans EVERYTHING ELSE THE SAME"  - came with beans.  It reads NO BEANS on the screen.  It says the same thing in the kitchen, right?  Guess not.  Never once was it made incorrectly back home in IL.  Guess I'll stick to TB once per year when I go home to visit.  
Service is always very friendly.  Too bad the crew creating the food doesn't pay attention.
