This place was horrible, service was the worst I've ever had! Server took our order and never came back to the table. Busboy had to bring water and dessert. 

When we asked for the manager, he said he was busy. Another server brought our bill and there was a 20% gratuity for our lazy server! the patio was full, but all the staff were hanging around the bar talking. 

Don't ever ask for more chips, second basket is $3! I don't recommend this place to anyone! You're better off at Taco Bell. 

I called the next day to speak to a manager, left a message, never got a return phone call. 

Lazy staff!! Go back to Mexico!!
