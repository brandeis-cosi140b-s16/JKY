I live in Surprise and have been wanting to try this place since we don't have an abundance of Mexican food choices. I'm sorry I did!  
The chips were overdone and the salsa was bland! 
I ordered a simple meal (#1) taco and enchilada with rice and beans.  The description says "taco and (beef or chicken) cheese enchilada". I ordered the beef taco. When my plate came, I really tried to like it. I'm generally pretty easy to please but nothing about this was right!  The taco was as skinny and skimpy on the meat as a jack n the box taco, the beans, rice and enchilada sauce were cold. And the enchilada was beef, not cheese. I'm talking a sweet tasting mushy beef! When the server brought my margarita I told her I was expecting a cheese enchilada and she rudely said, " You need to tell the server when you order or we make it all beef."  I politely told her I asked for the taco to be beef but didn't expect that to apply to the enchilada. She just stared at me and repeated you had to have told the server when you ordered. So I just replied "ok."  I managed to eat maybe 1/3 of this sorry $8.99 meal.  Would it have been too much for her to have switched it out for me?
As far as drinks, we were NEVER offered refills of our water or tea. (And the place was almost empty on this 6:00 pm Monday evening dinner.). The $2.99 house margarita was in a tiny ice filled glass. I expected small for that price but I also hoped for some flavor. This was basically watered down lime juice. My husband's bottled Corona was fine. 
My husbands enchilada style burro was fine and my sons chicken taco salad was fine. 
Unfortunately, I was the one who loves Mexican food and was excited about trying it. Sorry Las Caquelas...never again. Taco Bell has you beat by a long shot!
