I am from San Diego and visited this facility on Wednesday with my family in hopes of some delicious Mexican food. Unfortunately, it was terrible. I ordered 2 of the Carne Asada Fries and 2 carne asada tacos and 3 drinks. The total was overpriced at  $25.  The tacos were small treet tacos and the carne asada fries were a small saucer size serving. The carne asada fries has some nasty nacho cheese, which I have never seen on carne asada fries before. I have to say this was the worst mexican food I have ever had in my life! I will never come back to that place. BTW they get 1 star because I cannot post with no stars.
