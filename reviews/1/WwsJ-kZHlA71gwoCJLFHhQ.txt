Had the worst experience at this place.  I was going to hire them to cater my party but after the rudeness I experienced from the cashier I won't even set foot in that place.  I went there to order a machaca breakfast burrito this morning.  It took them more than 20 minutes to prepare and I asked if I can cancel my order and get my money back and the cashier said it's almost done.  So I waited and took another 5 minutes.  So when she handed me my burrito she had the nerve to tell me that "this is a restaurant not a drive thru"  I told her most taco places I go to doesn't take that long to make breakfast burrito.  Her come back to me is "next time go to there then".  

Word to the owner..who you hire to be in the front line could either make or break your business.  Hiring someone with that bad attitude will definitely break your business.  There are a lot of taco places in Las Vegas which people can go to..like the girl who works there suggested to me.  I am making sure that I put out the word that your place is not the place to go.  I will make sure to tell everyone that your so called "restaurant" is not the place to eat.  Frankly your restaurant doesn't even deserve a star.  

You want good street taco!!  Go to Los Tacos at Sahara and Arville
