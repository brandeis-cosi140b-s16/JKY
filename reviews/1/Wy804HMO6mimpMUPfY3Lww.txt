I really hate going to a restaurant, really liking the food and then having to trash them for something other than the food.. I had the chicken enchilada combo, it was great. The portions were good, the sauce was yummy and the chicken was seasoned well. 

So we eat and get the check when my friend notices an extra charge on there for $1.50. After combing over the bill we are perplexed at what that charge is for, so we ask the waitress. Well apparently a second helping of chips and salsa in not free at Tony's. WTF?

Why this REALLY irritates me is three-fold. First  if you are served chips and salsa without asking when you sit down at the table, it sets the precedence that chips and salsa are complimentary. I mean pretty much every Mexican Restaurant does it these days so its not a far stretch to assume this. Second. the waitress did not mention there was an extra charge for a second helping. That would have been nice. Duh!  Finally the serving of chips and salsa we were served was minuscule. At a $1.50 we were overcharged for the portion, I am sure their cost was something like 7 cents.

That leaves me to feel like they pulled a bait and switch. Too bad, I really liked my lunch. The hair-brained policy of charging for small portions of chips and salsa cost you a star and you lose another for the waitress not saying anything to our party about it.
