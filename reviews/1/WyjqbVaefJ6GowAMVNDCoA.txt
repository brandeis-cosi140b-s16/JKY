I used to come here on Tuesday's for grad school after I got tired of the neighboring meal options. I always got a chicken quesadilla and on two different occasions I had bone in my quesadilla. The first was more annoying that harmful, but the second time I was absolutely awestruck. How do you not notice a chicken bone that size? It was also sharp and I feel lucky that I was not hurt. See my picture and you'll understand why I have never been back.
