I LOVE Salsarita's...but this location is falling into disrepair. The tables are filthy, our last trip there both stalls in the woman's bathroom were broken, there were flies swarming the food bar. All the employee's seemed miserable and inconvenienced. And we had to ask for...and then wait 20min for the poquito that comes with the kids meal for our son. This is not acceptable for Rivergate and I'll gladly drive somewhere else or go to another location before consuming food in that filth.
