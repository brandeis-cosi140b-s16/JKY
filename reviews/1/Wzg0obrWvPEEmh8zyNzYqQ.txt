I've had my fair share of not-so-great "Mexican" fast food, but this place makes Chipotle look authentic. 
If you're looking for some good gut-rot, you've found the right place!
Aside from the salsa verde being nice & hot, the only flavor in my chicken bowl was cilantro. And lots of it. 
Go to the aforementioned Chipotle. Go to something ending in -berto's or -beto's. Just skip this place. 
If anyone needs me this afternoon, I'll be in stall #2.
