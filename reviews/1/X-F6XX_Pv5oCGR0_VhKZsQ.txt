First time here. Poor experience overall. Our server got to us quickly but was pretty disconnected after initial visit to get drink orders. I tried a patron blended margarita that was almost completely ice and my date had one as well that was a bit better. It took about 30 minutes for the server to take our food order despite us being 1of 2 tables in the restraunt.
I ordered the green Chile enchilada which was O.K. at best. My date ordered two tacos and it looked like we got them out of a taco bell drive through. The chips were stale and didn't come with salsa, but had a taco/enchilada sauce with them.
All in all we paid 70$ for a meal and two drinks each. This price is very reasonable for quality food and drink, however I do not feel we got that here. I will not be coming back here ever again.
