Went to El Pollo Loco today, ordered a salad..took it home and most of the lettuce was brown and black and close to moldy. Took it back to the store and the manager Julio Martinez with no apology said this is what happens to lettuce sometimes. I asked him if this was acceptable to serve to guests and he said yes. Asked him again and he said yes.  The first thing out of his mouth should have been I'm so sorry what can I do to fix this. But instead he blamed the lettuce and that this is normal. OMG!!!! I am not going to let this one go, called his supervisor and corporate. Unreal
