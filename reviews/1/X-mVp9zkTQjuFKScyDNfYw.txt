The filthiest chipotle I've ever been to. Dirty tables stay dirty until you bring it to their attention. Took 15 mins to go through a line with only three people in it , just to get a bowl meal. Managers excuse  was some imaginary online order no one was working on in a meantime. A few more people in line were not happy about the wait time. And no apology when a customer complains. 
Going to void this location!
