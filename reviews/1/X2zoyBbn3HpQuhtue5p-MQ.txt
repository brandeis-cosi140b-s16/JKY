I tried this place on a whim ordering via Delicious Deliveries, the restaurant delivery service. Now, I kept my expectations low considering we were having it delivered instead of dining in the restaurant. (No, we're not lazy, I swear. It was midterm season.) Even with that in mind, we're concluding if we were some strange alien species visiting the planet for the first time and ate what we ate here, we would turn around and never come back.

I had chicken and beef flautas and a beef tamale with green chili a la carte while my friend ordered a chimichanga. My friend went to town on his chimichanga, actually lifting his head before the meal was finished, which is always a bad sign. Apparently, it was bland and dry - now with sauce gushing out of its every orifice, that's a pretty "amazing" achievement. 

The beef tamale was "eh" - slightly higher than "urgh" but lower than "meh" on the yummy scale. The flautas were cooked to a crisp. So crispy, in fact, I could almost hear my father screaming in slow-mo about carcinogens while staring at the blackened ends. So I turned to the sopapillas, certain that at least they couldn't mess up dessert. (They could.) The sopapillas were hard and overcooked - how in the world do you mess up sopapillas?! C'mon! They were also so saturated with cinnamon sugar that I took a knife, scraped the excess away, and had enough to top an additional fifteen sopapillas. Pretty much the only thing that was somewhat tasty was the cream cheese concoction that came with the sopapillas.

And to think we suffered the after-effects of Mexican food without ever really enjoying the benefits... laaaame.
