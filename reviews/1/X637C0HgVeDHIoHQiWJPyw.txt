The food was nothing special. Went there for Sunday lunch. They were not very busy but still waited 20 minutes to have our order taken. Then when we finally got our order the food was very bland. Then it took another 20 minutes to receive my check , which I had to asked for. Regardless to say I will not be returning to this restaurant.
