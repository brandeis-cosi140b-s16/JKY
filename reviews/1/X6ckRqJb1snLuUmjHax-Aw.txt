This is the second time I called one day in advance to make an order to pick the following day at 8am. First time they even didn't have my name nor my order.... so I waited there for 30 minutes. 
Yesterday, I called again to pre order to pick up my order today at 8am (I gave them the benefit of the doubt).... This time they did exactly the same even though I told them what happened to me last time.
Management not present and place is a total mess.
No one is accountable for their actions.
Will never visit this place again. They lost a customer and I will spread the word!!
I even gave them my number for manager to call me and guess what!  They never did....
