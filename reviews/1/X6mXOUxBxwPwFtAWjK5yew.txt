My friend and I met here for lunch last week and we wanted to try something new that neither of us has ever been before. It was my first and it will be my last time too. Boy or boy were we both very sorry and extremely disappointed... Our server had an attitude with us because we wanted to just sit and catch up before we ordered. Once we were ready to order, we could not find her anywhere for another 10 minutes. Once we did order, she still was still not very nice and someone other than her had brought out our order but the food was cold and we had to ask twice for our sides. Our server did not come back to us nor did we ever get a refill for our ice tea/water with our lunch. I feel that the food, service, and the prices were not worth while. I WILL NEVER GO THERE AGAIN... I suggest that anyone is looking for a good Mexican place you will not find it here. Save your money and do not go here!!!
