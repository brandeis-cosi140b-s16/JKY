We stopped in for lunch when heading for a doc appt in Gilbert.  Have eaten at Chandler location once before.  We had the lunch special and were extremely disappointed.  Yes, the chips and bean salsa are good, but that was about all.  There wasn't even any cheese on the enchilada - or at least any we could see.  We were just really disappointed and would never go back.  The waitress was fine.  The atmosphere was fine.  The food left a lot to be desired.   Felt like it was going out of business.
