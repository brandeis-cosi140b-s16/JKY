If I could put negative stars, I would. I never had a MAJOR issue with this place in the past, maybe a wrong order here and there but I learned to let it go. I hate complaining, but as a person who works in customer service, I really can't stand when people come to work with bad attitudes! 

I went here the other night after work and ordered through the drive thru. I order my usual carne asada fries and as I pulled up to pay, everything seemed fine. The lady working the drive thru was just so unpleasant. She had to reach a little bit harder to grab my card through the window, and she started shaking her head. I even took off my seat belt so I didn't have to make her reach out far. As she handed me my food, I then ask for red and green sauce, and she had the nerve to roll her eyes so far back that I was livid after she did that! As she handed me the sauce, I said to her, "Are you really going to roll your eyes at me like that?" And she just walked away from the window. My blood was boiling and I wanted to go inside and complain, but figure that they wouldn't have done much about her attitude. Someone like that should NOT be helping people. What a joke!
