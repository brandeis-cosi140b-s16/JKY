Seriously, why is this place in business?  Food quality is on par with a denny's, and the drinks taste like cheap mixers with no alcohol.  Bland at best describes this place..... I had to ask for hot sauce, the salsa was not fresh, the guacamole tasted pre made and bland...  For a city with a large Mexican population, this is a complete joke.  Chipotle could put this place out of business in a week.
