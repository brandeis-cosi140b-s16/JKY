Macayo's used to be decent but over the years the food has gone downhill. I refuse to eat here and only went because we met friends there. The salsa taste like it comes from a can, the food is far from authentic. If you're in the area, Manuel's is a better alternative. If  you're looking for real mexican food, go to Tony's or Zamora's.
