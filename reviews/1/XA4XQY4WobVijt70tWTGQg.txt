Second time to this restaurant, had a rocky dine in first time, completely messed up the order, place had just opened so we thought we would give it another go BAD IDEA. Second try was a take out order, completely messed up the order, food cold and cheese in ENCHILADA STACK not melted, how do not melt Velveeta? I called to let them know the order was incorrect, just wants my credit card refunded, but GM stated "just give my name next time your in and Ill make it right for you"- not coming back wanted my 16 dollars for 2 burritos incorrectly made- not earth shattering just good customer service after messing up. I have 30 years in the restaurant industry and taking care of your customer is paramount.
About 9 hours after eating here- projectile vomiting- loss day of work the next day.
Lets just say I will not be returning. I wish them all the luck with this track record they will need it.

I wish I could give 0 stars.
