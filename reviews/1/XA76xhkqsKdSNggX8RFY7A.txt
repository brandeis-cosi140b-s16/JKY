Went for lunch there because I was told it was really good from coworkers! Nothing fresh at this place!! Fish tacos taste like old frozen boxed fish from the grocery store old guacamole couldn't eat sent it back, shrimp ceviche totally watered down that it made the tortilla shell soggy and no flavor !! Old rice and beans - it all made me sick, literally!! Never going back!! Yuck!! Talked to my coworkers when I got back and they admitted they haven't been there for a long time!! Obviously it's totally gone down hill !!
