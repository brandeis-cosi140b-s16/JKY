As a young boy, my parents had a rule. 
"If you don't like the taste of something, don't say anything while at the table"

Their logic?
Simple. It would prejudice my siblings tastes, my parents having a full-blown food revolt on their hands at that point. Pretty smart actually.

So, ever the brainwashed, can't let go of his mommy daddy issues, fucked-up adult I am, I never complain while at the table.
But when I get in the car to drive home look out. 
And when I get to a laptop look out even more.

Everything here has gone downhill, to hell in a hand-basket as some might say.
And guess what?
For all my Yelper and friends who don't speak Spanish, La Canasta means basket. 
Yesterday it meant waste basket. 

Green chile was lumpy, too much thickening agent and the beef wasn't braised tender, little chunks 'o rubber.

And that pot of menudo sitting in the middle of the buffet area? The one without a lid?

One has only to ponder the fate of some flying insect whom upon leaving his nest one fine morning, deep in a depression over spending its life lighting from one pile of dog-shit to the next has decided to end it all by kamakaze'ing his shit-wreaking self into the fucking menudo pot. 
You know, the one without the lid?

Not on my short list of Mexican food eateries any longer, this despite my knowing the former owner.
