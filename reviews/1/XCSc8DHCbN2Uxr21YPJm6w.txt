I love chipotles chips and guacamole. But today when I got my side of chips and guac, the entire bag was horrible, completely greasy, when you bit it the chip didn't even break apart cause it was so chewy. Worst bag of chips ever. How can they sell chips like that?! Take some pride in what you give your customers. If you know it doesn't look right, fix it. Not sell it anyway
