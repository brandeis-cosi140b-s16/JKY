Just had a Chk Chalupa Sup: Had to write a review.

This was probably the worst CCSupreme i ever had at a TacoBell.

CCS is my fav item and i know how a good one tastes.

The one i had here was disgusting looking , Very salty , very oily and least amount of stuffing you will ever see.

Will give it another shot (benefit of doubt on the employee who made my chalupa) and if it turns out to be same , thats it.
Never will step foot inside this TB again.
