I try to be a positive person but our experience here was not good. The food was mediocre at best and the service was awful. Watched our waitress stand and converse with someone for 15 minutes and we all had empty drinks. I politely requested she bring us another round on my way to the restroom. When I returned to the table, my friends had cancelled the order as the waitress continued to have a personal conversation and went to the bar to order the drinks. They requested the check which took another 30 minutes. Bad food + bad service = no return. They need stronger management here. Had they been around they would have seen what was happening. There were several upset patrons. Terrible service.
