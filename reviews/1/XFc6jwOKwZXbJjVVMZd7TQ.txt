I usually order on the app and take out, but today the app was not working. I stopped in and placed an order after waiting in line for close to 10 minutes, fine it's busy, I get it...

But it's before noon and the women's restroom looks like it hasn't been cleaned all week! I did let an employee know, but 30 minutes later nothing changed.

I sat and read their reviews through my whole lunch. I was really hoping not to do this, but when the restroom hadn't been cleaned by the time I left I had too.  

Food was great as usual!
