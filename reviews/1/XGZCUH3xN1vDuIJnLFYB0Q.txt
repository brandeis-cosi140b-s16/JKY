Horrible, Horrible, Horrible!! We drove by and saw a bar and tvs. We thought, lets try them out. We ordered a margarita. It was so bad, we had to add a packet of sweet n low to them. It was still un drinkable. The menu doesnt describe anything so you have no clue what youre getting. I have an out of state licence and the bartender looked at it for literally two minutes. Two sips in we asked for the bill and left. We were too turned off to even order food. Oh, and the chips and salsa? A joke. Salsa is pure water and the chips are salty and stale.
