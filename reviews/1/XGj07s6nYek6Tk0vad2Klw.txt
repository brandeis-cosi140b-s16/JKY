I was walking around the Strip, hungry and tired. I didn't feel like dealing with the crowds in the cavernous casinos in search of cheap eats.

Mexican came to mind - I would have settled for a chain restaurant like La Salsa but I just couldn't look anymore. So I headed over to the Fashion Show Mall food court - the choice of restaurants weren't that great, but decided to try Taco Maker.

I was a little bit skeptical to give it a try, but I was hungry.

I got the veggie version of the special, which consisted of nachos with melted cheese, a burrito with enchilada sauce on top, and a taco.

The food was eh - it did the job of filling me up, but it left me realizing that eating burritos outside of San Francisco can be... disappointing.
