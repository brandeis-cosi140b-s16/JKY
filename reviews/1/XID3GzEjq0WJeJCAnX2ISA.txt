I truly do not like to write negative reviews, so avoid them. But in this case, there is no escape.  My husband's favorite food is Mexican, and he could not even finish his order.  I opted for two stars; he said to give Jims Burros half a star, so we compromised.

To begin with, we were given a minimal amount of chips, about half a typical bowl.  Refills on soda cost 50-cents to $1.00, depending on the size of drink you ordered.  I got a chicken and mole burro, hubby had a red chili one.  Both arrived wrapped in a white flour tortilla on a white plate.  Nothing else -- nor garnish, no sauce. (See photo.) We found out later we could have ordered "enchilada style", but this was not on the lunch menu.  

My husband, who is not a picky eater, could not finish his due to taste and texture.  He decided to try something else: a ground beef taco.  It came in a shell that looked like it had just been taken out of a pre-cooked, packaged box from the store.  When he picked it up to take a bite, grease streamed out the other end.
