I'm a HUGE fan of this chain, they have the best food. Always fresh, sourced local, and delicious.

Unfortunately this location has repeatedly been a let down with crunchy rice, dry black beans, stale chips, and the guac seems to have been frozen. All watery and grainy.
We're gonna have to drive a little further for a better location, which really sucks as this is the closest to our home.
