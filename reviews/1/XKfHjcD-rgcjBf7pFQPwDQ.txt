I'm not sure what happened when my husband & I ate here, but it was the worst food we've ever had at a Mexican spot. I'm really confused by all of the great reviews, I consider myself a total fan of mexican food, my Hubby actually calls me his ''White mexican''. The food was very small portioned, flavorless, and I couldn't even finish his taquitos & I was still hungry. We paid $4.50 for the ''special'', and got 2 TINY dry taquitos. No lettuce, guac, or anything to go with them. I don't know, maybe we went there on their worst day. Won't be going back though, and I'm in that shopping center all the time.
