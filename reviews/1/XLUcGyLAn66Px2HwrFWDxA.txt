This is a bad El Pollo Loco location. I have been a few times on a lunch break and my food was messed up each time and I had to go back and have it corrected. I said I didn't want any guacamole or avocado yet it was on and in my food. I said I wanted a bean and cheese burrito and they put rice in it. I ordered a carnitas taco and got a chicken taco. The wait in drive thru or inside is ridiculous and waiting a long time and not even getting the right order only to have it done again just isn't right. I had a chocolate churro and it actually tasted burnt and nasty. Like a crushed up oreo cookie gone wrong. Definitely not one of the better locations.
