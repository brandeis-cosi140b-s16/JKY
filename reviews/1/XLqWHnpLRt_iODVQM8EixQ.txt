Ok either he people that cook here are idiots or just flat out jerks. Ordered mini tacos with no onions, and what I got was more onions than meat!! One taco was literally 3/4 onions 1/4 meat. It was easier to dump the entire taco and pick out the meat to put back on it than it was to pick the onion out. Second time I've been at this location. The 1st time I ordered the fish taco that was piled mountain high with their miracle-whip-esque special sauce. I think that they try to skip on more expensive ingredients by piling high on the condiment toppers. We won't be back here. 2 strikes is all you get.
