Michele K. nailed it in her review.  

The food is inedible.  I had the pork tacos which were so greasy, tasteless and disgusting we left and went elsewhere to eat. The management did not charge us for our meal which was nice, but we will never be back.  All of our neighbors that have been have said the same.  

Too bad, as Carefree is desperate for good restaurants, but not in need of any more bad ones.
