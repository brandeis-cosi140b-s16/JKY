Everytime ive ever come here to eat I've had to walk up to a waitress and ask to be served.. No one sits you or even notices you coming in. Their staff is slow and the food takes longer than it should.. 15 minutes for 6 tacos.. Get out of here. And the tacos have little to no meat in them.. Don't come here to eat.. It's an okay place to drink and hang tho
