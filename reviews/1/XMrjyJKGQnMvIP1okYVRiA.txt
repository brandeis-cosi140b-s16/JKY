I got food poisoning from the steak here. 

So did my friend (who ordered a steak sandwich), and while we were dining, I overheard a phone call that was very likely a possible foodborne illness complaint. (The waitress responded with comments like "I'm so sorry.. no we have not had any other similar complaints.. I am so sorry I will have the GM call you back." I did not think anything of it at the time because I understand it could be anything.)

I called, with no mean intentions, to inform them that I, as well as the doctor I went to see at Carle Clinic, were 95% positive that Wedge was the source of this foodborne illness, and the doctor assured me it was NOT the flu.  Wedge did not return my 3 calls until 3 days later, and the GM's response was that "I'm pretty confident we are not the source. There is a bad flu going around." Thanks for the call. By the way, unless your steak always tastes that dry, then there probably was something wrong with it. Will not return again.

GROSS!
