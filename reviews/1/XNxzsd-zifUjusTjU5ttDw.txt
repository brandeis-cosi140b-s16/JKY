Absolutely terrible. There should be a "no stars" option.  For 10 bucks you would expect a decent sized burrito, but no, its about as big as a taco bell burrito.

Also, its the most bland, basic and cold burrito I've ever had.. If I wanted to spend $20 on a burrito, then I might have had more than chicken lettuce and a few black beans to eat.

This place is sucks.
