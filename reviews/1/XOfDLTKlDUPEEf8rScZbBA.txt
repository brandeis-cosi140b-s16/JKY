Don't waste your time. Service was slow, sucked, and the guy just seemed like he didn't want to be there.  Chips tasted old, guacamole was  tasteless.  Soup tastes like dishwater and the food was just bland.  Shrimp was over cooked and just little tiny pieces.  
It was a real disappointment and another one not to go back to.
