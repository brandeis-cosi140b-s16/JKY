Visited Los Dos last Thurs. night - had family visiting from out of town and they wanted "real" Mexican food. We had never been to the Ahwautukee restaurant, but were excited to have something closer than the S. Central location.

Horribly disappointed pretty much sums up the whole experience - the food was good, but the service and atmosphere was awful. The restaurant was only moderately busy - 4-5 tables occupied, there appeared to be several servers, but our guy kept disappearing for 10-15 minutes at a time... 

There were 6 adults & a child in our party. We had called ahead and made a reservation, no one greeted us - we waited a few minutes, finally someone came up and we mentioned we had a reservation - no recognition or acknowledgement of having called ahead. We waited 5 minutes for our server to take drink orders, 10 minutes to get drinks, 10 more minutes before he came back to take our order, 25 minutes to get our food. Had to ask someone else for more drinks, salsa and chips as the server never checked back on our table. We had to go look for someone to find our server to get our check once we were finished. 

We were seated right under a ceiling fan turned on full blast - had to ask to have it turned down and the Christmas music playing on continuous loop was SO loud we couldn't carry on a conversation without shouting.

Food was nice and spicy, but the atmosphere and service were so bad we left disappointed and resigned to the fact that this would not be our new "go to" Mexican restaurant.
