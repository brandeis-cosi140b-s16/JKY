Went in for dinner we were only customers. Three girls behind the counter hovering over a cell phone laughing. One girl put her hand up and said we will be right with you. Ordered tacos an margaritas, we finished our food before our drinks came. We wont go back.

Thanks for the offer, but there are to many choices in this neighborhood to suffer thru another bad experience even at no charge.
