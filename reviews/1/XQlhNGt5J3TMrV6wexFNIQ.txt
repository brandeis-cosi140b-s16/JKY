cashier shorted me 5 dollars I caught it when I got home called they pulled the drawer and found my 5 I didn't live down the street from this location so I said I would pick it up in a day or so. I came today which is maybe 2 days later. the manager said he would leave a note. when I arrived I spoke with the Manger on duty which didn't know so he called the guy I spoke with who com firmed my story when he came back he said oh I'll give it to you but you were supposed  to get it that day. So I'm guessing that they put a time frame on when you can pick up your money that there no counting ass cashiers fuck up on if I didn't come back I know they would have pocketed it no good POS.
