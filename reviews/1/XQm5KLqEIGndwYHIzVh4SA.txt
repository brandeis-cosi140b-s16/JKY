Sorry to say this place was a huge disappointment. The chips were terrible. Tasted as though they came out of a SAMs Club bag. Salsa tasted funky. I ordered Ceviche and it was mushy and tasted off. My hubby ordered a salad that was grocery store right out of the bag quality. Margarita's were expensive. I DID love the atmosphere, thus the one star. The festive Happy Birthday singing made me want to come here for my birthday. Not for the food or drink, simply for the celebratory nuance. 
Overall, eating here made us appreciate the GOOD Mexican food in California.
