If my review for the T-Bell in Forest Hills is used as a reference, I can certainly say that this location is terrible. It is as if they dropped the tortilla in a puddle (probably a toilet... get it?) prior to assembling what is supposed to be a delicious meal. By the time I got the food home it was so mushy, cold, and overall dissatisfying that I would've fed it to the dog, but the dog sniffed it as he walked by and decided to chew on his rawhide instead. HIS RAWHIDE - what kind of world are we living in when a dog isn't even interested in Taco Bell? A sick, sad world indeed.
