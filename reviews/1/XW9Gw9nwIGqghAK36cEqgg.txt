I really wanted to love this place, but nope. Just nope. The basket of chips that they give you is about a third of the size of normal Mexican restaurants & they are super slow with refills. I ordered the cheese dip & I'm pretty sure it was the white Velveeta dip. It was so thick our chips would break when dipping them & had no flavor at all. The tacos were okay, but I've better from food trucks if that says anything ... Won't be back.
