Update:  ordered a ham and cheese breakfast burrito the cost was 5. I told them to add beans. The charged an extra 86 cents. With taxes it came out to 6.27 they're tax bracket is a little high. I wanted to pay with my card so the charge an extra 50 cents which is double of the normal fee even though because I'm spending more than 3 dollars their fee isn't as big as the normal fee. So if you do the math they should have charged me 6.77...well then they taxed me again ...so my cheap little breakfast burrito was costing me 8.00...I told them about their mistake and they didn't want to return the difference. So after the food was done. I told them to cancel the order and return my money since they had charged it before even telling me all these ridiculous fees and over charges. Went down the street to a high end restaurant got the same burrito for 4 dollars.
