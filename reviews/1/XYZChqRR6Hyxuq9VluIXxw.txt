We stopped here for a late lunch. Authentic looking SW decor, but not very clean, and no service from the start. With nobody greeting the public, we eventually found our own seats. Drinks took 25 minutes though there were only 3 tables. 

Maybe the worst part of this meal, at least visually, was the side of guacamole...it appeared to have cottage cheese mixed in it. We eyed it while waiting another ten minutes for the chips the waiter forgot. I did not eat it, apparently my husband was hungry enough to NOT object to cottage cheese guacamole. By now it seemed destined that I would go home hungry, and yes I did.

When at last the meals arrived mine, was ice cold on a hot plate. I sent it back and it returned to me freshly microwaved. The spicy white cheese sauce with fresh jalepeno on my enchiladas was akin to eating raw flour. Two bites was more than enough and no, they did not offer to take it off our bill. One of the worst meals I've had in a very long time. 

Save your money, eat somewhere else!
