I had the food once. My boyfriend brought it over. I thought it was pretty awful. Anything ending in "berto's" beats the hell out of this crap. As a matter of fact, ANY Mexican food including Taco Bell, Del Taco, etc... is 10 times better than this food.

I proooooobably wouldn't have worried about doing a review but I happened to see this story:

Uhhhh...wow. Seriously? You should appreciate that this Mia woman actually pays money for your nasty slop. But I guess being a jerk to a customer is about right if you want to keep the customer service on par with the flavor.
