I was really looking forward to this due to all the great reviews and also because, after days of paying for $25 dollar entrees, my wallet needed a break big time.  

Maybe they were having a bad day (I notice another 1 star reviewer went the same day I did).  Quite simply, the food was inedible.  First off, this is a place that LOVES their organ meats.  No fish or chicken tacos here so keep in mind that choices are very limited if you don't like tripe, brain, tongue or head tacos.  That's ok, we went for the carne asada fries, Abodabo and spicy pork tacos.  Fries looked awesome.  First bite....my mouth filled with fat/gristle/tendon.  Ick.  I'm a good sport, tried another bite.  Huge piece of fat.  One more bite.  Same thing.  Moved on to the abodabo taco.  First bite.   Fat.  I wasn't dumb enough to try another bite.  Spicy pork taco next.  No fat but no flavor either.  

So yeah it was only $20 for me and my husband to "eat" but neither one of us actually got to swallow any of it.  Have not had this horrible of a restaurant experience in years.  I'm left wondering, did I truly go on an off day or do regular folk just love fat filled tacos?  I'm certainly not putting out another $20 to get an answer to that one.
