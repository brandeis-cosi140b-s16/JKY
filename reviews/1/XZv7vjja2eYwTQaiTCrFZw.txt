The worst food truck meal I have ever had. I literally took 3 bites of the shrimp hamachi and threw the whole thing away and made my way to Papi Queso. First of all, when we placed our order. My husband paid the order and he immediately given his dish...."how did you predict I was going to get this"... Was my thought. After waiting for my meal I was horribly disappointed. It was drenched in cabbage, no flavor at all, I could taste the frozen food. Not that great of service either.
