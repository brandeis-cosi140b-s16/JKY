If I could give negative stars, I would... First off, all of their mexican food is grossly overpriced and their delivery takes FOREVER, but their burgers were good and they delivered to our work so we still ordered. Then our orders started getting messed up (one time there was a whole burger missing) and then this girl started answering the phone to take orders that I couldn't understand and she couldn't understand me. Today I have OFFICIALLY HAD ENOUGH!!! We called in our order (keeping it as simple as possible), they have stopped carrying Mr. Pibb (which is my friend's fav) and talked to me like I was an idiot about it. FOR ONCE I was given a short & reasonable estimated delivery time... Then my phone rang and I was told that my order would have to be picked up if we still wanted it & they were under new management and will no longer be delivering to our office b/c it's too far away... Meanwhile another group JUST ordered from them on Monday! And our whole office gives them a LOT of business and they just dumped us like that? Nope... Never again...
