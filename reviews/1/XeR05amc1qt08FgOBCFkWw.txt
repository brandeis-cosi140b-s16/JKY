HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!

My first visit to this place was today. I decided to go with a friend and grab some tacos in the drive-thru. I ordered 2 chicken tacos and asked for a little sour cream and guacamole on each one. With a soda my total came to $10.49!!! I asked why it was so expensive. They told me they had to charge me for the sour cream and guacamole. I told them I wouldn't mind paying a little extra, but I didn't need an entire side order of each. I just wanted a little on each taco. I was okay with them charging my a little extra for this, but not THAT much extra! 

The lady at the drive thru asked us to pull forward to try and resolve my request. As we pulled to the pick-up window, the manager poked his head out. I told him what I ordered and asked him why it was so expensive. I told him I'd be willing to pay a dollar or so extra for the guac and sour cream, but I thought it was outlandish to pay that much extra for two tacos. His argument was that I would get more for my money. I told him I wouldn't eat all that extra sour cream and guacamole and that it would be a waste. I told him that I felt like I was wasting my time and that it seemed ridiculous to pay that much for two tacos with a little guac and sour cream. 

His response? "Yes, I agree with you that this seems like a waste of time!" REALLY? I couldn't believe I was getting such bad customer service and such an attitude from a manager. My friend and I were so put off that we drove away with no food and paying nothing. The owner of this place should be ashamed that they hired such a terrible manager.

My first impression of this place was horrible. NICKELING AND DIMING your customers is NOT the way to keep a customer base and a consistent clientele. I will NEVER go back! They just lost a customer and because I'm well-connected in the valley, they've probably lost all my friends as customers as well.

Not a good way stay in business in this economy, I'm afraid.
