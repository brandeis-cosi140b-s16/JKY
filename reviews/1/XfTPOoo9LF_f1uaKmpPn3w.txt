Place look tacky ,  too much colors , ligths and some ugly chiles hanging.
Food could be better,  steak extra 1.50. Tomatillo sauce than is nothing but ranch and chile Serrano blended is a 1.00 for a side too,    My quesadilla was served on bottom of the round aluminum plate buried on lettuces, sour cream and pico,   Don't think is practical try to unburied your quesadilla from that mountain of lettuce ...    
Also very disorganized and dirty,(all toppings were all over their prep table).   I will not be back to eat there again
