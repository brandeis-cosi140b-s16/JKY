This place is terrible... We ordered two bean and cheese burritos, seemingly an easy order for a Mexican food place, and what we got we two tortillas with a sprinkle of beans and even less cheese. The little amount of beans that were in the tortillas were under cooked and honestly not that good. The drive thru menu does not light up at night, so it's also hard to see to even place an order, and the employees look almost annoyed that you are there when you pull up. I really wanted to like this place since it's close to our house, but I will never eat here again.
