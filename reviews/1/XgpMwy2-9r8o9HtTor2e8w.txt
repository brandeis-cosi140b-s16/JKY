I eat at Chipotle 4-5x/wk without fail. I've never had a bowl that wasn't great until I hit this location. The amount of salt on the chicken was near unedible, and ruined the entire taste of the bowl.  I chocked it down, but will not be back to this location. 

I didn't think it was possible to screw up a chipotle dish, but they managed it quite well. 

"Why didn't you take it back?" You ask...it was a to go order
