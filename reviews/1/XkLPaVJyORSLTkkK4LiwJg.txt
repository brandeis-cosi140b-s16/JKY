The monstrosities that come from this kitchen aren't fit for my dogs. Seriously... My wife and I came here late one night on our way home. Figured we'd be safe and ordered 2 beef tacos, 2 chicken tacos, and a carne asada burrito. The beef tacos were edible at best. The chicken literally tasted like fish and I had to dissect our tacos just to be sure they weren't. The carne asada was horrible and tasted like dog food. Would give this place a negative review if it was possible. Not sure how this place for any positive reviews.
