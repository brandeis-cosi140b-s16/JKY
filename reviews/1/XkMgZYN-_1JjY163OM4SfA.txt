What a waste of a cool building. In some parts it reminds me of the batman ride at magic mountain. Anyway, the food really sucks, I have gone three times, evertime ive had to return my food. Its not like preticular meals are bad, its all just bad...real bad. 

Tastes like frozen dinners, like bottom of the line in quality. 

Aweful.
