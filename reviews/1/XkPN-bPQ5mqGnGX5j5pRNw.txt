I have never experienced food this sub par. Unbelievable. This is a 24 hour joint located inside Ballys Las Vegas. I have been alive on this earth for 35 years. I live in southern California. I am not Mexican. But I know Mexican food. And this place served the worst Mexican food I have ever eaten. Good part? Open 24hours. Full bar. Full bar is what you are going to need to swallow this garbage. We ordered fish tacos. Quite possibly the saltiest and nastiest morsels ever created by gremlins. I am not going to call the kitchen staff cooks. Because that means they know how to prepare food. These creatures create the worst things ever known to man. Might seem like exaggerating. If you dont believe me, go ahead. I dare you to eat their trash. Also ordered the nachos. Supposedly meant for 3 to 4 people. They spill a bag of tortilla chips and spray random acts of chicken, crema and bean residue on there and expect you to pay 15 bux for it. These people have no business serving dog food. One star for the full bar and show. The food got a lot of laughs. Harsh review you think? Try eating here.
