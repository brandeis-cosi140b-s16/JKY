We came to this restaurant at 8:30 on a cool November Saturday night. Our previous dinner here was very pleasant. Tonight there were only two customers inside the bar which was quite cold. My wife asked the waitress if she could close the doors. She asked the manager who told her the other couple wanted to doors open. As we left without ordering, I told him he won and he smiled. 
He must be very proud that he runs the only empty bar in Tempe. 
We'll never be back. 
As a footnote, we went next door to the Normal Diner and had a pleasant experience and the hotel desk manager was very sympathetic.
