I would have given this place zero stars. My first visit to this restaurant at the food court in Caesar's Palace. I had one question about an item on the menu that I was interested in ordering and I was given an attitude. I asked for Taco's and if they come with a combo. Apparently there's two names for an order of tacos. One has cheese and one doesn't have cheese. She mention the names and I didn't understand what they came with. I asked the lady that was helping me to explain each one to me please. The lady's name that was assisting me was Geneil. Her reply to me was do you want cheese or not. I asked again what is the difference between both and are they combo's? She repeated herself do you want cheese or not. I said yes and moved on. She asked "To go or for here?" I said "I said to go" When I received my food it wasn't to go. I asked if I could have this to go. Geneil took the plate back with attitude put it in the box then showed it to the cook for some reason I don't know what he was doing to the food, he was poking at it I couldn't  see really. Then she puts it on a bag twisted close and doesn't even look at me she just drops it in front and walks away. I felt I wasn't being respected I wasn't being shown customer service. I should be receiving eye contact with an apology and have a nice day. That's what you do when you give good customer service. Customer service was terrible. The manager came back after I asked for a refund because I felt like I was being miss treated. The manager doesn't say anything to me just gives me a refund and hands me my receipt. I know Caesar's Palace is better than this. I love this property they have a lot of amazing restaurants, but this food court experience was terrible. I know you guys can get this right and fix the issue.
