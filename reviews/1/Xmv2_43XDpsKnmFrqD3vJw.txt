Can't say I would try this place again... The commercial makes it look so good, so my hubby and I decided to give it a try... Well to get straight to the point he ordered a chicken burrito and I ordered the chicken wing meal... He couldn't finish the burrito and left 1/4 of it. About 4 hrs or so later he was violently throwing up, it was horrible, and I was seriously worried. 
Today he is still weak but at least the puking has stopped... 
I don't think it was a 24hr bug as I looked up the symptoms and it was salmonella. Sorry El Pollo Loco
