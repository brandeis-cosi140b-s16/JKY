Useless people.. don't know where to complain now.

They are treating me all the time like crap. It is a guy all the time working there in dinner time. I hate the way he treat me always. Is it because I am foreigner?  I already complained to chipotle and a nice customer service guy ensure me that they will take care of this store . But I guess this specific chipotle people not going to change at all. 

first they don't smile , it's okay if they don't want to but they don't give me food what I paid for. I am tiered of giving a chance. And I don't have any other  chipotle near to me now so done eating chipotle.
I wish I could complain for this humiliation.
