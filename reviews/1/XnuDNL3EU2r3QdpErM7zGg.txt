I live close to here so it is easy. But I kick myself in the butt every time I go. Every time I order to go, I get home only to find out they short my order. Tonight I ordered a taco salad. I think I had maybe a 1/2 cup of lettuce hidden under a blob of sour cream and blob of guacamole. Don't get me wrong...I love everything that is part of the salad. But key word...salad. It was one big mush. I won't say I will not return. But in the future I will ask for lettuce and sides.
