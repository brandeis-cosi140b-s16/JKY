One of the bartenders with a nose piecing, beard, and tattoos all along his left arm denied me 2 glasses of water when I was begging to have them for my friend who was having an anxiety attack all because , "I was yelling and being rude" he made me go find my friend before he would give the water to me. After I found her, he tried to be super nice to her after seeing how pale white she was. As a bartender you never deny a customer water. What a low life.
