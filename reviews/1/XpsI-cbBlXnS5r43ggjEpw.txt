My husband and I were just there on Friday and got intoxicated. We think it was the shrimp, since we both ate that and my daughter ate just steak. Thank God she didn't eat the shrimp! I can't imagine my 5 year old suffering as we are now due to food intoxication. I am very upset and disappointed that this happened since I had to go to the doctor and spend money that they will not reimburse. Unfortunately, I feel obligated to contact the health department so they can conduct an investigation on their food handling process before anyone else gets intoxicated again!
