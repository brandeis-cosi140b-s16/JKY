On the border is one of my favorite places to go, the Woburn MA location was my go to place before moving to AZ. The bartender at this location (tonight) was an ass. I had a tough week so I decided to go get a massage then doing some make up shopping so I wore comfy clothes and no makeup. The massage place couldn't get me in for an he so went to get a drink at otb. Sat at the completely empty bar and he came right up to me super friendly when he asked for my id ( I am 25) I realized I left it in my husbands wallet , he couldn't serve me I get it no big deal . I order an appetizer. Then he never comes back ! No small talk nothing , just stands by the service bar . Another women about my age comes in with maybe her mom they order drinks and crazy she wasn't asked for id? She was dressed up make up The whole deal. He stayed and chatted with them for a bit then stood by the service bar after 40 minutes he finally came over got my check and left .  If you have a policy enforce it equally and if your a bartender have a personality
