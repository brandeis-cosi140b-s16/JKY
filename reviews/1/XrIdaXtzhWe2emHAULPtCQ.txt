The wait was the shortest here, so we decided to dine here.
It's an interesting concept but not worth the money.  I would've much rather waited a bit longer to eat at the burger joint next door.

Our party ordered a variety of the mexican and chinese dishes.  Neither were on par to what we're use to back home (Orange County)
