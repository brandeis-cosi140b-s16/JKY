Was seated presented with a filthy menu. Waited 5 min for drink order and returned with cold chips in a unlined plastic container. A pepsi for my date and water for me. Manny turned his back and stated I will be back for your order. We were ready but he did not return after 20 min in an unbusy restaurant I got up left and he chased us down in the parking lot I need you to pay for your pepsi. He had no interest in us until that moment. He then said I have your plate and will be calling the police. The place was not very full or busy for a Friday evening every customer means something. The place was unkept and not maintain. Glad I did not eat here after all. Customer service worse. The national chain won out over another sad local restaurant experience in Phoenix.
