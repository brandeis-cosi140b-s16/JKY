I wish I would have read the reviews before going.  Place was empty yet service was extremely slow.  Servers/bartenders spent more time socializing than working.  During his break, one server went out front to smoke and spit in front of the window that was next to our table.  One of our dinner orders was wrong so my husband's meal was cold by the time my corrected meal arrived.  They can not classify this food as Mexican.  Canned green chiles, tomato sauce on rice for Spanish rice, and cold beans.  Will not go back!
