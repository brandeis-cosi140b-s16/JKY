My wife and I stopped at the Gilbert location on Sat night (March 28th). We were on our way home and wanted to get something to take home. We looked up the store hours and their website said they were open until 9:00 pm (so does the sign in the window). We went inside to order and it was 8:35 pm. The employee at your counter asked if we had ordered ahead of time. We said we had not. He told us that they were closed and could not serve us. There were people inside eating, but he said that the store was closed. I checked the window again and the time on my phone and we were there almost 30 minutes before the 9:00 Pm.  The employee acted like we were crazy for wanting to order food. 

Normally I would not write a review about this, but this is the second time this has happened to us at their Gilbert location.   Not sure why they post business hours if they will not serve for the hours posted.
