Stopped by around 2:30 today with a friend to grab a late lunch and a drink. We walked in and sat down at the bar hoping to order.  

No bartender was there at the moment but there was a hostess, waitress and a guy in a plaid shirt. All three of them saw us and knew we were sitting at the bar but oddly no one made eye contact, no "hello", greeting or acknowledgement of any kind.  5-10 more minutes go by, the guy walks back and forth a bunch of times and still nothing. 


We got up and walked out. As we're leaving, the guy says "have a great day". Really?


Won't be back, if you can't even make my business feel welcome I'll take it elsewhere.
