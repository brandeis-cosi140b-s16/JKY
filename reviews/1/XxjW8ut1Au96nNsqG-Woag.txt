OK. We went into this Roberto's and purchased 2 carne asada fries 2 chicken enchilada plate, I ordered 12 rolled taquitos.  Of course I'm a mother and full-time employee that works down in Las Vegas.  Since I had an early meeting in the morning I figured I would pick dinner. So of course I get my order the girl Ruth, she was sweet. Took my order. Very friendly. When I got home I didn't even bother to check my order.  The fries we're cold, the meat you can see was cold. The rolled tacos we're hard, they only put guacamole  on the top not through the order.  So I called the manger Ruth she said o I don't know what happened blah blah.  So I asked for the corporate office a Rey answered claiming he is the owner. He said he had to talk to his manger to see what she is willing to do for me. Are you kidding me. You are the owner buddy. Get it together. Then he wanted me to go get in my car and go back are you serious.  I don't have time for that. Is this how we really treat people? I spent 40.00 in this place. I could of gone to Lindo Michoacan for amount of money. Very disappointed guys. Will not be going back.
