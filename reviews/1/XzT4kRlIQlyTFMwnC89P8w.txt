I ordered a special potato burrito with small amount of beans and with rice and guacamole, I got a cheese burrito instead.   I got no apology or sorry for it.  Second time I had pieces of meat in it. 

How does meat get into a vegetarian burrito?   I truly think they did it on purpose. (At 6:30 PM)

I asked for the manager and they said "to call the number on the receipt"   I called and they answered it themselves. 

I think that customer service is not good anyway but when someone like me orders something not on the menu they become frozen in place.  The cooks get all out of their comfort zone and start blaming the customer who to them may seem picky, when in reality I am vegan and I don't each cheese or meat.   They don't understand this, this is to them a difficult customer.  

They were puzzled and did not know what to do, not a word of sorry or we can re do it for you.    I have photos of the pieces of meat in my burrito and left w/o eating it.

I sent a "Contact Us"  message to their non existent "customer care dept." and got no response or reply, so I reviewed it on Yelp.
