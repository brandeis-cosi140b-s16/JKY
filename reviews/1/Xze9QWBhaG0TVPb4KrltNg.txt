OK, no hours on their web page, and the web page leads you to believe you are headed for a nice place. Got there 11:30 on Saturday, doors were closed, only hours listed on the door sign for Sat was open at 1 pm. Seriously? It said 11 am on here. 

Peeking in, definitely a greasy spoon no frills super dive. I was so excited to get some good New Mexico food so I drove half way across town for double disappointment. If I were in the area again, I don't know if I would give them another chance. I'll head to Frank and Lupe's in Scottsdale next time I am going to drive for my fix, they are solid NM food.
