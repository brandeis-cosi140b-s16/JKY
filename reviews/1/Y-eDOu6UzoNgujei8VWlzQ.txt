Okay, I live right down the street from this place and had such hope for it. I took my mom and sister there one night and all that hope was just completely run over by a truck. Their prices are great though! I ordered an enchilada and got a burrito. Actually, none of us got what we ordered. And that was after waiting for close to an hour for our food to be ready. But it looked good so I decided to just go for it. I did like the sauce, but everything after that was just horrible, overcooked, dry, and flavorless. I couldn't even finish the thing. Maybe it was just an off night? It was disappointing though. If you choose to try this place, I recommend calling your order in ahead of time and checking your order before you leave.
