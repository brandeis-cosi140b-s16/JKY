We met some friends here for lunch on our way out of town. I had the crunchy chicken tacos. The two people I asked about military discount did not understand enough english to comprehend what I was asking them so I am not sure if they give discounts or not. 
The chicken was so dry that the ends of the shredded chicken were too hard eat. I couldn't eat the taco shells they were hurting my teeth just trying to bite into them. Was scared to chew them.
The employees seemed nice. Should most likely have at least one person working the front that can understand english a little more. 

MILITARY DISCOUNT=unsure
