Horrible customer service. Went in to have dinner with family/friends and the management was horrible. The on duty manager and the owners son couldn't even figure out how to accommodate us a party of 8. When we made a suggestion about seating they said no and told us it was a fire issue. Truth was this is a request other restaurants make for us all the time. Manager was a smart.ss smiled and thought they whole thing was funny.  I guess Nando's will earn our business from here on out. If I was the owner,  I would be switching management quickly. 

Btw... got to the restaurant and there was 4 tables open. Got to Nandos 30 minute waiting. I guess good customer service is worth waiting for!
