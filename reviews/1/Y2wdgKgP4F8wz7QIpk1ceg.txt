Thought I would stop in for a cheap meal and was shocked at their prices.  $8.99 for my  loaded Nachos?  Then I get them and there is barely any cheese and it's not even melted!!!!  Then I go to refill my watered down Horchata and I'm told that they do not give free refills! Filibertos, sorry but we will NOT be returning. If I want better food with my cheese actually melted I'll go up the road to Cafe Rio and I get free Horchata refills there too.  Oh and Fresh Homemade tortillas.  Then if I want really tasty food and have more time, I'll go across the street to Isabel Amor and have an Amazing meal.  Oh and their Tortas are served with actual Avocado, not runny so called Guacamole.  They're only .50 cents more than yours also.  

Step it up and put your menu where it belongs.  Maybe a $5 nacho and offer Free Horchata Refill
