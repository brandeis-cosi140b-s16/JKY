I tried this restaurant due to it's proximity to hiking in the Superstitions.  We stopped by after a hike.  The only positive that I have is that the place looks nice and has a nice patio with a waterfall.  I ordered a green chili burro and my wife ordered beef tamales.  Several minutes after I placed my order the waiter came back to tell me they were out of green chili.  No biggie here but at a good restaurant I would expect the waiters to know if they were out of something this basic before the order went in.  

I changed my order to green corn tamales.  When the waiter brought the order out he could not tell which plate had the beef tamales and which were green corn.  He takes the plates away for about 5 minutes to figure it out.  So we were teased with a preview of our meal only to be left hungry for 5 more minutes.  

When he brought the plates back we discovered that they were both beef tamales.  I tasted one and it was hard, salty and not at all like any tamale I had ever had.  He took my plate and re-order my tamales.  It took too long for the re-order to come out.  My wife was pretty much finished by the time I got my plate.  She was disappointed in her meal but to starved to hold back from eating it.

My green corn tamales were better than the beef tamales but not good.  They smothered them with cheese and drenched the plate in a runny sauce.  The rice tasted like rice and tomato sauce and the beans were just straight up nasty.  I could not eat more than one bite.

As starving as I was from the hike I could not come close to finishing the plate.  I left still hungry.

The waiter, although friendly, did not offer any amends to the lack of green chili or the tamale mix-up.  

I'll never go back to this place.  Overall this was the worst restaurant experience I have had in a long time.
