Overpriced and out-dated. Simple things like the pico were obviously old (mushy tomatoes, soggy onions), the camaron crepe appetizer was tiny and they used iceberg lettuce as its garnish. Ordered a $26 filet minion medium rare and it came out medium well. All other dishes were just barely warm, not hot and definitely not fresh. 

The main dining room smells like rat turds: literally. Years ago I helped a friend remodel a house that had a severe roof rat problem: it's one of those smells you wish you could forget. This place sucks. Go to Barrio Cafe if you want quality upscale Mexican cuisine.
