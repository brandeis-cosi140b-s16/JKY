Not enough servers at their new location. Decent good food, but they don't care about serving their customers. Feedback to the manager fell on a deaf ear. After visiting Mi Cocina/Cocina Real for years I was looking forward to the new decor. I would prefer the old place there servers offered too much than the new location where you are lucky if you get food and even luckier if it's the right food. If you go when it's busy, beware.
