Worst experience ever!!!! This was our 3rd time coming here and the food was terrible.  First time they charged us a 20% gratuity on our check and didn't even tell us,  and our service was not even good enough for a 10% tip.  Then on top of that the server disappeared and never returned our change.  2nd time,  it took 10 minutes to ever have someone pay attention to our table and bo one ever brought us drink refills,  but the food was ok.  3rd time,  the food was cold and hard and looked just "old",  we asked for the manager and the server got pissed.  She then came back and said the manager was busy but would come out and talk to us when she had a chance.  We said fine we are just going to leave then we got up to leave.  She followed us towards the front and said we still needed to pay the bill.  We said we weren't because we didn't eat because the food was terrible.  Then the owner lady came out and threatened to call the cops for stealing food.  We told her go ahead as we proceeded to leave.  Her and two employees followed us out but we got in our car and left with them all yelling at us.  Talk about CRAZY!!!!
