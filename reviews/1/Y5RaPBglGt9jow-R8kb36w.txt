Maybe if you go to the actual location its not as pathetic but we were at a concert at the pool at the Hard Rock Casino and Pink Taco was selling Street Tacos for $3 the size of a newborn baby's fist. Not only were they tiny but they were pretty gross, the chicken and the steak.

Perhaps the little stand had it backwards. Instead of selling Vodka soaked Watermelon for $9, beer for $8 and Ant-Man sized tacos for $3....They should have sold beer for $1 and Vodka drenched watermelon for $3 to get you drunk enough to actually enjoy those $3 tacos.
