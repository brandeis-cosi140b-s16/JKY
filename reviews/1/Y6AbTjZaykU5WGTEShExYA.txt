This was the 3rd time I went to the new location at the Metropolitan, and 3rd time was NOT a charm.  Service- The hosts were not presentable at all, they weren't even wearing all black or dressed nice and not friendly.  The waitress took forever to come to our table. The food took about an hour to come to our table, only to find out that it wasn't our food!!  Mind you there were only 4 tables in the whole restaurant! They set out the food tray on the stand, made us drool and then picked it up and went the other way.  Food--The guacamole was very bland and the queso was not traditional queso.  It tasted like velveeta microwaved cheese.  The fajitas were OK.  Honestly, I don't know why everyone says that this is a Mexican restaurant.  This place is totally Tex-Mex.  There is a big difference between the two.  And it's not even good Tex-Mex!  Never coming back again. Especially not after my bill was $35 when I can get the same food that is much tastier at a REAL Mexican place elsewhere in Charlotte for not even half the price!
