The staff looked bored as they texted on their cell phones in between takin our order and putting the obviously-store bought tortillas on the warmer which clearly did not warm them up enough. The al pastor/carne asada were ok, the guacamole was good but overpowering. The food was ridiculously overpriced and underwhelming. The only thing going for this place is the location, though I wouldn't even spend comps to eat here again. You are MUCH better off at earl of sandwich right next to it.
