never going to this place again!!!! I found a huge clump of hair inside of the taco I ordered and the hair clump had a bug attached to it. I got my food during the graveyard shift. Pure disgust & a waste of money.  Not to mention, the other food I ate, upset my stomach. I'm NEVER going to this place again and will post this anywhere and everywhere I can!!!
