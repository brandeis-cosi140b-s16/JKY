A group of friends and I had come here after a night of heavy drinking. We used to come here all the time when it was SuperMex. I guess the chef also changed along with the name change, because the food was pretty bad that night. When we first arrived, we sat in the section right next to the bar. It took us 10-15 minutes to get our waters when there was no one else in the restaurant. The ten minutes seemed like FOREVER since we were all pretty slizzard. When we ordered our food, the waitress seemed alright. My boyfriend wanted to get guacamole instead of refried beans. The waitress kept saying that it wasn't possible and they can't do that. So my boyfriend tried telling her he'll pay extra if you can just give us the guacamole on the side instead of the beans, but she still said no. But wait...when we wanted an extra side of guac later after we had gotten our food, it was ok? ok. whatever. After ordering, it literally took 40-45 minutes to get our food. There was no one else in the restaurant, just us, and it took so stinkin long. When we finally did get our food, anyone who had ordered carne asada style ended up with really tough burnt meat. The food and service was all around bad. This really saddened my good friend because hes been coming here since forever and now we have to find somewhere else to go :(
