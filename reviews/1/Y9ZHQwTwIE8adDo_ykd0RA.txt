No bueno!  Whoever prepared our two #5 combo plates for takeout last night just didn't give a damn.  Taco shredded meat was inedible (overcooked shoe leather)  and the sour cream enchiladas were a gross mess. Very unpleasant.  Too bad, we've been going to Jordan's on Central for over 30 years, until they closed (Thanks alot lightrail!) and recently reconnected with 7th St. location.   We know they are capable of preparing really excellent Mexican food, but it's pretty apparent that they've lost interest.  Well, so have we.
