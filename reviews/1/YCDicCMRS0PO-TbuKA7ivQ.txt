My oldest daughter took her mom and sister out for a belated Mother's Day lunch to On the Border on Bell Rd. I stayed at home and waited for any left overs. When they returned, they gave me a bag that was quite heavy and I thought they felt bad for me so they purchased an entire entree for me. Wrong...It was their left over entree's. I was hungry so I opened the bag and sadly discovered about 7 lbs. of what tasted like canned refried beans and partially eaten enchiladas and burritos. None of it was flavorful cold so I reheated it in the microwave and there was absolutely no improvement in flavor so I tossed it. Sounded like a brick when it landed! YUK!!! Save the trip and go to Fry's and get some $.99 Banquet T.V. dinners. I felt really bad for all of them especially on this special occasion! Oh well, at least I know where NOT to go if they take me out for Father's day lunch. I hope my daughter isn't angry at me for writing this but I wanted to give you Yelpers a heads up! 
They should rename the restaurant  "Borderline Mexican Cantina" Ha Ha
