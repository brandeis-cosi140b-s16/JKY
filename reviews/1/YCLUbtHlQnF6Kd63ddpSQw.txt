Nicole is the worst server! She was condescending, rude, slow, unhelpful, I could go on and on. The food was very greasy. I ordered a cheeseburger that showed up with no cheese. My boss had a beer and the orange that came with it was old and slimy. Bottom line low quality food, terrible service. NEVER GO HERE
