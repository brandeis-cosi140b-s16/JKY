We went there on Friday night, and the parking lot looked full. Needless to say, it was not busy at all, for being Friday night at 6:00pm. The server wasn't great. We asked for extra salsa, and it came 10 minutes later. By then, we were out of chips. So, we asked for more chips, and those, yes, came 10 minutes later. I asked for some extra sauce on the side for my chicken dish, and they said they couldn't do that....weird.... The food was OK- mostly forgettable.  Once we were done with our meal, we waited about 20 minutes to get our check. Finally, i asked our server for our check, and she looked offended that i asked for it. Definitely better places to go in Madison for mexican food. I won't be back.
