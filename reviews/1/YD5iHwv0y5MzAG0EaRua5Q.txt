This place has gone downhill big time! I actually contacted their corporate office a couple months ago complaining about raw chicken and unsanitary conditions in plain sight of their customers. My complaint must have been taken serious because things were looking up for a little while afterwards. Unfortunately things seem to be back to their "normal". Tonight I pulled a long hair out of my mouth that was stuck in they sticky rice! It was absolutely disgusting. I still want to puke just thinking about it. 
I've also noticed a constant change in staff and attitudes towards their customers. The only employee who seems to care is Raquel! She is the only reason this place gets 1 star.
I will definitely not go back!
