My boyfriend and I went for lunch here due to the high Yelp reviews.  You walk up and order your food, pay and pick up the food from the counter when it's ready.  We both ordered the special "Tostada and red sauce burrito."  Surprisingly this  place charges extra for chips and hot sauce/salsa.  When our order arrived I thought that perhaps Los Compradres had  swung by Taco Bell to pick up our order.  Maybe back in the day this place was good, however now it's Taco Bell food at a 500% mark up.  Go somewhere else peops, unless you're looking for over priced Taco Bell food, disinterested staff, and a poor dining environment .  Definitely won't be back.
