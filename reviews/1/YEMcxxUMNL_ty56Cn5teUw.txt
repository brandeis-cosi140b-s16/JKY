Let's be fair, if you like non-spicy, non-authentic mexican, servers too young to make margaritas, or overpriced dining on metal rod chairs, all hale, for you have found the restaurant for you!

Now I will be contrite, the service was great. Our server asked two people to make our drinks. That was how I knew this was going to be a distaster. When my gf said I can't tell which drink has extra salt the bell rang. I couldn't taste any alcohol in my over-priced drink either.  My shrimp were skimp. Not scampi bit not butterflied. I was hard pressed to pay full price for three tortillas on my fajitas. Then charged more for tortillas when I asked! How deceiving. Why make fajitas that need more tortillas than comes with? Was I supposed to be Frank Llyod Write and make all my veggies sit on three tiny torts? Not to mention the food was spiceless, no oregano, no pepper, what part of seasoning in culinary school did you miss? When I pour the salsa from the chip bowl on my food it should be a dead give away. Surprisingly that was not enough either. Worst food, terribly expensive. I will not return to your attempt of Mexican food. I'd had better at a taco bell.
