I'm not entirely sure how anyone eats here once they've been inside.  A dirty restaurant is one of the best ways for me to get on my 'list'.

Yeah, this place is on that list.

As a non-native first year med student I just didn't have a lot of time or options so, silly me, I would go here thinking "maybe the last time was just an off day".  There were times I'd walk over and over half the tables there had food remains all over them.  Often times there was trash waiting there too.  Well, after a month or so of their off days with terrible, greasy, and just wholly unappetizing food, I decided to finally take a little extra time to bring or travel further for food.

I'm sure it's the healthier option anyway.  For a number of reasons.  I don't think, no matter how busy it gets, that I'll be stopping in there this year.
