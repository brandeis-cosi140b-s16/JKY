I eat here almost every night how is it possible that my order is always messed up in someway how... I usually always order fiery in always seem to get regular. I ask for supreme and they never put sour cream I literally just start keeping it stock in my refrigerator but they charge almost a $1 for that SMH it's horrible. Half the time I go they aren't busy so what is reasoning my order is messed up other then people not giving a shit. I want what ask for I, I expect to get what I paid for. It's like I get home in what the fuck who wants to drive all the way back or deal with the attitude of the people its a waste of my time. I have try calling in to talk to general manager & have left message but never hear back. Yes I get its only Taco Bell but it's still a restaurant...so just make it like how people ask. I am a reoccurring customers but at this put rate there no point I could buy the normal tacos and make them at home! I guess I will have to do without my fiery taco since I basically never get it anyways! I hope this place gets it shit together it's been like year in still every time my husband but seriously everytime! What is the purpose of the phone if you don't answer !
