This place MUST have paid for their reviews. . I'm sure I'll eventually see this review being removed. 
Service here is beyond horrible. It took a table next to us 10 minutes before being greeted. Keep in mind, there's only about 10 tables in the whole place.. All in one small room. 
The food here is bland. Gross. The steak taco and burro we ordered were both full of gristle. Also got a specialty burro with shrimp. Blah. All bland with no flavor.
For having menu prices on the higher end of the spectrum, you would expect a better location. Scary!!! 

The only deserving star for this place is their salsa's. They do a good job with the salsa, I must admit.  But I don't see myself going somewhere JuSt for the complimentary salsa.

Do yourself a favor and go a couple blocks over to EL Nopalito's
