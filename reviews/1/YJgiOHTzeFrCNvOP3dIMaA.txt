This review has nothing to do with the food...we never made it that far.

Sat at the bar for drinks and apps last night.  The bartender was mopping the floor inside of the bar when we sat down.  When he noticed us, he put the mop down and quickly grabbed a couple of bowls, filled them with salsa and put chips in a basket for us.  

The issue?

He didn't wash his hands between putting down the mop and handling our food.  I sat there and watched the whole thing go down.  We left.

I've worked in enough kitchens to know that mops/brooms/etc. aren't the cleanest tools, nor are they typically kept in the cleanest part of the kitchen.  I mean...c'mon bro.  There's a sink right next to the chips.  WTH?
