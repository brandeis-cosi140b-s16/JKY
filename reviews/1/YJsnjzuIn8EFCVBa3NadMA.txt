Absolutely horrible. Don't bother coming here. We came because its and Taco Bell and a Pizza Hut so everyone could get something they liked. We waited 20 minutes just for the tacos and 35 minutes for 3 pan pizzas. The staff was unapologetic and every single one of them gave us attitudes. The assistant manager did apologize to us but she should probably get rid of the whole staff there especially the young black girl who had the absolute worst attitude out of all of them. Don't go here. There's plenty of other places to go around here.
