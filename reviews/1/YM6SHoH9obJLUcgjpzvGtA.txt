This is the worst Roberto's I've been to. Terrible customer service!! They charge way to much to use my debit card!! C'mon 1.25 that's ridiculous I've heard of .50 then .95 cents extra for everything cheese,bacon on a breakfast burrito C'mon seriously that ridiculous!! Then forget asking questions,they couldn't answer it, looked at us like a deer in headlights and walked away to grab someone else that still couldn't understand and spoke good English just decided to ignore the question. The food portions are ridiculously small for what I paid. 4.00 for a breakfast burrito 3.90 for a carniasada burrito ended up totaled to 15. After all the dam fees!! Every other Roberto's I've been to I couldn't finish my meal it was so big these are like kids burritos! F this location
