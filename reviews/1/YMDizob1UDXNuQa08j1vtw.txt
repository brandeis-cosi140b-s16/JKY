HEY CHIPOTLE!  Here's a big BRONX CHEER and big middle finger to you.  You totally ruined my trip and attitude merely hours in my time in Phoenix.  Know why?

You ran out of goddamn guacamole before 1 pm.  BEFORE ONE PM.  IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK.  ARE YOU FOR REALZ?

I waited in line, which by the way would have moved a lot faster if not for the incompetence behind the counter.  I waited in line, patiently, figuring I'd get my burrito bowl in no time.  I swear, Chipotle workers just work SLOWER so as for people to buy into the hype for their product (they do that here in NYC so it's no different).  So as I order, I say I'd like the veggie bowl.  Veggie bowls come with guac.  Don't you think THEN would have been a good time for them to mention - oh, hey, by the way, sorry for the inconvenience but we're actually OUT of guac.  Nope!  I find out only when I'm about to finish my order.  I left because I was so disappointed.  You people BLOW!

Now, the worst part is that because of this snafu I had to go to the far less superior Baja Fresh.  I was sick them entire weekend because of this meal.  All because Chipotle didn't have the common decency to have guacamole or enough.  I mean, isn't that your JOB??? To have INVENTORY???  What the FUCK? Meanwhile, this set off a chain of events that I didn't get ONE of my food orders right when I was there.  

So a big FUCK YOU to Phoenix central Chipotle.  I will never set foot in here again, which I guess is good for you because I don't live there.  But unfortunately I am an elite reviewer on Yelp so sucks for you that I had a bad experience. #BlameChipotle
