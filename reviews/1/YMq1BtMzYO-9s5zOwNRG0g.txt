While I don't quite agree with everything Colin S has to say he essentially sums up Julio's Too. It's horrible. I ordered the veggie burrito, now you don't have to. It is disgusting. Don't bother with the salsa, It comes from a jar. You would have to be really wasted to actually eat here and think it is anything but hideous. Colin S is also correct on the parking. The lot was full but there was no one in the restaurant. One of the worst Mexican restaurants I have had the misfortune of dining at.
