Food=Bad. Service=Ok. 

Ugh. If given 20 minutes in the kitchen I could concoct tastier chicken tacos from old tires and sweaty socks. Even the tortilla chips were bland. Hands down worst "Mexican" food ever. 

The single redeeming thing about the restaurant was the nice outdoor seating; the sun was nice.

I ate one of 3 chicken tacos and resorted to filling myself with the mediocre nachos and salsa. The re-fried beans were bland and the rice lifeless (I think it was Uncle Ben's). 

I left my with my tacos in a to-go box. As I made my way down State Street a guy on a bench asked if I could spare my left overs. I offered them over with the explanation of how bad the food was. He didn't seem to mind. 

Bottom line=Save your money. Go to Taco Bell.
