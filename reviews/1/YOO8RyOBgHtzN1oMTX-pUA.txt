We were looking to enjoy the concert at the mall using the San Felipe Cantinas patio.  The manager was Extremely rude and told us that unless we were going to order an entree we would not be allowed to dine at his restaurant.  We had full intentions of ordering drinks and appetizers.  With an attitude like that we took our business across the courtyard to Cadillac Ranch.  Excellent food and very courteous staff.
