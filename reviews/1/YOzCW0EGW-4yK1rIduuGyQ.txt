I am being utterly polite by giving this place one star. Places where I've had better food: the cafeteria in a hospital, 7-11, if I'd ever been to prison, prison. I'm not sure if Jordan's pays people to park in its lot to give the impression that the place is full. There's absolutely nothing authentically Mexican about this place, except, perhaps, for the Mexican dishwasher.  If you've recently lost your tase buds, love greasy beef dumped into a Old El Paso "taco shell" topped with shredded Velveeta and iceberg lettuce, then, boy is this the place for you. Also, if you're a fan of tomato paste in the guise of "salsa" and served from a stolen syrup container from IHOP, then do it up at Jordan's.

Please, do yourself (and your wallet) a favor and eat at the Jack-in-the Box down the street. You've been warned.
