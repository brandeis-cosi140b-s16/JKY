I love chipotle. I have gone to many other locations numerous times and have been completely satisfied. This location however was awful.  I got a chicken bowl and the portion was ridiculous it was most certainly not $9.20 worth. The portions were so small that not only did the lady in front of me comment on it but also the gentleman behind me. Also, I got my bowel to go and I live not even ten minutes from this location by the time I got home my bowl was cold. 
I love chipotle but this was the worst experience I've had at a location ever. I would recommend going to the next closest one because you are most certainly not going to get your monies worth.
