6pm on a Friday, only five tables were occupied. Nasty hostess with painted-on eyebrows tells me they can't seat us because they only have three servers. Sooo apparently their servers can't serve two tables each? No wonder this place is always empty!!! They turn customers away from their 75% empty restaurant on a Friday night!
