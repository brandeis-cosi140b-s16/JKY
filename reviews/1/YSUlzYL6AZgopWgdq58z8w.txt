Not sure if we just went on an off night or what but service was pretty slow. Some friends and I went and waited over an hour for food. Friends ordered vegetarian fajitas and you could clearly tell the food had been sitting out for a while. Tops were cold. They also didn't bring what seemed like enough tortillas for their food, and were going to charge extra for them!

I had soft tacos and there wasn't really much to them. 

Overall I wasn't impressed and despite so many good reviews I've had a bad experience and won't be coming back anytime soon.
