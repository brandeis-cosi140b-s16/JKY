We love downtown Gilbert, we live close and are so excited about all of the new restaurants.  Unfortunately we did not have a great experience and will pass on visiting again in the future. :(  We went on a Wed about 6:00pm and sat at the bar, there was quite a bit of staff coming and going from the bar, some to get their drink orders as you would expect and others to just standing around gossiping and complaining. We heard complaints about tips, about staff scheduling, about co-workers, etc. and as much as we would have liked to toon them out they were not discreet and it was nearly impossible to do so.  Now to the food... we ordered ceviche de camaron which was delicious, 3 tacos (the carne asada was pretty good, the pescado asado which came with shrimp in it and not grilled fish was confusing and just so so, and the barrio pollo which was just nasty), and el clasico sonoran dog...just steer completely clear of this one.  We did not complain, we ate, my husband enjoyed his beer, we paid and were on our way...but sorry, we will not be commin back my friends.
