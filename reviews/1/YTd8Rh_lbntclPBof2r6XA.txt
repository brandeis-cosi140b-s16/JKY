Honestly, gave this is a shot purely from the relatively high stars for a delivery place...boy oh boy was it gross. Purely from a non-meat standpoint - the vegetable burrito was one of the oddest things I've ever ate. A strange sauce it was drenched in(some kind of mayo/cheese hybrid) with tons of lettuce and cabbage and onion..It reminded me of a milio's sub in a tortilla. There was no beans or expected burrito substance.. It was easily one of the most undesirable vegetarian options I've ever had. I tried some of the sides such as the potato or rice - again, bland and TV dinner quality at best. The chips were probably SADLY the highlight of the meal..and that's only if you can tolerate incredibly salty chips and salsa with very little actual flavors..besides sodium. I can think of tons of better options in Madison(El pastor, la hacienda, burrito drive, Taquira on park, Jalapeno on Midvale, even Taco Bell(lol)).  Unless the meat options are ungodly better - I'd rather eat sides at Red Lobster than eat here again.
