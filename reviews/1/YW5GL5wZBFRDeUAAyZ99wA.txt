I hate having to write this review. Burrito Drive used to be one of my favorite takeout/delivery places in Madison, if not my favorite. I just ordered from there again after having not in awhile. I was severely disappointed. The burrito went from being a perfect, compact , & filling burrito to just another quantity instead of quality burrito. Just another terrible, messy, huge burrito with little flavor.

On top of that I found a piece of charcoal in my burrito. Let me repeat that: THERE WAS A PIECE OF CHARCOAL IN MY BURRITO. Thankfully I was eating with a knife and fork so I saw it and didn't end up chewing on it. Seriously could have been a horrible experience if I was eating the burrito with my hands.

Something has changed there and now this place is bad. I'll be reluctant to order from them again and only would in worst case starving & nothing is open scenario.

I will try them again in hopes this was a fluke because this place was really really good when I was ordering from them a lot this past fall/winter.
