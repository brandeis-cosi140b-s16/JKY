I'm not one to leave reviews or complain, but this is easily the worst dining experience of my life. The server was very, very rude. She wrote down my fiancés order and still came back to ask what he wanted. My food came out twenty minutes later because they were out of ceviche, which is what I ordered. My fiancés quesadilla was wet and cold. There was gristle in the chicken. When my food finally came out, the potatoes were greasy and undercooked. The bacon was the most over-cooked bacon I have ever seen. It was practically leather. I know I ordered bacon and eggs at a Mexican restaurant but I was afraid to order anything else. With my meal, I asked for a tortilla instead of toast and they still brought toast. I asked her to take my meal back and she didn't even apologize and actually laughed. And on top of all of that, the beer was warm!! This place doesn't even deserve one star. If you want good Mexican, go next door to La Santisima!! Or even, Taco Bell would be better!
