I'm sure I've been eating that this place since before birth.  I was born an raised in Glendale.  

The hostess that sat us took us to a table that still had plates, and cups from the last customers. We had to point it out to her if she was going to clear the table.  I had the Red Menudo, and my guest had the Carne Asada burrito. The order took 1 hour 20 minutes to get to us.  Burrito was cold to the touch, and other food matter on the plate that I'm thinking was not garnish. I asked that it be redone fresh, which it was. I waited to eat because my guest was w/o her order.  When food was brought back out, I was asked if I wanted mine reheated at which said no. My Red Menudo was orange in color, and the broth/caldo had no taste to it at all. This was a waist of 2 hours of my Sunday.  I have always look the other way when it came to La Perla Caf√©, but I'm so done.  I will find another place to take my family after Mass.
