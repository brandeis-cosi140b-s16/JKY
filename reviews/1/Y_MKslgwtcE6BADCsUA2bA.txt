I went in looking for a good margarita and some food. I asked if they made they margarita  mix fresh with real limes or used a sweet and sour mix. They use a mix and add to it. So I did not order a margarita., I looked at the menu and decided it was too expensive for me to eat  there. $10.00 for a cheese  enchilada and sides, first I really didn't t want the sides , there was no ala carte menu. So I opted not to eat there. The place was nice and clean. The customers are rude.
