What ever you do don't waste your money here.  I am not the person who likes to send food back, in fact I hate to do it.  I had no choice here, this was by far the worst mexican food I have eaten.  The food has such a horrible after taste.  I not only hated my meal but tried my boyfriends as well and it was still terrible.  The service compares to the food, we waited forvever just for a server to come over and greet us.  I wouldn't even recommend this place to my enemies.
