I have went to this location and the customer service is terrible.  The food is not bad but the people are very rude.  They got my order completly wrong,   forgot part of my order.  So with part of my order I drove back.  Asked the manager to give me the burritos that I asked for and to remake my order cause the food I had was going to be cold by the time I got home She refused.  So I paid for a part order and cold food that I had to heat up once I got home.  Wow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I won't be back....  My advice check your order before you leave.  Don't expect managment to try to make you happy.  The manager was a woman.  I would say lady but she didn't act like one.
