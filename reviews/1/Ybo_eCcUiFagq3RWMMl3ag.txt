After a close inspection of the menu, the salad is the closest item that can even remotely be considered healthy. I stayed with the grilled chicken, and it tasted like it was boiled, no texture, I am not even sure what I put into my mouth. 
Suffice to say, stay away from the chicken. The cheese sauce, what they call "queso fresco" is nothing at all fresco and all disgustingo. Their dressing is equally disgusting, not even remotely considered "mexican" nor is it fit for human consumption. Beware of the bacon bits, if they were repurposed for doggie treats, I'd feel obliged to call the ASPCA for inhumane treatment. 
I ordered the Platino Margarita, pretty sure It was $17, it calls for fresh lime juice they put some premixed stuff in a bottle into my drink and called it a day. Even the drink was subpar and worth less than half the cost that they charged. 

If you happen to land in Charlotte because American Airline sucks and refuses to help you out, stay away from this restaurant. Even their customer service sucks, which surprisingly is the least of their problems. Decor is not bad.
