It pains me to rate a Filibertos anything less than 5 stars, but this particular location just sucks. Today, for example, I got the Monday 3 Rolled Tacos with Cheese special and when I got the food home, there was hardly any cheese on them at all. Anyone who has EVER has Fili's rolled tacos knows that they're usually piled high with cheese. Then the red sauce was literally flavorless red water. What the?!?! I have never seen anything like it before in my life. 

I won't go to this location again. I will definitely go a few miles out of my way and hit the new Filibertos on 35th & Southern instead...THEY are the real Filibertos we all know and love!
