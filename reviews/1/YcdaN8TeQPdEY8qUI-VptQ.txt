No Thanks! 

Happy Hour specials are not that great, and definitely not worth waiting a long time while sitting at the bar and there are 5 bartenders fiddling their thumbs.
Definitely not good to have 3 bartenders in an hour period and then when tabbing out the 3rd bartender cops an attitude b/c we cant remember if we already paid for one or two of our drinks, considering we were asked to tab out 10 mins into our 1st drink! 

Food is less than average, WHERE is the flavor??? 
The staff seemed completed LOST! No thanks!
