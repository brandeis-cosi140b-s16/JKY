My family visited the restaurant recently. There was a dispute about the bill and the manager was called in at the request of my family. The manager was not only not nice but very unprofessional. We are hard working people. We expect good service because we pay for what we order and also tip accordingly. We have never been treated so disrespectfully. There was not even an offer of, "I'm sorry for the misunderstanding".....Attention all managers: Being apologetic in the face of controversy doesn't suggest a weakness. There was not even an attempt to right the wrong. We work hard for our money also and like to be wise in spending as we make decisions to relax and have recreation. My level of disappointment can not be expressed any further than saying.....This was really awful treatment of guests in your restaurant. No words......
