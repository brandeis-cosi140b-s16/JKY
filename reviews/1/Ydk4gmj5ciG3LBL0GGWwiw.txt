Service was bad. Didn't have Bohemia beer (hello, is this a high-end Mexican restaurant, amigo?). And the kitchen had run out of Duck tacos at 6 pm. One star because the girls at the hostess stand were cute and very sweet. Lindo Michoacan is better authentic Mexican. Dos Caminos is better pretentious Mexican.
