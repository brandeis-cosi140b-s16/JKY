I have a difficult time believing that anyone giving a good rating for this restaurant isn't related to the owners.  My husband and I were downtown Pittsburgh looking for a quick bite to eat.  We entered this restaurant, and a female Russian server was behind the cash register, doing some kind of paperwork.  We stood there for quite a while as she ignored us, and finally I told my husband that we should just leave.  At that point, my husband asked her if anyone was going to come to seat us and she just looked at us blankly like an idiot and grabbed a few menus & seated us.

 When she asked us what we wanted to drink, I ordered a cocktail (because I don't drink beer), and she told me they didn't have it.  I looked at her and said "You don't have Vodka??!!" so she grabbed the bartender to come over, and of course, they did have it, she just couldn't understand  English.  We ordered burritos and we proceeded to sit and wait for at least a half hour, while we watched a large table of Mexicans (presumably friends or relatives) get golden treatment by having several servers running back and forth to cater to them, while we sat watching our waitress taking care of one of the Mexican's infant.  

After the burritos finally came, they were the most pathetic burritos I ever had.  I ordered a chicken burrito, and my husband ordered a chorizo one.  Both of us had a difficult time finding much meat in our burritos, as they were just packed with rice and a few token pieces of meat.  They were tasteless and dry and not very hot.

After we had to hunt down our waitress to pay the bill, she asked us how we liked our meal.  I told her it was horrible and unacceptable, and she looked at me like I had 3 eyes.  I would never, ever suggest this restaurant to anyone - the food and service was total garbage.
