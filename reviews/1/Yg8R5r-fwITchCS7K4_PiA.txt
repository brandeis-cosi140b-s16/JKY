Customer service seems to be nonexistent here. I walked in just after 11:00am on a Thurdsay and I was the only customer in the restaurant. There was a female at the register when I walked in. She looked at me, never said anything and turned around and walked in the back. A few minutes later a man came to the register, never said anything just looked at me. I gave him my order and paid for it. Still not a word from this guy, he was too busy talking cook. After I paid he just walked away, my receipt still in the register. 

I sat and waited for my food, still the only customer in the restaurant. After a few minutes my order is ready and sitting on the counter. Still no one behind the register. I had to walk back up to the counter and ask for my food that had been sitting back there ready for several minutes. The cook came out from the back to give my my order. 

I order the beef taco plate. The tacos were dripping with oil, disgusting!!!

I will never eat another Filibertos EVER AGAIN!
Next time I will play it save and go to Taco Bell.
