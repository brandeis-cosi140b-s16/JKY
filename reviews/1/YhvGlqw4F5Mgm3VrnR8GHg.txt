Walked into the restaurant on a very slow evening and was escorted to our table. The waitress appeared after 10 minutes and took our drink order. 15 minutes late the drinks were delivered. We placed our food order and the waitress disappeared. 25 minutes elapsed and we were on the way out when the waitress  appeared to deliver our order. We should have kept on walking as the food we had was more like something concocted in a small town in northern Canada. Tasteless all around and the salsa resembled ketchup with a few chunks of tomato thrown in. Should have gone to the burger joint instead. The tip was as non-existent as the waitress.
