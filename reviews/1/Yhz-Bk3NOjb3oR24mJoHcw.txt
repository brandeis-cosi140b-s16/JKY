This is the worst chipotle location. Bad service. Horrible staff. They are never attentive, and I always have to repeat myself multiple times. I live close so I've been countless times at all times of the day. Unfortunately, each visit, the bad tends to outweigh the good. Had to pay double portion of meat just to get the amount I get at any other location. I will drive further for a better chipotle experience.
