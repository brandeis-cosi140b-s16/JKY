Beautiful decor.

And thats it. 
This place is absolutely worthless. I thought the food was horrible; their "renditions" on classics like the chile relleno just ended up as awkward sloppy looking things on my place that just flat out sucked. The waitress checked on us once maybe the whole night.  But, when I do finally get her to ask for some sour creme for the last 3 now bites of my meal, I get this HUGE glob and unknowingly get charged 2 bucks for it!!  

For TWO PEOPLE - two entres, and two drinks nothing more - 80 BUCKS.  RIDICULOUS! 

Will never go there again, would not recommend anyone going there ever or again, way too cool for school.
