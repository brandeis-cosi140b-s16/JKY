This food sucks. Horchata sucks taste like water with a lil of cinnamon. Eww the burritos are very thin and have no rice,  no flavor at all. the sopes looked ok, but the first bite says run away!!! It had some thing crunchy in it, i look and beans very hard. Has no flavor. Raspado de Tamarindo eww nasty. The only good thing was the salt with lemon. My experience. 9/2/14 Never coming here again. Disgusting
