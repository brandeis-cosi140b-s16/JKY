Food is pretty good, the service is horrible.  I won't be coming back to this place again.  I asked for a cup of water at the drive thru and they told me no.  Not that it cost something, just no. I would have paid for it for a small amount.  With service like this I'm sure it will be closed soon.  Don't waste your time, go to a place where your business is wanted.
