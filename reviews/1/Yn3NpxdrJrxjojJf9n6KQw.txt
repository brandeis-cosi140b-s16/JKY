Oh boy.
The first thing I noticed was that my menu was kind of gross. There was salsa squished inside of it. Yuck.

Secondly, the plates were BURNING hot. You could not touch them, and they were so big that they didn't fit on the table and we had to burn our hands moving the plates to make room. That was only a small issue, although it did give us the impression that they were just putting the food on the plates and putting them in a microwave...

Thirdly, the food was not good. Rice was dry, shrimp was wayyyy overcooked and just overall, it was horrible. Not to mention that my plate was not cleaned properly whatsoever. The corn tortillas were also the kind you buy from the store. I have the same kind in my fridge. However, everyone lost their appetite officially once a customer behind us began to complain.

There was a huge hair wrapped in her food -- and it took a while for the waiter (who spoke no English) to give her another plate.

We complained as well about our food and my dirty plate, and he didn't understand anything, but thankfully he did understand to take it off of our check.

(Also, I wanted to mention that the chips are simply taken out of some weird file cabinet-looking drawer and put a bowl... I could see them do that from where I was.)

Don't go here. It's just not worth it.

UPDATE: My sister and father both had gross diarrhea today -- my dad's started last night a couple hours after dinner. That does it, guys -- don't go. Don't risk food poisoning or upsetting your stomach in any way.
