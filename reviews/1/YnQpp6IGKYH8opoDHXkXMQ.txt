Okay so where do I begin.  It was sooooo gross that I have a hard time looking at lettuce any more.  They didn't drain it it leeked into my rice, beans and Enchiladas.. I had to use a napkin to to drain the water becuase i did not dare send it back.  Now the Enchiladas couldn't even called enchiladas.  They had no enchilada sauce and they were greasy... the flautas someone else had were just harden greasy tortilla. NOTHING had flavor.  Ugh I will never go back.
