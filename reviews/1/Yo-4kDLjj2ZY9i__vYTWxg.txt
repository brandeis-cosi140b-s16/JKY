This california chain used to be reasonable, tasty and have the best margaritas (you could pick from a myriad of tequilas to try), and I have spent well over $1,000 in vegas tris at their locations with family and friends.   Alas, a few years back corporate made a change to be more trendy and therefore raise prices.  They have made a further policy to no longer take traveler s checks.  When I asked to speak to the manager I was actually refused and he hid in the kitchen and would not come out.  There is a survey on the receipt, so I called it while in the store.  To date no one has retuned my call. Average, overpriced, insincere.  If it wasn t for their foot long frozen drinks to college kids they d be out of business.  Gonzales y Gonzales (At NYNY) uses real white meat chicken in their burrito and charges $4 less.   Oh an La Salsa charges for chips & salsa.  What the?  You can do so much better than a California chain that doesn t care anymore
