HORRIBLE experience!

We arrived and were seated in the bar area, even though we only wanted dinner.  After 10 minutes we flagged down a server who was walking by and asked who our server was, as we had not been waited on.  She said our server was the bartender, but she would take our order for us on his behalf, which we appreciated.  Another 15 minutes passed and no food yet and our tea glasses had been empty.  We then contacted a manager who said she resolved the situation and she apologized and refilled our tea.  The manager said our food was ready and there was a mixup on table assignments.  Another 15 minutes later customers who were seated after we arrived received their dinner order.  That was the last straw and contacted the manager again to let her know we never received our food and that we were leaving and wouldn't be back.  First and last visit!
