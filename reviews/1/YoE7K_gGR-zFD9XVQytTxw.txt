Giving one star base on the horribly rude service provided to us by Andrea. My two friends came down for our penthouse for a midday snack and could hardly find any place serving food. This was an easy option and it had plenty of patrons as we walked to the bar. Andrea barely greeted us with words or eye contact as she threw menus our way. Poisoned us with gluten filled food when she told us it was gluten free... And over charged us on alcohol.
