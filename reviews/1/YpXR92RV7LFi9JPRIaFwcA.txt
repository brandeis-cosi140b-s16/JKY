Ok, I gave them another chance after my last review in March. They have always been fair with their portions up til recently. They either changed cooks, or have purposely cut portions. I again order the #3 Taco dinner. When he handed it to me I could tell by the weight of it that there was an issue. Waited to get home. There was barely any meat on the taco's and still they cut down the rice and bean amount. That was more tolerable thank skimping on the meat in the taco. I wish I could attach a picture. After many years of going here I am not happy at all these past two times. They may have lost a loyal customer. I may say 3 strikes and your out in order to see if they fix this problem. Also, this dinner has no onions in it and they got some onions in it, which I hate. What is going on Filiberto's Southern Ave?!?!?!?!
