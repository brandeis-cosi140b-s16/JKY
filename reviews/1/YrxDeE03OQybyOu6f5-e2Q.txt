Drove 14 miles to this place out of the way based on Yelp reviews only to be told we had to order to go, when it is 108Â° outside and we are from Colorado so no place but our vehicle to eat. There were open tables but I guess several people had pre reserved tables?? What's up with that! Very disappointed!! Going to give our business to another local Mexican restaurant.
