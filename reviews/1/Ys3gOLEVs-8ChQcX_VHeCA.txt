My father and I have been going to this restaurant since the hotel opened many moons ago.  99% of the time it is good food and good service.   They recently changed the name and some of the menu items.  I'm  all for change if it is for the better.  THIS IS NOT.
Last night we went to grab a quick bite.  The poor server was so overwhelmed doing so much without any support.  Since we go there at least 3 times a month the staff knows us.  I have seen the lack of support for their team in the last couple months and how the service has gotten so bad.  We waited for over 10 minutes for drinks, 25 minutes for the food, and another 10 minutes to get cashed out.  I saw the server running all over trying to do his best.  
The food-  I ordered the fajita chicken salad like I have many times in the past.  I was embarrassed for the company to actually put that salad on the table in front of ANY GUEST!!!  The chicken was diced up so tiny it looked like it was for a 2 year old.  Oh where was the rest of the salad.  Nothing but tiny diced up chicken and lots of lettuce.
My dad, who has had the fajitas so many times couldn't even eat one.  The chicken had no flavor, overcooked, and there were no onions.  We asked for extra and got none.  Terrible.
I have seen their business die down a lot since the new menu.  For sure now I know why.
