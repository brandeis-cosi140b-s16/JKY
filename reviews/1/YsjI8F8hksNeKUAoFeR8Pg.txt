After two trips to Pink Taco - the second was to make sure I was giving it a fair chance - I know it's all about the novelty of the name with no substance.  Two favorable items are the excellent service and nifty interior.  What's going to give Harry Morton his big tax writeoff is the quality of the food and drink (or lack thereof) and the music was so loud during both visits I couldn't carry on a conversation with my dinner companions.  An improvement in quality of food and atmosphere is going to be necessary to keep this thing alive after the novelty goes away.  The marguerita on the second visit was so damned tart I couldn't finish it.  Good luck, Harry, I'm afraid you're gonna need it.
