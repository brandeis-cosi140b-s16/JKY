As much as I tried to like this place, it was not good at all. 
The carne asada burrito was small, dry and salty. The side order of guacamole was an embarrassment due to the miniscule size.
All the prices on the menu have been changed (higher cost).
$6.99 and up for a breakfast burrito?
The 5 star reviews for similar items as I ordered are unreliable.
