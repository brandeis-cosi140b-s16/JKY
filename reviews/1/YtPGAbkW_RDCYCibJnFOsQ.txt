Well I am new to Charlotte and went here after seeing the reviews thinking it had to be atleast fairly good. But as much as I tried to like it I really really didnt.

I had the nachos supreme- with no jalape√±os and with beef. First off- it came out looking like a mess- but that's okay it's the taste that matters! I think the real issue here was the cheese. It was hard to explain. Because I would say it looked and had the consistency of cheese wiz from a can but I could also clearly see some was actual shredded and sprinkled. But it was liquid like- it didn't pull like cheese. I hope this makes sense. It was also really bland. The only good part was the guac which I asked for.

I also got a sex on the beach- no ice or anything wasn't even cold. So, unfortunately I won't be back. But I'm uploading a photo just so people don't think I'm a liar lol
