Have been here a couple of times, not by choice.  I thought the place was pretty filthy for a restaurant... actually it was pretty filthy for a backroads gas station restroom.  Bugs all over the floor, dirt, grime and a smell.  The food was OK at best - certainly not the best Mex food around; not the best Mex food on Chandler Boulevard for that matter.  As I am known to do, I checked out their report on Maricopa County's restaurant ratings site.  WHOAH!!!!!!  Mind you this was a while ago but I pretty much put my foot down and decided not to go there.
