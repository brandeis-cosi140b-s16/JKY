Just an okay burrito, lots of options, but none that are out of this world.  The service is complete and total garbage; I've left before ordering three times due to waiting for over 15 minutes for a waiter/waitress to take our order.  If it wasn't for being the only burrito place around I wouldn't step foot in here again.
