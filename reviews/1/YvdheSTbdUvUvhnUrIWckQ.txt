I came here a few days ago before the Opening Day game for the Diamondbacks.  My boyfriend was very excited to try this place since we heard great things.  However, we didn't have a very good experience.  As I walked into the establishment, I noticed how dirty the whole place seemed to be.  There were dirty tables everywhere and the floor was no different.  No one was coming around to clean either.  

We ordered the Diamondbacks Opening Day deal with 2 tacos and a beer.  We ordered one pork and one steak, they were both bland and tiny and the chips and salsa were just okay. Everything was overpriced for what you got.   We ate outside on the small patio and it was like a garbage bomb went off out there.  Someone finally  came out to clean the tables, but didn't bother to pick up any of the napkins, salsa, or other trash on the floor, that patio remained dirty, even after it was "cleaned."   It was a complete mess.  

I don't see the big fuss over this place, I will not be coming back.
