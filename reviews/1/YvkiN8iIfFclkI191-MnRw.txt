THIS CHIPOTLE SUCKS. they have 4 to 5 idiots in the back screwing around when there is literally 15 people waiting in line. Yes I counted. 1 idiot on register and 1 idiot making all the food. 1! And if it's not 1 it's 2. Step your employee game up and learn how to handle rush hour I go to plenty of other locations on Vegas and they fly compared to these idiots. Learn to hurry the fuck up its not that hard your menu has less than 10 things to make. Unbelievable
