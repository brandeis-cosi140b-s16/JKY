I hate to give Maria Maria 1 star, but I don't have a choice, and here's why. My husband, In-laws and I  headed on over for a lovely dinner at Maria Maria. For a Sunday night it wasn't as busy as I expected, but whatever. The decor was cool and the service was excellent. They bring out 3 different kinds of salsas and they were all very very good. The Sangrias were half off and that was even better. So my brother in law and I ordered the fish tacos, and my sister in law ordered the chicken burrito and my husband ordered chicken something. Anyway, the food was excellent, everything was cooked with lots of flavor and had a kick in every bite. Here I thought we just found our new favorite mexican restaurant. Now here comes  the 1 star - the next day I felt awful, and I'll just keep it at that. Later on I got a text from my sister in law saying she felt awful and her husband stayed home from work because, you guessed it, he felt awful too. So we all felt like crap. Coinkadink? I think not. Not a good day for the three of us, however my husband was untouched by the horiffic consequences of eating there, that is until today. Two days after we ate there it finally hit him. Bad food? Someone forget to wash their hands? No idea, but that's the last time any of us are going there. Food poisoning is not fun people. It's too bad because it really was good, but not worth it for me to try it again. So thank you Maria Maria for giving me the day off!
