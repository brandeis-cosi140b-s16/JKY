I wish zero stars were an option!! I'm only writing this review to warn potential diners of the horrible service and mediocre at best food. I drove thru the lady ''maribel'' was rude as possible I ordered two combos one rolled tacos BEEF with extra cheese and guacamole on the side. When I got my food she gave me one of each little salsa and I double checked by asking her that my rolled tacos were indeed beef not chicken. Then I had to ask for my side of guacamole again which she made obvious was a real hassle for her. Get home chicken rolled tacos with barley any cheese. Don't waste your time and money Maria's taco shop is right across the street.
