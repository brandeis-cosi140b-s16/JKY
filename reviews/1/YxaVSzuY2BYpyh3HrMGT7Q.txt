Nope. I got a taco and enchilada combo. The taco dripped massive amounts of grease. I have no idea what the meat was, but it wasn't chicken, lol. For some reason, the cheese was crispy and burned....did they deep fry the whole thing? The cheese inside of the enchilada wasn't even slightly melted. It was just a tortilla with cold shredded cheese and some bitter red sauce. It's less than 2 minutes from my house and open late, so I was hopeful. Until I can find a better, close, open late alternative, I'll stick to Chipotle or Senor taco.
