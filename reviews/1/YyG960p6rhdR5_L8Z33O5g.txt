I was here to watch the Super Bowl and the setup was not bad. 4 big TV's to watch the game. Some free food and I believe they had $2.50 pints. 
Now the service or should I say, what service. The girl working that night made it clear that she was not there for anything other than to watch the game from the table behind us. Maybe it was two of her friends at the table, but she sat there for most of the game and I had to ask her for service. Then she never went out of her way. 
Ordered the fried ice-cream and it had no outer shell on it. When we said something to her about it, her response was that's how they all are. Then we had to tell her we did not want it then and her response was "ok."
Never did she ask not offer to fix it. 
When we arrived, I asked what specials they had and the response was $2.50 pints. Just look at FaceBook to find out they had a list of specials. A few different drinks (beer, margaritas, and food) specials, just to name a few. 
I will never choose to come back here again. 
I had such high hopes as I wanted to find a good Mexican place in Madison. It's not this place. :-(
