Wow, how awful can this place be.  

First I walked in at 2pm on a Sunday afternoon and there were 3 people in line ahead of me.  Nearly 10 minutes later my nachos were being started.  It would have been faster to drive to Mexico City to get my food.

I ordered nachos.  Chips, cheese, rice and veggies.  Let's not forget the pint of sour cream they dumped on them.  Seriously, the sour cream was cold, and there was so much of it that it was running down the outside of the bowl.  The nacho chips became soggy in 5 minutes and then the entire bowl of nachos were tossed in the Qdoba garbage can.  It took longer to get the food then it did to dispose of it.  The soda was horrid too and had more syrup than Aunt Jamima.  All for the low, low price of $10.13.  I really took it in the shorts here, and the poor english speaking staff could have cared less.

I think I'd gladly walk across East Washington Ave, and feel like Frogger, take the risk of dodging the cars and go to Chipole next time I want this style of Mexican fare.  Knowing I might get hit by a bus trying to avoid this Qdoba location should tell you just how much it sucks.
