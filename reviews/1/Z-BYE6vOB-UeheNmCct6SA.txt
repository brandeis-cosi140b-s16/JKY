I visited Cafe Rio last Thursday while waiting for an item to be tailored at Men's Warehouse. The lady behind the counter asked the gentleman in front of me what he would like and asked him if he wanted cheese, guacamole etc. she gets to me and I told her I wanted the tamales and she asked me what salsa I wanted and I told her the spicy one then she doesn't ask me if I want cheese like she asked the previous man and she just sprinkles cheese all over it and I'm lactose intolerant so I advise her but she got upset and had an attitude and angrily dumped the food in the trash. Then she asked me what I wanted on it one by one, which she should have done in the first place. I got my food and ate it because I had paid for it, but the tamales were gross to me. I expected the food to be better and better service.
