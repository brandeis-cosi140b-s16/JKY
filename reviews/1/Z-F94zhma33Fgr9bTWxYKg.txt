I'd give a 0 if I could. The staff is very friendly, but the food is HORRIBLE! My husband and I got food poisoning from some lengua tacos and Carne asada fries. I guess I should've seen it coming when the cashier/cook said he was having trouble finding the lengua. (cow tongue. Hey, don't knock it till you try it... Somewhere else, of course.)
