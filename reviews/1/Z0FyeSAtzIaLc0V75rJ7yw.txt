Sadly nostalgia doesn't make the food here any less bland. I am very generous when I dine out, and always will find something positive to end the meal. In this case the positive was that I did not have to pay for the horrendous meal. 

Word to the wise- if a place that serves mexican food serves you ketchup as salsa, leave immediately. 

My boyfriend and I set the salsa aside and ordered the very basic machaca beef burritos. What we got was GRAY meat, with not one ounce of seasoning. 

At this point we apologized to our waiter, offered to pay for the drinks and salsa, but he seemed used to this and said not to worry about it. At first he tried to say they make the meat with eggs. But saw quickly that we would not be buying that story. We did leave a nice tip for the poor guy.

This is what happens when you have uninspired people making food. 

Too Sad.
