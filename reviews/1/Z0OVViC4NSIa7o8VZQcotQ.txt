Ever since Laredo's first came to Madison it has been one of my favorite Mexican places. Not only because of the good food but the good prices and service. 

I hate to say Laredo's has fallen victim to trying to cut back food quality and service to save a buck. But, at the same time, raising their prices. It started about a year ago when they started adding chunks of potatoes to their meat to try and stretch it to go further. Now, they have slipped some other unknown filler into the meat along with the potatoes to stretch it further. 

Last night I went with my wife and stepson for dinner.  All three of our entrees were cold.  I ordered the enchiladas sonora.  The rice was a solid mass and was simply scooped from a much larger preparation...probably a corner of a large kitchen pan based on it's shape/density.  The refried beans were ice cold.  The chicken enchiladas were simply thrown together... cold with precooked chicken.  It was gross.  I have worked previously in the service industry and I honestly do not know how this disaster of a meal could have left the kitchen.   

I'm sad to say the Laredo's I grew to love no longer exists and I can ever go back. Good luck if you go there.
