This location is by far the worse. I drive all the way to Mesa when I want chipotle now. They are sloppy, rude, and always late with my app order. The barbacoa is always full of fat and they give so little of it I'm lucky to even get a little bit of meat after picking the fat out. Been here several times. Always a disappointment.
