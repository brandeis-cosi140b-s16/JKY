The lime in the water was nice. The staff were friendly. We didn't get sick.

That was the good part. 

The food was boring. Everything tasted like it was out of a can or frozen. The chips were ok but the salsa tasted like tomato sauce. The chicken looked like Chicken of the Sea. 

Why is it popular? It must be due to people who don't eat authentic Mexican food.
