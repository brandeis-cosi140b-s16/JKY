The food here is usually good but the service is terrible. I waited 30 minutes today for a simple burrito because the staff didn't put my order in. I explained (politely) that I had to get to work and would just like my money back. They refused and kept telling me that it was coming any minute. When it finally showed up in the middle of my last request for a refund the girl said "Whatever." I through the food in the trash and went somewhere else - I will never come here again and advise anyone in a hurry to reconsider this place. If you have 30 minutes to wait and don't mind the rude staff go for it.
