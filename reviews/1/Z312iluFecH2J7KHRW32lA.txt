I am very disappointed in this place.  I enjoyed going for Happy Hour because it is in the neighborhood, the beer is cold and they had the best salsa and chips around....The food has always been horrible so I never ordered food maybe the occasional fundido dip which is always awful!) WELL, when we got to the bar we noticed that they NO LONGER have the salsa...Instead of making it in the kitchen they have contracted out to some place to make the salsa.  It was terrible.  It tasted like a bland version of marinara.  So disappointing.  So I no longer have a reason to go to Salty's.
