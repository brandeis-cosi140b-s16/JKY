My wife went there for lunch at  12:45 03/05/2015.
There was 2 clerks working. My wife was getting very fraustrated when they were not making eye  contact with her as a customer.  When she got to the cash register she noticed an overflowing Trash and lots of trash on the floor. At that point she was disgusted and loss her appetite. Not to mention the very poor customer service. 
Thank you qdoba employees at that time for making my wife miserable. I had to hear about it when she got home. 
Not blaming qdoba,I'm blaming the employees at that time.
