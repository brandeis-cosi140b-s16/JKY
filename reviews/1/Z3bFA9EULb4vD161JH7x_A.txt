It's hard to find good Mexican food in Pittsburgh, but Mexi Casa is probably the worst. I cannot begin to tell you how disgusting the fajitas are. For $16 you get 4 tortillas, boiled beef, lettuce, flavorless cheese, peppers, onions, 1/2 lb. sour cream and NO SALSA OF ANY KIND, NO RICE, NO BEANS. If you want salsa, you have to order it as a side! My husband, who's not a picky eater, could not finish them. The burritos are bland as well. When you order black beans you get exactly that... black beans straight from a can. I can't even believe they dare to serve that and call it a side. The only thing that is decent is the Southwest Platter, but that doesn't make up for the rest. Terrible, overpriced "Mexican" food. If you're in the area, go to Mad Mex instead. Heck, even Chipotle is better than this place.
