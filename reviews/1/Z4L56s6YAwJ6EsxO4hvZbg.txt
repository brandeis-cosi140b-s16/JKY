For several consecutive trips, food order was wrong. AGAIN. They say they check the orders, they don't. Eggs ordered over-med, they were raw in center. Vegetarian order of no meat on burrito, they add bacon. Had to trip all the way back. While we waited again, the Mngr sat in a booth and fed himself, never addressed the issue on his own. BE WARNED, they also recently started charging for salsa. Mngr states salsa doesn't come with burritos per policy and charged $1.39 per 5oz cup!  If money is tight and you have to hang customers out with salsa charges, address the smell of cleaning chems first that smack you when u walk in. So hard to want to eat and stay because it smells like a bathroom no matter where you sit.
