Terrible, terrible, terrible..service is aweful, food is aweful, service is aweful. Make the trip to Xaviers on Higley and Southern, the extra few minutes is worth it. Gordys, you are not ready to be a restaurant. Try a food truck first and figure out how to give great customer service and great food. Did I say aweful. Burnt beans? Overcharged me twice. Took 30 min to get my order with only two people in the restaurant?
