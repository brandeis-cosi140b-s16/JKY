Their chicken ALWAYS tastes dry.  The staff is not friendly, and the last time I went in there, the person taking orders and adding toppings did not speak english.....wow.  Although I live within a 2 minute drive, I go to the Salsarita's in Cotswold.  They have better chips, fresher ingredients, larger burritos, better salsa...and their chicken isn't dry!!!
