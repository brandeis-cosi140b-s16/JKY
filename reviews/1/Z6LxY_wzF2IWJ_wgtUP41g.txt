I can't ever recall being so mislead by Yelp reviews. This place was horrible. We went at 7:30 in the evening and there were no customers. So it seems that would tell you something. The waitress tried to be friendly but she did not speak English very well, so she tried to avoid interaction with us, The food tasted like something you would get out of the frozen food section at Fry's. The location itself is extremely hard to find if you are not local. Would not recommend this place to anyone.
