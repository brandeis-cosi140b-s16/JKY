Took clients here for a nice dinner with margaritas and good mexican food.  Almost everyone ordered the Shrimp Relleno...which appeared to be a pretty good dish.  I ordered the Enchiladas De Rez...beef enchiladas.  One looked like pork...I thought "Huh, okay maybe they subbed a pork for a beef" so I ate it not wanting to cause a fuss...anyway, puked when I got back to the hotel and three days later in the ER, the Doc says, "Son, you exhibit all the sysmptoms of Botulism poisoning".  Pretty nasty stuff...finally over it but I can assure you, never ever ever ever will I come close to that place ever again.  Good luck to anyone that eats there...cheers!
