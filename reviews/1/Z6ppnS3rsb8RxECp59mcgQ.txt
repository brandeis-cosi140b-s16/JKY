Well I just had to update my review of Moreno's in Central Chandler. Since I live so close to this location and the food has never been a real problem I continue to patronize this business. Recently I been very frustrated with the gals that take orders, especially phone orders. It ranges from being placed on order for a extended time periods to having to repeat my order several times.  Yesterday I  called in another for menudo and had go over my order three times. Now just this morning I called to place an order and was placed on hold three times before my call was taken (I said don't place me back on hold). because of previous problems with phone orders I was careful to have them repeat my order. I was told it would be about ten minutes. I did a few things around the house before leaving. Since I live a block away I figured after 15 minutes of placing my order it would be ready. When I walked in it was not busy. I walked up to pay for my order and it seems the help they have do not have a grasp of what they are doing. The young lady who help me took my money then walked away to take out orders to customers sitting in the dining area. Then she took two orders for walk in customers and actually served their menudo before my call order was filled. Twenty five minutes after I called in my order still nothing. Several customers who walked in after me placed their orders and served. I finally got her attention and asked about my order she asked what was my order. I said you took my money and don't know my order.  She just looked at me. She finally turned around to the food window got my order which was there the whole time. Now it get home only to discover my chorizo breakfast burrito was a bacon breakfast burrito! UNBELIEVABLE!  Nothing else to say!!!!!
