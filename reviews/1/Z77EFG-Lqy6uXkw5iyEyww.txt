Terrible customer service. I got bombarded at the front door for ID, keep in mind I'm 25, so my ID is horizontal but the guy still insisted I take it out of my wallet. The person at the front did not know how to work their merchant operating system. My card wasn't working so she told me she couldn't use it. I had to prompt her to enter it manually, I thought that would be common since. I had a party of 8 but was told I could not put tables together. Eight people at 13$ entry that's 104$ and you couldn't but tables together? Ridiculous. Overall they had terrible customer service, and seemed not to appreciate my business, so they have lost it. It's no wonder they went under before, with this service it guaranteed to happen again.
