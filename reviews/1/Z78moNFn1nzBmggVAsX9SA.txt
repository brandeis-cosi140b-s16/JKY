Food was so-so.  You can find better, for a lower price.  Nothing special.  Margaritas were good though.  The biggest problem we had was service.  We had a big group, and they absolutely refused to let 3 groups of us pay with 3 separate credit cards.  They alleged that their system could not utilize 3 cards to pay for one bill.  Sorry but no one believes that.  Your management made a decision that they didn't want their servers taking time to use 3 different cards for 3 different amounts, but you can't convince anyone that your system won't allow it.  They said if our 3 groups wanted to divide it equally 3 ways, they could do that, but they couldn't let 1 group (the big group, with margaritas on the bill) pay $100, and group 2 pay $50 and group 3 pay $75.  The server was rude about it, and so we figured it out (one person charged the whole bill on their card, and the other two of us went to the ATM and pay him our parts).  I left with a bad experience at this restaurant, and won't be returning.  If the food had been outstanding, maybe I'd try again.  But it wasn't, and the poor service and unfriendly policies will keep us away.  The area has many many great dining options.  Blue Adobe Grill might be one of them if they take better care of their customers.
