So me and my family decided to go and check this place out. Somebody needs to call Gordon Ramsey!!! The food took about 10 minutes to come out which is always a bad sign of precook food, which it was. Me being mexican know a thing or two about good tasting mexican food and let me tell you this food is horrendous! !  I dont know how this place is still in business? ! Anyways if I wanted microwaveable mexican  food, I would had stop by my local grocery store.  Honestly it would had tasted a whole lot better.
