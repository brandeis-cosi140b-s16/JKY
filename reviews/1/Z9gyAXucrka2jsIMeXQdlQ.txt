Live in Anthem and have frequented the place over the past few years.  I will not return after the last two visits.  Has been a place to sit on the patio after work and unwind with a decent meal.  Two visits ago, after having the carne machaca, I felt ill but dismissed it as something other than the meal.  After my last visit, I spent the night vomiting up Carne Asada and onions.  All night long.  Today I'm not able to attend work as I need to have immediate access to sitting on a toilet.  It is too bad the place has fallen into this state - not many decent places to grab a meal in Anthem.
