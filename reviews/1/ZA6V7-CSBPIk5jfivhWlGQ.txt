Tried the new Pasqual's last week and was very disappointed.
We started with the chips and guacamole ($6.95). I enjoy Pasqual's salsa, but the guacamole was very citrus-y. The chips were way oversalted. Nevertheless, we would have appreciated an offer of more chips which were served on a plate rather than in a basket.
My companion ordered a steak burrito which was adequate. It was helped by a side order of new mexican chile (upcharge). I had the shrimp tacos which were sub-standard. The meager shrimp were overpowered by a cabbage slaw which was very bitter and overly citrus flavored. The tortillas were dry and lacking flavor. The sides of beans were not warm enough and somewhat crusted on the plate. The rice was lacking flavor, other than heavily salted. 
We each had a glass of Sangria, which was okay, but overpriced at $6.95 per glass.
The total bill was $45. This was massively overpriced considering the poor quality of the food. 
We are disappointed because we love the Fyfe's space and it is decorated quite nicely with a good amount of space between tables (in the bar). It's hard to imagine many people returning after trying the food.
