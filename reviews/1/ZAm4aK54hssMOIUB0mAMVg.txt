Entered Casa de Sol tonight and no hostess. No one insight for 5 minutes. Final after searching for someone; a woman sits us down. No apology. Waitress  nice enough. Yet our chicken fajita  for two was tasteless, rice overcooked and choked on a hard substance. Manager nor waitress did nothing. Don't visit this restaurant. Too many better choices in Madison. Keep driving past Casa De Sol and onto to a better  experience.
