Let me start by saying that I love Cafe Rio in general.  I have frequented the Eastern, Maryland, Stephanie, St. George and Provo locations.  I am kind of a Cafe Rio veteran.

BUT I HATE the Horizon location. It is a frustration almost very time I go there.  I live right next to this location and have been there about 10 times because it is convenient.  I've just about had enough.  I probably should drive right past this location and go to the Stephanie location.  Or, because that is too far, across the street and eat Thai or Mediterranean. 

I have read the reviews on Yelp, and I agree with them.  The main problems can be summed up as:

1) They have horrible supply management and run out of basic ingredients all the time.

2) They have horrible supply management and run out of basic ingredients all the time. (x2)

3) They have horrible supply management and run out of basic ingredients all the time. (x3)

4) They have horrible supply management and run out of basic ingredients all the time. (x4)

5) They are sloppy on the line and tend to mix ingredients.  Not the end of the world, but a bit unpleasant.

So, out of the 10 times I have been there, they didn't have basic ingredients about 8 of those times.  My first time experiencing this, I had to wait for beans.  Another time I saw them run out of rice, which held up the line.  Twice I have waited for them to finish cooking pork while my family finished their meals.  I ended up with takeout.  I have seen them almost run out of cheese.

 I've seen them run out of tortillas. TORTILLAS!  That is, in part, what kept me in line for 25 minutes tonight.  (There were only about 15 people in the line when I got there.)  Tonight I decided I didn't want pork or chicken.  That leaves shredded beef and steak.  Guess what! After waiting 25 minutes in line and waiting for them to fix their tortilla shortage, I learned that they were out of steak AND beef.  I was told I would have to wait another 8 minutes for them to cook steak.  They didn't bother to give an ETA for the beef.  I ate pork.

So, if they run out of rice, beans, tortillas, meat and almost cheese, what kind of a Mexican restaurant is this location?  Those ingredients are kind of what it means to serve Mexican food...

CAFE RIO CORPORATE!  PLEASE, GET SOMEONE IN YOUR HORIZON STORE WHO KNOWS HOW TO MANAGE THE LINE.  SOMEONE WHO CAN TRAIN YOUR STAFF TO ANTICIPATE WHEN THEY NEED TO START PREPARING THE FOOD SO YOU DON'T RUN OUT.  8 OUT OF 10 TIMES IS BAD!!!! REALLY, REALLY BAD!!!!  IT HASN'T IMPROVED SINCE YOU OPENED THIS LOCATION!

I also think the people there are slow workers.

That being said, I really like Cafe Rio food.  And the people there seem to be friendly and apologetic.  Please, Cafe Rio Corporate, let me love this location!
