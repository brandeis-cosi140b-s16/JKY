Gross how can anyone serve food from a pig pen! I would not feed my dogs from this nasty so called restaurant!  With employees acting like it was high school running all over the manager! This place is a health hazard with the back having food everywhere! Amd mike the guy on the register giving food away to his friends making paying customers feel like he was doing us a favor for taking my order!!
