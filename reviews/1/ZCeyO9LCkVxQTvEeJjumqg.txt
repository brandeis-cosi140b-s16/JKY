I just went through the drive-thru. I ordered a breakfast combo. Very slow service, after I paid , still very slim. I saw the cashier handle my food, I could see her fingers touch inside the little pouch for the potatoes. I did not see her fingers actually touch the food, but the surfaces that would my food would likely touch once the bag shifts. Next she went into the corner, coughed into her hand. This was no just a slight cough, it was a muilti-cough type of cough. She then wiped her hand on her chest, went back to my food and bagged it up. Again picking up my potato bag while touching inside the potato bag.

What happened to washing your hands?

I confronted her about it, and she started to be a bit rude, but I think she realized her mistake and changed her attitude quickly.

I can not afford to lose work and get sick because employees don't want to wash their hands.  

I got my refund and left hungry.
