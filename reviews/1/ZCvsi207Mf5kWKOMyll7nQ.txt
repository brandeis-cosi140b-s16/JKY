i will never go back to this place anymore! specially because of the general manager called moises. he treated 11 local gilrs as a piece of crap, insulted us and act totally as someone who would never deserve to be a manager! he doesnt know what he is doing and the place will lose a lot of customers having those kind of people working there. thats insane!  i would never recommend this place to anyone who lives or is visiting vegas! when you go out to diner at least you expect to be treated by the staff with respect and this guys doesnt know what this word means. if you ever go to this place be aware of this guy. he will tell you in those words "i never want to see these people here in place anymore, pay your bill and get out of here." seriously??? you go out with your friends to have fun and not to deal with stupid and rude people.
