I first came to love cafe rio while going to school in Utah. Apparently the standards drop the farther you get from home base. This place seemed dirty and the line took forever. I'm accustomed to long lines at cafe rios, but they usually move quick. The two times we've gone the line has taken at least 30 mins. The crew seems slow and careless. Very poorly run. I don't care how good food may be, it's not worth the wait and mess. Not planning to go back to this one sadly, just not worth the terrible service.
