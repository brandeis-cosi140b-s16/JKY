My experience with this place started out as a good one, fun atmosphere, not too crowded, plenty of activities even if you are the DD. Now as a Mexican restaurant/bar you would think they would have good tequila and know how to serve it.  I ordered a Patron on the rocks with a salted rim. What I got was warm Patron with 2 tiny ice cubes which melted on delivery and barely enough salt to see that it was even there.  I didn't get too upset at my "drink" and just switched to beer for the rest of the night. At the end of the night when I got my tab I saw that they had charged me for the 2 tiny ice cubes that they put in my warm tequila. To charge me for ice cubes when a glass of water is free is ridiculous. I will never go here again.
