First, my friend bought a Groupon and asked me to give Super Mex a try.  Mexican food isn't my favorite and when I go I tend to split my visits between Coyote's or Lindo Michoacan.
Our waitress was rude and neglectful.  I don't know if it's because my friend and I are white, that we had a Groupon, or if she was having a bad night.
She never brought refills, never checked the table between the time she brought our order and when she put the check down, it took her 10 minutes after running the check to come back and let my friend know the Groupon covered the tab (it was NOT busy last night at 5:30).  
I won't be going back because service that bad doesn't deserve a second chance.
