On top of extremely slow, discourteous  service and 45 minutes to prepare food, the drinks are extremely weak. Had the margarita, had a very slight taste of lime and no taste of tequila at all. (Check out Ztejas margarita, a good model to follow). Three lime slices helped taste, but not much more. The Pinot Noir was my first choice but they ran out of that before 6:30.
