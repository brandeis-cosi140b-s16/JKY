Edit: I tried calling them again, and now it goes straight to voicemail. They've blocked a customer's number! LOL and for a simple question about a mix up in order. Wow. Never order here. Worst service ever.

I've eaten at Tortica's more often than I would like to admit, so, this isn't my first time ordering from them. And usually I never have any complaints on them. Last night, I ordered a Milaneza Torta, they didn't have it, which was totally fine! They called me and I ordered a steak quesadilla instead. around 1 hour later, I finally got my food. Again, I've ordered here many times so I was expecting around an hour for them to deliver. 

When I opened up the container, it was a cheese quesadilla. So they got the wrong order, I'm fine with it, again, 'cause I'm easy going. No problem, I will just call them and get my right order in. Multiple calls over the course of an hour. Nothing. No answer at all. I checked the time and I know they are still open. I thought maybe they were too busy to pick up calls, even though it was only 12:30am. So! I thought, hey I will just call tomorrow about the mix up and maybe get a refund or exchange. 

Next day I called and they finally picked up. A lady answered, as I was explaining my situation, suddenly she went "I can't hear you, sorry, bye, sorry" and then hung up on me. I was like what the fu... maybe bad connection. I am wayy more forgiving than I should be. I tried calling back after that and from then on, no more answers. They either keep ringing to voice mail, or cuts short and goes to voice mail. So I think it's obvious they are avoiding my calls. 

Learning from this I will just pretend I lost $10 to the wind. Will never order from them again.
