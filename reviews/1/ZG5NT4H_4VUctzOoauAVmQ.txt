Ok so I never ever post reviews but I just had to on this one. This restaurant claims to be authentic Mexican... very far from authentic. We went there on Sunday early in the day and I ordered a veggie taco and a sope in which the tortilla was not good at all. I have eaten tons of tacos and real Mexican tacos they are usually heated on a comal or fried in oil for a second and the sope, once I got to the middle the masa was somewhat raw. My son and husband who are Mexican loves Tacos and they were very disappointed with the food. My son ordered 3 tacos de asada and didn't even get through the second one. My husband ordered tacos de lengua and tripe and was sooo disappointed. The only good thing was the salsa that they give you with the little bit of chips. Never again.
