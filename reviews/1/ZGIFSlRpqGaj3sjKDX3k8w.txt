Given the paucity of Tex-Mex in Las Vegas, we decided to try Gardunos which we found on the internet under the heading "Tex-Mex".   Big mistake.  

We arrived about 4:45 on a Sunday evening.  The place was almost empty, but that did not improve the service.  The server was sullen and indifferent and seemed to resent our presence.  She spent most of the time trying to avoid customers lest they ask for something.  The young man whose job it was to bring us drinks and chips was rarely to be found either, and when he was his face wore a mask of utter contempt.  He also spent most of his time making himself invisible to customers.  Apparently they believe that the salsa bar makes their presence unnecessary.  Too bad they didn't have a water bar so we could get our own drinks too.

The server tried to up-sell us everything.  "Want sour cream or guacamole with that?"  When it became clear we weren't interested in add-ons the service got even worse.  

When the food finally arrived it was lukewarm.  The chips which we started with were cold and the sopapillas (which we had to ask for) at the end of the meal were so cold the grease had congealed.  They were inedible for anyone with the standards of a ground hog.  Are there no supervisors at this place?  We are not the only ones on this site to comment on the alienated workers and terrible service.  
  
A decent Tex-Mex restaurant might well be a hit in Las Vegas.  Surely there are enough displaced Texans to create a demand.  But don't bother with Gardunos.  It is truly awful.  

Our first visit will also be our last.
