Very poor. 
     Starting with the host... He would have been just as welcoming if he just pointed at the table that he assigned us to. I can not say that he seated us. He merely assigned us a seat and walked away. 
     Our server greeted us by setting a basket of nacho chip crumbs on the table, stood in front of us and waited for us to tell him what we wanted to drink. After a ten minute wait for our waters the man proceeded to take our food order in the same fashion, by just standing there... Literally, not a single word was spoken. 
     The food got to the table on scalding hot plates that were obviously microwaved. My burritos were floating in water and melted cheese. Absolutely disgusting.
     I can't justify wasting anymore time on a review for this place. This establishment was given a star from me only because it is the minimum.
