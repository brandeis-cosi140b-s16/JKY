This place is gross. I waited in the drive thru for 10 minutes....... i'm guessing that was why my food was burnt. While sitting there I watched the 3 women inside touch their mouths & faces, handle cash, & touch their very long untied hair repeatedly.....then box up my food & hand it to me. Kinda gross. The carne asada fries were covered in sour cream & pico de gallo (a disgusting amount).... perhaps to cover the beef jerky like meat? The chicken quesadillas had BURNT CRUNCHY splinters of chicken(I say that because it resembled tree bark) thank goodness it was only a tiny amount of chicken or my husband may have choked. 
Sad......they used to have good food. Won't be returning.
