Just left there tonight... usually love this place. My friend and i started by sitting at the bar and grabbing two drinks. Then our 2 other friends showed up so we decided to sit at a table. After being served another 4 drinks by our new waitress (over a period of another 2 or so hours) we were wondering why we werent being served. Once getting our special lady's attention she informed us our bartender (our original server) explained to us we needed to go to the bar. My ? was why now after this girl has been serving not only us but our new guest for the passed two hours. He felt entitled to our tips... Well he received nothing especially after the outside bar manager was also extremely rude. Needless to say I paid my tab, paid my waitress who was friendly and worked very hard and went to leave the place.  Walking out the door the outside bar manager waved sarcastically to me I said "Goodbye have a great night!".. I will never go back even though its a mile up the road. Great injustice to the sweet waitresses, maybe they should manage. They had better customer service than the supposed manager :(
