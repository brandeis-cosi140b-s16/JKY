Terrible food. We just moved here from the midwest and surprisingly, Tacos n More is some of the worst Mexican food I've ever had. The chips they gave me were as stale as cardboard. The chicken in the tacos was bland and fatty. Nothing had flavor, other than the cinnamon crisps which were ok. I couldn't believe the combo meal was $8.99 for that kind of quality. Will never go back. Positives: The front cashier was very nice and it seemed clean.
