I love Mexican food and was excited when my group chose this place. After being seated with no menus for at least ten minutes, we got up and asked if someone was going to help us. We were finally helped, but service was still slow, the food was not good, and to top it off they added gratuity to our tab. I will never return!  1900 or Azteca are so much better and cheaper.
