ABSOLUTELY THE WORST SERVICE IN MY LIFE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I gave this place 1 star because the food is truly amazing. Too bad the manager has absolutely no clue what he is doing. Probably gets tipped on the side by "regular" patrons and believes that's where his priorities should be at. First of all I made reservations for my mother's 60th birthday because the food here the first time was great. But did I mention the first time I was here our server made a mistake on every single food item we ordered?? At least he had the decency to get our desserts to make it up. An hour or two before the reservations we had called to see if we could add two more people. They told us fine and moved us up to 9pm for the private dining area. Well we showed up exactly at 9 and our room was not ready. Ok no big deal. A little annoying cuz what's the point of making reservations but we were ok. But after 20-30 min of waiting, I started to get pissed. I told the manager and he actually had the nerve to blame it on me!!!! That I called and added two people last minute!! Isn't it his job to make sure that this doesn't happen?!!! If he couldn't accommodate 8 people then say so and we could have went somewhere else. Also the whole time, he was even apologetic and instead of offering maybe a round of drinks for the wait or anything, he just stood around doing nothing!!! So we left and went to Capital Grille instead. We were very happy to celebrate and spend tons of money where we didn't have to wait and the manager and staff knew what they were doing!!! I will never go here again and if u want to go just expect to wait at least am hour even w reservations!!!!!
