Hands down the WORST service I've ever had today!! A few friends went in after a baby shower to have lunch and not only did the waitress get over half of the orders wrong, she blamed US for ordering wrong! I'm sorry, but I dine out quite frequently and I know how to order. 

So after the waitress had argued with us for the third time, we walked out.  WITHOUT having eaten any food. Now get this, 15 min later the police showed up at my door, with my young son and niece watching, and accused us of stealing alcoholic beverages!!! 

Our waitress should know that my husband nor I ordered ANYTHING alcoholic! They threatened to arrest my husband because he didn't know the names of the friends of friends who were there that didn't pay for said alcohol. This is absurd! And embarrassing when my neighbors are inquiring as to why the police are at my home! 

Save yourself some grief and skip this place!!!! Valle Luna is just down the street & their food is amazing!!
