I had eaten at this Garcia's a numerous amount of times with family, friends, co workers etc... I wont be going back to this location after my last experience. I visited this location a few weeks ago with some friends and my intermediate family which consists of myself, my fiance, and my 3 month old daughter. We went around 130 pm so the lunch rush was gone. After being told we couldnt be sat in a table, we were seated in a half table half booth. There were 6 of us and the booth had a curve to it. Between my daughter in her stroller and our guests son's booster seat, we were very uncomfortable needless to say. I personally asked our waitress for a chair to sit on the opposite side of everyone so that we were not so crammed, she got me a chair and I finished my lunch. About 20 minutes before I was getting ready to leave, a different waiter tapped me on the shoulder and said "um you are definitely in the way". I was beyond mortified that an employee would EVER treat a customer like that. My group alone spent $100.00 there for lunch. That is the worst customer service I have ever received. I wont just not be returning, I now wont be recommending.
