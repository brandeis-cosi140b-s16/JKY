Food was not good and expensive for the little amount we got. The worse part was the service! Our waitress didn't come to our table for over 15 minutes after we arrived. Luckily the food came out fast! Only to wait over 30 minutes for her to come back to us so we could ask for the check! Ridiculously bad service and they weren't even busy! We will not be going back... I don't recommend you wasting your time. Oh and we are still hungry.
