Just an average restaurant with RUDE managers.  I used a groupon here before.  No problems.  Went back a couple of months later and they would not let me use another groupon stating I didn't order enough food.  Are you freaking kidding me...my table was covered in dirty plates.  To make the long story short....you don't offer groupons and then taken it upon yourself to change the rules of the groupon...Idiots!!  I would eat here once a week, they knew me by name, but because I had a groupon everything changed.  So trust me....don't eat at this dump!!
