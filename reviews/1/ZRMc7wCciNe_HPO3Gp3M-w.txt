I had one of my worst restaurant experiences here in quite a while, waiting an hour to be served cold food and having only greasy chips to eat in the meantime. The details...

I arrived with a small group at the beginning of the lunch hour, and our party were some of the first seated. We ordered quickly (with the drinks). We were then served cold greasy chips (one basket for 5 people). Our drinks came about 15 minutes later (water and soda), and then the wait for the food began. We watched every table around us be seated and served before our food came out. Then, about 45 minutes into our time there, *one* person's food came out. Attempts to flag down someone and get info at this point were unsuccessful. Eventually someone from our group got up to find someone.

Finally, about 1:00 to 1:15 into our time there, 3 more meals arrived. Every plate was full of cold food. It was clear the plates had been sitting somewhere else for quite a while. This left one person still without food. More inquiries finally led to someone seeming to care and they said they'd get that food asap. When they served the final plate, which at least was hot, they said they'd comp that meal. This left the rest of us paying for our cold late food.

I don't know what's going on there but clearly they don't know how to run a restaurant or how to prioritize action. Our meals were not complicated (tacos and burritos). Perhaps if the food had been fresh and not cold it would have been good; no way to know. I won't return.
