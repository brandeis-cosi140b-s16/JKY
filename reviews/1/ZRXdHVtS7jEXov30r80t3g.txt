The worst food ever!
 It was embarrassing how bad the food was. It was nothing more than microwaved, canned, pre packaged junk. I had their sample plate small size, not sure what it was called.It took them 3 minutes after taking our order to food on the table. Should have been a red flag. It was microwaved so hot it was ridiculous.Rubbery shell, dry burnt meat in the taco, oh my It was not edible at all. On a Monday night at 7 pm,  also dirty tables all around I will never eat here again! The salsa was bottled junk again. Chips were ok that's about it.  Dont waste your time or money on this place.
