Bleh! I can't believe this place has so many good reviews. The quality of the food is very poor (I think their appetizers come from the freezer section of the grocery store), anne the preparation is even worse- meat and beans have hardly any flavor, and the fried items are cold, limp, and greasy. You'd think that would be enough, but no- the menus, table, and silverware were dirty! I would've walked out, but it was someone's birthday. Service was mediocre. The only things positive were some of the decor and rooms to facilitate large parties.
