Watched our server just stand around while our drinks remained empty, without silverware to eat our food that (finally arrived), and our chips had been needing refill for a while. When our food did finally show up, we watched them try to give it to two other tables before us. 

My chopped salad wasn't so chopped. The steak pieces were all with large chunks of fat and gristle. I had to take the steak off the salad and cut the bad parts off. 
The salad was overly soaked with dressing, weighing the Romain down.  The citrus was a nice touch though. 

We sat at 2pm. We finally got our bill, and paid at 335. Prices were slightly above average. Horrible service times and lack of attention. He was friendly but that about it.
