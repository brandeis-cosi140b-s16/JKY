So I've been a big fan of Wahoo's from the beginning... But they've recently have gone downhill in service. They completely messed up my order and overcharged me.  After asking numerous times for them to switch the channel to the game (in which they agreed to multiple times that they would), they simply kept putting it off, despite us being the only customers in the room on a Saturday afternoon. The channel never got changed despite being there over an hour. This place has fallen big time from when it first opened. I was so excited for it to move closer to me, but now I don't know if we're going to ever go back.
