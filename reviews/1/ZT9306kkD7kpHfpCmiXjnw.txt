Mediocre mexican. Priced awesome if you get the special and it's only about $5 for lunch and you have very low expectations. My fourth time trying this place,  I ordered a burrito for delivery. Nearly 2hrs later, it still had not arrived. Called to cancel my order and the manager answered. As soon as i requested to cancel my order, he said "okay, I'll call the driver." and immediately hung up. I've been disappointed each time I've tried this place and this was my last time.  Absolutely would not recommend. Pancheros or Chipotle are a MUCH better option over Cactus Grill. McDonald's would be a better option. Barf.
