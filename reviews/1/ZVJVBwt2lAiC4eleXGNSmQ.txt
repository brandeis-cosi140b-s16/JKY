This was quick and convenient.  And..... it was quick and convenient.

I ordered their fish taco plate and ended up biting into what tasted like a salt taco!  Yuck!  I thought it was just one spot on the fish, but my second taco was just as salty.

My friend had a chicken quesadilla that was equally unpleasant.

Unfortunately, the "serve yourself" chips and salsa could not make up for our disappointing entrees.  :(
