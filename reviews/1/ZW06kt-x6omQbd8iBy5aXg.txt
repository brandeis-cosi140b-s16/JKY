Wanted to try this place out so I went there the other day. Horrible customer service! I heard the food was good from someone who's been to the scottsdale location but it is WAY to overpriced crazy drive thru girl who hates her life had a major attitude when I decide to add something to my order and I made sure no one was behind me in the drive through or inside when I did it. The mgr or owner guy looked irrttated too You would think they would appreciate more money flow since that place is individually owned and opperated, seams like it never has customers. It looks like they have kids working there too, umm I don't know much about child labor laws but you really don't have to to see there's something wrong with that picture. DO NOT go here the customer service is so bad it's not worth your hard earned money to contribute to this place.
