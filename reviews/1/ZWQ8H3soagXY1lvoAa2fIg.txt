The food was just OK, nothing special.. The decor was pretty nice. Service was really slow and we were over charged for a few items. The service got worse as the night went on. Many families arrived after us and left before us. It took over 2 hours to get our food and leave. The restaurant wasn't even busy, not sure what the hold up was.
