Wow, not a lot of one stars in my review history so here we go......Salsarita's was the first "Mexican" place I tried when I moved to Charlotte....from Phoenix. Needless to say, I had high expectations, even if it was a step above Taco Bell. My first experience was absolutely horrible--I ordered a burrito which was cold, wet and dripping some kind of funky juice. Gross.

I went there a number of times after my initial bad experience and all I can think is no. I went there solely because for awhile were no other Mexican food options Uptown close to me and they offer a number of coupons in the Citpass book. But I've always been disappointed there, even up to last wk when I went there for the last time ever. Maybe it's the fact that the food had no flavor (seriously how does spicy salsa have no flavor?) or the fact that any time I used my check card there and didn't give them a tip (you know since they prepared my food), they would add a $1 or $2 in the tip line.....every....single....time. No bueno, sorry Salsarita's, you are officially Salsash***ty's in my book.
