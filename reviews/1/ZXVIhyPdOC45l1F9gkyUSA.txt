The food was alright nothing to brag about. I ordered the supreme nachos and I have ordered the chimichanga now that is crap but the nachos are good.
The service is horrible the girl that worked the drive thru had me repeat my order three times it could of been the speaker that wasn't working. I had her repeat the order when I pulled up to the window. I pay get the food and of course the order is wrong, on top of that the food was cold SMH not the best service I will be finding a new Mexican joint to eat at
