I have liked how the outside looked ever since I came to UIUC, and I was enticed by their advertisement. Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed with the food. (No comment on the drinks, I didn't have one.) Everything was cold or looked like it had been under a warmer even though we were some of the only customers. The chips were hard and greasy, as if fried more than twice. The guacamole was mediocre at best. The water even tastes awful, no amount of lime could cover it up. The rice looked and tasted old and the way the food was displayed was unappetizing. The service was fine, but she really shouldn't recommend something that tastes gross. Maybe this would be good "drunk food" but I won't be returning to find out.
