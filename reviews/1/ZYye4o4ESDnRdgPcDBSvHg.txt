Normally I have been a fan of Burrito Express and order from them 5-6 times a year. My neighbor had food delivered to him yesterday and I was trying to relax in my home next door but found it impossible as there was a car with the bass so loud everything was vibrating. So I go out side and ask the guy nicely if he could turn the volume down when coming into the neighborhood. He is like, "oh, I can't do that as they are 1200 somethings he said...., ya da ya da ya! I'm thinking REALLY!!!! So I told him that was rude/disturbing coming into neighborhoods with it that loud. He could have cared less! So today I call to talk to the manager as there wasn't one there when I called yesterday afternoon. She picks up the phone and I told her what happened. She is like - ok, I will talk to him. No sorry for the disturbance, no asking who it was (because she knew). She sounded like she could care less also. I told her he should have turned it off when he got in the car to leave. She didn't care. Then I asked her what her name was - because I didn't want someone pretending to be a manager who wasn't. She refused to give it to me. She said this is a family business and I told her I know as I order from you, but how do I know you are the manager if you won't give me your name. She didn't care, didn't apologize, just had a snotty attitude. Then a couple minutes after hanging up my phone rings and it is them again - thinking oh she is gonna apologize for her unprofessionalism. Nope! I answer and same girls voice "Oops, got the wrong number" - are you kidding me, grow up. So I am done doing business with them and my neighbor who ordered wasn't happy about the situation either. Two rude employees who obviously don't care that much about customer service for their family business.
