From what i remember Roberto's being this place was not doing what it needs to be.  First off the service and everything else was good.  No complaints there. The sauce bar was a mess, cups everywhere and ladles in the sauce no thongs for the carrots or cucumbers.  Just a bad start right off the bat.  The food came out quick and was hot.  Another plus for fast food.  Then when i was really about to enjoy that first bite of my Carne asada burrito it hit me.  WAY TO SALTY. This was the same for my whole group.  The carnitas, carne asada fries, and the quesadilla.   I couldn't even finish. Sadly to say i was really looking forward to this location since it was right near the house and i will drive to Don Tortaco from now on.
