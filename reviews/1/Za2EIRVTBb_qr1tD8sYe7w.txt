After reading the fairly positive reviews we decided to give Cafe Zamora a try. What a mistake that was as it was some of the worst mexican food we've eaten. I ordered the Chicken Fajitas and the chicken was so dry and looked like a dry sponge. I complained to my wife and she thought I was being picky and tried a piece and had to spit it out.

It appeared as if the chicken was precooked and sat in a tub in a cooler  for a month. When they served it they drowned it in a liquid (the liquid covered my entire plate even over the beans and rice) and heated it in a microwave. The chicken was flavorless and the consistency of a dry sponge. I could not tell if the beans and rice were any good due to them being covered in the liquid from the fajitas. When they sat the plate in front of me it looked more like a bowl of soup than a meal of fajitas, beans and rice.

The only good thing was the salsa which had a great flavor and was served cold.

We'll never go back.
