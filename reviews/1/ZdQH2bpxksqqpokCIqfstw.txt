Never get your food to go at this location. If you do, buyer beware. Foreign objects, like metal, have been deemed acceptable ingredients here. I got a taco plate to go here and found a strip of metal by biting  into it. When it was brought to the attention of Baja Fresh, their response was "since you got the food to go, too bad". Way to treat your guest and care about the quality of your product. Never eating here again.
