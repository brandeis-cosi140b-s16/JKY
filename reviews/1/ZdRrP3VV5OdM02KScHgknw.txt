Why are there almost 5 stars for this place? I went here last night because of the high rating. I got there about 40 minutes before they closed. The service was fast... But the food was greasy. Greasy quesadilla, Greasy tacos, Greasy loaded potato. Ma'an I'm not coming back, & fear the backlash!!! IYKWIM
