My wife and I stopped by on the way home for lunch today.  I ordered the carne asada burrito, which I've had before and thought was great.  My wife ordered the beef torta.  We got home and ate.  The burrito tasted great.  My wife ate half her torta and though it was decent. She saved the other half to eat later.  While eating the other half of her torta, she felt something strange after the bite she took.  She took out the food and opened up the torta to find the sticker on the tomato slices still stuck on there, (I'll upload the picture).  I don't think we will be by again.  It's unfortunate, because I thought their burritos were pretty good.
