Looked so promising... one positive the free chips and dip were pretty tasty.

We walked in and had a male server say he'd be taking care of us. We placed our orders and I asked for a classic lime margarita. Apparently the only type of margaritas this place makes are from mixes and no one had the heart to tell me... So after waiting 15 minutes with no drink in site, I just canceled it and ordered a water.

We got our meal and the one positive is it was pretty easy to eat fast because all I could think about was getting the check and black listing this place. We asked a passer by to get our check and she inquired as to who our server was we said the gentleman's name so we thought she went off to find him. Low and behold she comes back and informs us that our server is actually a lady.

Horrible service, beautiful venue, and apparently no limes to make a margarita with...

Beware.
