This is the worst experience I've had in quite a long time! I visited their restaurant in Cancun last year and we were treated like royalty..., here, we were treated as if they were doing us a favor.
They were not busy yet it took the hostess 5 minutes to seat us. The table was wobbly and the seats were worn out. No drink orders nor were we given napkins and silverware!
After 15 mins, a waiter stops and asks us if we'd like a drink. We ordered but 5 mins later, another server came and asked us if we were ready to order. About 10 mins. later our drinks arrive - we did not finish them!
Chips and salsa are decent. The food arrived: carne asada burrito and chicken quesadilla with bean/rice. The chicken was overly spicy and dry. The tortilla was soggy and the cheese wasn't completely melted. The burrito was OK but nothing spectacular.
Neither of us finished our dinner which cost: $78!! I did not leave a tip which was difficult for me because I have family in the restaurant business.

I would give less than a star if I could.
