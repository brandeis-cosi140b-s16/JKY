wow.  the service at this place sucks!  Maybe if they tried hiring staff with a little experience, rather than who looks hottest in the skimpy uniforms it would be better?  We would sit for 10-15 minutes with empty glasses and not one waitress in sight.......  no napkins or utensils were ever given to us...... they spilled drinks as they set them down and left without wiping it or giving us a towel..  AWFUL!!    AND not to be gross, but there are cockroaches in the walls!!  There is a small, dark booth on the way to the bathroom that we were seated at, and there were German roaches crawling out from behind where the booth meets the wall!!!  TOTALLY spazzed us out..  they did not offer us any sort of discount or anything...  GROSS!! I guess it makes it more authentic??  The only saving grace of this joint is the drinks are super potent!!!
