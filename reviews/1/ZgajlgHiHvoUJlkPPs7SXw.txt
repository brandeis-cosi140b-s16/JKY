We have always enjoyed the Phoenix location but the Avondale location is terrible. I went there today and got fajitas, Chile con queso, and a soda to go. They brought my soda and it literally tasted like it had insect spray in it....so did the guacamole. Maybe it was the foam cups, I'm not sure, but I have been sick to my stomach ever since, headache, and feeling horrible. I do not recommend eating here. Something is wrong with the food.
