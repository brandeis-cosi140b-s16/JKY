The reason I'm giving them a 1 is because  I can't give them a zero. The food is good but the service is the absolute worst of any business I've ever gone to. They habitually mess up your order and then when you go back to get it made right, they tell you that this is the last time they do this. Well do it right the first time. I asked for a refund then. The lady told me non she's like "We replaced your order.." By that time, I was sick to my stomach. I've been going there for the four years I've been out here and they've f#%ked me with several times.  I've kept going back thinking they would change but they never do. The manager didn't even have the balls to come out and speak to me face to face.  Forget calling their "corporate" office as they don't care either. It's a shame because they make a decent taco salad.
