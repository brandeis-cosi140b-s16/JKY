I give one star for a recommendation we were given by one of their employees to try the chicken and the gal at the cash register for knocking off a few bucks for the hasstle we had.  So excited this opened in a spot in the Vons plaza that has sat vacant since Starbucks came and went.  We almost walked out seeing the line but since the food is so good we decided to stay and wait and wait and wait for 20 minutes.  My husband is a steak kind of guy and after waiting we were told sorry we are out of steak.  I said for him to check with his manager and was told it would be another 20 minutes before it was ready.  What was interesting everyone was at their posts but the grill often times was left unattended. You should never run out of steak - come on.  So, here we are stuck if we didn't wait long we would have walked out.  We complained and then suggested they let everyone know in line.  It looked like to me there were not enough workers and no management on site.  I think undercover boss needs to come in and check this place out.  I will say we liked what we got all fresh food but after waiting and being hungry you are really eating so fast not enjoying the food.  Please get more help here.
