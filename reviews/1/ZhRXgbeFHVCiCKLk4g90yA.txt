The place was very busy when our group arrived but they were able to seat us quickly. The service was quick at first but very quickly the waitress became very scarce. I ordered a margarita on the rocks with salt, I thought what I got was made with orange juice and very very bitter. The waitress didn't seem to understand that a margarita is made with lime juice even if they have other offerings they're calling margaritas without a descriptor like orange or strawberry. The carne asada tacos I ordered were very good when the waitress brought the correct order, I ordered with flour instead of corn tortillas. The sides black beans and Spanish rice were in edible. The rice overlooked to the point of being redried and the beans had no flavor whatsoever. To top it off it started raining outside while we were inside the restaurant, we still got wet from the leaks on their roof. I definitely do not recommend.
