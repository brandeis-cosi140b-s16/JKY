Blech.  So bland, no Mexican influence other than the names of dishes.  Tortillas ordered as a side dish to the mains were brought out with apps (guac and out of season, dry, bland corn- their awful take on Mexican street corn)  and the server was flabbergasted when we requested that the be brought with mains instead... so that we could actually use them for eating our food rather than eat them plain.  He declined, saying they were already on the grill and he'd bring more if we ran out, which of course we didn't because who eats cold, stale, dry tortillas with nothing in them?  Carne asada tasted of meaty tequilla- no salt, no spice.  Just terrible.  Nothing could make us return here.
