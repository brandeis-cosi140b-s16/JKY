Worst Mexican food I ever had. The burrito is wet, and tasteless. The torta is tasteless also. Even the Pepsi taste weird. And the price is way too expensive for food served on disposable plates. Even Green Burrito inside of Carl's Jr. taste way better.

If you see a line at this place, they are waiting for the Starbuck next door. Don't be confused by it.
