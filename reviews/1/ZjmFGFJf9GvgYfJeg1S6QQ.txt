I should have know the moment I saw the logo but I have a fondness for bats.  I definitely should have known when I walked in the front door and saw the fake water feature straight out of a lame local amusement park.

My girlfriend is a vegertarian and it's a one-star kind of place for being so unfriendly toward veggies but the menu was uninspired and the decor was mind blowing in a bad way.  We ordered two beers, judged a bit (the folks seemed very nice and the food might be ok), and left as it's not was the reviews led me to believe.

It's a chain waiting to happen in a town with plenty of good local and authentic food options; we were absolutely thrilled with our 2nd choice of Los Sombreros - 5-stars!
