Frequent this Taco Bell fairly often and experienced terrible service yesterday.  Sonny, the shift manager, informed us upon ordering that there would be a wait for the food, as there was a backup.  We agreed and placed our order.  While watching everyone else get their food, we approached the counter 20 minutes later, only to find our food had been sitting there, but no one had bothered to call our number.  The food was completely cold, and Sonny had a complete attitude when we complained that he had not notified us that the food was ready.  He claimed that there was no way the food could be cold and was a total jerk, which prompted us to ask for a refund.  Won't go here again, as there are plenty of other TBs in the area with better service.
