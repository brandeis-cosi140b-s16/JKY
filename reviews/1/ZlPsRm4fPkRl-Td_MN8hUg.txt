If I could give my experience 0 stars I would. 

The service was just awful! 

It started with 20 minutes for a drink order. Our server brought the wrong margarita. We ordered mango and they brought strawberry. The owner came over and told us off saying we ordered the wrong margarita and it was our error. She stood there scolding us saying we ordered strawberry when clearly we did not. They re-make the margarita and bring it and it's still the wrong one - a regular instead of mango (but at that point who cared). Our server forgot to order someones food and when we asked he said we never ordered it (even though we did and he repeated it back to us). The server then brought the wrong food for another person. 

When we spoke to the owner afterwards (again), she was just as rude (if not worse) and then said FINE I'll give you a 10% off coupon. We told her, we don't want a coupon we're just giving you feedback. We're not complaining for a coupon or discount. She raised her voice, started walking away, rolling her eyes and said it was all our fault. Granted, we're not a group of rocket scientists but being college educated adults I think we know how to order a meal. She was a real witch.

Never ever again. Great food or not, the worst service ever.
