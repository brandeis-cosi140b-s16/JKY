Overpriced..   takes forever..  gave order to wrong people and it was wrong anyway..  Waitress rolled her eyes and got upset because gf didn't know Spanish... how's this 4.5 stars? Also order there clearly labeled  "tacos" on the menu and get ONE taco.  There second attempt at our order was further off than the first they tried to force on the wrong people who we talked too and they didn't know why they were giving it to them...

IGNORE above...
Woops...    lol I think I reviewed the wrong place... my review was meant for the taqueria on freemont street soooo...in a rush.   I'll change this to 5 star for now

Rerereview...   Just coincidentally passed by this vendor on the way back home same night and noticed they had the same shirts/same company so 1 star review goes back although it's because of the one on Fremont..
