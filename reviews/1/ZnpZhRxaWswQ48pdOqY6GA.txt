If I could give a negative rating, I would. Long story short, bill was more than advertised menu price, brought to managers attention (white lady with blonde hair, think Tanya Harding mid-90s look and you will recognize her) she basically said too bad so sad, I said that's not acceptable for a quesadilla to be on the menu for $16.00 and you try to bill $20.00

She had no recourse or excuse, provided the bill without a pen. I asked for a pen and a waiter standing around (think Marc Anthony reject) threw a pen at me to sign. I immediately let Aria Conceirege know about the level of service being provided at Javier's and they immediately rectified the situation while letting the food and beverage manager know as well. Food was bland and average, nowhere near caliber of original Javier's in so cal.
