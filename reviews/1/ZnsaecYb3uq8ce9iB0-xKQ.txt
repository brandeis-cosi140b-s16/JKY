After a hectic morning which resulted in me missing breakfast I ended up in the Sky Harbor Airport around 1:00PM with a short one hour layover. The Barrio Cafe appeared to be the only restaurant that I could eat at and still see my gate. Needless to say, I was starving and everything sounded good. I had ordered the Arizona Burrito. It was... Well... Bland and distasteful... The meat had large chucks of hard inedible fat in it and lacked flavor. Even for airport food the Barrio Cafe is terrible. Service was mediocre the waitress was indifferent and preoccupied talking to her co-workers. I will never go here again. Even if this was the only place to eat I would rather go hungry until I land at my destination then eat at the Barrio....
