For our first meal in Vegas we thought we'd try Diablo's as it was one of the places in our hotel, the Monte Carlo Resort. There were 4 of us, 2 couples. Upon finding the first "hostess" she pointed us outside to the "other hostess." Between the two of them they passed us back and forth before the "outside" girl finally put us next in line for a table, approx. 10-15 minutes. We noticed a table for 4 empty, so we figured we'd be seated soon. Next thing we know, a group of 6 and then after that a couple came into the restaurant and were seated right away, while we were still holding onto the pager waiting our turn. It was at that point that we left, it was clear that they were discriminating against us, either because they could tell we were lesbians or we were not "girly" enough or didn't have men on our arms. Get over it, it's 2012. After reading the reviews we are thankful we didn't eat there. We had much better fare over at the Sporting House Bar & Grill.
