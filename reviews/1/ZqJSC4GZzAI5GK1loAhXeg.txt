My fiance and I just left there. We are drunk and happy, so most food, at this point, would be pleasing to the palate. 

However, as we sat there debating the 17 pounds of inedible food left on our plates, here was our conversation:

"We just paid $17 for this shit?"

"Yep."

"Should we take it home to the dogs?"

"I don't really feel comfortable giving it to them, do you?"

"Nope."

And so then, we threw that crap in the trash can.

That about sums it up. Next time, I will indulge in Jack in the Box tacos: 2 for $0.99.
