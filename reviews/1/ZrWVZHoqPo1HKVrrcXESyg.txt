I went there with a coupon for BOGO buffets. My stomach wishes I hadn't. Some of it was better than other. The service was great. The cheese Enchiladas were disgusting. The Sopapillas were good, the icecream??? was funny tasting. With the coupon it was still about $17 for two with two softdrinks and a tip, so I say skip it and go somewhere else. Your stomach will thank you.
