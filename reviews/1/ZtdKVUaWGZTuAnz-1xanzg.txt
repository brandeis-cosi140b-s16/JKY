They should write a book about how to ruin a soft taco.  I didn't think it was possible.  The corn tortilla was raw, not sauteed or warmed up at all, and thus tasted like cardboard.  The whole thing was cold.  The only good thing was the rice, which was very tasty.  

A woman at the table next to us warned us that her chicken taco was horrible.  So why didn't we listen?  We figured it was just the chicken, but we should have asked more.
