First of all, they charged us to split an entree.  In fact, we had to do the splitting - I guess they charge to have access to an extra plate.  The mushrooms in our enchilada were canned, and then burned.  The ranchero sauce tasted like the red sauce that comes with Spaghetti-O's.   The chips and salsa was less spectacular than the stuff I buy on sale at the grocery store.  The part I depend on most to get me through crappy Mexican food - margaritas - also disappointed.  They tasted like Kool-Aid (but without adequate water) and lacked tequila.  This was all at the west side location, and I hear the east side is even worse.  No vuelvo.
