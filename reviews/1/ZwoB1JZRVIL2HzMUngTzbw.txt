This Close To The Border I Expected Good Mexican Food

The restaurant was full and everyone looked happy.  We were told 15 minutes for a table and were thrilled when it was just under that.  Forty-five minutes later - yes FORTY-FIVE - we received our bean tostada (which had to be sent back) and beef fajita - neither of which had any flavor.  

Don't bother.

On our way out we saw a tent across the street for "Fry Bread" and went to investigate Big Bertha.  SO sorry we didn't have this instead!
