This food was trash. My brother and I ordered sopes and they tried to sneakily hide that they burned both of them by flipping them over. The meat was also under-cooked and slimy..Avoid this place, it was completely disgusting. The only thing on my plate that was edible was the onion. -.- I cook Mexican food every day and was looking for a good restaurant with my family. None of us enjoyed the food and we left so unsatisfied.
