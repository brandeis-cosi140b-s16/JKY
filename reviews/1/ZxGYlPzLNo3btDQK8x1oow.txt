Tried this place for the first time today as my usual sushi joint next store was closed down(BUMMER). I was not impressed the sushi was not up to par and the fish didn't seem fresh, I also ordered the chicken teriyaki and was brought beef instead no big deal. It tasted as if it was warmed in the microwave and the rice was hard. I was eager to try this place due some positive reviews, we must have went on an off day. Needless to say we will not be returning, I advise you save your money and try something new from the westgate community!!!
