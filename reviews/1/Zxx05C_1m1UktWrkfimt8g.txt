So very disappointed... My family came here once a week, now we will never be back.  Our non-profit organization booked our meetings here for the entire year.  We were told tonight, (on a meeting night with a guest speaker coming), that we were "no longer welcome" because we had not been spending enough money there.  In the meantime, the place was empty.  I thought Hacienda's was our community partner - I was obviously very wrong.  If you care about our community, you will not eat at Hacienda's again.....
