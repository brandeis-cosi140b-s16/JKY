If you are looking for edible food, do not go here.  My husband and I ordered the chicken nachos.  The plate was piled high with goop.  There was some nasty liquid cheese on the very bottom of the plate which just made all the chips above it really soggy.  Service was fair at best.  I think the waitress knew better than to come back and ask us how the food tasted.  We felt like this place was a complete waste of time and money.  Diablo's hasn't figured out the importance of repeat customers, which is a real waste for such a prime location on the strip!
