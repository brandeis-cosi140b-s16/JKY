"I give it four thumbs down."

This place is an enigma to me.  For some reason, people rave about this joint.

I've been here twice and felt like I was being shafted when I ended up paying money for the garbage they served me.

At first glance the place looks promising, sporting your basic mexican menu with all the classic combinations.  However, upon ordering an enchilada, flauta, or taco, this joint nose dives.  Bland is the best way to describe this place.  The salsa is laughable, and the "hot" salsa isn't even one alarm.  They don't offer a real bar or much beer, so try their "margarita" thing for a huge disappointment.  

I can't understand why this place hasn't gone belly up, but I guess that's why I can't understand folks promoting the joint either.  

Fili B's is better than this, no lies!

Anyone giving this place 5 stars should be grounded from yelp for a month because there is no way that this place deserves it.
