Today, I walked into this chipotle. I have been here several times with the same outcome. On this occasion, no one was in line. I walked up to order my food. To my surprise, three out of 4 meats were not available. The black beans were depleted and not replaced. On top of it, there was absolutely no sense of urgency. This was a poor excuse for a business establishment. The store manager or supervisor on duty was obviously inadequately prepared to handle the customer or supplies. Poor service. This was at 7:00 mind you. Right during the dinner rush they should be prepared for. On top of that, they asked me to pay for food they had not yet produced to me.
