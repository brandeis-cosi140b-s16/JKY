This location is by far the worst. They've botched our order every single time we've ordered from here. After the first time, you'd think we'd go somewhere else. We were actually trying to give them a chance. Stale chips Everytime. We're vegan, so we ordered the veggie burrito. Got home, cut it open to find chunks of meat throughout. Now to animal eaters, this would be ok....to me it's absolutely disgusting.
