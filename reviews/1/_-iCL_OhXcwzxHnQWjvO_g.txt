Advertised $20 cover for the Mayweather fight on Saturday.  We got there before the fight and security said it would be $40.  We asked why since it was advertised for $20 and the bouncer said "because we can." We paid and went in.  The place was pretty busy because of the fight and they had 2 people working at the bar so the service was slow.  They didn't even have the sound on for the fight so it made for a strange atmosphere. 

Overall, it is just a dirty bar & restaurant that worked in college at the location by ASU.  There are certainly better places to go.
