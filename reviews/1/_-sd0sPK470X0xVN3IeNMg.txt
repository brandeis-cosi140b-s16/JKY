I'm from Los Angeles, California so I guess my expectations for Mexican food are a little high. My friend from Pittsburgh loves this restaurant... I went there two nights ago with my friend and ordered a seafood quesadilla, it was gross. I should have taken a picture of it. I opened the quesadilla and there was this big blog of sweet white cheese and imitation crab inside. My friend ordered fish tacos and she was not impressed. At all. The only thing we could agree on was the pico de gallo, that was decent. The best thing about this restaurant was that they had Jarritos. Gosh, I was so disappointed. Yesterday I went to Emiliano's (in South Side) and that definitely was a HUGE upgrade from Gran Agave.
