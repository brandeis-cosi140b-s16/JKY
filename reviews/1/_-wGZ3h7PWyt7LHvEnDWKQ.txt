Oh my gosh. Soooooo bad. It's been a long time since I've not been able to think of a single food-related reason to return to a restaurant, but that time is now. Even $4 margaritas can't save the food here.

I tried the 3 salsa app, which at $7, was a little steep for some chips & dip. The green salsa tasted like lime juice and chilies, the red salsa tasted like tomato paste and chilies, and the... bbq sauce (?) tasted like someone had tried to fancy up some cheap, sugary bbq sauce with some OJ and you guessed it, more chilies. It was syrupy and definitely the grossest thing on the platter. 

Imagine my disappointment when my "shredded brisket and cheese enchilada" came chalk-full of the same nasty bbq sauce, minus the OJ. And for $9, I got two little 5"x1.5" sticks with no sides. 

I tried my friend's guac ($7) - straight from a food service company freezer bag. I tried my friend's queso (also $7) - straight from another food servicecompany bag with a little chorizo mixed in. Fortunately, the plastic cheese was the first halfway edible thing I'd had and I ate it because I was starving.  

Even with the terrible food, the weirdest thing was the decor. I couldn't figure out how snakeskin booths, angel wings, Day of the Dead, motorcycles, birdcages, and iron crosses went together. That is, until my friend pointed out that it looked like an Ed Hardy store threw up in there... it's decor style is "dudebro." 

In closing, my Yelp tip says it all, "Come for the drinks, get wasted or leave before you get hungry."
