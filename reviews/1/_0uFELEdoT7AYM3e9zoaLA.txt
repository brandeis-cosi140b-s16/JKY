I would give no stars if possible. I was left waiting in the drive-through for over 15 minutes because all of the male workers in the restaurant we're too busy flirting with a couple of teenage girls who came in The dining area, And I know this because the bonehead at the drive-through window actually told me that. I was also missing a couple of items from my order because they chose not to pay attention to what they were doing. I will not be returning to this location.
