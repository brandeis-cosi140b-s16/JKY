It gets 1 star only cuz it's 24hr n 1 of the few things in the area that is. I don't understand everyone's rave reviews of any of them, the food is no where close to good. It's greasy, sometimes slimey, n not close to real Mexican. The only thing Ive found to be edible is the nachos. It also doesn't help that on the few occasions we have ordered from here they messed things up or even not given us food (like the meat when my husband ordered the carne asada tacos). I'd rather go to the taco bell down the street when I want quick Mexican
