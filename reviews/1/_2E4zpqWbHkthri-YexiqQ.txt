The line was absolutely insane. And not that it was abnormally busy for dinner time on Friday night, the workers just didn't have their crap together. They had two people adding ice to the soda machine the entire time I was there (more than 20 minutes, seriously?!)   That took whoever was supposed to be running the register away. Somehow they thought that my son's taco should be shell and meat only. They were out of chips. Everything was cold (rice, beans, meat). And it seemed like a huge inconvenience to ask them anything (my kids had never been there, so we had questions about the kids meals). We planned to eat there, but I ended up wanting to bring it home so I could have warm food, reheated in the microwave. Do you think they offered a bag for me to carry 3 meals outside? Nope. I'll not return to this location, and apparently I now need to ask for warm food.
