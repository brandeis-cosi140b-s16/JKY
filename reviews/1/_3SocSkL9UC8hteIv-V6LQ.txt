WORST food and experience ever.  I was out with my Mom in December and we decided to try something new and local for a fun lunch experience.   Totally regret it and wish we hadn't wasted a "special lunch" in this place.  Service was horrific.  The water tasted awful.  Finally asked for a bottle of water and was charged $2.00.  Ordered chicken fajitas.  The chicken didn't taste right...It was chewy/rubbery.   I didn't eat it and they didn't care if I liked it or not.  I had to ask for sour cream and they seemed surprised that I thought sour cream should be included (it was simply salsa and chicken and cold tortillas).  Generally fajitas would have some type of garnish.  Never refilled chips or the salsa served in Styrofoam cups despite walking by many times.   The employees seemed more interested in visiting and flirting with each other at a table of their own.  I could go on and on... but needless to say I will never go back and would advise no one else to go there.  Save your money.... Especially don't buy the margaritas... unless of course you enjoy ice with mix and no tequila!
