Well I think you need to be drunk to eat here because your order is wrong everytime. Never use the drive thru here. It is a game to them. Someone who use to work here told me how they fuck with peoples food and service in the drive thru. You asks questions about the food at the drive thru and they lie too your face about it. Also no matter how nice and friendly you are they act like your bothering them. The people that work here are rude and immature. If your white don't eat here. They will mess your order up on purpose and have a shit eating grin when you pull up to the drive thru window. Asked for chicken that was not too spicy and got a chicken burrito that was purposely flaming hot! Assholes! I hope this place burns to the ground!
