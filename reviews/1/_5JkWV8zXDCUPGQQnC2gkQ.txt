My husband and I would go here every week since they opened.. But it seems as though since the owner hasn't been in the place lately the restaurant is going down hill... The 2 waitresses have a very poor attitude... Last week we went the girl waitress had an attitude and told my sister in law they were out of rice & michelada's!  Went back today and the waitresses would not even wait on us! Another couple sat next to us and they give them menus & chips!!! We waited 20 minutes before walking out! Mind you have been loyal customers since they opened their doors! The food was great but has gone down hill!
