This was awful.  Base on the reviews from this site we decided to check it out.  I reallly wanted to like it, it's close to home, has awesome architecture, great outside seating and good atmosphere.  Howerver that's when the good times stopped.  The chips showed up and were so stale they had to have been out of the bag since early last week.  The salsa was not tasty at all and the sour cream came in cafeteria packets or "in baked potato packets from Golden Corrall" as Jessie says.

When the food showed up it was just as bland as the chips.  Jessie will eat just about any Mexican food on the planet but this was TERRIBLE.  I haven't a clue what other people enjoyed, maybe we managed t order the two things on the menu that are awful.

To top it all off there weren't any entertaining people in the whole place to pay attention to.  Just unacceptable.  

Needless to say we will not be visiting the Fiesta Cafe again, unless there is a Fiesta with lots of free booze.
