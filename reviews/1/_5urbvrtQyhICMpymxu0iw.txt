I was so hoping this place would be great. We live a mile from here and couldn't wait for it to open. I even gave this place six tries, I wanted to like it so bad and made up every excuse for why each experience was awful. Well, no more excuses, it is just awful. 

Food is sooo bland, portion size small and it's not cheap. Even my 6 year old said the food has no taste. Service is very slow. Last visit,we waited 15 minutes before someone took our drink order and another 5-10 to get them. My food never came out and it took the waiter until the rest of my party was finished eating to come back to our table to see how everything tasted. He acted like he had no idea what I was talking about when I told him I didn't get my entree and went to check on it and came back to tell me, "that's weird. It's just MIA"  nobody stopped by to apologize and I would expect the owners or management to do so...or even an offer of dessert for the kids who had to sit there an extra 45 minutes for me to finally get my meal and eat it.  Nothing. And every experience there was like this. That's why we won't be back. No more excuses. Take your money somewhere else, this place is terrible.
