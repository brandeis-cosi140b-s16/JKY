I would like to be able to write a review but after hearing that Abuelo's was offering a free entree to veteran's and going there I was told at the door I could only receive it by first buying one. As I was by myself this was not an option. I was told sorry and so I left. I went to Dave's Famous Bar-B-Q around the corner and had a great meal with no questions. Guess were I'll go back to!
