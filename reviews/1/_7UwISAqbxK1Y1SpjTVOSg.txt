I know it's only fastfood Mexican, but this was the most tasteless fastfood Mexican I have ever had.  I cannot tell you about the other locations, but this one, my first, did not leave me with a desire to go back.  And how does a bean and cheese burrito that the menu lists as being made with black beans, end up being made with watery refried beans? No, thank you.
