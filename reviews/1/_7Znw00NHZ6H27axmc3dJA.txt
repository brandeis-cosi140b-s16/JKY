Unfortunately we are limited in Buckeye on fresh, healthy, fast food options. I have been seriously disappointed by this place so many times, I always say never again but go back hoping it gets better. Small portions of meat, help that could totally care less, watery salads, disgusting soggy quesadillas. The staff is too busy chatting to one another to do their job. Total waste of money.
