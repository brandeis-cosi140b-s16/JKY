Quite possibly the worst chipotle location ever. The staff is lazy and slow. They consistently have you repeat your order because they can't remember 3 ingredients. They argue with each other and you can tell they don't work well together. The wait is outrageous pretty much any time of day! I've been here 3 times in 2 weeks and I have not waited less than 20 minutes. Even today the line was only 5 people long and it took 20 minutes because they kept running out of stuff. 

I absolutely love chipotle and the food here is no exception in that regard. my bowl was delicious as always but there are dozens of chipotles in the area here so why bother with this awful location? 

They probably don't even read these reviews because they don't care about their guests.

The cash girl was busy flirting with an employee not working. The black guy on grill was busy watching everyone coming through the door instead of preparing for the rush. (they ran out of rice, hot sauce, beans, and chicken while I was here. 15 minute wait for chicken!) 

Look for another chipotle to eat at! It's great food but 0 star service here.
