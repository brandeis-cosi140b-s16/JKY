I had some friends here visiting Saturday and BRAGGED about this place. I was very disappointed. The waitress greeted us almost immediately and yet it took 20 minutes to get a glass of water, followed by cold bean dip. An hour before our drinks finally came. When the food finally came out EVERYTHING was cold, all 4 of our platters. None of ate we all asked for boxes and then gave our boxed food to a peddling Bum outside the front door asking for money.

I doubt I will ever go back again, what a shame... I was a waitress once, I would have asked if something was wrong if I had a 4 top and nobody touched it !!
