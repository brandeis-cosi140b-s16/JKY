This used to be our go-to for yardstick-length margaritas because they sold them for much cheaper than everyone else - BUT NOT ANYMORE! We pretty much paid for double this last time. I even got double shots, and didn't taste anything in mine, while my husband's was pretty strong (I think that happened last time too). It was making me sick and I ended up tossing mine. Ugh, never again!
