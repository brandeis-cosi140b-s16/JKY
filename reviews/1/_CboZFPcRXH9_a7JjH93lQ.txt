Wish I could give negative stars. When you walk into the place it looks really cool. Then you realize how unorganized the place is.   Too many different places to order, that it is confusing. Sat at the bar and ordered two burgers. The kitchen tried to make our burger twice and screwed up both times. Kitchen can not read a simple ticket. Left frustrated without trying the food
