I loved the Carlos O'Brien in Phx.  I thought it would be the same.  NOT!  The place is nice and new.  Service was ok.  Food was just flat not good.  Got combo #15, chicken chimy with queso, rice & beans.  Bland, bland, bland...  

My hubby got their one of their specials (2) corn beef taco.  OMG, the total for 2 tacos was $18.04 (no price was posted on their special list on the table).  Since it is a St. Patrick's Day special, we thought $5 to $6.  He said he did not like them at all.  The shells had a weird taste and the corn beef was not flavorful at all.  

Lesson learned:  Always ask for pricing if not listed!
