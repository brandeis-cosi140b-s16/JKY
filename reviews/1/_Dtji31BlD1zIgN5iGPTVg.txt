Had been excited to try this new hole in the wall, strip mall Mexican restaurant. Well excitment quickly turned to disappointment. Food lacked in taste and quality. Service lacked. The place appeared clean. Unfortunately 1 out of 3 won't cut it. The menu was small. I did like the chips...so that's something :?/
