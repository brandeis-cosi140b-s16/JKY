This is the worst excuse for Mexican food I have ever eaten, and I have eaten the southern cuisine at least twice a month for over 40 years. The food is obviously prepared weeks ahead of time and reheated to serve. The cheese  enchilada was so rubbery it was not edible. The beef enchilada was burned at both ends where it had been microwaved. Don't waste your calories, money or time with this place. Want cheap either!
