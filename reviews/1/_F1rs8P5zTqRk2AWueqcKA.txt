I've been to this restaurant many time through the years. Because it's close, easy and not terrible food. But Sunday was more disrespect than I can take. We ordered our drinks and food, no issue. After waiting 40 mins,which is crazy for this place, we get 2 of our 4 orders. Wait another 10 minutes we get the third order. She finally ask me my order as she is dropping this entree off. Telling me it was coming she has to go pick it up. Ok. Another 5 minutes passes my family is finished with their plates, she picks their plates up and apologize again. I tell her it's alright, just put it in a box I'll eat it at home we are ready for the check. She returns with the bill still no food and we notice they charged us full price for their mistake. I ask her if some compensation can be made, she replies "no, is you want the food you have to pay for it" to that I said "no worries." Great customer service guy! I'll drive a few extra minutes if it means I can actually have the food I order. Will not be back to see you anytime soon.
