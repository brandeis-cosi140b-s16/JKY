Very sad lunch.  What the heck happened?  Service was good but the cooks need to find a new profession.  They must have been out of cheese.  Every other enchilada I've ever had had cheese on it.  Taco Bell would kick the crap out of this place for flavor.  Margaritas need to get more exposed to tequila and the margarita mix instead of a bunch of ice and water.  Once again what the heck is going on?  Maybe it's the summer heat?
