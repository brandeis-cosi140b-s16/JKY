I can't believe how disappointed my husband and I were with our meal!  We go to this location quite regularly and usually have a very tasty meal/treat, not so on 11/23/14. I don't know what went wrong, from the guacamole and chips to the burritos our meal was a disaster.

The guacamole had gigantic (1/4 of an avocado size) hard unripe pieces, loads of cilantro stems, no seasoning (s & p), onion or jalapeno.  This was a shocker as Chipotle usually has some of the best guac in town; this was inedible. The chips had virtually no salt and none of the usual lime salt which is what makes their chips deliciously unique.

Now on to the burritos; mine was a chicken fajita burrito, black beans on the side.  The rice was under cooked, crunchy and tasteless, with no cilantro or lime and for that matter any other seasoning that could be discerned.  The chicken, which usually has a wonderful marinade, was bland and unseasoned and several pieces were burned.  My veggies were burned to the point that the over whelming flavor of my burrito was that of charred veggies and crunchy rice.  The beans had zero flavor and had a slight crunch to them.  I hate to say it, but they might have been the best part of my meal!  My husband's burrito shared the same issues minus burned veggies as he goes for the beans.

All in all, I don't know what was going on as this location is usually pretty consistent with its quality.  Not so yesterday, it was a fiasco from start to finish.

I do want to point out that this in no way reflects on the line prep staff who were friendly and accommodating, as usual.
