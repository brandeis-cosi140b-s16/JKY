Chips were very stale. Waitress mentioned something about some sort of tortilla chip emergency, so they are having to serve chips from the previous week. Rice was a gummy mess indicating it had been reheated several times. The quac chicken breast was surprisingly  fresh considering the state of the rest of the meal. Dos Equis XX Amber was very fresh and cold. The initial salsa tasted fresh. Almost too fresh and familiar. It hit me that they may be serving Pace Picante sauce. The hot sauce that you have to ask for was actually the best part of the meal. I won't be going back. Wife enjoyed the mojito. She stated the chicken in her enchilada was fresh but ruined by the large amount of lettuce tomato and sour cream salad sitting on top cooling everything down. visited on July 4th so maybe that has something to do with the abysmal quality of the food
