There were a lot of problems with this place. After repeating my order three times because my waiter just couldn't get it right, my order still came out wrong. I notice the waiter struggle with taking my order so I repeated my order in Spanish (not bc I'm racist - for that person that felt the need to attack me on that) but because I had no problem being patient and making sure he got my order right. And he managed to mess up the table next to us (maybe he was new?) We went at a time that wasn't busy but felt he was all over the place but couldn't really manage to get anything right. 

How does a Mexican restaurant get Tacos so wrong? This place manages to do just that. The food itself was horrible. We came here as it was highly recommended to be the best Mex Restaurant in Vegas but were highly disappointed w the food itself. 

And to top it off we had to wait a very long time to get our check. Only reason we left a tip was for the bus boys who manages to keep up with our refills. Our waiter just took our orders, managed to screw our orders and we had to track him down for our check. (Not exaggerating - my husband had to track him down bc he neglected to come by our table to check on us) If you are looking for a decent Mex Restaurant than try to avoid this place. It sucks!





As some are offended for my review then just ignore it and go because you enjoy this place so much. I write my review based on MY experience and don't appreciate haters hating bc they don't agree. YELP is meant to voice your opinion on businesses as everyone has different experiences. 

Fortunately, I've had great Mexican food and I don't believe this was one of them. Forget about the bad service we received but the food was just not good.
