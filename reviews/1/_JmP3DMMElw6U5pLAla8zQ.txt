Holy crap, how does this place have so many stars!? First off, the food is ok. The first thing the employee does is tell me they have free guacamole and that they are better than Chipotle because they charge. Really, the first thing you do is bash Chipotle Mexican Grill? Which is not only a far more superior restaurant in every way, but also kills your guys quarterly and yearly sales. 

Next I had to wait for them to restock the white rice. Which was 1/2 scoop of old rice, and half of the new batch. The second thing I noticed was the rap music playing from the back. It COMPLETELY overpowered the Mexican music playing in the dining area. Who wants to listen to rap when they are eating Mexican food? I know I don't e≈õe. 

After getting the rest of my condiments and chicken out on, the female manager was arguing with an earlier customer about the sizes of some weird bowl or something. I don't even frickin' know. I was standing there with my food getting cold until I said, "Excuse me, can I pay for my food it is getting cold!?". Her and the customer apologized and each took a step back. Before my receipt even popped out they were bickering again and I had to point and remind her to give me the receipt! That process took awhile. 

By the time I sat down my burrito was completely cold. Some slight warmth coming from the rice, but overall there stoves must of been WAY to low. 

Thank god is was great weather out or I would of been stuck inside eating a burrito listening to rap like a cholo. 

Would not go back, at least to this location. Will stick to Chipotle from now on. 

P.S. Raising your prices to compensate for your FREE guacamole is BS. If you don't get guac you are paying and enflamed price. 

This restaurant shouldn't even be allowed in paradise valley. Well, it is next to Walmart...
