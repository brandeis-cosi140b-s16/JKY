Anyone that thinks this is good mexican food must not have taste buds. I grew up in AZ from a very large mexican family and mexi casa is terrible. The meat tastes like precooked frozen crap u get in the freezer aisle. The chicken meat even had freezer burn. The chips come straight out of the bag cold and stale. The salsa is absolutely flavorless.  My friend for some reason reallllly wanted to eat here. I was so disgusted with the food he paid for the entire meal and he agreed that I would from now on  I choose all mexican restaurants we eat at.
