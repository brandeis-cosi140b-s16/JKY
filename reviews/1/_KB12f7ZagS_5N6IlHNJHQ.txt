I was recommended to El Rico's by a co-worker. My husband and I were thinking of going somewhere else, but then the co-worker said she is spoiled at El Rico's and does not find anywhere else as good. So I thought we should give it a try. My husband loves authentic Mexican food and considers himself a good judge at finding a worthy place, and unfortunately they did not pass the test. The ambience is nice on the outside, the inside is a little too cafeteria like, not quite restaurant style. I will give them credit for the ceiling, very dramatic d√©cor (but that's not what I'm eating off of). The salsa was amazing, definitely my choice in dips. However the chips are way too thick, that's just a preference though. The food was not as strong tasting as we would like, my husband said it was like eating water but I think that's over exaggerating. I didn't mind the food too much, although I still left hungry (ordered the flauta plate). But, are you ready for the kicker? The taco my husband ordered still had the wire piece in it that holds it together during frying. Cooking 101 do not leave metal shards in food.
Wait a second, I just looked up their website and they have the inside all decorated. Don't let that fool you. When we went the tables were bare and sticky. I was going to give them 2 stars but just decided on 1 for the false advertising. Fine dining experience my butt. We went early so it was not crowded and  yet service was still slow, although polite.
