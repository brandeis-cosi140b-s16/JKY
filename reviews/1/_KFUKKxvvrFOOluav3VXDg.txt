Since zero stars is not an option 1 shall do. 

One of the worst dinning experiences EVER!
Me and my party of 4 sat down on a beautiful Saturday afternoon after the PRIDE festival just down the road. We sat and enjoyed the free chips and salsa and nothing else. After 25 minutes and ZERO service of a beverage or even an acknowledgement of our being there we decided to leave. 
If the place had been busy that would have been different but we were 1 of maybe 5 tables being used. 
Sad sad restaurant. 
Never again.
