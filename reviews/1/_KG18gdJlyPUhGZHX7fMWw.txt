I was very disappointed with my last visit at this location. The drive thru line was incredibly backed up and the service was running so slow. They forgot my scrawny dry chicken (what's up with that? The chicken used to be quality juicy chicken) so I had to go through the drive thru again AND they got rid of the BBQ black beans. I did not enjoy my BRC with the new black beans. Overall my meal was not something worth coming back for.
