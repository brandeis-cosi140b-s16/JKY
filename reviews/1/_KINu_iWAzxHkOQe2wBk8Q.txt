Service was terrible. Smelled great though. The worker kept asking us what was ours(?) I don't know, isn't that your job to kept track? We watched the kids break the cup for our salsa then put it on the tray, then puts in the queso in the cup, overflows everywhere. My tacos were ready, he puts them in front if me. The other worker tells him you need to ask them if they want lettuce and salsa. Then the little counter girls asks which is ours. I felt like I was doing most of their job by telling them where my chips were, which salsas it comes with, then they forgot the other half of my order. I just left.

I had never been to one of these so didn't know what to expect.
