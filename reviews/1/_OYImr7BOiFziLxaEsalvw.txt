I'm so sad to say this because I used to love this place... tonight it was inexcusably terrible!  It was bland, greasy, and not even remotely fresh.  My husband and our roomies food was atrocious too. Its not often they run into something so bad they won't even keep eating it but tonight it all went in the trash. They even scraped the crusty bean corner into my plate, didn't even try to stir it, yuck. Worst carnitas I've ever had, hands down.
