Someburros used to be good...not anymore.  They've cut down on what you get and charge more.  The mild sauce is so watery now, you can drink it.  No more tomatoes as garnish for pollo fundido and the amount of sauce on top and rice on the side has been greatly reduced.  They should have never messed with a good thing.  Won't be back.
