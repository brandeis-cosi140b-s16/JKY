The worst restaurant experience ever!  The person who sat us was one of the cooks that just walked in off the patio smoking, didn't even wash up first!  We never got silverware or napkins after asking several times, our tacos took forever and when we did get them they were cold!  Waitress was not friendly and not apologetic at all, scared to come to the table actually.  This place will not last.
