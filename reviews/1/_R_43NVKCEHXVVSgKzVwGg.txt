Ate there last night. Two of the four dinners made where wrong even as they brought back what should have been corrected it was wrong. The whole dinner was a disaster  on top of that the correct thing would have been to offer a desert or something. We are not the types that look to get comps or bitch about service but it was bad.  Two of ate while the others had to sit there. Once they received their dinner we had to do the same.  
Well all I can say that's another one off the list. I will stick to El Segundo on the strip
