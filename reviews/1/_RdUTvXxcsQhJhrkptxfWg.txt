Wow is all I can say. Terrible service and the food was just as bad. Their menu is hilarious because every other word is misspelled. This was probably the most enjoyable part of our experience. The menu is extensive but the food was just blah. There were also ingredients in my burrito that weren't listed in the description. It was supposed to include mushrooms, onions, and chicken. There were thick slices of carrots and zucchini. Wouldn't have minded if the food was cooked correctly. Chips were stale, cheese dip was lukewarm at best. The server disappeared so long that we almost walked out before ordering but I was starving so we stayed. Then when it was time to go, the server was again no where to be found. Also caught management and servers arguing. I am fluent in spanish, so there was no disguise to what was really going on. Will definitely never go back here again. We would have been better staying home and eating a frozen pizza.
