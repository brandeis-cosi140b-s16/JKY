I have gone to one other don tortaco other than this one. I thought the food was far superior to Robertos but the service was terrible at this location. 
My boyfriend likes his burritos with meat, bean and rice. No guac and no pico. They wanted to charge him more for ingredients that cost less. And said they can't do that for him. They just lost a customer. Ended up going to Robertos.
