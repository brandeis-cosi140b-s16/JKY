This chipotle is always out of something! And if you come in at 9pm, a whole hour before close forget it! U will be left with scraps because u are unworthy of fresh warm food. How dare u come during regular business hours! This last fist was the last straw. They were out of white rice at 9pm and also out of onions. So i had to again settle for something different. Also everything that i picked was ice cold! So i pretty much picked at the cold food i settled on. The garbage ate more of my food then i did. So note to this chipotle until the doors are locked every person should be treated to the same experience. As they pay the same money everyone else pays. I am resident of laveen and will mot be returning. Such a shame considering its only 3 min away from me.
