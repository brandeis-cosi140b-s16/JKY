I called in an order for 2 fish burritos, upon arriving to pick them up I was told that I ordered beef burritos!  When I respectfully asked for fish instead the cashier rolled her eyes at me and started talking to another female employee in spanish!  That was enough for me to walk out, good luck in business with that attitude!
