If I could give this place less than a star, I would. We had in person discussion with the owner to book a party of 40 people to be in the restaurant at 6pm Nov 7th and were promised happy hour specials. We were assured multiple times they could accommodate us and it wasn't a problem. 40+ people show up to the restaurant at 6pm and there's one table with 4 chairs ready and nobody was aware we were coming. Starving people who just flew for 8 hours were made to wait outside for an hour until most people just left. The people who were served didn't get the happy hour specials we were promised and the menu prices we were shown beforehand were drastically higher when we arrived. Plus the manager was obviously tweaked out of his mind. He was extremely rude to a friends pregnant wife and laughed as he made a pont to always serve her last. Despite all this, we still dropped about a grand in this dump all for the pleasure of the most horribly unprofessional experience of my life. Thanks for nothing. This is Canyon State Beard Club unapproved establishment.
