This place sucks. Terrible service and I can usually tell how my food is going to be by the chips and salsa. Chips were stale, salsa below average and we had to ask for them. Waitress was more in the mood to socialize with drunkies in the bar instead of taking care of her customers who were there to eat. Food was bland and tasteless. They should change their name to "Clearance Shelf."
