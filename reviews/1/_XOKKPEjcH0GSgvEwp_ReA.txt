The service here was not good and unprofessional.  One bar tender forgot our chips and salsa for literally 30 minutes after being reminded of it twice!  The other bartender was leaving so she asked if we could close out with her.  This was fine except we ordered happy hour two for one drinks and was still drinking our first one.  What's her solution...make the second drink and let the ice melt in it until we're ready for it.  

Overall:  Bad Service.  Bad Experience

Recommendation:  Skip this place!
