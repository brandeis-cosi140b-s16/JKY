This was my third visit, and my last. Each time I come, I try something else- thinking my last poor experience was just a fluke. It's not, this place just stinks. 

This time, the food was average, at BEST.  Though it was hot, it took awhile to get out and looked like it had just been thrown on the plate! The worst was the service. Never have I ever tipped under 10% or had such a poor customer service experience. The waitress came to take our order and then disappeared (busers brought out our food, and then too disappeared). We literally had to waive her down to ask for our check, and even then, she never showed up again. Ten minutes later, we had to waive down the manager to get our check. No water refills, no checking on our order (when we needed items), nothing. Lunch was miserable, overpriced, and long. DO NOT BOTHER.
