Had dinner at Patron last night for the first and the last time.  What a disappointment.  From the street, the place looks cute.  And I will give two stars for the decor.  However, the food was a huge flop.  First, I had the red sangria (which was so so) and my boyfriend had a classic margarita on the rock, which tasted like a mix out of some plastic jug.  Truly awful.  Then the chips & salsa arrived.  The chips were unremarkable but the salsa (which was pur√©ed and runny) was clearly out of a jar.  Nothing tasted fresh.  The menu was so huge there's no possible way anything is fresh or from scratch.  I don't see this place surviving long in the shadyside neighborhood. 

In summary, I'd rather eat at Chipotle.  And that says alot.
