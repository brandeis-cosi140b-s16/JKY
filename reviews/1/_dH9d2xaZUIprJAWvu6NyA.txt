I am absolutely astounded that this "Mexican Restaurant" has 3 and 1/2 stars on yelp! The only reason why they get a star from me is the bar atmosphere, they have a great bar with good happy hour deals, but that's it. 

Lets begin with the food, salsa and chips...absolute crap. The salsa tastes like canned crap from a 99 cents store, bland and just CRAP, I can go to Filiberto's across the street and find salsa 10 times better than what's at Loco's. The chips are salty as h***, tastes as if they poured the entire salt shaker into the basket, VERY SALTY, i'm not a goat, but thanks! I've been here for plenty of taco Tuesdays (mainly for the drinks). The tacos run between 1-2 bucks. The dollar tacos are shredded chicken or beef and the 2 dollar ones are shrimp, mahi mahi, and new york steak.I've tried all of the tacos, the shredded chicken and beef always dry and bland, same with the mahi mahi! The only tolerable tacos are the shrimp and new york steak, but once you go to a REAL Mexican restaurant, it makes those tacos look like poop! I've had their chimichanga's, again like another poster said about the beef, they put ground beef instead of shredded like what I expected and it sucked! I refuse to try anything from there again! If I go here it's only for happy hour once in a blue moon, but that's about it. Want to go to a real Mexican Restaurant try Los Taquitos off of 48th st and Elliot and La Canasta in Downtown, those are real Mexican restaurants. 

You know there is something wrong with a "Mexican Restaurant" when the hamburgers are better than the "Mexican food" they serve. Nuff said.
