Let me start by saying that each and every time I get suckered/dragged into going here, it reaffirms my vitriol hatred for this "establishment". You know how as a man or woman(I assume) you size up people in the place and inevitably you hate those of the same sex for some reason or another? No, just me? OK then. Well, here I hate both sexes just as equally! I am not sure I can really even put my finger on it. Maybe it is the shear desperation that is on everyone's face as the night starts to wind down and the women get drunker and the men lamer. 

The bar is filled with 40-60 year old men and women, who are looking for someone for the night. It is dark in the place so it is really hard to tell just how old some of the women are in this place. It could make for an interesting story I guess. 

There really isn't one redeeming quality about Cocomo's. Maybe I just have my Haterade before I go to this place? Who knows. Skip it!
