Well I hate to write this but I have to. Went to the drive through and ordered several tacos and a 1 piece fish and 2 planks dinner. We were told to pull to the lot and they would bring out our food...15 minutes later we get the food and the man says it was just made nice and hot, I thanked him and drove home. We sat down to eat and my chicken was Raw, and yes I bit into it, Yuk!!! The other piece was cooked but I was so taken back completely lost my appetite! Now mind you I waited 15 minutes for this raw chicken! I drove back and asked to speak with the mgr. she was so nonchalant,  I brought it with me clearly pink inside not a big deal I guess. I said would you please take this and show it to the cook you really don't want to serve raw poultry. She said ok. I mean come on act concerned a little at least? She wrote my name in a book for a free meal (fish only)! but what concerns me was her attitude. I used to own a restaurant and that is the last thing you want to have happen to a customer! I didn't drive all the way back for free fish! I thought I would get a thank you for bringing this to our attention and we will make an effort that it doesn't happen again or something? Oh my what's wrong with people...is that my stomach gurgling???
