Terrible Food. Baja Fresh WAS arguably the Best Fast/Casual Tex/Mex Restaurant in America. It has rapidly deteriorated through the years. I wish the Original Founders ( Magglos Family ) would buy back this once Great company. The Salsa bar is bleh, prices have risen and the Food Quality is average @ Best ! Is it any wonder that their Stores are Closing ???
