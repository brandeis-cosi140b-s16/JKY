Does anyone in Madison consider this a great Mexican food location? Both of my experiences at Pedro's have left me disheartened. They go a little something like this:

1. Thursday night. Friends invite me for inexpensive margaritas. Am   approached by a girl who wants me to go out with her father standing 10 feet away, who ironically is the least creepy of the crowd looking to enjoy cheap tequila. Implementing Gym Rules, i.e. baseball cap and hoodie upon my next visit post 9pm.

2. Wednesday evening. Dinner with a friend. Server who may or may not go on living if she stops texting, poor quality food and terrible lighting, which is imperative unless practicing G.R. (see above.)

Being a girl from the southwest, I have had a great fajita or two in my day. If you are feeling rebellious and decide to go despite the many poor reviews, know this: Mexican food is great, and this is nowhere near that.
