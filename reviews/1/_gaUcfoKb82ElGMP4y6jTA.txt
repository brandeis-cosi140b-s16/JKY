You are a Mexican restaurant and you guys are showing the Mexico World Cup Soccer game with no volume ???? ! Freaken total sell outs . You should be called Jimmy's . What a let down . Headed over to another real Mexican bar that is hosting the game , nice and loud to pay respect to our soccer team .
