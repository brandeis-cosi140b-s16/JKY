We called ahead of time, but they refused to take our order over the phone (we were a large group in a hurry). Our waitress insisted she could get us in and out quickly, but didn't. Service was slow and the waitress was anything but friendly. At the end she even got upset with our big group when we asked for separate checks... will not go again!
