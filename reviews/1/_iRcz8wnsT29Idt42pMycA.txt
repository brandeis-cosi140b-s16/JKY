Fairly terrible is how I would characterize this poor excuse of a Mexican restaurant. To be honest I hate texmex, so I guess this restaurant started off with a disadvantage. But when the food is bad, it is bad. The chicken quesadilla was bland and soggy and the corn sides were equally disappointing. The Caesar salad was subpar. The only redeeming dish was the crab nachos. It was loaded with cheese, tomatoes and crab; however, the dish still was not that great. Worst of all were the prices that the restaurant demands for the food. Sad times for Mexican food.
