I cannot even begin to explain how angry I am at the customer service I received last night and the amount of ingredients in  my dishes. I quarter size of barbacoa in each taco and in my bowl...Wow! Tiny scoop of rice and beans and quarter amount of sour cream. Meat. rice and cheese.
I have been coming to this location for so many years and to be treated like this with the money I pay is unacceptable! I had a c I asked 4 times for more of each item and they rolled their eyes at me and ignored me! My bowl was almost empty the way it was served 
My coworker with me that was treated the same way and complained about the amount of food in his burrito and the girls became even more rude!
I am really upset about this because I have paid a lot of my money over the years to this location and I was treated like dirt and I would never treat anyone with this much disrespect and much less a paying customer!
Thank you for ripping me off and ruining my experience last night! I will post a picture of what it looked like too!
