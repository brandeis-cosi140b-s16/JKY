What a disappointment!  Not authentic Mexican food.  I ordered the Pink Taco and it wasn't good at all. Husband ordered fish taco. Okay but have had better. The worst part was the watered down and overpriced margaritas.Wow! Awful, all ice and we ordered two of their signature margaritas.  To end a bad meal we were double charged on our bill.  We told waiter who just walked away and came back with corrected bill. He then grabbed the double bill sitting in front of me. I said I want to keep this to make sure our credit card isn't billed.  He said, "No you can't have it" and ripped it into little shreds and put the shreds beside me and left.  Service was an F.
