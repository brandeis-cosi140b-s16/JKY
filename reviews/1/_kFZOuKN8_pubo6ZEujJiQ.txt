Dirty! That about sums this place up. Walked into this place because I was in the area and I had not been to one of these in years. The food is okay, but once I had ordered my meal, I began to notice how dirty the place was. The floors had dirt stains on them and no one had mopped up. There was a small bucket sitting on the service counter that had a rag in it an some type of cleaning solution for wiping down the tables. The trash cans behind the counter were viewable and they were full and had trash laying on the floor around them, and the final things I noticed were the condiments bar and the drink area were dirty and had not been wiped up in quite awhile.
Stay away from this place!
