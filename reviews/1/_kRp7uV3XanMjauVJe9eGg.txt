The worst customer service ever!! We will not be returning. We were recommended this place by some friends so we decided to try it.
1) the place was overly crowded and tables are extremely close to each other.
2) the host didn't even greet us and seemed in a bad mood as she was walking us to our table. 
3) our server took over 20minutes to ask what we wanted to drink and took another 10min to bring them to us by then we were ready to order. 
4) another server brang out our food but we were never advised that she was our new server so we sat there waiting for the server we had initially no where to be found.(the food was nothing special by the way)
5) when we finally realized we had a new server she took FOREVER to bring us our check she came and went around our table over 5 times every time we would make eye contact so I can get her attention she would look away fast and walk away this made me super angry so we finally got up and headed to look for a manager we ended up bumping into her and she said she will get our check immediately. 
H0RRIBLE. NEVER AGAIN.
