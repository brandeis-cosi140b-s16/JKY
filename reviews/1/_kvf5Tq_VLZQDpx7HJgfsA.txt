Would definitely not recommend. Lucky I gave it any stars at all. I love to support local businesses but this was an awful experience.  Heard great things about their salt and pepper wings...horrible. Like fried chicken.  No taste. Took us 45 mins to get our food. Even though we were the only ones in the restaurant. The other people were just in the bar drinking. Chips were extra after the first basket. Really???  The wings my hubby ordered were burnt.  The server didn't know it was happy hour all day so we got overcharged on the drinks. Do not go here.  It isn't worth your Money or your time.


UPDATE: since they are locally owned I messaged them on Facebook to let them know how disappointing it was. I know I would want to know if it was my business. The GM Jon got back with me within an hour or two and said to come back and try them again and it would be on the house. So I will try again and update. Hoping for a different outcome
