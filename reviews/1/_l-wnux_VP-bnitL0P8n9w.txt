The 1 star is for the service. As far as the food, their goal is to prepare it like authentic mexican food. However, it's an epic FAIL.... The beans are the star of the show here. The meat is plentiful, but bland and chewy. The meat is supposed to be the BASE of the meal. Smh The rice was also flavorless. WTF is going on here??! I read the reviews and decided to eat here because everyone says the food is so good. You have failed me my fellow yelpers, I'm very disappointed. This place is worse than Robertos. I left very full because I was starving, but not happy. Very sad, I drowned my sorrows at Baskin Robbins across the street. Anyone else, DO NOT BE FOOLED BY THESE REVIEWS!! Save yourself the heart ache & go to Los Tacos, hell even Tacos El Gordo will do.
