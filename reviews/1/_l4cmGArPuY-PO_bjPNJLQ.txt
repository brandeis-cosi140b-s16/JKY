This is the second time I've received the wrong order going through the drive thru. I called to talk to a manager (Deserea) and she offered to correct my order if I came back tonight (what's the point of a drive thru if you have to go back) or replace my order next time I come in. Not even a refund. She said it must be a training issue. Regardless it's so annoying getting food you didn't order and can't eat but already paid for.
