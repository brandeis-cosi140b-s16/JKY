There really should be some kind of board that gives accrediation to restaurants claiming to be "Mexican." That way the consumer would know that places like Taco Bell, Pedro's and ChiChi's (if they're even still open) are not really Mexican restaurants, even though they purport to be. That way folks wouldn't be fooled into eating at a "Mexican Restaurante" just because there's an "e" at the end of "Restaurant." 

After my meal at Pedro's, I decided to just hit up Taco Bell the next time I'm in Madison and I want "Mexican." It's just as crappy as this place, but far easier on the pocketbook. 

This place is an afront to the people of Mexico and their cuisine.
