The food here is great, the low stars are for the crappy service. I dined on a Friday night with 5 other people, I understand its a busy night but I don't understand the waiter who acted bothered every time we needed water or when we got our food that was cold. I ordered the carne asada burrito which was really good and we all shared the guacamole which was also very good. The second problem we encountered was when our checks came, as a party of 6 we were locked into a 20% tip, which was fine the problem is when we asked to to split the check three ways we got even more attitude from our unfriendly waiter. We wrote each total along with the amount to charge each card with our names on the receipt, no problem right? WRONG. I was charged an extra $80 that is still pending and when I pointed it out to the waiter he accused us of shorting him, saying he guesses he'll "eat the cost" pretty sure you just over charged us and got a 20% tip.

Flash forward to the next week when I decided to give this place another chance, I called to make reservations and to make sure we were not seated in the waiters section we had had previously. I asked to speak to a manager and explained our first situation, he apologized but didn't seem to care to much. I asked to make reservations and he said well we already have two reservations so I don't think we can get you in, you can just walk up. Why i earthen would I want to just show up and wait for a half an hour? After my first experience you think they could squeeze in a party of 5- so finally he said I'll do it (like it was a favor). I showed up five minutes early with my entire party and was told there was no reservation and we'd just have to wait for a table. This is probably the worst service I have ever had at a restaurant especially after speaking with a manager. I probably won't be going back here any time soon, which is to bad because it's a cute place with good food.
