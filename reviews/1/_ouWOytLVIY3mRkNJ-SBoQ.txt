Was so excited to see something new open up in this area. Arrived at 6 to see a handful of empty tables inside and on the patio. We arrived at the hostess table and then the wait began. We saw server after sever pass by without saying anything  or acknowledging us. Husband started the timer on his phone and after 2 minutes three different people said they would be right with us. That is when I started to really look around at the other customers and see that many were sitting at a table with no drinks or trying to flag down someone. After the four minute mark someone approached us and asked us if would come back in 15 minutes. What?! I have never had a place of business ask me to come back. At the very least seat me throw some chips and salsa and water and when you get around to me that is fine, I am not very picky. Don't waste your time....do yourself a favor and go down the street to El Encato
