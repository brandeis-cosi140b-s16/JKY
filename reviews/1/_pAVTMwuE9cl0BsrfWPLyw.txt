Untrained HARASSING security at Sandbar Desert Ridge. I went here last night with my girlfriend to watch the Mayweather fight. I paid $20 dollars to get us both in as a cover charge and then ordered an overpriced $10 cocktail. After about 10 minutes I noticed my psycho ex girlfriend was also there. She soon noticed me and started following me around the bar grabbing on to my waist as I was walking. I told her to get off me and repeatedly pushed her off as she kept on trying to grab me. I immediately went to security and told them that the girl was harassing me and for them to watch her. About 5 minutes later some overweight bald bouncer asked me to step outside while they investigated the situation. I explained what was going on and I was very frustrated as I was the one who initially reported the incident to security. Instead of investigating the situation with both parties or viewing the security cameras they kicked me out because I asked to talk to someone in charge (The security guard didn't like that I wanted to talk to someone who actually had some intelligence). Worst bar experience ever! I couldn't even have security's help when I specifically asked for it. It's not always the females getting harassed in the bars fellas. Now a days there should be equally security for both sexes and I don't appreciate being kicked out after I was the victim who seeked help. Ridiculous!!!
