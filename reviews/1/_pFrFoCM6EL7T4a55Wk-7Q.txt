I waited in the drive thru for 10 minutes without even so much as a hello. I understand it gets busy but at least come over the speaker and acknowledge that you'll take my order when you can. I drove away as did the person behind me and went elsewhere. On my way out I saw three employees standing in the parking lot on break. Maybe only send one employee on break at a time? Very disappointing and frustrating.
