The food is reasonably priced, the service is excellent but not too Impressed with the Food or my experience. I ordered a Torta and it was very simple not much flavor at all! Their salsas are watered down. I did love the pickled jalape√±os and carrots thought. The reason why I'm giving such a low score is because when I get there before I ordered i asked for the restroom she said, no you can't use it I'm cleaning it right now, really you are cleaning the bathrooms as she is carrying some used paper towels and a bottle of windex. I still placed my order I observed her she continued so help people she did not wash her hands! Yeah needless to say I did not enjoy my Torta and will not be back!
