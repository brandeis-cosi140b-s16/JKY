There was a time that this wasn't too bad of a corporate restaurant.  Besides the usual musical chairs with menu items that corp restaurants love doing, the food has never been too bad, and some dishes in the past were quite passable and good.  However, it would seem things have took a turn for the worst.  

The main problem is the overall service.  My family and I (4 of us total) sat for an hour waiting for our meals and watching people that came in after us get their meals.  Instead of just telling us they messed up our order, they just kept bringing chips and assuring us our dinners were coming out, which they never did.  We finally got up and walked out in frustration and disappointment. 

After several months of staying away, we returned to give it another shot.  Again the service was extremely slow and we didn't even get the common courtesy of the waitress checking to see if our meals were ok.  So, not only this time were they slow, they were not even courteous or showed any care whatsoever.  

The food overall is just average corporate flair, and through the years they have removed various items I used to order frequently, which is what is very disappointing about corporate restaurants as they don't believe in consistency.   However, what really kills this place is the service and obviously poor management.
