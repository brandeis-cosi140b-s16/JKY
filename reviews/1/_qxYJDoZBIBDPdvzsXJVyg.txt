This place is terrible! Not only is the food bland and non-authentic, but the service is even worse. The waitresses don't know what they are doing! It took 3 people to figure out how to use their register. The couple before us walked out upset because they charged food they didn't order to their check. 

The salsa taste like it came out of a jar, like seriously the hot pace picante sauce! You can taste the MSG's in the beans and the rice was dry and flavorless.  I ordered ground beef tacos and let's just say taco bell has better tacos. 

While I am typing this my husband has been inside for 20 plus min waiting for the waitress to figure out how to run the register. I am so annoyed because now we are going to miss our movie. Don't waste your time or money!
