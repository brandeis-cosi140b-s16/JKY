We had stopped going to this location a couple years ago. One day we took my 89 year old grandma for lunch and asked her to sit at a table while we went and ordered (she has a hard time standing for long periods of time). A member of the staff told her she was not allowed to sit until we had ordered. It was not particularly busy and there was plenty of available seating but they insisted she could not sit until we ordered. So we left and decided there were better places to go. Fast forward to today, we decided to give it another chance. Again, my now 92 year old grandma was with us and wanted to order something off the children's menu because she wasn't particularly hungry. After receiving our food a member of the staff came over and told us kids meals were absolutely for kids only and we were not allowed to order them for anyone except for a child. Seriously!? You went out of your way to make a point to tell us not to order from your kids menu next time? You have to be kidding me. Well you are in luck because I will not be ordering from any menu here again. To be honest the food is average at best. I like chicken tacos and the chicken tacos here are weird...the chicken meat is covered in some kind of gravy. Not very appealing and pretty salty. Chips and salsa are ok but not worth the rude service. There are plenty of other Mexican restaurants with better food and better service.
