Not one to normally criticize but this place is highly over rated. First of all our waiter was terrible and the food was so so . We gave our waiter our order, which he never wrote down, he asked first for our drink order which he got totally wrong . He then brought me a Sangria which was all ice. After 30 minutes I finished the drink and my glass was still 2/3 rd's ice on a hot day. Our food was under flavored, after we had to repeat our order to him, my wife had the quesadilla's and I the chipotle chicken with noodles. The prices were high for what you receive. We will never return.
