I come here quite often but via the drive-thru. I went inside yesterday at the slowest time of the day and this place was a mess! No toilet paper or seat covers in the restroom, tables were filthy, and the food presentation was mediocre at best. Cheese on half of my nachos, cold fries, etc. I mentioned the restrooms to the gal at the counter and they still did nothing. I may not be back!
