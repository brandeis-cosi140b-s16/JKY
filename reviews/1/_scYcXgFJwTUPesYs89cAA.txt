I wanted to share how extremely dissatisfied I was with their service tonight. I have a large family and my husband usually goes in and orders for us. The girls gave him attitude the last two times and said "why dont you order online for large orders?". Well, tonight we decided to order online. I was a little frustrated as you cannot order quesadillas online. I scheduled my pick up to be 6pm. I got to the store about 5 minutes early. I saw the staff working on the order. I went to the cashier and asked, is this the order for **** - she said yes. I said ok, I wanted to order 4 cheese quesadillas but there was no where to order online. She looked at the gentleman standing next to her and he said oh we are super busy - you need to go to the line.. Mind you the line was long and going very slow. Also, the thing they used to make the quesadillas was sitting behind the gentleman. Well - 20 minutes in line and i was finally able to order the quesadillas. I got back up to the cashier and the gentleman put my bags from the online order on the counter. I reached in the bags and all the items were COLD. I said to him, all this food is cold! He said well we made it to be ready for you on time. I said I understand that but you said I had to go in line. He could care less that the food was cold and brushed me off. No discount or nothing was offered. At this point I was furious as I just spent over $80 on cold food. When I got the food home and my family unwrapped their food, the tacos were soggy and fell apart, the burritos were soggy and fell apart.. it was a mess and I only live across the street.. I will never go to this Chipotle again as the staff is extremely rude. Like I said, this was not the 1st encounter my family has had with the rude staff there. We did not eat the food and ended up having to go pick up $5 pizzas from little cesars. Well worth it to drive a little further to the Chipotle on Sahara or at Arroyo Crossing.
