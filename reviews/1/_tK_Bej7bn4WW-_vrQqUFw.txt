Now usually the rating of a restaurant can be measured by how many police officers frequent a place. By those standards, you would think that Mendoza would be the best of the best as it is always swarming with officers sitting at their tables. Not even close in this case.

This has to be the worst meal I've ever had in Pitt. The chicken was most certainly from a can and was very bland. The corn tortillas didn't even make it to the table before they had disintegrated. I am 93% positive that my dish was microwaved and it all tasted very old. My fiance's wasn't much better, but at least his flour tortillas stayed tortillas and didn't become mush. Now I am a huge fan of Mexican food. I would come here nearly every day if it were good. Even though this place is two minutes from our house and my office, I will never be returning. I would not even say that it was subpar fare. I would much rather make the inconvenient drive to the Strip for Chicken Latino or to El Paso in Bridgeville when I need my taco/burrito fix.
