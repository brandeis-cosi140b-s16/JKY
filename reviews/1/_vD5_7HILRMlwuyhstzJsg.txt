I've never been to America's Taco Shop. My fiancé was very excited to take me there since she loves the one on 7th street. I ordered the carne asada salad and she ordered the carne asada burrito. The food was such a disappointment. The salad was nothing but romaine lettuce, cheap cheese, small portion of beef and a dressing/sauce that I chose to leave off because it was so sweet. My fiancés burrito looked nice and full but was dinky and left more to be desired. I would have been more satisfied to go to Filliberto's. 
One a side note, when my food was delivered I asked if the wifi was free and if so what the password was. The woman didn't know if they offered free wifi and claimed there was no one present to answer my question. No manager or Director of Operations as she put it? I felt like she just didn't want to take the time to find out for us. By reading all of these other negative reviews, I'd suggest the owner make some drastic changes in the operation. 
First time......last time.
