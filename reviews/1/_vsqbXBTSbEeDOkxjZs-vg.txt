First time here- I ask for a beergarita & receive a Blue Moon draft with margarita mix and tequila. BLEGH! And it was $9 to boot. I drank half and couldn't finish the rest. The bartender was some unattentive guy who kept twirling the bar shaker around. It was a terrible experience & I'll never return!
