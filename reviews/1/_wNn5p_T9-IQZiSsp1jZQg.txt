This place is a VERY mediocre Mexican restaurant. The service is horrible. My girlfriend and I go once every few months in hope that the service will have improved, but we get forgotten every time we go. We have sat at our table for 15 minutes before being served on multiple occasions. The communication between host/waiters is just terrible. Not to mention the food. I would rather cook my own rice and chicken and eat at home than pay 12-13 dollars per person to eat mediocre Mexican food. You're much better off going across the street to Don Pedro.
