I don't understand these ratings. Yelp has never let me down. However, I told my husband this is where I wanted to go when We visited AZ recently and I ordered tacos. They were the worst tacos I've ever had. There were 2 flour tortillas  with carne asada and shredded cabbage on top. My husband did not like his carne asada burrito either.  Meat was like little bullets of spicy meat. The margaritas were OK but nothing special. The one good thing was the key lime pie which was outstanding. That's why I'm giving this restaurant one star but not worth going back.
