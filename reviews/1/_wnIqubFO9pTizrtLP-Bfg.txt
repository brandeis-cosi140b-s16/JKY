I had got the crunch wrap with chicken and an order of Cheese fiesta potatoes on Wednesday, I got food poisoning for two days... Horrible. Sad to say I will never return to Taco Bell again. Never in my life have I had food poisoning, and it is Aweful. Sad because I ate here atlwast once ever other week because it's walking distance from my house. Still thinking about this is making my stomach turn.
