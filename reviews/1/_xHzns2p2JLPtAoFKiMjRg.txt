Food taste just like any other location. But what is different about this one is the horrible service.  I have only been there twice and both times I have got probably some of the worst service I have ever experienced. Taking 15minutes for a bean burrito? Then on top of that someone who storms off when you ask him for hot sauce then basically throws it at you when he finally gets it to you. Definitely the last time I'd ever go to this particular one. Wish I could do more than write a review but doesn't look like anyone's had any luck.
