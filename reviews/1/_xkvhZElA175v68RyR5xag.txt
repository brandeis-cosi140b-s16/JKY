Upsetting I didn't get to try anything here. 
Had never been here before, we walked in and were slightly confused by how the lines were suppose to work. We made our way up to what we think was the front and the lady just stared at us. I greeted her and told her it was our first time here, I figured that would be enough of a hint for her to be slightly more patient with us. "What do you want?" was all I got, so I just blurted out tacos and she walked away. Wait, do I get to pick what kind of tacos? How many? Hello? I looked at the other worker at the front for help and she just stared at me in a daze. Is everyone here on drugs?
Apparently only to us, right after that another customer walked in, and she snapped out of it and proceeded to take her order, which she completed in full and moved her on down the line to pay for her meal. After continually being ignored for 2 minutes, we made our way to the cashier too, hoping they could give us some insight. Same random blank stare and they mumbled something to us about our food being almost ready. Why was the other customer run through so speedly but no one can figure out where my supposed order went?
Getting anxious from the mass confusion and awkwardness of the staff, I just walked out. Major communication issues here that I've never had at any place I've been new to. On the avoid list.
