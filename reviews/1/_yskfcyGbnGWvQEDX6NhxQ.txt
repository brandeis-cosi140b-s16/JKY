Stay away!  Their green Chili Cheese crisp is just a flour tortilla with cheese and canned Ortega Chilis,  OMG their salsa was awful tasted burnt.  Menu was dirty and had left over rice and beans smeared all over pages.  My husband ordered the Beef taco Delux!   Ughghg super dry!  I had the three tacos with a chipotle sauce so gross!  Our bill was $49 Beer was cold glass had lipstick.  They need a dishwasher and a cook.  My advice go to Taco Bell and get a 6 pack of beer somewhere else!  The good reviews must be family!
