I ordered the nachos, these come with ground beef. As I was digging in, I noticed a red part in my meat. I put it to the side and looked further.... A lot of the meat appeared uncooked, as there was a lot of red and pink. I asked the waitress to please take my plate, and she said she could replace it for free. I ordered the same thing without meat. When she delivered my plate, not only was there still undercooked meat on it, she told me "When the meat is reheated in the oven- it can sometimes turn pink & appear uncooked".... What kind of meat does this?! WOW- so I can be lied to and still get food poisoning? Bullsh*t. You can guarantee I will NOT be returning. I'm sorry I had to pay for my crappy bloody mary & my sick nachos.
