Well I have come here for years at this location matter fact since it was built. Things continue to change and head down hill.  New owners, etc etc, Julio's Too,  I went to a lot, was always a great place a long time ago. Now the place year after year is falling apart piece by piece, same broken stool in front for almost 2 years, salsa bar discontinued, which is fine but take it out it collects trash, the stainless steel is stained everywhere, no one cleans anything here anymore.  The chip dumpster for fresh chips looks slightly cleaner than one for outside trash.  I have visted the place 4 times in 60 days and no one ever wipes tables down, sweeps the floor or wipes stainless steel down.  Has Broken drain cover below the dirty soda fountain, signs in paper taped up on equipment, but front cashier folks stand around board between customers and do no cleaning.  I see manager do nothing to motivate his staff at all on all the occasions I came to eat, which means it lies on the shoulders of the manager and the ownership, that you guys don't care anymore to clean it up, and or renew the place.  I cannot come by and spend one Dollar more of my money anymore.
