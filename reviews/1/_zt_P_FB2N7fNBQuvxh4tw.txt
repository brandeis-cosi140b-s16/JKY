My co-workers and I work in close proximity to this location and have eaten lunch and dinner here often. The food is hands down great for the price. True sometimes they get ahead of themselves and your order isn't made how you requested. It is also true at times it can be a little on the skimpy side, but overall the food is good. However, since the original manager left, the service has done nothing but go down hill. The workers seem to leave, and I just know its because of the manager. It seems to be a miserable/hostile work environment. We have recently started going back to Moes. Most of the great friendly staff that worked at this location can now be found other places...Moes, Five Guys etc.
