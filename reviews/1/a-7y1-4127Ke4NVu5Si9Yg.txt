If I could give this location zero stars, I would. I have been a fan of Cafe Rio for a long time. Unfortunately, the Eastern location is the only one where I have gotten good, consistent service. 

There was only five people ahead of me in line. For restaurants like this, that is not very many people at all. The style of eatery can be compared to chipotle. I've been served faster at the eastern location with lines out the door. The people on the line should have spent less time giggling with each other and more time focused on getting people's orders together. 

Their whole food line was a mess. I had dressing spilled all over my dressing cup, grease and whatever else was on their counter all over my salad container, and food spilling from one container into others. One girl was swapping out the dressing, and did not care that it completely spilled into the cheese container. She acted like it did not even happen. My salad tastes okay, my only complaint about the food was my tortilla tastes really old and crunchy. 

The line took so long because there was no one at the stations. When someone finally asked what we wanted, he slid our salads down the line to no one! We stood at the toppings station for a good while before someone came over to help. The manager was completely clueless. He wasn't assertive and didn't tell his staff that they should stay put at their stations to get the line moving. It doesn't take four people to switch out a cheese container.
