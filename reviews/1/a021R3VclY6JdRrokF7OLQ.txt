Now, I'm from Arizona so this review may seem a bit unfair. I compare all Mexican food, especially when claiming to be authentic, to the food I grew up with.  Cocina Mendoza is not even close to authentic. Extremely bland, corn and carrots in the rice, chicken tasted like it came out of a can, soggy taquitos, the list goes on. I didn't expect to find great Mexican in Pittsburgh, but this place is just awful. 

I'll be nice and rate it one star higher than it deserves.
