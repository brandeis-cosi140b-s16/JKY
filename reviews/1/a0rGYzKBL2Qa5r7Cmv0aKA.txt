Food meh. Customer service terrible. I got a vegetarian salad, and asked for the guacamole in the side. The line worker told me she would have to charge me extra for that. I explained her I got a vegetarian, and it comes with guacamole. I just wanted on the side. She insisted on charging me extra. 
Terrible attitude. High expectations, let down.
