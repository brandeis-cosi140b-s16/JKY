Horrible service for Happy Hour! I met some friends here for happy hour last Friday (not my idea) and was sadly disappointed. The happy hour specials are reduced priced drinks and half off appetizers. Our problem was that we had a 90 year old waiter that had huge difficulties taking orders and getting them right. We ordered drinks that took forever to receive even though we were sitting 5 feet away from the bar. I walked up to the bartender (at the bar) at one point to order another drink and was quickly told that I had to wait for the old man to come back. The appetizers we ordered came out in sporadic order, some never came at all so we had to reorder. He even brought us a few we didn't order. I saw another table haggling with the waiter about the check he received as well. They need to either hire an additional waiter for the bar area during happy hour, or find one that can multitask efficiently. We had a group of 10 people and it took us 3 hours to get 10 drinks and 5 appetizers. 

On a side note, the food is mediocre at best.
