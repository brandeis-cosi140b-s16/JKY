The food here is nothing to brag about. I ordered the chargrilled chicken vampiro and it tasted bland. The sauces that came with it were bitter and ended up dousing my food with salt and pepper hoping it would taste better. The portions were smaller. I'll never come back here again. I felt I wasted my money.
