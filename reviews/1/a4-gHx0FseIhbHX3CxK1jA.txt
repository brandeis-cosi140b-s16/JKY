This Filiberto's was not as yummy as other ones. I don't know if it is just a difference in cooks but the food just didn't taste that good. This was the closest one to my work; I now have found other Mexican food restaurants by my work. Don't want to go back to this location again. I would gladly go to other locations though. Filib's makes for great drunk, and hung-over, food!
