Not the business.. If your stomach is growling and your hungry for some mariscos that are gonna hit the spot macizo..... Don't go there. Ceviche was decent at best, my shrimp cocktail tasted like it needed life. My girl got some botana that had lobster grilled tilapia shrimp wrapped in bacon shrimped fried in batter and said that all of it was bland.. I don't usually deprive my waiters/waitress of their tips but with this one I had no choice, I left a 3 dollar tip on a 50 something dollar tab. Horrible service and not quite hits the spot food. This is actually the first review I've ever written before this I didn't even have an account with yelp to write reviews I mean I've wanted to write reviews on places even when they were bad, but never did.. This place was so disappointing that I took the time out of my day to download yelp, create an account, confirm the account on my email just to come back to the app to write this long review.. And the only reason I did is because I don't want any other person that knows what a good marisco tastes like to walk in and settle with this place. Hope this was helpful...
