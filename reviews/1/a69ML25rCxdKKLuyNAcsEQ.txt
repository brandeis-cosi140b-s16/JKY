After eating at this place, I can safely say I am lesser of a man than I was before and I will never be the man I was meant to be. The bad service made me question my value in life and for a brief moment I felt as if I was an utterly useless piece of shit. Tomorrow I will wake up to the sun and feel no warmth. 

P.s. don't order the quesadilla. Its a taco with a piece of chip on top. I can take a shit and put a chip on top and call it a burrito and it would be the top order on the menu
