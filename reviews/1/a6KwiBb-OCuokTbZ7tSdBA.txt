Absolutely horrible. I wanted to say they did fine, because the reviews just trashed them and I was in and out within 10 minutes in the drive thru. After their machine refused to scan my card the first 20 times. 

Once we left, I checked my order, and of course it was wrong. I went in the front door and requested the jalape√±o honey chicken grilled taco that I ordered for a second time. And the lady told the people cooking and they say "it's on the grill right now" to me personally. After about ten minutes of me standing and waiting for one taco, while the rest of mine and my wife's dinner got cold, a manager finally approached the counter and asked what I was waiting for. Finally she asks the cooks and they have no idea what's going on. One cook finally double checks and says "sorry would you like this instead?" By this point I wasn't waiting ANOTHER ten minutes for the chicken to be cooked. So I said fine. For the next 3 minutes while I waited for THAT one to be made, I got to listen to them all laugh and goof off while my order was jacked up for a half hour. Never again will I give you the benefit of the doubt, Taco Bell. Never again. 

Find a new Taco Bell if you want decent service and dinner on time.
