Ok after reading the reviews here desided to give place a try god was I dumb! This place is a rat hole. We sat in the restaurant and it was just dirty, and it felt dirty. Service was extra slow. We ordered the mexican pizza and it came out with mushrooms. Now I am allergic I did ask the server what came on it and he never mentioned mushrooms so had to send it back. When he finally came back for our main order I ordered the tequila shrimp I asked about the mushrooms and he said no but it came with mushrooms... wtf said I was allergic I could see he didnt care. I am a server and a bartender and when my guest tell me they have an allergy to something I pay attention. My husband never got a refill for his soda glad I asked for water or he would have had nothing to drink. Avoid this place not worth it.
