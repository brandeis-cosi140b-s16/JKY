I still can't figure out why everyone likes this place. The food is not very good and the wait takes forever, not to mention food is overpriced. I have gone multiple times as others like this place and I've been asked to join. Something as simple as a burrito should always include rice and beans, it doesn't here. Even the meat is fatty and not very tasty. No R&Ts for me, I'd rather pay over $10 for a burrito somewhere else.
