Im glad its closed. Hoping the  new place will be good. My husband and I went for drinks and apps and got the chicken wings, well after consuming half of them we noticed that the one I picked up had literally feathers deep fried right on it. Talk about gross.  It is so dark in there that who knows what the heck we were eating was even chicken.
