Horrible...if you want to eat lunch then constantly go to the bathroom eat here I've been to a lot of Taco Bells this one gave me the runs within 20 minutes of having it I know it's fast food but WTF man something is very wrong if I can eat at other Taco Bell locations and not have this problem please fix this only positive here is they renovated this location so it looks nicer inside than others
