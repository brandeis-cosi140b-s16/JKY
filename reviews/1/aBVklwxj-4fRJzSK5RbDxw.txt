I can't believe my experience at this place   I have been eating there for YEARS.  I order the same thing and often pick it up to eat with family members.  Today I was charged $7.50 for approximately 6 ounces of the dressing for my two salads.  This is a new policy I'm guessing?  I was treated so poorly. I would think they would value my loyalty as a long time patron.  I'm not however willing to pay for dressing for my salads.  That's something I would expect to be included in the price of the salad.  Then they put the dressing for both salads in one container when they were being delivered to two locations. I guess another one of their new policies. I won't be returning. I will spread the word to my friends and family of the "dressing" policy and the rude way I was treated.  So long Lindos
