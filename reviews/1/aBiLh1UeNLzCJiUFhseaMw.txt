While I was ordering I asked the guy if there was anymore of the fajita mix. He turned around and grabbed the new batch of it and asked me which burrito was mine. I reached over and pointed at it and he slapped my hand and said rudely "don't put your hand over the glass." I was in complete shock that he hit my hand. I understand that it might be unsanitary but he could've said it nicely and left out the slapping of the hand. Pretty pissed off...
