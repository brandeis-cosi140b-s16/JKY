First, the staff does not listen very well or really pay attention to what the customer wants. More importantly, they tend to be very unfriendly and sometimes downright obnoxious with a flippant attitude. The food is ok, somewhat flavorful and a fair variety. However, it is expensive considering the size of portions. It appears they are trying to project an image of a more upscale, authentic Chipotle. However, what it really is, a cheesy, arrogant version instead. Although Chipotle itself isn't cheap, at least the staff is friendlier and portions are larger.
