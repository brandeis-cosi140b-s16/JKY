Every time we go we are more disappointed than the time before,  I believe last night was it for us.  They put about a teaspoon of chicken on my sons tacos and although my husband asked for light sour cream the girl behind the counter proceeded to glob on about a cup on his burrito.  When my husband nicely said that he asked for light she looked up and said "sorry" and proceeded to wrap his burrito.  Couldn't even crack a smile the whole time she helped us, and glared at my husband while we were paying.  Every time we go they put less and less meat in what ever we order, for one reason or another we are disappointed and vow to never go again.  Pretty sure last night we meant it.
