Decided to walk to grab some lunch since I live right behind this Qdoba, left my apartment at 10:55 ensuring I would be there after the 11:00 am open time. Got to Qdoba at 11:05, and it hadn't been open yet. There was another lady already waiting before I got there and I could see the lady inside running around getting things ready, I know she saw both of us waiting. They unlocked the doors around 11:12, no acknowledgment to me or the other customer or any apologies on opening late, us having to wait, etc. I wasn't even asked what I wanted to order or anything the lady behind the counter just looked at me and waited for me to say something. She continued to talk to the staff person in back while she did my order. I'm done with this location, the huge lack of customer service is such a turn off. I rather drive a half hour out of my way then come here again.
