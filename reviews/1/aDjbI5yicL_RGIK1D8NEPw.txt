Had family visit. Took my dad here on a Fri night to have a couple drinks. Found an unwelcoming door person. Place charged $7 to enter. 1) What bars charge cover anymore 2) If you are gonna charge why not the typical $5 or $10. Does it really have to be an odd ball number like 7. Nothing special was going on in there.
