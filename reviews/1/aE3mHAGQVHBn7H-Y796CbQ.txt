READ REVIEWS PLEASE! This Taco Bell drive thru plus customer service ( even the manager doesn't seem to care) IS THE WORST! Go to another. This is the 5th time my boyfriend has tried to order his meal & drives home (15) min to find out it's wrong!  They won't give u the $ back but not even IM Sorry or here is a free meal for next time so you come back?? Again they DONT CARE. It's Taco Bell go to another. We are calling the head manager to tell our story as well......most likely won't care either.
