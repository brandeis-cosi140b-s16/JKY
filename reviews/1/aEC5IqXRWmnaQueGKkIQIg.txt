I went there once and will not be back. I ordered the steak fajitas and was disappointed firstly when the plate came out as just a plate and not a sizzling entree as per usual with fajitas. However, the taste was much worse. The steak was of the lowest quality I've tasted (it looked boiled more than pan seared, and was mostly fat). There was so much salt on the fajitas that I couldn't even eat them. That being said, our waiter was a nice guy who gave us good service, but the food that i got was too bad to make it worth going back for me.
