was there 9/27/2014 in evening.  Place was dirty, I should have known better from the start.  Ordered a BBQ Burrito and my GF ordered Beef Wrapped Burrito.   The workers acted as if they couldnt wait to go home, just could care less.  the food looked bad, originally was going for steak but was so dried out it should have been thrown away.  Make a long story short two days later and we both do not feel good.  we have been fighting over the bathroom since we ate there. that bad honestly. probably the worst I have had in few years, needless to say I will never go back to that one, or any of them.
