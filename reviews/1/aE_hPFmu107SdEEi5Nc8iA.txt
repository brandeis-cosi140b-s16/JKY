I am so, so, so disappointed that I have to write this review.  I've been looking forward to Martinez Taco Bar ever since I read it was coming to the Aliante Marketplace.  I waited a couple weeks before trying, hoping that any issues would be worked out.  I'm so very sad to say that this place is awful, and I will not be returning unless some major changes occur.

The restaurant itself is small, but clean and nice.  The decor is a little cheesy, but bright and cozy.  I like the outdoor seating options.  The woman at the counter was nice, and the cook was super slow.  It took about 15 minutes for 2 tacos, and this was after the dinner rush on a week night.

I ordered 2 street tacos, one steak and one pork.  The meat was literally just gristle.  It was so bad that I couldn't tell the steak from pork by taste.  Also, the toppings were pathetic.  Maybe 2 cilantro leaves and 4 pieces of onion.  So stingy.  The tortillas are store bought and they were gross.  Something was also way off with the temperature.  I took 2 bites from each taco and threw them away (and I HATE wasting food).  

Maybe after some good quality control (the soda machine had 3 of 6 flavors "out of order") and more generous, fresher ingredients, maybe this place can be saved.  For now, I'd eat anything at Taco Bell over this place.  Thumbs down.
