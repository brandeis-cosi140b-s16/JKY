The first three times my wife and I had visited this place a couple years ago, it was pretty good. The meals were good and the service OK. The final three times it got progressively worse each time. The carnitas my wife ordered went from moist the first few times, to dry as shoe leather the last few. Service went from semi attentive, to completely ignored. Missing food items that we were told would be right out...20 minutes later nothing.  Waiter standing around while we are wondering where the hell or beans were. The actually should rename it Casa Toilet as 20 minutes after leaving, your stomach will be demanding a visit to the throne with no room for leeway. Sign of old, bad oil in fryer. This happened almost every time eating there. Again, it has been at least a year or so since we were there but nothing of our experiences would get me back.
