I went in thinking it was going to be way better then Taco Bell but im afraid I was wrong! I ordered a quesadilla and it was small and not worth the 6 bucks I paid for it I also got a chicken taco and it was DISGUSTING. Dry and no flavor at all. I asked for sour cream and they said they didn't serve it. They are seriously over priced for what they serve!!
