This used to be our favorite mexican restaurant in the phoenix area. However service was awful during our last 2 visits. We usually don't care at all about decor but the place really needs some effort put into it. Its just looks flat out dirty. Our server hardly acknowledged us. My husband ordered the fajitas, received his plate & then sat there for 15minutes waiting for the tortillas. All 4 of our stomachs were upset after so I'm pretty concerned with how clean they're keeping things. I don't have any desire to go back.
