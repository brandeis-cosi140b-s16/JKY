Alas, it's finally over. It's the night where you have that final blowout fight with your significant other and you realize it's just not worth it anymore. We had the Steak and Chicken Fajitas and the portion size was enough to starve a small child. After calling over the manager, I realized that this location is doomed. He proceeded to argue with me over portion sizing and couldn't level with me that having a Fajita portion so small that you could only make 2 small tacos out of it was just not right. His only solution was to not charge me for the "extra" portion they brought out, which was also laughably small. 

I've been going to On The Border since I was a little guy, and truth be told this experience just ruined it for me forever. Every time I go back the portions get smaller. The good news is that there are plenty of other locally owned places here in the area offering reasonable portion size, and care for their customers. 

On The Border, R.I.P.
