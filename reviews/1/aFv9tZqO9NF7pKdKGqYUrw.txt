This restaurant is by far one of the worst places I've ever been. The waitress was extremely unpleasant. I felt uncomfortable even asking her for something because of her attitude. When our food arrived, it was cold. I'm not talking lukewarm, I'm talking cold, and soggy. The cheese was put on as an after thought. Bagged cheese that had not melted, so just nuggets of hard, bagged cheese. Absolutely terrible. I'm surprised that I didn't get food poisoning. The only good thing that this place had going for them was the outstanding  bus boys. They were working their butts off. They actually provided 99 percent of the service. The waitress took our order and then stood in the corner and death glared us the whole time. Long story short, do not go. This is the first review that I've ever written, and my experience was that bad that I had to share.
