Went for a late night snack, the person taking the order could not get it straight, when it finally looked like he had gotten the order right, they gave it to us.  The cheese queso was so oily and greasy it was disgusting, I asked for a chicken queso with just chicken and cheese no veggies and got a load of onions and peppers.  My brother in law got a steak taco that was soaked with water.  I will never eat at this horrible location again and we are fans of Robertos.  Honestly all these mess ups it is hard to believe was coincidence considering I never have had these troubles at the other.
