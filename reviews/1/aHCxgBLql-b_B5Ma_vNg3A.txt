The shrimp cocktail was the worst thing I have ever tasted. The ketchup was too much and the 6-7 shrimp that were included were too small. We ordered 2 shrimp cocktails and 1 drink and the bill was over $28.00. Definitely not worth it and will not be coming back. Also, the cashier was not friendly at all.
