I hate to say it, but this is some of the worst Mexican food I've ever had.  Edible?  Sure.  Mexican?  Not a chance.  My hopes were high; with a name like "Two Hippies," I thought it would be a funky little place that served addictive street tacos... (I've never actually had *authentic* street tacos, but I KNOW they're not supposed to taste like THAT.)  

My friend tried the three taco combo; one carne asada, one green chili, and one fish taco - all on the low end of mediocre (though she couldn't even stomach the fish taco).  My burrito tasted like they wrapped bland beans, rice-a-roni, boiled chicken breast, and one ton of chopped onions inside a Mission tortilla.  Don't get me started on the chips and salsa either... Mission and Pace for sure...

The horrible part about all this is that the service was REALLY wonderful!  I think it was one of the owners who served me, and it was probably one of the most pleasant experiences I've ever had service-wise.  She had a distinct Midwestern charm; unfortunately, that's also what the "Mexican" food at Two Hippies suffers (severely) from.  

VERDICT: Go to Rosita's or Juan's instead...

(In response to Bryan L's callout:  1)  Yes, I'd take Bertos [or ROSITAS, or JUANS, or Chipotle] anyday over Two Hippies Beach House, and I'm not afraid to say it.  And 2) Everybody [staff and kitchen] speaks English at Two Hippies because they're white as ghosts.  It's like eating at a Chinese restaurant owned and run by Wisconsins.  When English is NOT the primary language of an ethnic restaurateur, to me that's a wonderful sign.)
