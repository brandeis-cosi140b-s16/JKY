By far one of the worst fast food places! So disappointed.  Service is sucks. I don't appreciate how I work all day to earn $$ and go for a quick bite and get ripped off. It is not my fault you didn't finished school or dropped out and have no education and now your stuck working minimum wage . But don't rip other people off by the crappy service and crappy food.
