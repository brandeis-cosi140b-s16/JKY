RUDE A** WORKERS! Went here today w/ my sister n bf, we decided to go in to order & received nothing but rude ass customer service. One worker questioned my sister n the way she was dressed. N to mention it was a 100 degrees outside n she was dressed in shorts n a tank top. Not no booty shorts w/ her ass cheeks hanging out, REGULAR SHORTS. Whether that person was a boy or girl he/she said "r u trying to look for a husband is that why you coming up in here dressed like that" WAY TO GREET A F'n customer huh?! Plus the cashier was scrolling on her phone in front of her customers. N the cashier also commented on the amount of food we order "wow that's a lot". Never coming back to a place that don't know how to give good customer service.
