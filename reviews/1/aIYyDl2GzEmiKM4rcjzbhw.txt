Can I give it a zero?  Valentine's Day reservations in Scottsdale made a week ahead of time.  12:45 a phone call comes in on Valentine's Day. We regret to inform you we can not open due to severe understaffing.  

At this point do you think I can get another reservation anywhere?????   Thanks Fogon for ruining Valentine's Day!
