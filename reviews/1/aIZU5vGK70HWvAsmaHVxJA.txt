I wouldn't go back. We tried it because of a groupon, but it just wasn't good. Very slow service, the waiter got my order wrong- i asked for rice side and he brought beans, I specifically asked if the enchiladas were spicy and he said no, but they were too spicy for me to eat . My husband's entree was brought cold and our beers were hot. Wouldn't go back.
