If it were possible to give this place 1/8 of a star I would. Quite possibly the worst burrito/food/slop on a plate that I have ever consumed in my life. They cover your burrito in a liquid cheese that's absolutely disgusting without telling you that's how it comes. I ate this while under the influence of alcohol and am this strongly opinionated on how bad it was. Imagine if this was eaten while sober? I would suggest eating the gravel off the side of the street before entering this place. I'm going to stop typing now because thinking about this atrocious burrito is making me nauseous.
