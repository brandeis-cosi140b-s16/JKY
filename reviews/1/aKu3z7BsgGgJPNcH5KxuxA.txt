Honestly this location is the only Chipotle I have ever received poor service at.

When they put sour cream in my burrito after me not asking for it due to the allergic reaction eating it would cause, they were very rude about me saying I did not want it.

When I asked to speak to a manager they were even less helpful and pretty much told me my service did not matter to them.

This one poor experience was enough to make me never return to any Chipotle location again.
