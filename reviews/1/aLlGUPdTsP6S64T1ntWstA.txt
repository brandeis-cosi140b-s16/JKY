It has been 6 months or so since I've been to a Taco Bell.  Now I remember why.  This one was particularly bad.  I got a 1/2-lb. beef combo burrito, nacho cheese gordita, and a large soda.  
The name "beef" combo burrito is a misnomer; this thing had 1/4-lb. of sour cream in it, and the rest was refried beans.  There couldn't have been more than 5 little granules of ground beef in this crappy thing.

My order was $7.07 for two items and a soda.  I used to go to Taco Bell in California and get the same order for about $5.00.  I don't know what is going on at this place, but I'll never go back.
