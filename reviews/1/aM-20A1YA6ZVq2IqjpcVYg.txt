Ocho doses of salt, on my Yucatan.  This is the saltiest meal I have ever eaten and very same with the cream cheese on the side was so salty that I could not eat it.  I love salt but not the whole shaker.  Chef is not tasting his/her own food before it leaves the kitchen.  They are new and hope they come around.  Nice atmosphere but no drink deals after Happy Hour, this is sort of a turn-off for us.  Not really willing to go back.
