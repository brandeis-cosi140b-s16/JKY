Go anywhere else in this airport for food! Worst food ever. BLAAAAARG! My meat gobbling, bovine slaying, leather wearing husband ordered a breakfast burrito that was bland with tasteless previously frozen and hard homefries and I had a nasty vegan burrito. I get these whenever I eat Mexican and I have never had a bad one....until now. Disgusting. Service leaves a lot to be desired as well. Hubby's eyebrows speak to his extreme distaste..no Bueno.
