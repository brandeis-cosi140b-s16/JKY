Went here last night with the family and got dinner to go. Wife got a #7 Carne Asada combo and I got the #4 shredded beef tacos. While we were eating, wife found a plastic disk in her beans, and an old, nasty french fry in her guacamole. There was not a piece of meat that wasn't gristle, so we threw most of hers away. Mine, on the other hand was just bland and tasteless, or so I thought. I spent the night wanting to throw it all back up as it sat like a festering rock in the pit of my stomach. Do yourself a favor, go to the Chipotle down the road; it may not be "authentic" but at least it is edible.
