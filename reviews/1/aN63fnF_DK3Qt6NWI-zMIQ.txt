Horrible, consistently getting my order wrong. Adding things I don't ask for on simple burritos, like a half lb of carrots& beans on chorizo burro when I asked for rice and cheese to be added. Have found plastic in horchata. Overall horrible attention to detail save your money and go somewhere else!
