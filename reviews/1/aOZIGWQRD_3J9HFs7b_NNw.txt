I have been a yelp reader for years but this is my first review. When I first moved here a long time ago, this was the first bar I ever went to in old town. Service was great and fun an d food was ok. Went yesterday to catch the last game and have a few tacos. Wasn't busy but you would think that the bartender with the detroit hat and shirt on was dealing with hundreds of people. He was absolutely rude to everyone. I miss the old dos that had people that understood they were in the service industry.
