Try try try again, 
Had to ask twice for ice tea. Then it tasted like it was yesterday's, you know that funk like the tea pot wasn't cleaned out the night before. 1.99 for watered down gross. 
Fish tacos, 2 for 5.99
I opened them and they were loaded with lettuce and salsa. Oh and cheese was sprinkled in there. Looked for the fish, and oh there are some little tiny chunks mixed in. I taste it and no kidding it was yesterday's salsa because it didn't taste of the salsa on the table, it had that over night onion flavor left over thing going on. yuck. Guess they were going for the big taco look of something??  Wasn't fish!
Maybe one piece of fish diced between the two. I looked! 

All I could think of was that i didn't have time to go else where or I would have got up and left. 

I have to say I expected more based on reviews. I wouldn't go back if someone offered to buy! 

FYI, the bus boy that blew me off, dropped cups because he couldn't quite get enough fingers down the tops of glasses to hold on. Food handlers card? Mmmmmm

My waitress was nice++ once she found me.
