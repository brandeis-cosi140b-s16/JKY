Normally I love chipotle and get good service at the Zocallo Plaza store. But tonight I came in to this store and the one girl couldn't figure out how to make 1 cheese & 1 steak quesadilla or seemed like she didn't want to make it & asked a guy who was just getting off work (end of shift) to do it. Then the mngr told him he had to go but I got my two quesadillas, chips and guacs, made it to the register and the cashier dumps all the food in 1 small bag! 2 nice chilled guacs thrown upside down on top of 2 hot quesadillas with a bag of chips on top! So here's what really got me: I asked for a larger bag and was told "the manager does not allow these to be given out unless you are buying at least two salads or bigger/more items"! Really??? I spent $14.51 and I am refused a larger bag??? The cashier was not budging, repeated her manager wouldn't allow it - I even offered to purchase the damn larger bag! So then I requested & got a 2nd small bag which I transferred the 2 cold guacs & chips into myself! Chipotle, you need to get a grip on your franchise operations - stores like this bring your rep waaaaay down! I won't be back here EVER!
