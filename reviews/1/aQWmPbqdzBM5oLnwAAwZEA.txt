I want to give zero stars but the minimum is one. I don't understand how this place has a high rating. The food , the service, and the cleanliness of this cafe is horrible in each case. My daughters food literally had a bug in it and was completely uneaten yet we were still charged full price for the food. 

You can absolutely tell the food all comes from cans from the sauces including the salsa and the red chile and green chile to the meats. Yup they use canned meat here. We paid close to seventy dollars for quite honestly close to the worst dining of our lives. Do not waste your time or money this place needs to be shut down.
