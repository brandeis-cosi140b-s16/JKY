We have given this place two opportunities within one month to get their act together. Sadly, I took out-of-town guests there tonight and was embarrassed beyond belief.
The food is mediocre at best.  The hostess rolled her eyes when I asked that we be seated on a different section of the patio.  Are you kidding?  The pork carnitas was inedible, overcooked and dry.  The "award winning" Margaritas were just okay.  I will give kudos to the side of guacamole.  It was pretty tasty.  The whole place needs a facelift...menu and decor.  Even our server seemed like he was just plain tired.
