Plan on taking ear plugs so the concert style music does not make one deaf. Forget having any conversations unless you use sign language . The staff is helpful but it wasn't their fault the the fried fish tacos were not a big hit. The fish was strong and smelled before arriving at the table, and were over cooked. The shrimp tacos had no flavor, but I find that everywhere. The beef ones were good and the black beans .
After going to Tacolicious in San Francisco nothing in Phoenix really stands up to what they should taste like.
