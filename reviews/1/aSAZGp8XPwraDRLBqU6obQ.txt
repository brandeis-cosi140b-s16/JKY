Okay....your restaurant is in an airport.  If someone is sitting at a table, odds are they could be waiting for someone else who they're traveling with.  Hence, the following greeting may be deemed as inappropriate:

"Excuse me sir, the tables are for patrons only.  Do you plan on ordering anything?"

"Yes, 75 year old smoker's cough raspy voiced bad makeup lady.  I will have a water while I wait for my colleague to arrive."

Then the oversized bookmark that is your menu, with 8 items to choose from.  At least making a choice of what to order wasn't too difficult.  Light lunch sounds good, so I choose the Southwest Chopped Chicken Salad.

a) The 3 pieces of dry chewy chicken breast were "sliced".  Not so much chopped.
b) Plastic utensils?  Really?  You charge $11.99 for a crappy salad and can't afford to pay someone minimum wage to load silverware into an automatic dishwasher?
c) When 2 people dressed in business attire are having what appears to be a fairly involved discussion, it's rude to interrupt with "Can I bring you your check?", even though the paper plates are visibly empty.  You have 30 open tables.  You don't need to turn them over that quickly.  

I know I sound like I'm expecting a lot from an airport restaurant, but step up your game a little.  Next time I'll just get my 5 hour old slice of pizza from Sbarro and at least get a smile from the cashier.
