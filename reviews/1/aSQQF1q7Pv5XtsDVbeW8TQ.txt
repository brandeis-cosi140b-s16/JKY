The past few times I have been here they have screwed up my order. The first time I asked for a shrimp burrito with no green salsa it came out with it, the second time asked for the same thing and got a fish burrito, and this past time asked for the same thing and got a shrimp taco. Which was disgusting. The service has gone down so much here. They are always rude to me when I go in and never can seem to get my order right. Would recommend going somewhere else if you would like your order to come out correct.
