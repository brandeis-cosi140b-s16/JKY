We used to frequent this location after it opened at least once a week. It was our go to for good, fresh, clean Mexican food. However it went down hill in the last 5 months or so. It used to be a lot cleaner, now the tables and floor are always dirty. The service is slow unless you order at the register. The patio was so dirty last time it smelled like rotten food and after waiting approx 20 minutes for a server we just got up and left. No one even noticed and they only had about 4 tables full inside so it's not as if they were busy. Won't go back for a while, maybe they will get their act together.
