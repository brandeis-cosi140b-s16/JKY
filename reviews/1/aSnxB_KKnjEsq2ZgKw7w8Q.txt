Girl at the drive thru was practically yelling the whole time.When I tried handing her the money, she said ;wait hold on and then she slammed the window. To top it off no sauce, napkins or receipt.When I stayed at the drive thru window to ask for them, she just stood there and look at me and walked away.Never going back to this place since I called the manager but she wasn't very concerned to hear me out. Totally rude!!!
