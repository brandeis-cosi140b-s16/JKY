If there was a zero stars that's what I would have given.  This used to be our go to spot for Mexican.  They used to have the best salsa and chips and their Carne Asada nachos were the bomb. We were bummed when they closed the one on Alma School and Queen Creek but we moved from that area and would hit up the Baseline location.  But after last night, unfortunately we will not be back and we had a party of 8!!!  The chips tasted like grease, the salsa was nowhere near as good as it used to be and the Carne quesadilla I had was just gross.  My husband had the fundido burrito and his stomach was really messed up from it. It didn't even look right when the server dropped it off. no bueno
