Ordering a Nevada Burrito ? You might want to check before you leave ! The employees play the innocent no engliśśś card but in reality they will take advantage of you by not putting steak in your burrito. Not only has this happened once but it has happended twice!! I have confronted them twice and they act like they haven't done anything wrong. Looks like robertos is the real winner !
