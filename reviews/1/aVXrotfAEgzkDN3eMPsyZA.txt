This is a very popular (Why?) casual restaurant where you order at the window and wait to be called to pick up the food.  We ordered a total of 4 street tacos; 3 with dried out pastor and 1 with tasteless pollo.  Our plates included industrial taco chips, tasteless Spanish rice, ugly refried beans.  I did enjoy the complimentary carrot and onion escabeche.
