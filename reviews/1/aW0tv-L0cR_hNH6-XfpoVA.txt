In the past few months,Mexicasa has gotten just horrible,not that I thought they were ever good,they have gotten worse.However,it did force me to looks else were,and I found a gem a few miles down the road in Beechview,Casa Rasta,it is BYOB,and great food. Also in Beechview,at IGA grocery store,on the sidewalk,the best tacos I've ever eaten.Homemade,all fresh ingredients,delicious, and only two dollars.I suggest you find a curb to sit and eat,the tacos don't travel well,gets a bit soggy when you get them home.
