My wife and I went there for the first time last night.  They seemed to be doing well.  We were sat immediately and were acknowledged by the waiter.  We were not that hungry so we split the Nachos El Patron.  The menu says it comes with the following: Chips, Cheese, Beans, Chicken, Beef, Lettuce, Tomato, Guacamole.  We ordered it without beef and with cheese only on half since my wife cannot eat dairy.  The food was brought in a timely manner.  Cheese was only on half.  Okay.  No lettuce, No tomatoes. No Beans.  No Guac.  And the chicken was cold!  I called the waiter and he took it back.  When he brought it back, they only added the lettuce to it.  No three strikes here!     We will never go back there again.  And this really is a shame since our favorite food is Mexican!!
