Holly cow this place sucks! First of all I was hesitant to walk in because someone had been shot there a couple of days ago. I orderd three tacos, carane asada, carnitas and pollo. They all tasted the same with a small flavor... the salsa sucked to... it felt like I was pouring lame tapatio in green and red slasa on my taco. The service was ok, but this place did not sell me. Not coming back.
