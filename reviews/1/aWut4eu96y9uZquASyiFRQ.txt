Is the food good?  Yes, most of the dishes are pretty good (I have to disagree with those who like the veggie tamales).  Here's why I'm giving this restaurant one star:  On  a Monday night with a party of 3, we asked to sit on the patio.  There was only one other party out there - the place was almost empty (the patio is quite large).  We asked to sit at a round table, but were told no, that was reserved for larger parties.  Now I totally get that policy, but on a Monday night when it was almost empty?  

So dinner was fine, however...I was shocked to look at the bill.  We were charged .95 cents for the small dish of pico de gaillo we asked for in addition to the salsa.  I ate half my dish and so asked for a to-go box -- they charged a takeout fee of .25 cents.  I also asked for a small refresher of the cheese dip so I could enjoy my takeout -- they put 2 tablespoons into a container and that was an extra charge of $1.95.   

I know containers cost money, etc., but most restaurants build it into the price of the meal.  We thought it was a lousy business model to charge "extra," so although we enjoyed the food, we were not happy with the restaurant` taking every opportunity to nickel and dime the customer.
