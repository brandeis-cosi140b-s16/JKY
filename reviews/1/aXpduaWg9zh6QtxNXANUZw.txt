Sadly really wanted to enjoy this place with the ideas of fresh non GMO foods etc that they have but they have a small variety only one Vegan choice - veggie tacos / others they could strip off the cheese or sauce & if you want chips & salsa it's extra . We left - we wished we could have liked them but when you are promoting healty options think vegan too !
