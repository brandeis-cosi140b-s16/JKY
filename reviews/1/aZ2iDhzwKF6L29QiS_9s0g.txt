We really enjoyed the food.  I had the fish tacos and they were really good.  Chips and Salsa were pretty good.  When it came time for the bill we though we were all square.  The server came back and told us the Deal Chicken Coupon had already been used.  We have never been to this restaurant, so we had never used the coupon.  The manager said it was used the day before in a Phoenix location.  We had to pay the entire bill, even though we had invested in 4 coupons for this restaurant.  The restaurant told us to contact the other restaurant to do some leg work.  They told us to contact Deal Chicken.  Deal Chicken told us to contact the restaurant.  Then Deal Chicken called the restaurant when we demanded our money back from Deal Chicken.  Within 5 minutes our Deal Chicken Coupon was good again.  Why they could not figure out that they had made a mistake when we were there waiting for about 30 minutes listening to them tell us we had already used the coupon.  We got our money back from Deal Chicken.  We will never go back.  They never even attempted to contact us to at least apologize.  Treating us like scam artist's instead of new customers!  Too bad we were looking forward to going back after finishing our meal.  Service was not the best.  For anyone who does not know Deal Chicken is a place where you can buy coupons for extra value at the business.
