The taco salad was surprisingly tasty, but is served in a paper-lined bowl instead of a tortilla shell bowl. 

My main complaint is with the servers. Minutes after I left, I realized the waitress had picked up my personal pen with the check after I signed it. It could have been an honest mistake. When i went back in, I couldn't find her in the restaurant and was treated rudely by two other servers when I asked for assistance. One refused to even tell me the name if the waitress that had just been working our table. 

In the end, after standing around with no help finding my property, I had to leave for my flight and chalk this up to another Las Vegas Stupid Tax. The fleecing of the flock continues... I hope she uses my nice pen to fill out her next job application.
