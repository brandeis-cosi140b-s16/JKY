Horrible!!! I haven't been here in ages and now I know why! I ordered the chicken sandwich and I can't even describe what the meat was. I took a bite into it and it had the weirdest texture. At first I thought it was a tomato but then I realized it was the chicken. It had some sort of rubbery skin looking thing on the chicken. GROSS all around!
