I've been to this Marisco place several times, and I've passed the absurdly loud music since the food I've been served has been decent. On today's occasion. My Aguachiles (the red kind) not only smelled rancid it also tasted like it. My husband was in need of a new refreshment and it took 15 mins. For someone to pass by (not our waitress who was too busy flirting with the band members at the bar) for us to ask for a refill. Needless to say, I did not finish my Aguachiles and now I'm kind of scared of getting some sort of infection later tonight for eating some of that rancid raw shrimp. I would not be coming here again since  this goes beyond a bad waitress, if they are serving rancid raw food here I can only imagine. Also the bathroom do not have stalls, the "door" is a shower curtain! Nope, will not be coming here! PEOPLE BEWARE!!
