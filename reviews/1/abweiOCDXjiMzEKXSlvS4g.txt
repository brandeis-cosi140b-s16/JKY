Pissed customer! I walked into Moreno' s with my two young daughters and had  a seat.  Three of the servers looked directly at me, no menu or greeting. Two men walk in about a minute after me and have a seat. A server takes menus and gets their drink order right away. I got up and left. Be more observant Moreno's!!!
