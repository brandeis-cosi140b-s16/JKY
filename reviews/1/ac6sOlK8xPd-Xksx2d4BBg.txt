I'd heard great things about this neighborhood joint so I thought I'd give it a shot since I was in the mood for Mexican. 
The experience started out lousy. The sign says "Please wait to be seated", the place wasn't all that busy yet we stood there ignored for about 5 minutes before we were told to seat ourselves. 
Once seated, we were brought chips which were hot and fresh but we didn't get any salsa to eat with the chips until we'd finished about half the serving. 
I ordered the carne asada taco combo plate. The rice and beans were ok, but my carne asada was very similar to whatever Jack in the Box fills their 99 cent tacos with. Whatever it was, it had less flavor than the Jack in the Box tacos and cost much more. My carne asada didn't resemble meat at all. 
The food sucked and the service was substandard, I will not return.
