Had a solid 1-star experience at this location that will keep me from going back.

Dining room was pretty messy, which I can tolerate. A rude and inconsiderate staff is something different.

Suffice it to say that I left to wash my hands and came back to discover that food I left on the counter had been thrown away by an overzealous employee. When I discovered what happened I was told there would be no replacement, but instead was directed to where I could get my food out of the garbage can.

So eat at this Chipotle if you want to eat a restaurant where the staff thinks it's ok if you eat garbage.
