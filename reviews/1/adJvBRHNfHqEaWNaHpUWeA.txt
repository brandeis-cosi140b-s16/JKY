This is not really a Mexican restaurant. It serves dishes that sort of resemble well-known Mexican food, but the similarity stops there. 

The six dishes our party ordered were insipid and dull. Even the guacamole did not taste right. When I ordered 'sopa de tortilla' from the menu, the waiter did not know the menu well enough to know what I was ordering. The top-shelf margarita tasted like lemonade. Stay away!
