Cheap yes, good, no.

The flour tortilla was dry and hard, the meat was overcooked in the carne asada burrito and the rice and beans were soggy and gross.

I felt sick after eating here and I only obliged because J said he wants to relive his college days where he'd eat there all the time.  

Thankfully I didn't die.  Felt like it for a few hours afterwards though.  Come here at your own risk.
