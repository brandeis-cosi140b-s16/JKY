The last time I ate at Cabo Fish Taco was probably 2007 or 2008. There must have bene a major management shift because after eating there tonight, I would never return again. The server was way too laid back and paid no attention to us at all. The chips and salsa are bland - ordered some cheese dip to kick it up, and the cheese dip was just hard, melted velveeta. We ordered the steak and fish tacos. Both were mediocre, at best. I had the mexi slaw, which was nothing to write home about and my husband had the jalepeno-chedder mashed potatoes which were cold and just plain awful. Our beers were VERY over priced as well. Overall, I will never go back there again. It's a shame, because a few years ago, I remember it tasting much better. Perhaps being on a food network show got to their heads because the quality has gone WAY downhill. Ugh.
