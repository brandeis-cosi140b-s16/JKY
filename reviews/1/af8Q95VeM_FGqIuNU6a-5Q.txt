For a dining experience you won't soon forget, I can't recommend Bitzee Mama more highly.  Unfortunately, you'll remember it for all the wrong reasons.  
Where to begin.  First off we showed up on Monday night for dinner.  Closed.  OK, so I checked their website which says they're only open until 2 on Monday, then Tue - Sat until 9.  Showed up Tues at 6 for dinner.  Closed again!  So on Wed I called & found out that they're open Thu-Sat until 9.  I suggested they update their website and got a grunt as a response.  If I hadn't had a LivingSocial I would have written this place off but the $10 was non-refundable so I figured 'it can't be any worse than making a "run for the border".  
I ordered the green chili beef chimi and my GF ordered two shredded beef tacos.  I have to way that the incredibly small amount of meat was a pretty tasty morsel, but that's all it was - a morsel at each end with a small green chili in the middle.  And how do you screw up refried beans?  I can't even begin to identify whatever it was I was tasting.  Rancid fat?  Even tho my GF ordered the tacos ala carte she got the dinner which included more of the rancid fat refried beans and rice that they had somehow managed to infuse with a sickly pinkish-orange color.  
In short, even tho I got the whole thing for half price I still felt ripped off.
