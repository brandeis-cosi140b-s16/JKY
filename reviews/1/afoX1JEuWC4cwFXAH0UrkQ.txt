I do not recommend this food truck!  Ordered the Argentine Quesadilla.  first took about 30 minutes to get my order.  When I got back to my desk I realized that some ingredients were missing.  Was supposed to have moz cheese, grilled steak, chimichurri, grilled red onions, field greens and potatoes.  Well, no chimuchurri or potatoes to be found and what was on the quesadilla was minuscule.  The outer 2 inches of the quesadiilla was nothing but flour tortilla.  And by the way when was leaf lettuce considered field greens?  Very disappointing.
