Not only did these assholes give me carne asada burritos when i ordered pollo, they looked guilty while I was ordering it so instead of just telling me they were out of chicken they gave me beef which I havent eaten in over 10 years thinking I would fall for it.  I will never give them my business again. Think before you act assholes.
