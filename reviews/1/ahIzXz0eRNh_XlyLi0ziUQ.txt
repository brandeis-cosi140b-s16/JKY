Rude, slow, unresponsive, and incompetent staff from the hostess to the server.  The service is about as bad as I have experienced anywhere.  It took us nearly an hour to get one enchilada each after being seated.  My wife bit into her chicken enchilada and was greeted by several chicken bones.  The rice was mush on one side of the plate and almost raw on the other.  The sauce for my Sonoran Enchilada was awful.  The only thing I can say positive is that the salsa was good and I eventually managed to get a refill on water before I left.  Still not enough to earn anything more than the minimal score possible.  This one goes on my no-go list.
