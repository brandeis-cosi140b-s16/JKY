The restaurant was empty, but the hostess told us it would be about a 20 minute wait, so we decided to sit at the bar instead. It took at least 15 minutes for anyone to acknowledge that we were there and another 15 minutes for drinks. I flagged the bartender down and asked for dinner menus, which he should've already voluntarily given us. He acted frustrated that I asked and told me I would have to hang on because he was really busy. After another 25 minutes of waiting for a menu, we paid for our drinks and left. We were sitting right in front of the beer taps where they saw us every single time they went to pour a beer. It wasn't like we were off on a distant corner of the bar. I'm a very patient person, but that was all I could handle that night. I will never be visiting this place again.
