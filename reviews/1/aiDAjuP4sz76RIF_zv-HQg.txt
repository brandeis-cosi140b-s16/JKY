Having been in Anthem for 7 years and watching this place go through various owners and even before Ocho Locos was here, I've come to the conclusion that this place is cursed. Never have I had a good meal here. My most recent visit involved flies everywhere, and overpriced, mediocre food. I ordered Vegetarian tacos that consisted of a copious amount of guacamole, an equal amount of lettuce, and cheap shredded cheese. (After having to send it back for getting the wrong food.)  I took a couple bites and couldn't finish it. I sent my food back and went to Taco Bell.
