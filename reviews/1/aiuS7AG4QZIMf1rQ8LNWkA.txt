The food is good when they at least get your order right. That NEVER happens. I think I have had a correct order maybe once. And no, it is not a language barrier since I order my food in espanol. It is super annoying! un burrito con guacamole de Arizona, pero por favor sin cebolla? Ugh.... Will be awhile before I go back for an onion filled half cooked potato filled burrito.
