I so wanted to like this place because it is so close to our house. Probably the worst Mexican food I have ever had. Nothing we ate had any flavor or tasted fresh at all. Beans tasted like they came out of a can. Shredded beef was bland and tasteless. While we were there I heard another table complain to the manager about the food. To my amazement he recommended another restaurant down the street for them to go to where they might like the food better. It's as if they have just given up. Oh and the prices are ridiculously high. Avoid Avoid Avoid.
