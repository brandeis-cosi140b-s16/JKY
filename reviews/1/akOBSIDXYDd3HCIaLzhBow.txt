Just when you think airport food is improving-along comes Taberna Del Tequileria. Blue corn quesidilla with pork so dry I had to drown it in salsa (in the stupid little cups - like another reviewer pointed out) in order to choke it down. 

$10 'house' maragarita, come on-it was a flavorless glass of ice slush...

Glad to get back to my 'home' airport (PDX) where they have real restauranteurs running their own places that take pride in what they serve!
