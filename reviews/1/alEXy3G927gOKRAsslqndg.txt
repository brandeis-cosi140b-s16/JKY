-Food is decent, not the best Mexican food. It's about $7.75 for a 2-item combo during lunch, no rice or beans. Taco shell was dripping with grease and the meat was room temp. That's appetizing, right?

-The WORST waitress EVER!!!! We thought she was either drunk or on some sort of drugs! We tipped the bus boy instead. It was too late to ask for a different Food Server...we were stuck with her. 

-Waitress told us she was going to clear off dishes at another table and will be back to take our order, even after we were sitting there waiting already for 10 minutes and told her we WERE ready to order....we saw her chatting with another table. Who does this?

-The Busboy acted more professional than the Food Server. She was "in-your-face" patronizing, rather a very "fake friendly", and acted like someone who had been drinking, it was really uncomfortable.

-Chips and salsa were good.

-Not a good value for the price/portion.

-Hostess was friendly. 

-I would NEVER eat here again, esp since there are so many other choices for Mexican food in the Valley.
