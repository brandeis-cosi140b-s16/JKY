I am very sorry to have to write this review as this WAS one of favorite restaurant's to go to.  My wife and I both ordered a Chili Relleno from the Mix and Match menu.  It was terrible.  I learned from the waiter that they have changed their sauce and the rice had no taste.  It seems that they are now making the sauce in house not rather than purchasing it from their commissary.  I've been a long time customer since 1995.  Sorry to say, I will not be coming back.  With crappy sauce like that they've pretty much have destroyed the entire menu.  There are too many other restaurants to go to throw away my hard earned money.  Adios Macayo's.
