I was excited that there was a Mexican joint that I can walk to. I went there twice for carne asada tacos and california burritos and both times were a sore disappointment. I love gringo Mexican food that's greasy and indigestible but the flavors were horrible. The meat was way too salty and  the salsa was bland and undesirable. They got the gringo tortilla right but everything else simply tasted wrong. Then I was really bummed when I bit into my burrito and there were no fries. Where was the california burrito that I had ordered?! Ah what sadness!
