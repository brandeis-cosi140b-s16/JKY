My dining partner and I got takeout, which was our first encounter with Los Cabos.  Normally we would dine in at a new restaurant before getting take out, because restaurants deserve  some leeway in terms of food quality when it comes to takeout due to the presentation and vehicle ride home.  That being said, Los Cabos was the absolute worst Mexican Food I've ever had the displeasure of eating.  I've had much better food at Mexican chain restaurants. We started with guacamole and chips which I can't really say anything negative or positive about.  It tasted no better or worse than the usual guac and chips.  The salsa, however, was watered down and had no taste worth mentioning.  I also made the mistake of pouring the pico de gallo on my tortilla which was also extremely watery. I had the Carne Asada, and the meat tasted like stringy jerky.  I'm surprised I was able to chew off pieces without first cutting the meat across the grain. The Mexican rice that accompanied my dish was mediocre, and the refried beans were much too salty.  I tried a few bites of my partner's Chili relleno, which tasted like mushy, old, frozen mozzarella sticks.  She also had a beef taco and chicken tamale, both of which had a few morsels of meat and were almost entirely filled with lettuce.  We rarely ever throw away food, as I'm very fond of leftovers, but we couldn't bring ourselves to save what was left of this terrible meal.  There is no chance we will ever eat at Los Cabos again.
