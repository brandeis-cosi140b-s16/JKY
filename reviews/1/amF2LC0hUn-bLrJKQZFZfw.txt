Terrible. I walked in and they guy behind the counter tells me he needs 3 minutes. I'm in at an odd time (3:00 PM) and see he is working hard to clean the grill. 18 minutes later, I place a to go order. Included was a veggie burrito wet with red & green sauce, with rice & beans on the side. He must have misunderstood because I get home to a tortilla with lettuce, cheese, cilantro and onion. How have I lived so long without this creation? Uh yeah, because it is AWFUL. Rice had NO flavor, beans were tge runniest I've ever had.
I usually avoid meat, but something was telling me to add on to my order. I was curious how the fish taco was. Um microwaved to heat up and ALL BREADING, equally as terrible as everything else I tried. Didn't have more than a second bite. Chicken taco was totally bland and dry.
I had to order "Grandma's recipe flan" 3 different times and it still got left out of my order. Ordered & paid for separately, it was the best part of my meal (which had been comprised of 6 bites of various yuck). Maybe it is an approach to flan I wasn't used to. Not particularly coukd although it came from the cooler and the texture was sort of mealy and not a bit creamy...

What a waste of $13.00....
