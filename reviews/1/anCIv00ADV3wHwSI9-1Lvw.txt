Good afternoon how are you? 
I would like to inform of my not so pleasant experience at your chipotle located on Rock Springs and Lake Mead in Las Vegas, Nevada. I arrived at the location around 2 o clock they were pretty busy so I didn't mind the little wait they had, but when it was my boyfriend and I turn to order I ordered a steak bowl and he ordered a chicken bowl. I was told it'll be a couple seconds before the steak was ready because they had run out. There was one gentleman who also wanted steak before me so they brought out this little bit that looked like it barely had been cooked, I told them it was a little to undercooked for me so I asked if there was anyway I could just get the next batch and Carmen rolled her eyes and said no that's how it comes. I go to Chipotle all the time and have never received meat as raw as that. I took a photo for you guys to see if you would like. I told Carmen I didn't appreciate her attitude and she started laughing I then told the manager about her attitude who also started laughing. Very unprofessional and I will probably never return to this location again.
