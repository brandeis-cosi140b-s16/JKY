I was excited to try this restaurant as it had good reviews and I liked the made-to-order aspect to it. I even drove out of my way to go there. However, I was incredibly disappointed. A veggie burrito is just lettuce, tomatoes, and onions along with the beans and rice. That is not a veggie burrito!! Other places have peppers, sauté onions, etc. and salsa and jalapeños are included in the price elsewhere. If you don't order ahead for pick up, be prepared for sub-par service. Also, make sure you tip or they become incredibly nasty!! I'll stick with chipotle, qdoba, and pancheros.
