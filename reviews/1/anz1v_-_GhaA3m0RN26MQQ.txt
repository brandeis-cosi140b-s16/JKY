Downgraded review after finding several rocks in my pinto beans. Told waiter and he did nothing. He did not appear to notify cook. He did not take it off the bill, nor did he apologize. For the those who don't know, a rock in pintos indicates poor food prep, and can lead to a cracked tooth. Boooooo.

This is a real shame because otherwise, I have loved every dish and every visit to Sabor Queretano.
