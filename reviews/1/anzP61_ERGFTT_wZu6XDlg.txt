Needing a quick bite to eat, I thought I would try a new place in my very own neighborhood...big mistake!
I ordered the chimichanga plate and the beef burrito plate... the rice and beans were good, and they were generous with the guacamole (only plus), but it is what was inside that disturbed me... 
shredded beef, stringy onions, and canned tomatoes cooking on a stove in a pot for an entire day (maybe longer)... then shove that into both the beef burrito and the chimichanga... 
I don't think so!
Reasonable prices, friendly staff, and great beans.. but I can get that at home from a can. 
Pass on this one, trust me. sigh...
