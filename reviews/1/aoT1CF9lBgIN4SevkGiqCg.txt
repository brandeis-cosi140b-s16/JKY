Dropped by this place cause I needed a quick bite and it was new to me.  Well needless to say I ate and left.  I don't even remember what I ate, but it was food for sure -- I think!? Okay gotta stop being mean.  Let's just say it wasn't anything "new".  Nothing I couldn't have ordered say from Rubio's or Chipotle.  Yo quero Taco Bells please :(  The place itself was decorated with some traditional Mexican portraits and paintings in an industrial-like setting.  Kinda odd, but whatever tickles your senses I guess. - Enjoy!
