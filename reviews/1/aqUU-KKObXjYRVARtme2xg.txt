If I could give less then 1 star I would. I got the chicken Zaba bowl to go on my lunch break, only to discover a red roach in the chicken, this after I ate half the bowl. I took it back to the manager who, after looking at it for a solid minute, told me over & over it was a chili as he tore it up in his hands. It definitely was not a chili. I have uploaded a photo for people to make their own conclusion. Everyone I've shown agrees with it being a bug. I'm so disgusted, I will NEVER eat there again. So gross!
