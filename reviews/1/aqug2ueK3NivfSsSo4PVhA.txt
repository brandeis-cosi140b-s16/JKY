This place sucks. Their rolled taco is mostly tortilla with some trace amounts of beef. How freaking cheap do you have to be to not fry up fresh and meaty taquitos? Seriously, if your only two options are Felipito or Del, then just starve because it will be more satisfying. 

I'm going to use the rest of this space to pitch a lucrative Mexican restaurant proposal to some local entrepreneur. The fact that Cafe Rio is the best choice for Mexican around UNLV is pathetic and you CAN compete with Taco Bell on campus. There are many CA, TX, and other ex-pats here that don't recognize Taco Bell as food. Get a lease at one of the many strip mall vacancies around campus that can support a kitchen. Keep it simple, just offer big tacos, filled with fresh shredded beef, chicken, pork, and maybe adobada. Price it under two dollars, don't worry about the small margins, you'll make it up in volume. The only other things you should offer are burritos, again, simple, tortilla, meat, cheese, lettuce, rice, and beans. They should be under five dollars. One other thing, make fresh guacomole and chips. Price those nearly to cost of inputs, you will be pricing them similar to the canned guac that felipito offers so you will end up drawing anybody who would have gone here and making money off the inevitable tacos or burritos they order. Only offer specialty Mexican drinks like orange bang, agua frescas, or sugar cane cola. Don't fall into the delusion of selling syrup and water for high margins, you want keep up image that you only offer the best and tastiest. 

You put this together, you will make money. Thousands of college students will be at your door.
