The first time I went to this place, I would have given it 5 stars, but every time I went back, the food was worse, and the last time it made me sick. The first time the service was great, the last time, service was awful. I won' t go back. It makes me very sad because they had a chicken dish with some kind of jalape√±o creme sauce that was fantastic, last time I could not even recognize it as the same dish, and like I said I got sick after eating just a little of it. When I asked the waiter to take it away, it tasted bad, he snatched my plate and stomped back with the check. He never offered to get me anything else or remove the item from the bill.
