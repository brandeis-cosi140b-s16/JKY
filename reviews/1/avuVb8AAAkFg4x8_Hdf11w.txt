They pretend to serve Mexican food. Ordered a "Torta de Carnitas" (by itself an aberration). A semi-open face sandwich came with French fries smothered in jalapeno slices. Another aberration The carnitas were pulled mushy pork and not oven baked chunks as they are supposed to be. And they topped the "carnitas" with a fried egg!
I will return to this place sometimes in 2054...
