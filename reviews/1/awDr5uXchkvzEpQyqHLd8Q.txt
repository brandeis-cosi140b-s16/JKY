BF wanted Chipotle so we got some to-go. 

I got Barbacoa when I normally get steak or carnitas and made a bowl with black beans, rice, the different salsas, corn.

A few hours later I was throwing up. 

Hot sauce and rice is not fun coming back up. Probably one of the worse throw up experiences ever.
