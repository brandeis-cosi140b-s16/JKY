This place is now  El Nopal Mexican Grill. I had the Burrito with Carne Asada.  Turned out to be a bean and rice burrito with a little meat. The GF had the chicken fajitas  and they were smothered in tomato sauce.  Picture and the discripiton did not say anything about tomato sauce.Green sauce on the salsa bar and guacamole have way to much cilantro in them. You don't taste anything else. Over all the meal was not very good. I think we will stick with Saborr down the street.
