Always a long line inside and in drive thru. All of the workers are incompetent . The good workers they get always somehow don't work there long (probably for good reason, they're too good for the job). This place is terrible. My food order is never right.  Never coming to this Taco Bell anymore. Tear it down and put in another Starbucks. Save us the trouble!
