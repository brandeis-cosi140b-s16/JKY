I really wish i had seen the poor rating on yelp before we decided to come eat here

the bad:

1.  we saw our waitress 2 times in the 2 hours we were there.  the first time was after sitting for 20 minutes waiting for her to come take our order, and the second time was after waiting 30 minutes after finishing eating to have her bring us the bill.  no checking up to see how the food was, or to fill drinks at all

2.  the charlie burrito tastes like cheeseburger hamburger helper wrapped in a tortilla

3.  there is some stupid lady who comes up behind you and tries to put a hat on your head without any warning or asking.  she almost ended up with my dinner knife in her leg when she just slammed the hat on my head



the good:

1.  the guy who brought out our food brought out the food

2.  the guy who made our guacamole made the guacamole



in reality, there is nothing good about this place and i will not be back
