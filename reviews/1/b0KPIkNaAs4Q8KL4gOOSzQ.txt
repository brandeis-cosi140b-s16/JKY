I order online since I was at work on a 30 minute lunch break I ordered a chicken salad which by the way had 3 pieces of lettuce, and like 5 pieces of chicken I ordered it with rice and they didn't put rice on it very little portions and a SALAD WITHOUT LETTUCE! So upset since I love Chipotle so much. Never ordering online or from this location !
