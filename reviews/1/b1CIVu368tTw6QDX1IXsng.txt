Disappointing, to say the least.  Mediocre (cold) chips and salsa.  Good Margarita (I upgraded to Milagro tequila).  I asked my waitress what she recommended (beef fajitas) and tried everything on the plate, but I will not be bringing the leftovers (lots!)  home.  They can put in the garbage or "re-gift"!!!  I don't understand how/why this place has so many great reviews....no atmosphere, run-of-the-mill Mexican food, average service.  Will not be returning...too many really good Mexican food restaurants in the valley.
