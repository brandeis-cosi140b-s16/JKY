I don't think I've ever given only 1 star before, & I admit the enchiladas were decent, but service was -10 stars. 
Asked to have a quesadilla on corn & not flour tortillas because of wheat allergy and to start them first 'cuz he was very hungry but all the food came out at same time - quesadilla in flour & wrong sauce on the enchiladas. When I brought up the problem she said quesadillas were only on flour (couldn't say they would not make it on corn before having us pay for it?) Then when my remade enchiladas were done they just sat on the counter until I happened to look up & the cook pointed to the counter by the cash register/order taker who had no inclination to let me know my food was ready. Later when I asked if there were desserts she just looked at me until I repeated my question & motioned with her head towards the freezer with ice cream bars. Guess words required too much effort. 
So I advise going somewhere else unless the whole rest of the city is out of food.
