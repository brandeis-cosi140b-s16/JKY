I've been to several On The Border locations and this one was not up to par. We arrived around 5pm on a Sunday with larger group of 6 people with two guests who are deaf. Our server was less then please to deal with what seemed to be an extreme inconvenience to her. She was short with us and seemed to be jarred by any sort of request we had. 
Our meal took quite awhile and no soups or salads came before the meal. We asked our server about the salad our family member ordered and she said "well your order is already up so I'll have to bring it with everything else". Once our dinners arrived they were cold. I had a cheese crisp and chicken tortilla soup. Both cold, I told our very irritated, hurried server that it wasn't even warm and she took back the soup I told her I wanted to keep the cheese crisp because I was very hungry and didn't want to eat without my party. Once she (actually it was two others who brought out the orders - our server seemed irritated by us and made little effort to attend to our table) returned w my soup and my sister in laws soup they were beyond hot, I was shocked they would bring it out like that. My chicken tortilla soup had little to no flavor. The crisp was fine for it being cold, would have been good hot. 
We had to ask multiple times for waters and drink refills. My brother and mother split chicken fajitas and they were cold and dry. 
It was just a very blah, uneventful (but annoying) experience with bland cold food. Not the normal experience I've gotten from other locations.
