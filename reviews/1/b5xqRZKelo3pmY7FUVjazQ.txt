Went to Zaba's for this first time at this location seeking a good burrito.

The staff here is not friendly. No greeting, no hello or thank you.  I can
Sum up what they give you as being very skimpy I especially the proteins.
The guac. Was extra which was not communicated to me.

Rubio's is much better than this place and they give you free chips. Actually,
Every other a Mexican restaurant is better than this place.
