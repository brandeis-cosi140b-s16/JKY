Within 15 minutes of eating all five of us felt sick  the salsa bar tasted three days old had a pure acidid taste from the spoiled tomatoes. Decided to continue and try the broiler fare and wish we didn't the fish tacos were hard not over cooked hard but tough hard like the fish was old. Everything else just tasted like salt.  The margaritas are not margaritas (tequila and lime) but instead tasted like watered down skinny girl wine.
