I've been a taco Mexico customer for 3 1/2 years and the tropicana location was my favorite, so when I saw this location on charleston I was excited..... Till I walked inn was not greeted and felt humiliated when the cashier tried to explain to me about drinks.. We all know what Jamaica is of coarse and she was rude, management was just the same when I tried to ask about how come there Asada taco almost tried to kill me when I choke on the hard meat, when I tried to talk to a manager they only spoke in Spanish and did not look at me directly poor customer service food tasted like they just recoiled it and didn't actually make it, place is falling apart and not clean and the manager in black who spoke Spanish to her cashier told her not to give me her name because I have no need to have her name and then tell her to tell me her name is Maria...... I am Hispanic and not rude I was calm about very thing but the  staff and management were completely unprofessional and I refuse to ever go back or recommend my friends and family I refuse to let anyone eat at this establishment that does not know how to properly cook good Mexican food!
