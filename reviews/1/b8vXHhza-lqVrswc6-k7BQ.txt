Horrible!  I asked if they had nachos, she told me she could give me a bag a chips and I could get some cheese whiz from Charley's subs!   Say what!??  WTH cheese do you use for the tacos??
Then when my 12 yr old ordered a kid meal she laughed and said " that will never be enough food" not everyone needs to eat 2 tons of food!  Seriously, just avoid this place!!!
