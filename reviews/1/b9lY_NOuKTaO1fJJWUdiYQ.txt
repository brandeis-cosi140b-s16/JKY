Don't let the $2 sangrias fool you.  Mediocre food and HORRIBLE service.  We sat at the bar most recently this past week and let me just say the bartenders were much more interested in chatting with each other than getting the free chips and salsa (had to ask even AFTER we ordered), had to BEG for more alocohol - what is the problem are we interupting your social hours guys???!  BLAH - I got fish tacos and they were fine - really I could have saved a lot of money heading to Taco Bell and get a six pack of Heiny instead of putting up with the aggravation of trying to eat here!
