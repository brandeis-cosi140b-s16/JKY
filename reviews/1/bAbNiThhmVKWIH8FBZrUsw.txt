Went to diner tonight because my family and I were craving Mexican food so we chose maycos not only was the food bad but the service was horrible the only good service we received was from the buss boy and he wasn't even our waiter. We had order a plate of fries they weren't cooked all the way there was about 15 fries for 3.99 there should be more we told the manager about it what does he do takes the same fries and microwaves them comes back with the same amount of fries but a new plate why not just make a new order instead over cooking the fries to where none of my family members could eat them I work with food and I know my manager would have made me make a new batch of fries and also our cheese crisp was burnt, worst service and food never going back! Never again!
