I love Chipotle, but this Chipotle manages to be consistently bad. Food quality is sub-par. For a while, they somehow managed to have defective bowls that would break due to moisture saturation by the time I got the food home (which is all of 2 minutes away). And speaking of to-go orders, this is the only location I have been to where they utterly refuse to make your online order until you go to the pick-up area. This usually means at least a 5 minute wait while they make your burrito right alongside whoever came in the door last. At which point the cashier may or may not try to buy off your irritation with a free soda, which never quite does the trick.
