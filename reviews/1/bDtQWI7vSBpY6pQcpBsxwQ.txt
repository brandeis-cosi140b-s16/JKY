I've been coming here since 1996. The prices have gone up, and portions have gone down. The staff gets worse every year, and the food quality has too. I almost feel bad that I'm talking badly about this place, it's such a landmark...but I have to be honest, it's just not as good, and the staff has a lot to do with it. The last two times I came here, they messed up my order, and when I told them "that's not what i ordered" they snipped "that's how it comes".
...wtf? No "let's check your order" nothing. And not to mention most of them act like they can't read...really, I think I'm done
