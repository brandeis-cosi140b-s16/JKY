Can never complain about the food. But the food isn't worth it when you have a careless, rude and lackadaisical  staff. The line is always longer then normal stores. The staff is always rushed and never personable not to mention half the time they skimp on portions and when you ask for more they have an attitude about it! Had to throw my burrito away after finding a hair in it!!
