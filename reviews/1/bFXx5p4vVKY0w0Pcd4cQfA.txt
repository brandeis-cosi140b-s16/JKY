This place was straight up N.A.S.T.Y. 
I am prior military so I have eaten some not so good meals. I'm not a picky person. I think you can pretty much doctor up food to be edible....that was until today! I took one bite of my tostada and I refused to eat anymore. I literally was grossed out and by the time the staff noticed our table, I wasn't even willing to order something else. I was disappointed.
