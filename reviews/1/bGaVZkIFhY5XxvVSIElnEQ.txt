We had lunch here after shopping at Caesar's.  I had the taco salad with beef and while it tasted OK at the time, I had a severely upset stomach all afternoon!  My wife had no problems with her meal (an avocado and chicken stack) so perhaps it was just bad luck.  The service was bad, the prices were too high, and my wife's $14 margarita was served in a plastic cup.  Meh, no thanks.
