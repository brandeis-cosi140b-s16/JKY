Usually you can't go wrong at any chipotle, and the first couple of times were pretty standard. The last time I went, my wife and I realized the chicken was pink, undercooked. We showed them and they didn't even offer us a free dish, a refund, and didn't tell anyone else that some if the chicken was undercooked. They didn't even apologize and walked away from us just to remove the current bin of chicken. Got to give them 1 star just for that.
