Paid $16 for 2 disappointing street tacos. They were on one corn tortilla with meat on one box then the other had the toppings thrown in that box. If I knew $3 Tacos meant 1 taco on a single tortilla, I would've gone to Garcia's Mexican restaurant paid $11 for 3 street tacos with rice and beans. I will not be ordering from a place that left me hungry after almost paying $20 and unsatisfied. I don't recommend, Just go somewhere that will serve you appetizing food instead.
