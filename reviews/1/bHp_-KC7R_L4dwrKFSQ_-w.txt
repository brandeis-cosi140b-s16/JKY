This place is gross. I've been a few times with coworkers that love it, and have been disappointed every time. Every meal I've had has obviously been nuked in the microwave, with my most recent experience looking like they had accidentally put the pico on the plate BEFORE sticking it in the microwave, so it came out a steaming pile of tomato-ish sauce. If you do happen to do go this place, get something that has either been grilled or cooked fajita style...that's the only way you will be eating something that you'll know is relatively fresh.
