I've had my share of really good, slap your nana good Mexican food. This wasn't it. Granted, I only had a fried ice cream and horchata, but the chips and salsa lacked flavor and the icecream was far overpriced for what you got.
The whole reason I'm actually writing a review, however, isn't because of the flavor of the food, but rather the atrocious service we received. First off, when we walked in, we didn't know that it was essentially an open seating, so we stood at the cashier looking like schmucks. It took about 5 minutes for someone to acknowledge us, and we still were never greeted.
Our server was the cherry on the pie. Took 10 minutes to get us our drink (order) & once he realized we were only getting dessert, he quickly turned rude & short with us. I get that as a server you are working for tips, so a smaller bill would be less important, but you never know how much you could actually get from someone.

Suffice to say, I don't plan on going back, at least (for damn sure) not to this location.
