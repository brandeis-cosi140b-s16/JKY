Let me make this review short and sweet. Edgar's is over priced and the food is not that good. The place does not get a lot of business and I don't see them changing their ways. I ate there for my fourth and final time the other day. At the height of the lunch rush a friend and I were the only people in the place. I was disappointed with my lunch and I won't be back.
