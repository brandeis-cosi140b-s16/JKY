This is such a random place... It appears to be a sit down restaurant, but once you walk in- you realize it's really NOT! 

The shredded chicken in the burros & the mini-chimis were awful. We literally spent $23 and threw it all away. 

I hate to write bad reviews- I really do, but I had to do it for this place!
