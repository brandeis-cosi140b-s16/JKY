We had a terrible Wed. evening.. at this restaurant.  We were here twice last year and enjoyed ourselves AND the food, enough to want to return.  We are snowbirds here for a month, and wanted to take a friend out for dinner.  First off... service was terrible, we sat out in the patio.  She took our order for drinks first.... never came back for a long time... drinks came.  Then waited FOR-EVER for her to come to our table to take our meal order.....  had to catch her eye... she arrives to take our order for the food.  It was cold outside, so we asked for the heater to be turned on... wasnt working... Meal came, sizzling fajita was not sizzling, all of us thought the meals were bland....  then comes in a miniature horse sized dog.... stretching out on the floor.  Is this possible???  Hygiene people.... think. 

And the fork I had was tin and almost bent when I cut into my enchilada.  I think it was from the gold rush days haha
