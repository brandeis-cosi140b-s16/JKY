Ordered a beef taco combo and a burrito combo. The taco was greasy and not appealing. I didn't even attempt to eat the other one. Halfway through my boyfriend's burrito he found a wooden stick inside. Not cool. Overall a bad experience at this Roberto's. Don't think I will come back here anytime soon.
