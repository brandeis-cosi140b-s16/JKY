We have been going to Guedos for years. On a recent visit I think it was our last.The place is filthy. What may have once been shabby chic is now disgusting. Torn burlap hanging from the walls. The food was barely edible. To top things off we had a strawberry drink that was $5!!! each!! The so called service at the register did not bother to inform us of the price.
Last time try El Sol up the road if you want good food, low rices and a clean place to sit.
