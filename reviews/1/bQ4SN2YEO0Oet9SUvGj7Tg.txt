I live in the area and I have been to cocomo joes and now Asados numerous times. My wife, myself and two friends had the worse service this evening there, and it seems like a trend. Our server was SHELBY. She ignored us most of the night in spit of it being a very slow in the restaurant. She messed up multiple aspects of my simple order. Advised me of taco tues special while ordering, which resulted in ordering more food, and then informed me at payment time that the taco special she advised actually excluded the specific tacos I ordered. She also judged my group for wanting additional salsa when only one was provided to a table of four all night. She blamed the kitchen staff for messing up the food order. When questioned about the pricing she gave me a great deal of attitude and left a sour taste in our whole group's mouths. Unfortunately this experience likely cost Asado our future business.
