Overpriced and over-spiced. Ha...seriously though, just because you make the food spicy doesn't mean it is any good.  Anyone can add chilies upon chilies and peppers to any food.  I enjoy spicy food, but the food has to at least be good first.  

Typical mexican food with chilies and heat added to a point of if anything did have flavor it is now hidden.  The interior is a mixture of someones southwestern nightmare and cheap utensils.
