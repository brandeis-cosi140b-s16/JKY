I came here on August 31st, my husband ordered three tacos, and we decided to eat there. There was no one else in the joint, and we waited about 5 minutes. The tacos came, and my husband tells me he ordered them soft, so I told him I would go and return them. I told the girl who was working and she said "he didn't say soft" I was taken aback so I told her if that was the case I would pay extra for giving us soft tacos. I think I was very nice. She then says " if I do that, I'll throw those ones out" so I say " so I'm stuck with these." Which she turns around and starts talking with her crew.  What makes this worse is I contacted the company with no response. It's one thing to have a rude crew, it's another for a company not to care. Terrible, I should of read all the reviews first.
