My wife and I went to this place. We went to drive thru it took over 5 min just to place an order. When we got to the window the cashier looked like she just got a root canal and didn't want to be there. She told us to pull up into a parking space. We waited for 10 minutes for our food. And to make things worse no forks or napkins in the bag. I had to wait in line for 10 more min just to get them. I've been to this place in the mornings and it's not near as bad. Don't go to this place at night, if you do be prepared for lousy service.
