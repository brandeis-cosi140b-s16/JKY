No, just  no!!!! There was a bone in my daughters beef taco, not only gross, but dangerous. The meat was questionable, what kind of meat is this? Where did it come from, why does it look like that? I didn't eat my burrito, it went straight into the trash. This is not real food, go to Taco Bell for much less and higher quality. 
Spent 30 dollars on food that no one would eat.
