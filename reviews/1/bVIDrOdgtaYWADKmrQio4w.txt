Went here last week with my brother, sister-in-law, and husband. We stopped by the MGM Grand food court for breakfast and all settled on trying their breakfast burritos. WORST DECISION EVER! The eggs were watery, they put way too much sour cream on it. The bacon was kind of tasteless. They wanted to charge 3.00 extra for potatoes. It ran us total over 50 dollars and none of us could finish it. It was that gross. We honestly should have just ate at McDonalds and saved a few bucks. Lesson learned.
