I am one of the friends who was with the recent reviewer Evonne L

I won't rehash everything she said before because she is 100% on point 

This is one of the worst places I have ever eaten at and it will be the last time

My tacos were so greasy and oily that I got a stomach ache afterwards. Disgusting, nor will I get into the clusterfuckery of a salad that my poor friends had to choke down and be charged 12 dollars for.

I didn't know that when you order a side a guacamole it actually means they take the avocado that already comes on your salad and chop it up and serve it in a side dish. Nice. Pretty pathetic.  I expect a place that calls themselves a Mexican restaurant to know what guacamole is.  

I ordered the beef tacos and got pork then the waitress said they didn't have beef but then another friend who had tacos got beef

Wtf? You can't just replace a food item without telling the customer . 
Do the staff even know the menu?

But I digress 

A 3rd friend who ordered tacos, received them so spicy she got such a terrible stomach ache that we had to get medicine, the menu showed no indication it was spicy. That's a big thing to miss. Major fuck up. 

The waitress failed to even write down our orders and low and behold they were messed up. Then the bill was wrong 3 times

As a former waitress I understand mistakes happen but no offence the place wasn't that busy and you should always write down the orders and actually check on your customers. 

Terrible experience. Do not eat here if you expect real Mexican food because most of it comes from a can. It's obvious. Try using fresh ingredients, that might help

This place is a joke. Do not waste your money.
