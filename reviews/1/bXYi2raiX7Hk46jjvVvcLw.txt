It has been a few weeks since our last visit.  The food is always fresh. My concern is that the tables are always greasy and have food particles on them.  Not wiped down. Also the drink area had soda spilled all over the prep area. The manager was very nonchalant about it when it was brought to her attention. Think it will be a long time before we go back.
