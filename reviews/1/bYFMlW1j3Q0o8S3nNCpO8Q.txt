Okay, this is a storefront type restaurant, so the tacky d√©cor can be forgiven.  What can't be forgiven is the filth.  The dining area is smaller than my living room which means there is no excuse for not keeping it clean.  The ceiling fans were caked with dust and grit as were many of the surfaces.  The floor was filthy.  Come on, guys, that place could be cleaned daily in less than 15 minutes. If the public area is that way, one can imagine what is in the kitchen.  I took my food home, opened the box, was craving Mexican food, but could not get myself to eat any of it, thinking of the general filth of the dining area and its implications for the kitchen.  I like seeing little places like this succeed, so I hope that someone decides to start cleaning this place on a regular basis.  No one likes clumps of dust dropping into their food from a neglected ceiling fan or wondering what the hygiene is in the kitchen.
