This place is a joke! $13.82 for a 2 taco combo and a drink! Tacos had a table spoon full of meat each then they add lettuce??? That's no taco they even tasted bland. If your in Vegas I suggest to go to tacos
el Gordo by downtown that place is amazing it's the first time I ate tacos that are super authentic they taste identical to their location in Tijuana!
