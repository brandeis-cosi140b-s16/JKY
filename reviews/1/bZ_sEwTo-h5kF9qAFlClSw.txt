Went for the 9 dollar fajitas and margarita.  We were very disappointed.  Arrived at 500 pm on Memorial Day and the place was busy.   We placed our order and watched for 45 minutes the bartender next door grab every fajita dish that the cooks made, clealy our order came out twice and he snatched it away to give to newly arrived bar patrons.   At 600 pm we finally complained and at 615 we were given steak and chicken that tasted like it had been sitting out for hours.   It was awful and we became sick the next day.   I heard other patrons complaining as well about the bully bartender with the glasses.  Do not eat the 9 dollar fajita special!!!!!!!!!!!!
