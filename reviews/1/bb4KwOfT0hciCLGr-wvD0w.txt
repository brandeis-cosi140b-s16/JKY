I remember when LC opened their first place on 21st and Van Buren. The food was magical, the prices, even more so. 
Last week I stopped in for one of my old favorites, their green chile burrito.

I was sadly disappointed.
In an investigative effort to learn why I had yet to bite into a piece of meat, I surgically opened my burrito, spilling its contents out onto my plate.

It was like the shark autopsy scene from Jaws sans the license plate. 
I wasn't expecting the little Kintner boy to come spilling out, but rather, hoping for a few pieces of meat to go along with the green chiles. 
I counted 4 pieces of meat.
As I said, this was a huge letdown given my carnivore emeritus status and all. 

Three weeks ago, I visited their Missouri and 7th location for a bowl of Menudo, since they've always made it better than most.
It was a huge letdown as well. 
Overpriced and with more hominy than tripe, the service was poor too.

Other than buying their LaCanasta tortilla chips at our local grocers, I won't be going back anytime soon.
