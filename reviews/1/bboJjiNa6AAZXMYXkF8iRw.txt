Let me warn you now... Not the place to go for a cheesesteak (or any food for that matter). The person behind the counter had her baby in tote (runny nose and all). At the recommendation of Yelpers, I came in to try the cheesesteak. The girl cooking it picking up trash and what such... Not one person washed their hands (ummm... Gross). The bread dry and cracking, and hardly any cheese. The fries were freezer burned... And what should have given it all away.... I was the only person there during lunchtime.  I would not recommend this place to anyone. Excuse me while I go throw up!!
