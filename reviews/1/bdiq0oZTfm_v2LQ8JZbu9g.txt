I wanted to like this place, but there must be a reason that it is empty every time we go in (in the few times during prime time hours that I have went, this was the case). 

This last visit (and final), literally zero customers during lunch time on a Saturday....and it still took almost 20-25 minutes for a couple tacos and a burrito. The meat tasted old and like it was sitting out for hours. And, given that I've been up all night with incredible stomach cramps and the runs, I'd venture to say that it was absolutely the case. 

I'm calling their corporate/franchise office to complain as well as the city health inspector to complain about the apparent food poisoning. I should have trusted my instincts after the first bite, now I am paying for it still at 7am the following day. 

Save your wallet and your bowels the trouble. If you want cheap/fast Mexican, go to Filibertos
