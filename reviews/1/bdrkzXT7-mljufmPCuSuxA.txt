Honest review about the place. First problem, seated next to the door of the kitchen. The people had to walk in between 2 customers chairs to get in and out. They shouldn't have table at that spot. Overall they need to remove some tables from the place period!! Not comfy seating environment. The manager dropped a dirty fork on my friend's shoulder and didn't even apologize. We asked for a move, which took another 20 minutes because the host forgot about us. Finally they moved us to another table. The manager came smoozed with us after but he never acknowledged the fork incident. 

The food is mediocre, I ordered a $25 menu item which should've of been $11.99 at most places. It's very overpriced, these prices work for Manhattan Beach , CA for their original location, not Vegas. The food is bland and uninspiring, especially when we have amazing Mexican food here like Lindo, La Mojarra Loca...etc etc. To diners who love food, this is a skip!
