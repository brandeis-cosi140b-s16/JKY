The cashier was great, she was friendly and prompt. The rest is downhill. The restaurant itself could probably use a deep cleaning. The food took quite a long time to come out and my tacos were wrong. We take them back, tell them the issue.....wait....wait and wait some more. The tacos come out and they're wrong AGAIN. Same exact issue,  so back they go again. I continue to wait and wait again and the tacos come out correct but the chicken is pink. Over it. We just left, too irritated to argue over this terrible meal. I wasted $20, but I'll never come back.
