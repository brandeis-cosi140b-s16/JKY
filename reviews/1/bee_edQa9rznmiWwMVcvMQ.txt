I took a friend from out of town there yesterday for lunch 9/17/2015. We got there about 11:45
Ordered lunch I am sorry to say it was the worse lunch I had. The shredded taco was dry could hardly chew the meat the soft one was the only thing I ate on my plate the beans were terrible tasted sour the rice had no taste at all. The waitress was good but did not even ask if everything was ok because I would have told her they need to fire the cook. Don't understand with this negative feedback why they do something about it. I was really embarrassed taking someone here and the food was not even eatable .

iI was contacted by the manager Craig and told me he was sorry to hear about my experience and said they wanted to make it up. I will try it again and see what happens. I love there margarita's especially the Watermelon. I was glad that they took the time to address the issue that I had with my meal hope the next time will be better. Love Mexican food.
