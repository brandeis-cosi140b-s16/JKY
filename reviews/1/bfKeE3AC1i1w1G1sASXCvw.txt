The food here is not up to the standards of the other locations and the salsa is some of the worst I have ever had. It is basically just red water.  I have attempted this location about five times since it was so close to my home but every time has been very disappointing.  I have tried the regular tacos, rolled tacos and a couple burritos and nothing is as good as other locations I have been. I must stress again how bad the red sauce is, it is unrelentingly terrible.
