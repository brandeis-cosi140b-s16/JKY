Had the super nachos and added shrimp to them which were a dollar each. A total of 5 in an order which is pricey but didnt mind paying for. When i opened the box I found that all 5 shrimps were not cleaned at all which was disgusting. Also the beef used for the nachos seemed like the fatty bits not used when butchering beef. Very disappointing experience these nachos are very photogenic but not worth the money.
