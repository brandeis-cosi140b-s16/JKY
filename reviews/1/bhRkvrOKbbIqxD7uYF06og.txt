Im sooo angry and dissapointed with this place....I ordered a breakfast (chilaquiles)and the rice and beans were good BUT the chilaquiles were so tasteless and when I told the staff the guy told me.."THERES SALT" and just pointed to the salt..the whole staff was giving me a rude attitude..I will NEVER eat here and WILL spread the word!!!
