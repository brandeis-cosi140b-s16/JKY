I found a living bug in my food, and a roach under our table. Also the girl dishing rice scraped out the last of the rice in the pan which wasn't even a full serving but apparently it was too much work to add from the fresh rice, so I got jipped on rice. I guess it doesn't matter because I stopped eating when an insect crawled over my lettuce.
