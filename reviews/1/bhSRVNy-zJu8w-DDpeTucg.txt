First off this was my first time at this location and it was not a pleasant experience to say the least. We walked in on Mother's Day, no wait which was nice seated promptly. We sit down and table was dirty so I took out sanitizer wipes out of diaper bag & wiped table it was so filthy & black so this is where problem starts & gets worse. We never received our menus when seated there was a drink menu on the table covered in dried crusty food , our server came over after about 5-10 min & asked for our drink order I had asked if we could get menus he said yes we should have gotten menus while seated. my husband asked what they have on tap or what IPA's they have & they don't carry any so he was disappointed & ordered a water shortly after that our drink arrived & still no menus he asked if we were ready to order I said no you still never brought menus & he laughed & said I forgot. He brings menus over & I open up my menu & there was food that was fresh & dried stuck all over it at this point I had had enough & told my husband we are leaving if the restaurant is ok with clients seeing this god knows what conditions they are making food in so we got up & left. The health department should be notified of the filth this place has the ledge on the booth where we were seated had about 1/2 inch if dust & dirt stuck on it.
