The food was OK. Based on favorable reviews 5 people at our table ordered the margarita and we were unanimously disapointed. Our waiter gave us the check but did not mention he had included an 18% tip. I did not see it until I got home so he got a 38% tip. A bonus for him, but I would never set foot in the place again.
