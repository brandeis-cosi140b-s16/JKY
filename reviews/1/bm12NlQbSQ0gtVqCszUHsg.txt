We were so excited to finally get a Pollo Loco over here, but so far we've been extremely disappointed. The food is fantastic when we are actually able to get what we order. Three out of three times that we have been here they have been out of several menu items and one time were not serving chicken at all. They definitely need to get their stuff together!
