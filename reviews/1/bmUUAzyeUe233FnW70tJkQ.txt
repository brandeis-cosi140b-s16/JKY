I should have known better than to try Mexican food in madison, I live in CO and the bar is pretty high. I had steak fajitas. The steak was sliced into 6" strips and the flour tortillas were only 5", so there was always meat hanging out of the fajita and inevitably you were not able to bite through the meat so ended up with pulling a strip of steak out for each bite.
The tortillas...dry and nasty
Learn my lesson.  You are in Wisconsin, not the Southwest, avoid the Mexican food and go eat something the locals know something about.
