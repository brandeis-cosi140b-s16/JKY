I saw this place featured on Diners, Drive Ins and Dives, so I made it a"must try" on my next trip to Vegas. This place is located in a large plaza with ton of parking. The decor is beachy themed, lots of surfer stuff, the tables are a bit uncomfortable, the servers for the most part were attentive, however the cashier ( young caucasian female) was on the rude side giving every customer an attitude. They seemed to be out of a lot of stuff, which seemed odd because it was 11:30 am on a Friday, you would think they would be prepared and stocked with what they offer, everything I wanted to try was unavailable so I had to settle for the " Al Pastor". The meat itself was tasteless, it needed salt n seasonings BAD! I was hugely disappointed, my husband had the "Bombay Taco" that one was a little more flavorful. I gave this place one star because one of the servers was extra courteous and was extremely attentive with us, however I don't believe I would try this place again, specially not after hearing and confirming it was shut down because of health violation codes. (ewww)
