Greeted by the server when I walked in.  Ordered two tacos, shrimp and fish.  I got the el fish taco special.  I took my order to go and when I opened the box, it was so disappointing.  I spent $14 with a tip for two of the saddest and tasteless tacos ever.  
There was a corn tortilla, 4 baby shrimps, a watery cheese sauce and the other had a piece of fish with that watery velveeta cheese sauce.  

Man, this place sucks.  This place is way too expensive for what it is (for $1 menu items).
