I hate this Taco Bell!! I waited 15-20 minutes in the drive-thru and after I paid the Manager comes to my car and claims that my card did not work and had to pay again.... so I looked on my mobile banking app and sure enough i had a debit from "westaco" for the exact amount! The Manager was irate and finally gave me my food.... I WILL NEVER EVER go to this taco bell... and after several emails have not heard one work from ANYONE! I was so disgusted at the level of service I received and was nervous that the Manager did something to my food because she was so irate with me that I threw it out! 

Please go across the street to Filibertos or just go to Del Taco!!! 

I HATE HATE HATE the service here... and now I just hate Taco Bell altogether!
