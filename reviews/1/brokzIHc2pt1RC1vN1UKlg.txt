I have been going through the drive through of this place for a while and have always been pleased with the food. Never interacted with the staff much until today when I went in to place a large order of tacos, and Kaylee, the cashier gave me an attitude right off the bat and rolled her eyes when I asked to see the size of the large guacamole cup because I wanted to make sure I ordered enough. I was with a friend so I wasn't paying attention when she gave us order and left. I got all the way back home and realized we only had half our order. 

Upon returning to the establishment to request the other half of my order she immediately met us with the same attitude like we were inconveniencing her for their mess up!!! She went back and spoke to the chef, came back out and said absolutely nothing. My husband had to ask her twice if they were going to make the rest of our tacos and she responded with an eye roll and an a half ass yes. We were trying to speak with her to confirm our order and she completely ignored us then replied with the same nasty response. I have never in my life been met with such poor service. I understand that she probably doesn't make a lot of money or could have been PMSing, but to make ME upset about the way I was treated is saying something huge, because I hardly ever get angry. As much as I enjoyed the food, I will never return to this place again. The owner needs to re-evaluate and check their staff!!!
