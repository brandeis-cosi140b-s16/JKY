I frequently stop at this Taco Bell, and for the most part get decent food, hot and fresh.
Tonight around 10:30 pm after picking my son up from work we decided to go through the drive thru.  We live not too far and so there was no reason for the food to be cold. 
Honestly I have never been more disappointed and disgusted by the food we ordered. 
The bean burrito was ordered to have NO onions, there was a few onions and pieces of lettuce, the beans were scarce and dry and cold.  You would think that they prepared other food over this burrito.  My chalupa had very little beef and tons of lettuce...  Again COLD. 
We also ordered the cinnamon delights, which I'm just waiting for it to kick in and upset my stomach for the amount of grease that dripped out... These were also cold and over cooked, which explains the dripping grease.  It's making me nauseous. 

Don't eat there after 10:00 pm because it's apparent you will get the bottom of the barrel, as I'm sure they wouldn't want to have to prepare fresh food at the end of the night..  

If I had been able to go back, I'd ask for a refund of the $16 something we spent on  horrible food.
