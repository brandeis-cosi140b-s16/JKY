Absolutely NOT GOOD! I asked the waiter in SPANISH can I have barbacoa and he gave me chicken, mind you he spoke Spanish. The cooks have a hurry-up-and-order attitude that SUCKS and not very welcoming. Also, they are eating pieces of the meat while they are preparing your taco, that is VERY NASTY and unsanitary. I understand you have to taste your food as you cook it, but when you are licking your fingers in public, then wiping them with your sweaty forehead and then pick up my tortilla and start making making my food with your bare hands doesn't paint a clean picture here. 

Not to mention the AL PASTOR had no flavor, it needs one ingredient to bring out the meat. SALT!! in Spanish it's called SAL, doesn't matter what I speak to them, they still wont get it right.

This place sucks!
