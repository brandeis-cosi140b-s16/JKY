Over priced & bartenders who act like they are doing you a favor! Here for happy hour and ordered a beer at 3:05pm, the bartender asked for credit card, swiped the card at 3:07pm and charged us full price ($9.73 per DRAFT beer) . Absolutely no interest in eating here if they are this cheap on their happy hour, who knows what other shortcuts they take in the kitchen to make more $$.
