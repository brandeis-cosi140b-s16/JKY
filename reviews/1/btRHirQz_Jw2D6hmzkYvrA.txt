We were very excited to find a Groupon for a new restaurant( New to us). After seeing a movie at Village Square, we headed over. It was 9:30 on  Sunday night of Mother's Day. Seated and waited. And waited. And waited. Finally a small basket of chips and one small bowl of salsa was brought. We Waited. We waited. We waited. 15 minutes after our initial  arrival, a waitress asked if we would like to order drinks. It was not busy, at least 85% empty. After receiving our drinks, the waitress asked if we wanted to order. I stated that I was Gluten Free and if the menu item I was interested in was gluten free. She had no idea what I was talking about.  How does this story end? After waiting for her return when we said we needed more time (she was busy talking to friends who had come in) we laid our Groupon printout down and left.
