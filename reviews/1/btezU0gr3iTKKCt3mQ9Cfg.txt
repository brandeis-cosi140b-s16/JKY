DON'T GO!!!! I GOT FOOD POISONING!  

Went the evening of 1.30.13

Let me start off by saying if I could just rate our waiter I would give him 4 stars he was great, very attentive plus got our drinks to us in a timely manner. 
  
I ordered shrimp fajitas they tasted decent they were sliced in half so it should have been simple to cook it thoroughly. The rice and beans were barely warm, the black beans had a nice crust on the top of them from sitting under a heat lamp.  
  Anyways later on that evening my stomach was hurting after eating there. 
  I was up sick all night as well as most of the morning. Stomach and insides feeling bruised today :( 
  Long story short save yourself the money, time, and the nasty consequences by skipping this eatery.
