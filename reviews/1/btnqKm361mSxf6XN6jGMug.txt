I do not recommend this place.  I order a medium lemonade and my total was 3 dollars. And the Manger who took my order didn't give me a receipt. Later on that day, I checked my bank account and I noticed she charged me 90 dollars for a lemonade. I went back and spoke with the same Manger. She called me a liar and she refused to give me my money back. I even showed her my account balance and she refused to speak with me.
