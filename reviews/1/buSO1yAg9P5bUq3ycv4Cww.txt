Once a loyal customer to the NV UT and AZ locations, I'll never return to a Cafe Rio or recommend it to anyone again. 

Open your eyes, listen to your customers, check your Yelp reviews. Heck, check your dang feedback inbox! I've written twice to headquarters regarding their customer service issues without response. What's happened to your food quality, your once outstanding service and pride? Every single AZ location is absolutely horrible in every aspect. The strawberry lemonade machine has been broken for MONTHS yet you still try to serve stagnant lemonade that results in a cup full of iced pulp. 

I keep giving you second shots but now I'm done. Your food is sub-par at best. Over salted, under cooked or just plain out of stock. I won't even get into the absolutely ridiculous service. I shouldn't have to wait for your cashier to finish shoving a donut into her mouth before she decides to ring up my order. The manager is quick to insult you or roll his eyes when you attempt to bring up an issue. I'm done. Chipotle is better and fresher anyway. At least I can count on a consistent meal from them. The larger you've grown the worse your brand has become. Cafe Rio, nice knowing you.
