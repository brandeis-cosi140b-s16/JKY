As someone else mentioned.....Shrinking burritos! This place has gotten cocky and thought it could trick some of us long time customers. Not anymore. Too bad to, our family used to eat here twice a week for on the go items...As soon as I told others at a family reunion, we have all stopped going. Probably $300 in revenue a month we had spent there as a whole family. Might not be a whole lot to some but they lost 22-25 good solid customers now from us...Plus, this place could never get an order right. The college girl behind the counter was nice but could not hear a thing...Going down the street now...Will you ever get an order right here Los? Will you earn our business back? We are here to listen..
