You will have better food on taco night at your Mom's house, than at Don Ruben's.

People lauding this place as the best Mexican food in the Valley? Really? REALLY??!!! 

I had the Taco, rice and beans combo, my standard first plate at any Mexican food restaurant, which is my own personal test.  If said restaurant fails this test, I don't come back.  Guess what, Don Rubens failed pretty badly.  

The food is total generic Mexican food.  The chips were slightly stale.  So was the taco shell, which by the way, seemed like they went across the street to Fry's for their ingredients.   The shell must have been the Kroger brand because it was pretty nasty.  Same with the rice and beans.  I felt the food definitely did not justify the prices. 

The wait staff were not rude, but were definitely not welcoming or very attentive, and we seemed to wait a long while to both have our order taken, and have the food delivered.  

I do not recommend Don Ruben's
