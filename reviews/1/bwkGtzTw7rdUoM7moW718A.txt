Horrendous service and attitude from both waitress and management. I was expecting a Williamsburg feel (as I live in nyc) but unfortunately that's not the case. Extremely poor service. Do not recommend to anyone. Stay away. Also should add this may have been due to me being a minority as I was the only none white person in the entire place except the waitress. Disappointing
