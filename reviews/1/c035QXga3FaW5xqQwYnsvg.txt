Very disappointed. Heard of this restaurant on the radio we had a free day and drove up to wickenburg. Got there way after lunch so it wasn't busy. It took about 10 minutes for our waitress to show up. We placed our order when our food arrived it looked delicious. We both had the burrito with ground beef and green chili. Dove in and was saddened by the lack of flavor in the ground beef. The green chili was okay but had no heat at all.  Why have chili if it's not hot. The rice was dry but very flavorful. Our waitress well who know where she was because we didn't see her till we were just about done. I could have used another drink but didn't get one because now we were just about done.  Bathrooms are discussing to say the least. Prices are outrageous for the lack of service you get and the bland tasteless food.  When our waitress finally showed up with our bill we had our credit card already on the table as we had been waiting on her. She placed the bill down grabbed our plates and was gone again. Never to return.  So we took the check to the front. The person at the front was working with someone who said he was there earlier and was overcharged, as she dug through receipts she never acknowledged us standing there. Another waitress there was chatting with someone else and finish after 5 minutes she said oh I can help you with that and took our check to cash us out. I was never so happy to get out of that dump.   I would not recommend eating at this establishment.
