I have always been a customer at Azteca and I usually order the exact same thing. Tortilla soup with the chips on the side. Today I was really craving some tortilla soup from there. I offered it carry out which I never do but I was in a rush. When I got there I gave the person up front the money and I noticed my food was completely wrong. The actual water from the soup was on the side instead of the chips so I told them and they kept arguing with me telling me I was wrong! I asked them for my money back and they said they would not give it to me since I ordered the food. I kept on asking for my money back and the manager herself told me I was "badly educated". I told them fine and walked out with my change. Never got my food. Oh yeah and they charged me .50cents for a to go water. 
The manager should never ever tell a paying customer that they are badly educated. I asked nicely for them to give me my money back and thy didn't. I paid $8.12 for them to criticize me. Ridiculous. I guess my Azteca days are over.
