Actually, I haven't eaten there...I lived New Mexico for 8 years and was excited to try "The Best New Mexican Food" in Las Vegas, but after sitting down I was discusted to find that the table was sticky from food and drinks.  

We arrived right at opening and were the first patrons to sit.  My wife wiped the table with a wet-wipe from her mom arsenal and turned it over to find it black with filth.  Normally, a table with a little leftover food doesn't bother me, but this table was disgusting.  If they can't wipe their tables clean before they open for business, I can only imagine what their kitchen must be like.

We left before even placing our drink order and headed over to another nearby restaurant.  I will never go back.  Too bad, because the menu items sounded good.
