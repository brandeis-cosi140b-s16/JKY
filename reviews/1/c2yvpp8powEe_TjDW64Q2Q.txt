I don't often leave behind a whole plate of food I've paid for and look for a second restaurant for dinner. That's exactly what I did at Hussong's. 

My wife and I ordered chicken nachos, steak tacos, chips and guacamole, and tried all of their salsas at the salsa bar. 

My wife and I only ate half of a steak taco, three nacho chips, two bites of guacamole, and a few dips of salsa. Everything but the chips was terrible. The chips were just standard low end chips.

The nachos, chicken, and salsas can be summed up with the phrase, "what is that flavor?" For the chicken it was something red that doesn't quite taste like tomatoes. For the fresca salsa it was something that tasted like tomatillo but not, and was much stronger. For the hotter salsas it was something that reminded me of a mole, a deep rich flavor that clashed hard with the salsa. For the nachos it was a combo of whatever makes the chicken gross and something green that I have no idea what to compare to. 

The steak tacos were a complete joke. Easily some of the lowest quality meat we've had. Even by Mexican restaurant standards. We weren't expecting filet or ribeye, but this meat was just pure gristle and tendon. Totally unacceptable. 

Finally the guacamole. It might as well have been a bowl of cilantro. There was so much cilantro it was completely inedible for both of us. My wife looked at me incredulously when I called it "inedible". Sometimes when it comes to cilantro I can exaggerate a bit. So she took a bite, looked at me with a funny look on her face, and said, "wow, you're right: inedible."

In the end -- about 4 minutes after the beginning -- we got up, still hungry, and walked away from a still-full table of terrible food.

I lost $30 so you don't have to. You're welcome.
