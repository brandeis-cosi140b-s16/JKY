Ugggh.  That should be enough for this review but I'll explain a little more.  This place just sucks.  The food is mediocre and I'd rather eat taco bell for the price.  Why does everyone go gah gah over crappy texmex?  Oh it must be the margaritas, cause alcohol makes every taste perfect.  I will never waste another night trying to stomach this crap.
