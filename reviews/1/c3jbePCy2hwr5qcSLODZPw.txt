Totally fell in love w this place last week , then we went in today for Thursday night game .. Well the whole staff was different very sad cause it didn't compare to last weeks staff.. Not only did the bartender spill a full beer on my wife she had the balls to yell out to everyone we had a "whooping 16 dollar bill" it was happy hour btw .. She couldn't apologize or comp or take care of the fact she spilled a full beer on my wife , just in case I forgot to mention it .. Again not coming back again .. Parkway tavern wins again
