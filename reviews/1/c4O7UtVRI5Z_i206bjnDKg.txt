Please save urself some time and money... Skip this place if ur looking for food. At least breakfast... I've had better breakfast at 7-Eleven! At 2am! Drinks are OK, but how hard is it to make a mixed drink... Pass this place by and u will be a lot happier... Sorry to be so blunt, but it is what it is... And not cheap. I know it's airport food, but come on, how hard is it to scramble some eggs to order... And not leave in a steam pan for 3 days, and bacon? Can't really call that bacon.
