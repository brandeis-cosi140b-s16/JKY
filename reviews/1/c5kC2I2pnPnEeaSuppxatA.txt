We ordered a burrito from here which happened to have three wooden toothpicks hidden in the middle of it. Luckily I was able to find them before they did any serious damage, but I can't help but wonder, what if a small child had those in his food? We called the manager, but weren't able to resolve the situation since he could barely speak English. Very very sloppy prep work, and quite frankly flat out dangerous.
