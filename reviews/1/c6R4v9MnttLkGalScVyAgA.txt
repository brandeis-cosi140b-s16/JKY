I'm surprised so many people like this place.  I went once at lunch on a weekend.  It was totally dead at noon.  There was no cooking going on out in the restaurant at all.  I wasn't even sure of the purpose of some of that equipment out there.  It appeared to be left over from a previous restaurant of which there have been several in this location.  We did get a lot of chips and those weren't bad.  I ordered an enchilada and it was served in a skillet with a hard crust of cheese on top.  Too much for my liking.  I only ate about half and left it behind.  

Overall, i wouldn't go back, other places to choose from.
