Came here on a last minute haven't eaten for 13 hours need some food and everything is closed whim. Needless to say I was not impressed especially for all of the 5 star reviews. We came half an hour to closing but this is quick stop and go food so I figured I was fine. I got the steak burrito with seaweed rice, black beans, pineapple salsa, and the regular fixings. The food looked cold but I thought I saw some steam come from somewhere so I'd be alright. I got home and took it out of the bag, thought I felt some remote warmth...took a bite so much for that it was cold. I was too hungry to care, about 1/3 into the burrito I felt sick. The damn steak tasted like friggin rock candy. Shit was about to have me bouncin' off the walls! I also got a bag of their chips to accompany my burrito, I could've bought the same ones at the grocery store. I am close to certain I will not try again unless I have some life altering Notebook moment.
