Well, I would've loved to have visited either Salsarita's location at the CLT airport however I couldn't get either location to answer the phone. I called during normal business hours to ask a question that depending on the answer, would result in if I would go there or not but since I can't get anyone to pick up the phone, I guess that's my answer right there. Unfortunate. Why list the phone number if you're not even going to answer? I called each location 3 times each.
