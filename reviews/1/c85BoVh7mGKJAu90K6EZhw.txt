with a name like Fat Burrito, I had really high expectations.  I'm not sure how this place exists.  I couldn't even finish my carne asada burrito because it was so bad and I usually can put down anything.

its a poor bootleg version of chipotle, assembly style...but its terrible.  I don't recommend this place unless you want to taste a terrible burrito.
