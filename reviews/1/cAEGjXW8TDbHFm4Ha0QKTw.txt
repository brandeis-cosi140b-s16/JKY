Went to El Valle in Mount Holly.  Food was ok, nothing much to speak of.  I went to give my server my digital coupon through the entertainment book application on my phone.  He said that he could not take it and referred me to the manager.  The manager said that he could not take it because their barcode reader was broken and so the owner told them not to take digital coupons.  They said if I printed it out, I could have used it.  I said, "So YOUR machine is broken, so therefore YOU will not take MY coupon, so I have to pay double what I was expecting?"  He said, "Yes, the owner said he doesn't want people using the same coupon over and over.  How do I know that if you use it, you will not just come back in and use it again?"   I showed him how you can mark redeemed, so that is not possible.  He did not understand and said, no coupon.  So we paid the full bill and they don't have to worry about us ever coming back-  coupon or not!  They need a lesson on customer service.
