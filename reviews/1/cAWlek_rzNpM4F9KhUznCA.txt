i always feel like such a tool when i eat here.. why do they only advertise to hipsters, potheads and drunks.. i don't know which one of those is worse.. i feel like they just assume everyone that comes through the drive thru is one of the above.  maybe thats why they don't have any real food at this place just s**t..
