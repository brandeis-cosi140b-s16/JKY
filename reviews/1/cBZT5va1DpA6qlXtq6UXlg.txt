This place is terrible. It's just bad at everything. not authentic enough to be "Mexican," not fresh or tasty enough to be cali style (like they claim). Soggy fries, microwave tasting quesadillas, yellow cheese (come 'on...) sprinkled a bit too liberally on everything, and fried food that manages to have a cold interior. 
The one tolerable thing here is the guacamole, which as mentioned tastes very fresh.  That said, it's not particularly well seasoned. The chicken is pulled not grilled, and okay too I guess. I tell friends to avoid this place literally every time I walk past it. Thats how active my dislike is for "get some."

NOW TO BE FAIR, I have heard that this place is "pretty solid when you're drunk." But I think thats a b.s. rationalization used for bad restaurants. There are at least 10 better drunk options. Call me insane, but I'd direct someone to PDR over this place.
