I have been here a total of 3 times trying to give this place a try because its one of the only mexican food drive thrus near me. The first time my boyfriend and I ordered a bean and cheese burrito which tasted like they came out of a can. I never knew a bean and cheese burrito could taste bad. 2nd time I ordred chicken street tacos and 3 rolled tacos. BLAND! tasted horrible and again like they came out of a can. SO this morning I decided to try a breakfast burrito thinking you cant really mess up a breakfast burrito and again I was wrong! i got the Chorizo plate which I paid around$7 for with literally little pieces of ground beef. no taste of chorizo at all literally pretty much scrambled eggs with bits of ground beef! If i wanted scrambled eggs I wouldve made them myself. However, my boyfriend had a bacon egg and cheese burrito which was decent but you cant really go wrong with Bacon. I decided to write this review to save people money and it upsets me that if this is family owned and ran they way it is. No pride in their food and up charged like crazy!
