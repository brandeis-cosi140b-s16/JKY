it might be the best kept secret of Glendale, but it should remain that way. We expected great service and delicious food. We were dissatisfied!! Why?
1. No one greeted us when we walked in.
2. Smells like a goodwill, not a scent of food anywhere.
3. Very grease ridden tortilla chips.
4. Sour tasting tamales.
5. Wait staff unable to rectify a simple issue (with the sour tamales) did not offer to remove from bill & did not offer to bring out something else.
6. Blamed the customer for complaint! really? ha!
Don't be fooled. It's really that bad!
