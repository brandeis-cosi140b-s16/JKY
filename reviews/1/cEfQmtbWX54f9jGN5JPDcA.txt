We had our company Christmas Party there.  Before closing, the staff turned the lights out over half our table.  The darkness was so overwelming, that we all forgot what we were even talking about.  When we were leaving our ruined party, we spoke to the staff about this.  They responded that "we all have families to go home to."  They don't care about their customers' experiences there.  I will never go there again.  Not even an "I'm sorry!" from them.
