Ambiance...small and not very clean. Very limited menu. Ordered 2 steamed fish and 1 beef tacos on Taco Tuesday (buy 2 get one free) $6.46. They screwed up the order. Seriously, how challenging was it? Didn't even order a drink and it wasn't super busy! They acted like it was a big deal to change it, so we just let it go. The fish was tasty but very greasy.  The beef was very runny and couldn't be eaten like a taco. Wasn't much flavor. More like pot roast. Very disappointed. They didn't have chips. Wanted to give a new place a try. Won't go back. Original Burrito Company or Los Taquitos are both much better.
