I know this will not really make a difference as it is a fast food place and no one will contact me. This is probably by far the worst Taco Bell I have ever been to. 99% of the time my order is incorrect. There is a difference between beef and chicken right? No one seems to care when you call in and make mention that the order was not correct. You get treated like you did something wrong. Will probably be the last time that I have taco bell...
