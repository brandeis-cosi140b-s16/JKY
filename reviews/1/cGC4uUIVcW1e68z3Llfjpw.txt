We come here 1-2 times a week with a group of coworkers. I'm sorry but when you fulfill 20+ online orders making over 30 people wait who actually came in to order in person, you can expect everybody to be pissed off and to reduce the chances of ever coming back in. Why should somebody who has ordered their food on the Internet have their food made before somebody who's physically in line. Learn to manage your staff if you want our business to continue.

What will effect your business more negatively- the amount of people that turn away when they see a line out the door due to online orders, or the one online order That frankly can wait. Management, if I were you I'd not allow online orders during a certain time gap. You're frustrating people.
