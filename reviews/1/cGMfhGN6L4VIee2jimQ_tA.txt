Well, the first time we tried this place was just after they opened when we experienced one of the worst dining experiences in history.  The food was so bad it was hard to believe that they could survive a year in business.  Well, we wanted to try it again and the food here is simply not Mexican food.  Nothing is authentic here, and there are many good places in Phoenix where the food is light years ahead of this.  Their red sauce for enchiladas is terrible, as are the salsas that have almost no flavor of hot sauce. Nothing here is spicy, just bland food you would feed your young kids.  Don't ask for anything hotter, you won't get it because they don't know what hot is supposed to be or how to introduce real chile pepper into their food.  Expensive, and a staff of employees without any enthusiasm who talk poorly about the place and complain.  Without a good chef this place can not possibly last, we need a good Mexican food place here, owners should try Valle Luna which is so packed at night you can not get into the place, this will show you how to make good food and provide good service. Very disappointed, one more try and we are done for good.
