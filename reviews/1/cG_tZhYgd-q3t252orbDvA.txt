Where do I even start? I hope the owners of this franchise read this review and take it as seriously as possible. This was the 4th time visiting this place , and it was 4 times to many. Let's start with the employees, rude and unprofessional. Clearly never trained on customer service or food handling. Management should be responsible for hiring quality people. This place looks like it's ran by high school students also pretty clear they have no management skills judging by how EVERY SINGLE VISIT they had some excuse on why they had either no steak no barbqua no guaq, or white rice. I've been to many chipotles that are jam packed of people, and the staff and food is always on point. This chipotle can't even handle the small amount of disappointed customers it gets. Let's talk about quality of food. Gross, rubber steak burnt chicken and stale chips.. Even the water doesn't taste filtered. Don't eat here, if you want chipotle drive 4.2 miles north to the next one.
