It's ok...their food comes on a hot plate that seems to be frozen and then microwaved not made in the oven. We had the combo plates and there was no differentiation between the burrito, chalupa and taco because they all had the same sodium-full red sauce. 
Nothing authentic about this place, will definitely not be going back!
