My kids love Taco Bell, I love to take them here because it's cheap lol. Usually we go to the one down the road because every single time I come to this one, they always seem to either screw up the order, or short change all the food by stuffing it full of lettuce and barely any "meat" so do your self a favor, drive the extra couple miles to avoid this Taco Bell
