We went to Leticia's on a Friday night. They were very busy, but we went right to a table. We felt the service was just mediocre (Mario was our waiter). One of our 4 people had to send their food back, it was cold. One person ordered enchiladas in a red sauce and received it with a white sauce. When we told the waiter, the waiter said "Well don't you even want to taste it?" NO! we just want what we ordered to begin with. Their red sauce tastes like a mild mole sauce, which was not all that good. I ordered a taco and it was pretty good, but beans and rice were cold. It was higher priced than most places, which would have been ok, had it been good!
We will not go back!!!!!!!!!
