The service at this restaurant is terrible.  They throw food at you like they are giving food to the homeless. :(   I called the manager to complain, and she said she will fix the problem.   The food are so expensive here.  The burrito is full of rice and very little of everything else.   Do you ever question what you put in your stomach for your meal??? They claim that they try to get organic food here, but I don't really know or we all don't know how hard they try (1% or 99% organic????).    It is better to go to a less expensive fast food place.
