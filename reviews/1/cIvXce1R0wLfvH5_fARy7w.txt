I pulled into the drive thru on Sunday, Nov. 22, 2015 at 8:30am to find it closed.  However, employee Beverly was walking around inside.  I parked and went to the front door to wait.  Beverly opened up around 8:45am.  When I asked what happened, she was so rude with her response I can't post it.  I left and went away sad and disappointed that somebody would talk to me like she did.
