I do not recommend this restaurant.  They were enthusiastic when we walked in, the service was fair, and the place is cute and decorated.

But the food was bad.

We started with guacamole- it was the grossest I have ever had, completely overpowered with onions, yet still tasted bland.  It didn't even taste like there were avocados in there.  And it didn't get any better.  Our entrees were bland (just excess salt), the refried beans were a creepy grey color, the sopapillas were bland.  It just was not a good dinner.
