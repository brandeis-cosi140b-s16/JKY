HORRIBLE customer service. First time coming here and there was no line. The girl in the register was counting her cash. We were waiting right in front of her for a good 3 minutes and she looked up twice while counting her cash. She finally asked if we were ready. Really? It took that long for her to ask? The rest of the staff didn't look happy to be there and the girl taking orders through drive through was just sitting around. What a waste of my $11. They need  new set of staff. First and last visit
