This was the WORST Mexican food my husband and I have ever had.  It would be slightly more forgivable if the restaurant were in, say, Pennsylvania, but Las Vegas is about as far West as you can get!  We both got burritos chimichanga style, which just meant there was some sort of bland, bright red, ketchup-looking sauce dribbled on top.  My husband didn't even finish his chicken burrito, which we both noted was a first.  But nothing tops (or bottoms?) the chips and salsa, which, in my opinion, is pretty hard to mess up.  My husband describes the chips as what you might find in an expired bag sitting in the back of a shelf at a 99 Cents store (not good enough for Dollar Tree, he says).  I would just describe them as cardboard.  Needless to say, we were sorely disappointed by the entire experience!  We thought about standing outside the entrance for 5-10 min, warning people to go somewhere else as a service to humanity, but decided we weren't going to waste any more of our time on that place!
