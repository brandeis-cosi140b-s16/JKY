So I'm not even sure where to start, I wrote a review 7/9/2013 and this used to be my favorite place to eat because the food was amazing, the place was clean, and the staff was very friendly. This is the second time my mom and I have had lunch here over the past couple weeks and it was completely horrible. At about 2pm on Sunday, we waited in a very long line (which I'm used to) and once we got to the front we both ordered separate orders of chicken tacos. I asked for more chicken on my tacos because there were only a couple of pieces on one of them, compared to the other order there was not much of a difference so I told them I didn't want to pay extra for chicken when both orders look similar. They did as I asked and I was very grateful, then we paid and only got water cups not soda. Thank gosh we didn't pay for soda because every soda was out of order and to top it off there was no ice. We sat on the patio, every table was dirty and no one ever came outside to clean up while we were there. Then I tried going back into the building from the patio and there was no door handle - where it said "pull" so I had to go all the way around to get inside to go to the bathroom. Then as we were leaving I wanted to throw away my garage and get more water, so once again I had to walk all the way around to get inside from the patio. The soda line where all the plastic silverware, lemons, and straws was covered in garage and napkins. This has been the worst experience and I will never return to this Chipotle again.
