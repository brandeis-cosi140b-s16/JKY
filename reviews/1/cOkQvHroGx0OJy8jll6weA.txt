I've enjoyed eating at many La Salsita's across the Valley, but this location was a new one for me. I ordered the Carne Asada plate, which looked great when it was presented, but after a couple quick bites of the meat before I got to whipping up some flour tacos, I could taste that the meat was bad. The pieces I tried were cooked but everyone knows the strange taste of out dated meat. It has a funk to it. I automatically lost my appetite. I explained very nicely to the person that took my order that something wasn't right with the meat. She went and told the cook who scoffed in Spanish at my suggestion. She came back and said I could get something else. I was already 8 minutes into my 30 minute lunch and had no desire to tempt fate. The total price was $8.38 for the plate. So I told the girl just refund $6 back to my card and we'll call it good. After 5 more minutes had passed, a different lady came forward and completed a full refund for me, which I thanked her for. She spoke very good English, but never once apologized one bit for what had transpired. It left me with a bad taste in my mouth to say the least! I mean, I know I wasn't dining at Ruth's Chris, but the slightest bit of Courtesy in the customer satisfaction dept. sure could've gone a long way. Also, the giant sign at the front door saying that the restrooms were out of order could've have been a little less blunt as your walking in getting ready to eat... I'm sure I just caught them on a off day with their meat, but when a problem arises with the food, they need to step it up and show the slightest bit of remorse. Just a simple we're sorry, and I would be writing a different review!
