The food here was awful, I noticed that their seasoning is loaded with tenderizer and that had me in a state of distress all night.... lets just say i couldnt leave the bathroom. I am hispanic and enjoy my Mexican, but this joint sucked. I had cramps and stomach pains all night. Do not give children this food.... have mercy.
