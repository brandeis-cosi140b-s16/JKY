This place must still be going through a rough start. I ordered a tequila on the menu that the bartender "couldn't find." On the second try, the tonic was flat, and even after asking about it, wasn't offered a new drink. Finally, I watched as she blew her nose into a tiny beverage napkin, and without washing her hands, continued to make drinks, serve food, and hand out silverware. Yikes!
