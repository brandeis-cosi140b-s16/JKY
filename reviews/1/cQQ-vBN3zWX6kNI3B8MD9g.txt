The food was disgusting here. I love filibertos but this one is nasty, the food taste weird like it was old. I ordered a carne asada quesadilla and my sister carne asada fries. We both agreed the meat was salty and harder then usual and tasted bad i spit it out. Never coming here i found a new favorite spot and it was NOT filibertos. Go to Ramiros!!
