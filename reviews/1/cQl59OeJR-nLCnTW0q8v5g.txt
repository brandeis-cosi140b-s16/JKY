Average food, which is strange for a fox restaurant. The service was just BAD!!! I had a margarita and after it was finished I put it at the end of the table as kind of a hint to ask if I wanted another, no go! After 6 pass by's from our waiter I walked to the bar to get it myself. My wife just had water and no offers to refill. After all that I talked to the manager and all I got was a "that's not right" then the bill came and no compensation. Can you say One and done?
