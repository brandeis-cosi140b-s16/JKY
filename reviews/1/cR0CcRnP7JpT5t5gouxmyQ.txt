I have eaten here about 6 times now.  The level of service and food quality and gotten worse each time.  My last visit I was terribly disappointed!  The bill was $442 and we were still hungry afterwards.  I would no recommend this place at all.  Another problem with this place is the hosts always put the customers in the same section instead of utilizing the entire restaurant.  So annoying.
All in all, food tastes bad and the portion sizes are very small.
