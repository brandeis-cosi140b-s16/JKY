I had high hopes for this place. The decor is awesome but everything else was awful. Went in with 4 people on a Saturday night. Asked the hostess for a table - She looked at us like we were crazy.. She pointed to the room and said "we are pretty busy, but I'll go look for a table." When she came back, she said a table might be ready in 30 minutes. We stepped to the bar and that was an even worse experience. The bartenders were rude, didn't know the menu, and took forever to acknowledge us. The margaritas tasted like Jose Cuervo sweet and sour mix and were over priced. The bartender over charged me for the tequila and when I asked him about it he aid "We are still working out the kinks" Well.. sir.. you got more than kinks to work out for sure... no adjustment was made for the overcharge. 

We waited an hour to get seated and when we asked the hostess she told us no one is leaving and walked away. So we walked out. We won't be back.
