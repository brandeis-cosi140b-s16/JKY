Cinco de Mayo at Casa Del Sol 2013. Waiting for a deck seat for an hour while waiting 30 minutes in between drinks? Not fun. Waiting for our cheese fondue which tasted more like a bowl of melted leftover cheese which was overpriced another 30 minutes - awesome fun. Our food? Boring. The vegetable fajitas I got was almost all onions and cactus. It was not good. The waiter was awful. I don't know if he just was having an off day but based on him standing in the bathroom texting or doing something standing in the stall - guessing he didn't take his job too seriously. A restaurant shouldn't be a 3 hour experience, especially when the ONLY customers were just in the patio seating except a FEW sparse people inside. We've gone there a couple times before and I'd rate it 3/5 for those experiences but this one is a solid -6/5. You know that feeling when you're so concerned the waiter won't come back that you want to shove them your credit card just so you won't have to wait another 30 minutes? Yes - that bad.
