DO NOT GO HERE!  Brought to you by the same lousy management and food purveyors as John Cutter.

Lousy food, I am surprised I did not get sick from the fish.  Tiny portions and very little flavor.  Also, be careful when you write a bad review about any of the lousy Corrigan restaurants because you will get a petty little note from the owner - "Adam C".  Here's an idea: if you have bad reviews and poor feedback from guests - invest your time and energy into listening and making changes instead of striking back.  If anyone else gets these messages, make sure to avoid their other restaurants: John Cutter and Sedona.
