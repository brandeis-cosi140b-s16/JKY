Chicken tortilla soup was room temp which is never good unless it's meant to be cold.

Chile jalape√±o burger was greasy and warmish.

Why is nothing served hot here?!?

Left with a bad case of indigestion.  I should've checked Yelp before eating here.  Save your $$ and eat somewhere else.  Unless you want to see what a restaurant is like before it dies.
