Had a very rude experience with a cashier, her name is Ashley and she has short bleached hair with very dark eye makeup..I came in and asked if they had a menu with calories and she told me if I wanted to be healthy I shouldn't eat at Taco Bell, it was uncalled for and she shouldn't have said it. I told her I would get a soft taco and she told me to get the supreme because it has tomatoes on it, she said it in a mocking way and I finally decided to walk out, she shouldn't be working with customers if she doesn't know how to be courteous to people
