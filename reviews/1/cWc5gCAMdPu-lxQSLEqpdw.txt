Ordered a grilled steak burrito for delivery and when I got it there was no steak.  The delivery service (Eats24) contacted the restaurant and said for sure there was steak in the burrito... so I guess the customer who's eating it is wrong!  What a joke, food was at best average otherwise.  Won't recommend this place to anyone.
