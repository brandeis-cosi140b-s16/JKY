Horrible Custmer service from the Ass-sant manager. She is horrible to all that were waiting line.  She never made eye contact. She yelled for the NEXT CUSTOMER. never once looked up just kept ask what what what do you want. We will never go to this Rita Tacos. The food had no flavor. Just like their service.
