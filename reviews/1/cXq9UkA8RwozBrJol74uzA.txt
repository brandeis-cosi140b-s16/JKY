The employees working the night shift are extremely rude. The man always lies and tells me the hot sauce is in my brown bag and slams the window shut. Last time I literally emptied everything out of the town bag on my lap and he still argued with me. What a joke. It's Mexican food and I want hot sauce. That should be expected!
