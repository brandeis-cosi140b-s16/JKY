Like so many who have written reviews, I live very close to Aliante Casino and was hoping the Mexican food was not as bad as some of the reviews. I actually waited until yesterday to give it a try thinking they are going to get it as right as they can by now.

This was worse than I expected after reading the negative reviews. The Margarita, if you ask for a happy hour price, is only $4 and not bad. The chips, which they obviously buy in bulk either in a bag or a box, are not fried on premises and about 80% of them, were little pieces too small for even me to eat. The chips came with 3 salsas. The bean and salsa were pretty good but the green salsa had a fishy taste.
I ordered a two item combination, chicken enchilada and shredded beef taco. These items are what I consider the basics or gold standards in Mexican/American food. If you can't get this right you can't get anything right. 

The food came pretty quickly which was not surprising as the restaurant was deserted and most of the people in the bar area were only drinking. As soon as I bit into the taco, which was in a purchased taco shell like you can buy in a grocery store, I knew it was chicken and not shredded beef. When the bartender came by I said I think my taco is chicken not shredded beef. She said oh, I will order you one a la carte. The taco came very quickly but it was ground beef and an off tasting ground beef. Taco Bell's ground beef has a more Mexican flavor. The enchilada was really small and had almost no sauce on it.

I have eaten at two Mexican Restaurant predecessors of the Salted Lime at Aliante Casino and they all have the same thing in common. The chips and taco shells are purchased and not fried on premises. Also, the sauces are very simple and uninspiring. I am guessing the problem is that the kitchen is not properly equipped. There is no other way I can explain how three Mexican restaurants in one location can be so bad!
