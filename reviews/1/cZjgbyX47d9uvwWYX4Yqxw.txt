Food was decent but expensive. The service was terrible. They forgot our appetizer, and then brought it out after we finished the main course. We saw our waitress maybe 3 times, adnd every time we had to ask for her to come over. They offered a two for one yard drink coupon, but the yards are twice as expensive as anywhere else so it's not a savings. 
Overall the food was fresh, but expect poor service and when the bill comes out they'll soak you for a small fortune.
