I attended a client appreciation reception for an ed tech company at the Canonita a few weeks ago. Our group had the run of the "outdoor" seating area right next to the canal. The atmosphere and wait staff were pleasant - those are the only positives I took away from my experience at this restaurant. 

Since the reception was small and casual, I had the opportunity to try their margaritas and a few appetizers/finger foods. Their margaritas, while potent, were a little bland, and the appetizers were over cooked,  flavorless, and uninspiring. The experience did not make me want to frequent the establishment again.
