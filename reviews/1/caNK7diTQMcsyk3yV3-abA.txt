I took my family to this establishment to see the local alternative band  The Love Me Not's who were to hit the state at 9 pm. We arrived at 8:15. The place, small indoor seating and large outdoor seating, was packed to the point where we couldn't find a seat outside. We went inside to order some food and wait until 9. Inside, it took 10 minutes before we were approached and given a menu. Drinks came quickly (iced tea, lemonade, and water) and we placed an order for nacho's when they arrived (8:30). By 8:55 the waiter approached offering us chips and salsa as we waited. I explained that we were there to see the 9 o'clock band and that we'd be outside shortly. A second waitress approached, the one who was supposed to be our server all along, asking if we needed anything. Being 9 PM I canceled the order and offered to pay for the drinks. She gave us the drinks for free. We went outside. The place was still packed and while we couldn't hear the announcement of the next band very well, we didn't hear them say anything similar to the Love Me Not's. Disgusted with the experience we left. We ended up at Old Chicago on Bell and had nacho's.

The issues with this place are piss-poor management and a total lack of organization. I blame the kitchen for being slow (possibly understaffed).

We didn't see or hear the band we came for, we didn't get the food we ordered.  I will not be coming back here again.
