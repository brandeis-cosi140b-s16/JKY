as a food-ie, i've eaten at literally thousands of places in over 20 countries, and Cilantro in Madison is the first place I would describe as "gourmet Mexican"...sounds good, but the food is anything but gourmet.

upon arriving at the restaurant, we are greeted in a small space, occupied by a nicely stocked bar giving it a cozy ambiance,  we were then escorted to the main dining room, which is spacious and decorated with interesting pieces of art.  the rest of the decorations were tacky at best, and I found myself trying to not looking at the multicolored window drapes.

We did not order any appetizers and went straight to the entrees.  My date had the vegetarian fajitas and I had the "jumbo shrimp and rice."  Well, the food came out in a reasonable amount of time, about 15-20 minutes.  

I was immediately disappointed by my entree; the jumbo shrimp were not "jumbo"...just regular size.  The rice came in a nice pyramid and was cooked with cilantro.  I tried the rice first and found that it was not cooked correctly.  it was damp and completely without taste, even with the cilantro.  I then tried the shrimp and it tasted like all the other shrimp i've had at any Mexican restaurant for less than half the price.  

My date said she thought her meal was "ok" which is never good.  

Our waitress was pesky and had poor timing.

I paid about $50( including tip) for 2 entrees.  The food is terrible and even at half the price, I would not eat here again or recommend it.  

Once again, Madison has been lacking a good Mexican restaurant and Cilantro only makes things worse.
