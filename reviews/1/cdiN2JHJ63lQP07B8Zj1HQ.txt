I'm very disappointed in this location. I have been  raving to my friend about how much I like Chipotle and she had never tried it before. We went in around 5pm today.  There was a bit of a line but it's expected, only two line workers and one cook. Once we got to the front you could see the mess of rice all over the counters where the cook was. They were running low on everything and nothing was getting cooked fast enough. Of course with most Chipotle they give you less meat and everything else. When we got to the house we later find out that the chicken was burnt! We couldn't even enjoy it because of the burnt taste. This location embarrassed me and Chipotle itself. I really want my money back it was not up to par with quality. All could've been forgivin if my food wasn't burnt.
