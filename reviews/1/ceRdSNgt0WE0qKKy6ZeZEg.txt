Hahahahah this place is a joke the line workers were very unorganized and frazzled, there were only 2 other people ordering at the time, and my girlfriend and I almost walked out before witnessing more chaos... Thank goodness the food was good but I wouldn't recommend this location at all I asked for a discount and free drinks, the cashier smirked and could only shake her head and obliged my request as she saw the debacle that just happened....
