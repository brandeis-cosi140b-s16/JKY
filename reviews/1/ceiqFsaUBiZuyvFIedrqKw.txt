Get some Taco Bell and drink wine coolers. This place sucks, Unless you are 23 , drunk with no standards.

This joint is loud and caters to young people who have no palate . We left . Couldn't stand the noise ..it's embarrassing to say the least.

The reviewers are typical yinzers with no taste . Trust me, stay away
