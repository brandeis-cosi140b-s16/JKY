This was soooo disappointing.  Service was terrible. We watched 3 parties walk out because they weren't getting any service.  The Mexican food was authentic, but our adult daughter commented that the vegetables looked like what she buys at Traders Joes, fresh out of a bag-and these tasted like it.  The staff pressures you to order appetizers.  If you order appetizers the chips and salsa are free but if you order 3 meals all over $20. each, plan on paying for the chips...it does state free when you order an appetizer on the menu, but seriously that is just silly!  Another Scottsdale business that won't and shouldn't make it!
