Had to get a bite before my flight and my choices were the taco bar here or Burger King and Pizza Hut. I figured I could get a decent taco in Phoenix, and even then I wasn't expecting much. Turns out I should have went with the fast-food chains. The tacos here were terrible, both steak and chicken had no flavor at all, and the tortilla was like a piece of cardboard. I know this is airport food, but come on people make an effort.
Couldn't even finish them.
