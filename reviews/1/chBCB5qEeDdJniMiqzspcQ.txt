If you were a fan of the Carlos' n Charlie's on Sunset, fuggedabout this joint, it sucks!
While the waiter was charming and handsome as all get out, not even his beautiful smile could make up for the fact that those in the kitchen could not cook worth a damn! There is no  one in that kitchen worthy of being called a chef! They did not even put all of the ingredients in the dish! I guess I was not supposed to notice there was no Chorizo in my Quesadilla, Really? Not everyone that visits Vegas is from Podunk!
The margarita was good. The end!
