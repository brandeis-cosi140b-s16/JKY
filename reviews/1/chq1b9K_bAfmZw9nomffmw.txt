Super super super slow service. My party waited an Hour and a Half -- Not an exaggeration, we got there at 12:10 PM and did not get most of our orders until 1:40 PM. I say most of our orders as I did not get my order at all! The server/bartender just offered a lot of eye rolling and threw a lot of shade but never gave an apology, no I'm sorry, nothing but attitude. Everyone had separate checks and everyone prepaid and she made bank on the tips. I will never make that mistake again. She didn't deserve a penny! So at 1:40PM as I was getting my refund she rudely told me "I'm also going to cancel that order in the kitchen" like I was fishing for a comp'd meal! So rude, so slow, so bad, so long Nacho Daddy! Your service is in need of retooling and maybe a staff that cares. 
Update: manager contacted me just to get clarification on what happened then abandoned all contact with me. Once again I was let down and nothing was done to make things right. I am no longer surprised that the service was lacking as the manager had no follow through.
