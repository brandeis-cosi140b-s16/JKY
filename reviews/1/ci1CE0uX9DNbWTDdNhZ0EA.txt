We live close by and couldn't wait for this place to open! Our first and only time eating here was pretty disappointing. 
Although service was fast and the staff were friendly, the food was not very good at all! Meat was dry and bland, salsa was watery... Overall poor quality or just old food! 
Too bad because this place looks nice and clean but they just need new cooks and recipes??!
