The worst "Mexican" food I've had, sadly.  It's also the most Caucasian (not counting the likes of Taco Bell).  The second worst was Del Taco, which had a far uglier interior and was in a worse neighborhood, but at least that was edible.

The enchiladas have a massive (ridiculously massive!) amount of white onion inside them, which I hated.  Their red sauce is not flavorful.  Their cheese is very low quality, and greasy too, while the tortillas aren't really anything of note.

This is on my "won't ever go there again" list, sadly.  For fast Mexican food just go to Los Favoritos by Bashas' down the street, or run into the mall food court for Rubio's.
