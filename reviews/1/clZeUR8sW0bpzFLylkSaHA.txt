This used to be the best mexican food in town. Roberto sold the place and the quality and service has taken a nose dive. Don't bother anymore. They get orders wrong and then practically force you into taking what they've made anyway. I'm so bummed Roberto isn't there anymore. Especially since this place is about 3 minutes from my house.
