Good was greasy, not fresh or healthy that I was expecting. We ordered our food to go, and when they brought it out to us, I asked for more salsa. I said that the amount they gave us wasn't enough, and she refused to give me anymore salsa. She said "that's enough salsa for you". How is she supposed to know how much salsa I like?
