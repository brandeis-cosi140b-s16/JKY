Awful! The service has to be the worst! Yes, today is Cinco De Mayo but they were not overly busy when I went and the attitude was very unnecessary. I ordered lunch #8 and someone who cannot speak nor understand English brought out #9. He said #9 and I said no #8. He said #9 again and I said no #8. Then he started to argue with me even though he can't understand me. Another server came by and took #9 out of said servers hands and returned it to the kitchen. While my friend ate her lunch I waited for my #8 to come out. When it finally came out I had beans instead of rice. I was very unsure as to whether or not I wanted to say something. I finally said something to the waiter about #8 having rice instead of beans. He told me he didn't think so. I was pretty sure it did. Anyway, he very rudely told me he would get me some rice. He came back with a serving platter full of rice. Really? a cup would have been sufficient. 

All in all the food was awful! They drenched the burrito in a red sauce and everything was slimy. The flavor just wasn't there either. I have decided that even though this place is close to work I will not be going back unless I am forced to by conditions out of my control.
