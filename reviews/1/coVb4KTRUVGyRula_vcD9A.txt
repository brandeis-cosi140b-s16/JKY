Soo me and a friend just stopped in for a snack, since we were going to see a show, and it didn't start for another hour. The prices looked perfect, so we choose this place. 

So after waiting for about 10 minutes, a gentleman walked up and stared at us. He stood so close to me, it felt like he was hitting on me. I didn't know if it was an employee or a random person. He didn't say anything.. not "hello," not "how are you" "what can I get you?"  

Nothing.. we looked at each other confused, and it was so awkward.

We just started ordering so the uncomfortable feeling would go away. We ordered some nachos and he walked away. I already knew this place sucked just by that moment. 

The nachos were so gross.. the beans tasted like they came out of a can, and not a name brand can either. The chicken had NO FLAVOR at all, and you got some chesse topped on it. No sour cream, no sauces at all! Beans, cheese and chicken. This cost 10 dollars..

He never came over to check on us, and it took forever to get the check. I think I heard him talked once during the 40 minutes we were there.
