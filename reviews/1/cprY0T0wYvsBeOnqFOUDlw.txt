I had the worst restaurant experience of my life here tonight. After attending the Desert Twilight XC Invitational at the sports complex, we were looking for a good place to eat before driving home to Phoenix. We Yelped, found the great reviews, saw the terrific ambience, and asked for a table for 4.
We were seated fairly quickly at 7:15 even though the restaurant was almost at capacity. Our drink orders were taken, then our food orders were taken. Drinks great, chips and salsa great, fun night, good conversation. Then we waited. And waited. The restaurant started to empty. At a little after 8:10 I went inside and checked on our order. We were told it was next. We waited some more. Then we were told it would be 10 more minutes. At 8:20 I asked for the check and asked for our food to be boxed. At 8:35 we got our food. No discount was given, they didn't have utensils for us. They apologized for the slow service but told me they were busy all night!
Isn't the GOAL of a restaurant to be busy? Don't you have higher standards than a meal taking OVER AN HOUR to be served?
We got in the car, my kids are their food with their hands, and then fell asleep.
By the way, they were OUT OF MARGARITA MIX AND COCA COLA. And the manager never visited the table to apologize, he let the poor hostess take all the heat from us. If I could give them no stars I would. And I still tipped the server 20%.
