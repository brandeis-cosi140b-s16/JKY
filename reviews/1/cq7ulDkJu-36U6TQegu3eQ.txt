So frustrating. The only reason I came here was because Costa Vita is closed on Sunday. The customer service is appalling! I called in my order, showed up at the time I was told my order would be ready they hadn't even started it. When it was ready it was incorrect, the guy blamed me for the fact that it was wrong. They made it again but gave me attitude about it. When I got home I found that the order was still wrong and the other items were soggy because I had to wait. This is my 2nd negative experience there with poor customer service and I wouldn't recommend this location.
