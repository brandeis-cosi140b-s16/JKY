This wasn't the worst place ever, but for the price I would never go back. For a soda, and iced tea and 2 meals we spent $45!!! I would totally pay about $7 for my Chimichanga...but not a penny more. My husband and I both got chimichangas- his was chicken and I got ground beef. There was flavor, but mostly of onion. Our meals both came with some cold, bland spanish rice and refried beans. We did get the free chips and salsa, but I've better of both in Denver. I'm not sure why everyone is so impressed that they are free. The waiter didn't even come back to see if our food was okay...instead he just stood around staring into space since we were his only table. If you've have real Mexican food at any point in you're life don't waste your time or money at Gonzalez y Gonzalez.
