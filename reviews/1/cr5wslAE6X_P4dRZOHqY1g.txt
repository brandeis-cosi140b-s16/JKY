The star rating  should be blank. I've had the worst service  at this location. I ordered a bean tostada and my friend a bean sope. It had a smear of beans. My friend  walked over to the counter.  Little  woman came from the back and told me if I wanted extra to tell the waitress. 

I told her that there was a smear and I loved the beans. She kept talking down  to me. Them told me all I do is take and take. I've  never received  anything free. She then told me not to come back. I said for a little  more beans. 

I was just at the Jones and lake mead location  yesterday. She then spoke insults in Spanish  and told me don't ever come back. This is hands down the most poorly  ran Tony's  I've ever been too. I will never go back. If you want service and to be treated like an American this it not the company. I will never go back. I have been patronizing  this company since 2012 faithfully. Never again.
