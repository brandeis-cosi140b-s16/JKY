This was my first visit to this particular Chipotle and it was disappointing.  I ordered a chicken bowl and there were several pieces of fat and gristle in the meat. Yuck. Then while I was eating, a girl who was sweeping actually asked me to move my feet so she could sweep under the table.  She did the same thing to the couple in the next booth.  WTF??!!?!
This place is not the usual for Chipotle.
