Went here for dinner tonight , never been before, won't EVER go back! The sign on the menu clearly states 3 tacos for $9.00. But I was charged $10.50 for the 3 tacos we ordered. After My family sat down to eat I went to question the charges. The person I dealt with was completely disrespectful and told me the reason the price was different was because of tax. When I told him that didn't make any sense, because the tax was also charged at the bottom of the receipt he then asked me to look at it on the screen with him. He charged me $3.50 3 times ($10.50) and then hit total, again claiming the tax was making the charge more than advertised. BUT at the bottom of the screen it showed the price (including tax) was actually over $11 with tax, again proving he was wrong. I continued to state my case, they were clearly false advertising and I wasn't going to accept his BS story. He reluctantly opened the register and gave me $1.00, but I was owed $1.50! I demanded the additional $0.50 and he complied, slamming the register and giving me a nasty looks as I turned to walk away. There are too many good places out there that don't rip off their customers, I'll take my business elsewhere!
