Good God, I hate this place.  

Why do you go, you may ask?

The answer?  Many of us have them: crazy in-laws.  In-laws who all live in WAY east valley (just call it what it is, PINAL county).  And they ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS pick Serrano's for dinner functions.  It really has been the only place out there for a long while as Christina A. says, but thank goodness more options are arriving, because neither I nor my intestinal tract can take this place any longer.

Start your meal, if you dare, with the baby diarrhea bean dip.  As for anything else on the menu, close your eyes and stab a finger: it is all the same anyway, just different shapes, or layered differently, flat instead of rolled, folded instead of encased... IT DOESN'T MATTER, it barely qualifies as food anyway.  It's not even cheap enough to be worth it.  Ugh.  

Save yourself.  Save your in-laws.  Just say NO to serraNOs.
