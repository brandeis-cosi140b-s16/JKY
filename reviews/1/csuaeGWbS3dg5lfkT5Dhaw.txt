I love Chipotle usually, but when I went into the store for the first time a month ago I was HIGHLY disappointed. The customer service was pathetic. The girls just stared at me like I was in the wrong for bothering them in the middle of their conversation to order. I went back a week ago to give it another shot, because I believe in second chances, but the service was maybe one smile of a difference. They obviously don't care about their customers at this place and just want to be somewhere else.
