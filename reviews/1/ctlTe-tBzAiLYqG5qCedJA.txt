Like supporting local businesses but never ever going here again, like ever. Maybe if it's torn down and a nice new place not called Rudy's is built in its place, maybe then I'll return. Very slow service, had ask for chips and salsa, they charge 4.00 to fry a burrito, why does it cost 4.00 to fry a freakin burrito? They need to learn to cost out their food. They sur charge for every little thing chimichanga plate ended up costing over 17.00 bucks! They need to hire an interior designer. They need a little background music. I don't understand how anyone could give this place more than 1/4 of a star. I'm giving one star cuz the server was clearly brand and I feel sorry that she has to work at this depressing job but I'm never going back here ever ever ever again.
