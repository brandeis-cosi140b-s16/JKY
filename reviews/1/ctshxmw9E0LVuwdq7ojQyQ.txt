iI have eaten here several times and never had a problem. Good food, clean, friendly staff.

HOWEVER! I will never be going back after the other day. As I write this I am in horrible discomfort from food poisoning after having the green chili plate. I wont go into details but lets just say my life sucks so much right now. My father accompanied me to the establishment and is also not feeling well from the carne asada plate that he had. We both have very strong stomachs, so in order to have a meal effect us so much speaks volumes on its own.

I would recommend great caution if still frequenting this place. I hope nobody ever feels or experiences what I have been for the last 12 hours.
