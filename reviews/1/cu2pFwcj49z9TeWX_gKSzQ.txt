There are two places on yelp to review the same restaurant, but the food was just terrible here.  Service was good, the place is beautiful, and the margaritas were huge which is a plus, but the food was absolutely horrible.  For those of you that have written a good review, I can guarentee that if the food doesn't get better soon this place will be gone by next summer.  We need a good mexican food place in the area, so i hope they get things turned around.
