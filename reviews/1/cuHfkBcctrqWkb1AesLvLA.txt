We ate in the main restaurant on Saturday, April 11, 2015. Wanted to try the new place out. So disappointed! Waited in the bar while waiting for our table for three. No one waited on us. Went to bar myself and grabbed three margs: frozen mango, peach on the rocks, and regular frozen lime. All sucked...all mix, little liquor, and way too sweet!  Couldn't finish them. Went to receptionist and asked for chips and salsa, since no one was waiting on us, or the other patrons in the bar. She said she'd have someone bring them right over; never happened and we waited 40 minutes. 

Now to the dining room. Confusion by our male waiter from the beginning. Service was not good. Prices definitely increased from prior restaurant at same location. Food was not good. All three meals were served at different times; awkward!  We finally got our chips and salsa; chips weren't  bad...salsa (red and green) wasn't good. 

I realize they're still in their soft opening period working out the kinks, but this experience was simply awful and the food not that good, especially for the price. Probably won't return...bummer.
