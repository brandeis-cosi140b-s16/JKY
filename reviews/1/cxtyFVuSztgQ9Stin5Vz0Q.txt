I should have read the reviews!.... Food terrible; I ordered the burger sliders, and after 45 minutes I received them cold and hard, my husband ordered a bacon burgers and received a dry cold regular burger. Service; the worse here in Las Vegas- we waited for an hour because they told us the kitchen was backed up. After we were seated we waited another 45 to receive our food. Our waiter came twice in the 2 hours we were there. I needed some ranch and when I asked the server he told me to ask my waiter... I don't get why he couldn't just give it to Me. I'll never come back. I recommend u take your money somewhere else where u'll get good serivice
