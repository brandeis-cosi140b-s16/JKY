The tacos were horrible.  No flavor, wet shells.  Just  yuck.  I don't care if it's authentic or not.  I just want food that tastes good. This didn't.  At. all.

I understand the fajitas were great. Two friends got that.

The take-out order I got at the end of the meal was missing all of the condiments when I got home, and not one of the three take-out meals I got my family were edible.  

I made a reservation for 5.  They weren't prepared when we arrived and so five of us were seated at a booth with a chair at the end.  It was very cramped, and I wondered why I bothered to give them the benefit of knowing we were coming if they weren't going to give me the benefit of being prepared.  We ordered appetizers, drinks, meals, and all of that didn't fit on a table for four.  It just didn't work.

The margarita was great, but I honestly don't think there was alcohol in the thing. 

Lastly, the waitress didn't ask if we wanted separate checks and acted like she was frustrated when she had to separate them for us.
