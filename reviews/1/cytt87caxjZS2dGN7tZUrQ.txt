Given the 100% positive ratings on Urban Spoon, I was really looking forward to getting take out from Lupitas.  I walked in and it seemed like it had a lot of potential. So I ordered everything on the menu.... all THREE things!... Carnitas, shredded beef, and chicken. I also ordered some salsa and tortillas.  When I got home and opened the boxes I was disappointed to find that they were boxes of meat and nothing else.  I mean, No sides of any kind.  No rice.  No beans.  No veggies.  It's a good thing that I had ordered the tortillas or I wouldn't have even had anything to put the meat in. 

This wouldn't have been a big deal if I hadn't woken up a handful of hours, violently ill from what I had eaten.  Being up all night with intense cramping from bad food is not an experience that I care to repeat.  I won't be back.
