Do not pay with a cc.   They scammed me and the other people that were with us out of money charged my card 4 times going to the state attorney general office first thing in the morning the other people scammed them out of 500 buck they told me.  Charged their card over and over.  When we got the first charge we both told them the charge was wrong so did it again and again I asked for the return paperwork and they told us oh we don't have to return because it does not get charged till I close out the charge.  Liars      They scammed us
