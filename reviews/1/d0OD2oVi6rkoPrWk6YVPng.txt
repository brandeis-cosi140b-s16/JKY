Wow, what an awkward experience.  My wife and I decided to go here last night for the (and last) time.  When you walk in, we weren't sure to seat ourselves or wait to be seated.  The hostess was apparently doing something else.  There was no sign, and the waitresses were not around.  We finally get seated and and salsa were brought out.  Salsa was good but a little bit spicier than expected.....Oh wait, we hadn't gotten any drinks yet or even our drink order taken!  That took about 10 minutes from being seated until we received our drinks.  By the way, if you were looking to put salt on your chips, expect it to be all over your table.  No wax paper or anything underneath the chips, so it spills out from the basket they put them in.  My wife ordered the green sour cream enchiladas and I ordered the machaca chimi.  Hers had barely any taste whatsoever.  Very, very bland.  My chimi on the other hand was full of flavor but a bit on the salty side.  I have no idea how long I waited to get a refill on my drink.  They give you the bill (eventually) and you go up front to pay.

I've seen a lot of reviews about the service.  I don't think it's the waitresses fault.  It's a small establishment but they seem very understaffed for the wait times.  I would have rather gone across the street to Macayo's or in town to Garcias Las Avenidas.
