This is the second time that I have been here, and both times were terrible. I typically enjoy the standard "tex-mex" type restaurants, but this was a pretty poor example of the style.

Like most of these places the experience starts with chips and salsa; this salsa was bland and watery. The chips were cold and stale; not sure when they made them, but I'm sure that it was not the day they served them to us... At this point I should have left and drove up the road to Azteca, Don Pedro or any of the other taco shacks the Queen City has to offer; but sometimes I am not so sharp so we proceeded to order lunch.

I ordered the chimichanga; now usually a chimichanga is a flour tortilla filled with a wide range of seasoned flavorful ingredients and deep fried until it is a golden brown color and slightly crispy on the outside. This thing was filled with bland, unflavorful, grayish colored "shredded beef" and was soggy, they then smothered it in some sort of unseasoned canned tomatoes that they tried to pass off as salsa, I assume to mask the lack of flavor in the dish itself. On the side was some wilted lettuce with sour cream and something that vaguely resembled guacamole, and some oily rice that was nearly as flavorless as the rest of the meal. Phenomenal. I managed to eat about a quarter of this flavorless, oily, soggy train wreck before I gave up and threw in the towel. 

When the server finally came back around several minutes later, she acted like she didn't even notice that none of us had eaten more than half of their meal, and quietly picked up the plates and brought us our checks. None of us were asked how our meal was, if everything was OK, if we wanted any desert or more chips and salsa, and none of us received a refill on our drinks.

All in all, this was one of the worse restaurant prepared meals that I have had the pleasure of experiencing. Kudos to the good folks at El Cancun
