Don't know how the actual food tastes here because the store decided to close up 30 minutes early. Went here because the yelp page said they close at 11 only to see everyone in the back, cleaning up already. I get it can be slow but change the hours then if that's the case. Instead, I just got a blank, annoyed stare from the employees inside who clearly saw me,  for coming by 30 minutes before closing. No words other than lazy come to mind.
