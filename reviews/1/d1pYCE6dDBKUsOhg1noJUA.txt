Food was ok. Nothing special. Wouldn't go there again mostly because the girl taking our order had a HUGE attitude and wasn't even listening when we were asking her questions. Pretty disappointing. Would have given a little higher rate if the service was better. Also paid $20 for two burritos and it totally wasnt worth the money.
