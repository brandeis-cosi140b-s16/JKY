Today I came to this qdoba and found a server getting a meal ready with out his gloves on. Then this lady failed to make my burrito even half way decent. Then the entire time I'm ordering I have to repeat myself over and over again. Ever since this qdoba went under new management it has gone downhill very fast. I used to come here 3 times a week now I'm hesitant to ever come back.
