I've had better Mexican food in a Bowling Alley Cafe!!

I could go off an on a rant for 7 paragraphs about how bad this place is and why but I will make it very simple for everyone;

Go to Fausto's, it's right down the street and is the best little Taquer√≠a in Las Vegas/Henderson by FAR! WAY better quality and quantity for a much better price.

p.s. If you have any doubt about my position in this then next time you take your money to SB, go ahead and stand up and watch them make your order. Nuff said...
