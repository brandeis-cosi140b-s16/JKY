Went here for a late dinner with the bfriend and his little nephew at 10pm (this place is open 24/7). We ordered 3 tacos al pastor, 1 quesodilla al pastor, 1 carne asade fries and 1 med horchata drink (free refill). The total came out to be $17ish.

The tacos were slightly warm when it came out. But shouldn't it be hot? I didn't think my order was that long for the food to go warm/cold. The pastor (marinated steak) meat in the tacos was soft , mushy-like and shreddy (which i didnt like--i think the meat is probably old because if meat is marinated for a long time, the acid from the marination breaks down the connective tissue of the meat causing it to be mushy/shreddy). The carne asade fries had skinny fries with melted cheddar cheese, guacomole, onions, a little sour cream, and carne asade meat. It also came out slightly warm and since the cook was a little heavy on the cheese, I felt like i was eating cheese-fries instead of carne asade fries. My horchata tasted like its been watered down-- it was slightly sweet, but there wasn't a strong cinnamon taste in the drink.    

My overall experience here wasn't memorable. I wouldn't come back. I think I would be more satisfied eating a Chalupa from Taco Bell!!!
