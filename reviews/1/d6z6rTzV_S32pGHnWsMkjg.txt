Ate here while staying at the South Point.  Well, at least it was priced reasonable.  Other than that it was nothing to write home about...at all!  The service was very poor (slow and kind of rude).  The food was not really good at all.  It didn't make us sick or anything, and it did fill us, but it just wasn't good.  But hey, when you are stuck at the casino, what are you going to do?
