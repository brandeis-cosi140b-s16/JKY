Very disappointed in this place. The food was expensive and tasteless and big name Casinos shouldn't allow such bad restaurants in them. I trusted the 'name' of Carlos n Charlie's but wish I had read the reviews before wasting my time and money. They even charge $5 for chips and salsa, which we didn't get and our lunch still cost $43, insane!
