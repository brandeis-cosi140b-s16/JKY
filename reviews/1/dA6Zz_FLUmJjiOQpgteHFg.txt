I liked this place untill I showed up around 3:30 ish pm, it was my first time going at that time and every single staff member was rude , just because I asked for a wheat tortilla and so along the line,I had a 2 for 1 cupon and they didn't seem to like this neither, if I really have to go back it would be in the morning ,they are nicer at this time,different shift different people.
