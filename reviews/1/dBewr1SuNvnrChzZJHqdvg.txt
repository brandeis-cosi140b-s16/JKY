This is by far the worse Mexican place I've ever been to!!! Other people who say this place is good have obviously never been to a real Mexican restaurant. The food is very Americanized and not authentic at all. The portions are super small for the price. Come on, $17 for 4 little tacos?!?!? I've had better tacos at Del Taco. I came here for a friends birthday, but I will never ever come here again. And for some reason, the cashier messed up and ended up charging $283 on my card when our bill was only $40. STAY AWAY!!!!!!
