My mom and Iwere the only customers in.the restaurant. I walked up to the young lady at the counter who was on headsets taking a complicated drive thru order.
So I waited and waited, you get the idea. While.I was waiting, a guy who is apparently a regular walked in and yelled his order directly to the kitchen. I don't remember if he actually got his food first. We were waiting so long, my mom had to sit down at a table. Finally the woman behind the counter was ready to take my order and apologized for the wait. Maybe they were shorthanded, so no biggie, it happens.
  When we got our food, it was awful. Probably the worst Mexican food I ever had. I had a chicken burrito that was filled with bland rice and tasteless chicken.
Mom had a ground turkey burrito and asked me where the turkey was.
    Why doesn't Del Taco take a cue from Pollo Loco? I've never had a bad meal at Pollo Loco. I can't understand how you can take essentially the same ingredients and have 2 such different outcomes.
 This Del Taco even makes Taco Bell seem like four star dining!
