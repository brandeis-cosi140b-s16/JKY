Been here a couple times. Continually getting worse. today was the last straw. Did drive thru, was shorted a meal, was asked repeatedly what I ordered by indignant counter girl. Finally got meal....portions are even smaller than 3 weeks ago. Used to be, meals would feed two adults easy, not any more. Burrito had hardly any cheese, carne asada plate had hardly any meat. They keep forgetting to give additional requested tortillas (they are good), but last straw was 7 1/2 hours after dinner tonight. girlfriend gets food poisoning from the chile relleno. Screw this place. Whatever the new management situation is, they have failed.
