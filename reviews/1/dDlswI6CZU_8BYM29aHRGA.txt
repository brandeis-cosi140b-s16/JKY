Ordered a Monterey burrito (carne asada, cheese and beans) husband ordered a big burrito (chile relleno, beans, rice cheese, guacamole, pico, and carne asada) we got both wet style. The enchilada sauce on top was disgusting! Super salty and gelatinous. Gross. How hard is it to make some real enchilada sauce or at least buy a good Cannes version. Carne asada was a grey color. No char marks or signs of quality grilling. Looked boiled. We both said our burritos smelled fishy and left with our hands smelling fishy. How was that possible with carne asada? Not going back. Should have listened to the other reviewer!
