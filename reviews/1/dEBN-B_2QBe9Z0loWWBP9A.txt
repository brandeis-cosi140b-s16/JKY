Went for tacos after the movie around 9:00 p.m.  Sign said they were open until 11:00 p.m. But chairs at several tables were already stacked.  Service was less than stellar.  No one in the place but still had to wait.  Food was fast and good!  Went back to order those delicious little caramel bites and waited....and waited while manager talked on his cell phone.  Finally made a comment regarding his being on the phone and too busy to wait on customers.  Then the guy who was taking drive thru orders finally took the order but with an attitude.  Another couple who came in after us received the same attitude.  We probably won't return to this Del Taco!
