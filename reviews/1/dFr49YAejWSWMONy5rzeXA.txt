I really, really want Saltys to be a cool place to go for breakfast on Sundays. There just aren't many options and those are all indoors and packed. 

They just seem surprised every Sunday morning when people show up and want to eat. 

They have these really cool omelette forms that you can fill out to build your own. The last 3 times I went there they were out of them shortly after opening. Once they told us the manager was making copies. Came back 20 minutes later with torn pieces of paper. 

We had a party of ten a few weeks ago and one didn't get their food for an hour and 20 minutes. The waitress kept asking if we had told the person who delivered our food. 

I finally went to the manager, who was totally unaware of the problem.

They need to hire ONE PERSON who knows how to run a food operation so he or she can tell the rest of them the basics. 

It is such a cool place to take people before spring training. It's too bad they haven't got a clue in the world of how to run a food operation.
