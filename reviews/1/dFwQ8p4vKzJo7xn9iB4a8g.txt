I've been here twice now, and the first time I loved it. I'm from San Diego and we have pretty high standards for good Mexican food since we're surrounded by it. The carne asada was delicious. The second time, I waited over 30 minutes for my burrito to be done, and people who ordered after me got their orders first. I was irritated, but it was the lunch rush so I was trying to be understanding. Then my burrito contained every nasty piece of meat. Fat, gristle, weird crunchy pieces, it goes on. Disgusting.  Overall I'd give their food a 4, but between the service and terrible quality of my most recent order it plummets to a 1.
