This place is terrible!  We had reservations and arrived on time but the only seating they had for us was a concrete booth with no cushions! We sat down and ordered our drinks which came out tasting like water with a lot of salt. Then after we had waited for 30 minutes for our food, the waitress came out and told us it would be another 40 minutes!  When the food did come they had gotten my order completely wrong and I had to wait some more while everyone else enjoyed their meal. When my tuna tacos did finally arrive, the tuna tasted like something out of a can. I will never eat here again!
