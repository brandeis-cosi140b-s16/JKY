Had the 6 taco platter Friday evening. Got 3 different tacos all so bland that we couldn't tell the chicken tacos from the fish. OK atmosphere - a band was getting read to play as we were leaving at 9:15 but can't comment on them. I don't like giving bad reviews but just had to warn others. Cannot recommend for the food, atmosphere, service or prices.
