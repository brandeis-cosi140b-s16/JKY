Two words, "stomach ache." No bueno. I had the worst stomach ache after eating a half order of carne asada fries. It totally sucked that they already had the carne asada cooked. I saw the cook spoon out a carne asada in a metal container. If it was freshly cooked right in place of the order, the quality would be way ~ better. I was pretty disappointed. The salsa bar was pretty unfortunate. I didn't like the salsa because it wasn't fresh and was very thick for the taste. I've tried better. The food was way too salty too.
