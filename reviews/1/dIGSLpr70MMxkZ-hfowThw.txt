The other 4-5 star reviews here are very suspicious. Based solely on the Yelp reviews, a group of 4 of us went to dinner on Sunday night-very quiet inside, maybe 1/2 full with not one person sitting at the bar. We knew something was wrong when it took 15 minutes to get the chips and salsa and  a few chips were in the basket- not your typical "overflowing basket o chips" as is usually the case at a good Mexican restaurant. The salsa was actually quite good.

That unfortunately was the highlight. It then took another 15 minutes to order drinks and Table Side Guacamole and place our entree order,

After another 15 minutes and after us asking, we got our drinks- but no guac yet. We waited about 20 more minutes and asked for the check. Never got the guac and didn't care to wait for the entrees suspecting they'd be as bad as the service- plus we didnt want a 3 hour meal.

Clearly they were understaffed, but we felt that the whole place did not live up to any of these suspicious Yelp reviews, It also looks nicer in the pictures than it really is- pretty cheaply decorated.

On the cab ride back to our hotel we told the cab driver the reason we went was the reviews. He too said he recently went and had bad service that took forever and he has no idea how they got these reviews.

One guy in our group was wary from the minute we pulled up and he was right- this place is just bad news. It is sitting on a skanky side street next to a strip club for a reason- most horny drunk guys wont care about a bad meal.
