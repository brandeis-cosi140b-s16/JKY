First time to Phoenix decided to get delivery since kids wanted to stay in the pool at hotel. Ordered 3 thongs 2 of which had beef at 430 pm and they told me they could only make 2 items because they ran out of meat. Wtf they don't close till 8pm so do you just stop serving Carne asada? Never again....
