This wouldn't pass for Mexican food in the valley outside of Fountain Hills.  All I ordered were beans and rice and I'm surprised by how bad it was.  

First, the portions were tiny for the price point, it was too salty, and when I asked for hot sauce the waitress started pouring tobasco sauce in a little plastic container.  Seriously?

I also asked the waitress if there was added oil in the beans to which she replied to, "No".  By the time I came back to my office the oil had dripped through the container and on to my legal pad.
