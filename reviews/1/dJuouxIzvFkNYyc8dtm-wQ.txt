okay.... so this is my 1st review as a yelper & unfortunately it is not a good one - I felt compelled to write this one asap! 

I work around the gilbert/baseline area & was excited to see a new taqueria opening up! I went today for the 1st time & was sorely disappointed. At 1st I thought "this is going to be awesome" because it was very busy and the food coming out looked good. I ordered my food to go so didn't make my discovery until I was back at the office! I ordered a combo plate with a fish taco & rice/beans. The beans were okay, but the rice bland. My 1st bite into the fish taco had a sweet flavor - completely not what I was expecting! I have to say the fish itself wasn't bad, it was grilled & not breaded... but with the sweet sauce - it wasn't very good. Here's the worst part... I also ordered a green corn tamale on the side- DON'T GET IT!! It was very dry & 1/2 of it was inedible! The salsas were okay - didn't try any of their specialty salsas but was intrigued. It is well overpriced for the quality of food I received!! 
So needless to say.... I may go back to try something else, maybe I ordered the wrong things? If it's better I will update my review. 

Sorry Tia, but so far.... no bueno!!
