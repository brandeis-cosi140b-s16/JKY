This was pretty damn close to the most disgusting meal I've ever been served.

I made the mistake of coming here for brunch on a saturday morning with the wifey while being wallet-raped by Danny's Car Wash for an oil change (see review).   It was open and across the street and I'd heard about it, so I figured what the hell. Big mistake, this meal didn't help my mood.   

The build your own omelette and bloody mary seemed great on paper.

I didn't even care that I had a waitress-in-training that had absolutely no clue what was going on.  After all, I had time to kill.  I guess taking a piece of paper from a diner to the cook and bartender is difficult labor requiring highly skilled and specialized employees.

But wait!  The bartender doesn't know how to make a mimosa?  A retarded monkey could make a mimosa.  In between flinging feces on the walls and picking fleas out of its hair.  That, at least, would have been entertaining.

So I'm going over my omelette choices.  No green bell peppers?  For real?  A "mexican" joint with no green bell peppers?  I actually wrote it in, hoping that this was an egregious oversight by the menu-making committee and they did actually have them.  I finished selecting my omelette fixins, including "chorizo".  

I received a plate with a pound of dog food and jalapeno peppers wrapped in an egg.  I'm positive not one morsel of this mystery meat was USDA approved for human consumption, let alone a massive pile of it.  And I'm positive jalapenos are not bell peppers.

You know what?  In retrospect, this was the most disgusting meal I've ever been served.  

Don't come here for food.
