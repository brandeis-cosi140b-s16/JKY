Nice counter people but terrible kitchen workers. This fifth time that I've had to head back after seeing that my order was wrong when opening my burritos will be the last. They've put shrimp in vegetarian burritos, no chicken in chicken burritos (who does that!? $9 bean and rice burritos )  and added onions to friends orders that asked for none and mentioned they were allergic. 

I'll never trust this one again. I wish they would put something else there because now it's just a waste of food space in my neighborhood. So the moral of the story is don't go here because they suck at taking direction and making burritos.
