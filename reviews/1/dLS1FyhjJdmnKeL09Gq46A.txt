I never review franchises unless the are bad. This taco bell is terrible. If I want taco bell I go further and more out of the way to get it. Service is terrible, they are always messing up an order and the drive through is always backed up. Several different people have worked here and they continue to be rude, and could care less about their work ethic. Avoid this place
