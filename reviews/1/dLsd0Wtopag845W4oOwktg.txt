I am not in general one to review a chain property as you would think a patron would be getting a mostly consistent experience from location to location.  Not so the case with the Fashion Show Chipotle.

First, it should be noted that this store is more expensive than the surrounding Chipotles.  I understand the rent for the building is probably pretty high, but that's a tax that seems to have landed on the customers.  Being that you are paying more however, unfortunately the portions are less than neighboring Chipotles.

The proteins are dished out in what looks more like garnish portions.  The meat should be the hero and not the after thought.  Ask for a more ample serving and you are charged double for what truly is a normal sized portion at any other location.

Eat there in a bind because you know what you're getting flavor wise.  Just don't hope to be satiated unless you want an $8 dollar burrito bowl.  For a store in a more lavish environment, they're exceedingly expensive yet wow, at the same time incredibly stingy!
