Horrible food.  Not sure what happened to this place but it used to have pretty good food. I took my family yesterday and my carnitas plate was burnt, my sons chicken tenders were burnt,   the rice tasted old, my tortillas were hard,  and my wife's taco meat was tasteless.  When I asked the waiter if we could exchange my son's tenders he took the plate back and brought them back looking even worse.  I will never return here and recommend you don't either, as the prices are pretty high for the quality of food.
