Awful. If I could give negative stars I would. The chicken in my bowl was raw and slimy or pink. I called to let them know they were serving raw chicken and the manager told me she could refund my money, but I would have to come back in for a refund. It could be reversed to my card Witt my receipt number. Horrible customer service. Cold food. I will never return. Hopefully I'm not sick all night from the few pieces I didn't spit out before I threw the whole thing away.
