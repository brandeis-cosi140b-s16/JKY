I came here last week and made my order over the phone I was excited because of all the great reviews here on Yelp. 
Unfortunately I was not pleased with my experience I ordered based off their online menu and apparently all their prices have gone up and they didn't fix the online menu yet so their Cilantro Fries went from 8.50 to 10.50!!! Are you kidding me they were not even very good they use steak fries instead of the skinny ones and I had it to go so they gave me a very small side of guacamole and sour cream that comes with it that was the part that upset me most! If im paying $10.50 for one entree I should get double the sides that they gave me and if you ask for more they charge you more!!!! Ridiculous these Mexican places out here are outrageous I'm
From San  Diego and you just don't have to deal with all this B.S. Out there of being ripped off... I paid 19.7-something for two items at this place and in my opinion it was nothing special or worth they're exaggerated  prices! I wouldn't recommend it!
