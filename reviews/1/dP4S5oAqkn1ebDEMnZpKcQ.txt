I went here once and then went back to try it again. After entering and observing, I realized that this was going to be the same exact underwhelming experience as the first time. As a matter of fact, they are pretty much a factory of that exact experience. Kind of annoying. 

The food was salty. Really salty. I've had so much better Mexican...I don't understand this place being successful here. I can only imagine that it is because we have so many transplants here in AZ and they have trouble trying places they don't recognize the name of. 

Its OK people. There are real Mexican's here who have been making food for years! Go to one of your local places, check it out. It will destroy this corporate blandness that has salt as its only spice.

You are on Yelp, you could look for a place near you! A Mexican place that only exists here in your town! Has no other locations 2500 miles away from Mexico. Its OK to adventure out of what you know! Its actually why some of us are Yelping, so you can go to the places that are good, not the ones that suck.
