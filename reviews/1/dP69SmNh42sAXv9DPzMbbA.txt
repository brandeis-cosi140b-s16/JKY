This place deserves an award for the most consistently awful service. I brought friends from abroad here and the waitress was so rude I was embarrassed. Another time we came and waited 40 minutes from the time we ordered (and nobody came to  give us drinks at all) and when we told them we were leaving, the food finally came out. No apology. I don't know how they stay in business. Their food isn't superb, the location isn't great, you would think they would go out of their way to make patrons come back.
