I've been coming to this location for quite some time. I enjoy the food and customer service. But who is in charge of scheduling!? When there's only 1 guy doing the cashiering, the cooking, the cleaning. Like really?! I feel sorry for this guy. Like WOW. My heart goes out to this lonely single hard working dude. My condolences...
