The worst taco I ever had in life. This place is so dirty!! The service is horrendous : different lines for different items. You get your food first and then you pay. Some people just walk out without paying. Kind of hard to tell who pays and who doesn't because it's so packed with drunks and smelly musty people inside. The lines are out of order--- not worth the wait and $$$. I came back into the room with my friends asking why I reek like onions--- damn you el gordo nasty crap taco!!!!
