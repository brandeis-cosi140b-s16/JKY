Although the food was decent (I used to live in San Diego, so I know what really good Mexican cuisine tastes like), I was somewhat alienated by the service I received, and felt like I was the victim of a bait and switch.

While placing my order for a burrito and chimichanga online, I opted to include chips and salsa with the chimichanga, which listed a cost of $0.50 to do so. I also asked for guacamole on the side in the notes for my chimichanga since adding guacamole wasn't an option. When I got there to pick my order 20 minutes later, it wasn't ready yet. Furthermore, I was informed that the chips and salsa were actually $1.99, and that there was an error with the price ordering through yelp. Rather than giving me the benefit of the doubt for their mistake, I had to pay 4 times the cost for the chips and salsa that I had agreed to when placing my order. I was also informed the guacamole was $1 extra for a tiny cup of it on the side.

Another 10 minutes or so later, I got my order, and took it home for my gf and I to eat. The chimichangas were pretty good, but apparently her burrito wasn't very good, and the main ingredient in it appeared to be lettuce.

Based solely on the food, I'd say this place would be a 3 star joint. But based on them sticking it to me for their pricing mistake, and the length of time it took to get my order (BTW, when I got there, they didn't seem at all busy), the cost of the order (nearly $20), and the overall quality, I'm giving them a 1. Hopefully this will balance out the current undeserved (IMO) 4 star rating.
