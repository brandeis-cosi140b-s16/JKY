Horchata was sour and they were out of soda. Empty restaurant had crumbs on the floor. Napkins are kept hidden in the back and bathroom is locked. I found this out the sip of my rotten drink. 106 out and I don't think the ac is any lower 85 (being generous).  Couldn't even finish my burrito before giving up. Over all a  never again.
