Diarrhea inducing shit food is what you'll find at Tacos Jalisco. It's pretty authentic if your idea of Mexican food is Rocky Point. It's dog turds... Rocky Point side of the road tacos are good only because you spent all weekend drinking nothing but beer and you're drunk... the reality is, it barely counts as food.

My roommate swears by it and eats there frequently, but I had trouble digesting it. He lived in Argentina for like a year, so maybe that's why he likes it. Plus, he is fluent in Spanish. It's the kind of place you would feel a lot more comfortable at if you spoke Spanish. 

It seems to always be crowded. The tables are always dirty and it's hot and smelly inside. There are so so many good Mexican food restaurants in the valley - many that are authentic. This place is benefiting from the location because it is right on the edge of little Mexico in south Scottsdale. It's seriously dump though - terrible food made from garbage ingredients. Best thing I can say about it is that it's cheap.
