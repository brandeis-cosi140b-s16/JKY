Don't go to this location unless you're okay with in waiting the drive-thru for atleast 20 minutes.  Apparently a malfunction of some kind at their location caused a huge wait in the drive through on my visit; I was stuck for 20 minutes and only got an "I'm sorry for the wait" when I FINALLY got to the window.

I was so angry about my experience that I even did the survey on the back of the receipt. I doubt anyone will follow up about it, but this was the straw that broke the camel's back. I will NOT return to this location. Every single time my husband or I have gone, there's been an issue.

This location is a train wreck.
