Why didn't I read this before I sat down and ordered. 
This is an airport people are on the GO!!! If I wanted that "slow" southern feel then I wouldn't be at the airport. 
Terrible service. I can't name anything good. Food was bland. Waitress running around all crazy but only had 3 tables. Airport service requires you to be proficient and fast. They lacked EVERYTHING.
