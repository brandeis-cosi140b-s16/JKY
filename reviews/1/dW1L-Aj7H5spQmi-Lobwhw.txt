I came here for lunch and was really not impressed. The lady behind the counter had her food-handling gloves on while she was sweeping the floor and cleaning up the place, and then she came over to take our orders while handling the money and cash register with her gloves still on. 

Can you guess what she did next? You bet... she went right over and started handling our food with her dirty gloves. I spoke up and asked her if she was going to change her gloves and she replied "Why?" I told her and she replied "Oh, don't worry the broom is always clean." I explained again and she finally acquiesced. 

OK, so now let's talk about the food... I had one chicken and one steak taco. The most notable flavor on the chicken was a burnt taste. She charred the crap out of it. Now on to the steak... it was overcooked to the point of losing all its juices, so it was very dry and chewy. Completely underwhelming. 

This place is clearly an after-dark spot where all the drunken people from Whiskey Row can grab some fast food to soak up all that alcohol. To that crowd, things like flavor, quality and cleanliness probably don't matter so much. But to me, they matter very much and this place absolutely failed in my experience.
