I ordered food for 40 people this past weekend and when I got there to pick it up I was shocked to see how small little there was. This was not going to feed 40! The manager told me that their serving sizes are based on what they presume a person eats, which is (1) serving size... What?!  You mean most people don't serve themselves twice?? I know I do. I ordered Chile Verde and it did not look like Chile "Verde" it was a brown ugly color and not green???  All the food was Waaaaaay too salty and I was very embarrassed by it!!  I will Never order from Somburros Ever again!!!
