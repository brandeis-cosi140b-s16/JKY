Not as good as I had hoped! I should have known because there was nobody in the place at dinner time.

I walked in and wanted to order carry out and was handed a menu. I ordered a Carne Milanese but was informed that they were out of that. I opted instead for the carne asada entrée.

Waiting for my order I noticed a couple things. First, that the inside of the place is dirty, old and not somewhere I'd want to sit down and eat at. Second, that Burrito King and Tortica's Grill are synonymous. The menu said Burrito King but the outside sign says Tortica's. 

My entrée came with a whole bunch of stuff including the carne asada, rice, beans, 3 tortillas, pico de gallo with lettuce and guacamole and also chips and salsa.

Unfortunately, I didn't think any of this stuff was very good. The beans were just OK and the rice, guacamole, chips and salsa were all sub-par. The carne asada was pretty awful. It was two very thin pieces of tough, flavorless meat that I was seriously questioning if it was actually steak. I had to put my own hot sauce on to make it bearable.

I paid $11 for all this and was not satisfied with what I got. The portion size is good, but who wants a large amount of crappy food?

Not this guy, 1/5.
