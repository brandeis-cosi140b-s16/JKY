Went here today..
 Sat for a while before approached. Finally, ordered a carne asada torta and a el pastor
taco and a water.  Got my son a taco from the kids meal..
Waited a long time to get our food. No A/C. No Chips or Salsa was ever brought or offered. 
When it takes a long time, you start to look around hoping that your food order is the next one to comin out. I saw what I thought was our food given to a table of patrons that came in and got seated after us. After the waiter left, the people at that table flagged him back over. About a minute or so later, he went back to retrieve food from other people and brought it to our table. So, it WAS our food!! :/
Went to salsa bar and it was empty as in not plugged in/being used. Ate a dry torta that had less meat($7) then my son's street taco($2). ALL BREAD. 
NEVER got my water or my El Pastor taco that I ordered so I can not comment on that. 
This Place Blows..
It was soooo White people "Mexican Food". 

Bottom Line..
If your looking for a slower, pricier version of Roberto's that uses metal forks, this is the place.
