No don't do it... Don't eat here! I've been to this location twice. I didn't learn the first time. But that's me... I'm a person that will give second chances. The workers are really rude andi thought she was jus maybe having a bad day or PMSing...but when i went back for a second time i realized that she is just a really rude person and the burritos are just not good, they're edible but that's all. Bad attitude+bad food=BAD BAD BAD. ¹/² star is more like it.
