The moment I walked in I thought this was a very cool place with a nice atmosphere.  It was hard not to notice how empty this place was at 8PM at night.  That is usually a very busy time.  

The food here was way over priced for what you get, The drinks were soo weak that I didn't even have a second one, very rare for me.  2 of my friends had Long Islands and being a bartender for 10 years I know exactly how it is supposed to taste, only thing is that all I tasted was sweet and sour mix.  They even tried to send them back, only the waitress returned and said "sorry, it is what it is"  Now we did not hold this against the waitress, in fact that was the only positive thing about this place.  

I can see how this place is run and if it is still around through the summer, I will be amazed.  

Overall:
The food is ok at best!
The drinks are HORRIBLE!
The music sucked!
but
The Service was great!

My advice, if you want a good drink... go next door to Dilly Dally, you won't have to wait 10 minutes and you will actually get a good drink for half the price!
