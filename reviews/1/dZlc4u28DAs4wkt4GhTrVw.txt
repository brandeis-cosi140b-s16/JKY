Monday lunch,first time experience.House salsa has a strong taste of store chili powder,chips are Costco like .Red sauce on enchiladas was so bold had to take all the bland rice and mix it into enchiladas to eat it,tried a plate of lime to hide the bold almost scorched taste. Refried beans with a few shreds of cheese,needed rice added to it. We had a $6 lunch special,and wished we had not had to pay,would have been mad had we paid $10.Enchiladas were at least half the size of any other places enchiladas.Will never eat there again.Guest felt exactly the same about her meal,the same item except with mild green sauce,that was not mild but hot.We even thought of adding table sugar to our food to make it less bold.Mexican is my favorite food,this was TV dinner Mexican food.Service,was bad,they brought chips and salsa,and after 5-10  minutes we still had no water,no napkins and no silver ware.How can you eat salsa and chips without napkins.Were they busy,NO,4 tables of people heart of lunch hour,and 3 waiters,now and know why no one was there at lunch time.
