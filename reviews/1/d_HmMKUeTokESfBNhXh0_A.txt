What a joke!!! After a lovely date night with my husband, we decided to stop and watch the football game and have a couple beers. The female bartender not only spills my beer on the bar, it spilled all over my phone, my purse and me.... She only was concerned about my phone and the bar countertop. She didn't offer to wipe my purse or offer to give me a towel to dry myself up. I had to ask for one. And to top it off, charged me for it!!! Good job bartender!! A comped beer wouldv'e been the right thing to do.....
