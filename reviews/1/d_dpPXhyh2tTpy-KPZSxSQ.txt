I gave this place a try and the menu is an exact carbon copy of crappy Roberto down to the bland taste .  I believe this is own by Roberto and they decided to have another shop in the Main Street and changed the name since Roberto is right around the corner. I'm not coming back here since I not a fan of Roberto and yes I had really good Mexican burrito before and Roberto is crap.
