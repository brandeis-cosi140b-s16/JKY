By far the worst taco bell I've ever been to. Waited 25 minutes in the drive thru line, paid and was asked if I wanted sauce then had to wait longer still. I had to ask for sauce tho I was asked when I gave my money. No napkins either. I will never return to this location and will recommend others don't either.
