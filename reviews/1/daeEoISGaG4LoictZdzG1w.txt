I just picked up a Arizona burrito. The burrito was cold and the meat was un-eatable. I figure since it was the only thing open I would give it a shot. I feel like it needs to be good since they stay open 24hours. I am very disappointed that I spent 7$ and my time waiting to get a burrito that sucked! If it wasn't 12:45am I would go get my money back!
