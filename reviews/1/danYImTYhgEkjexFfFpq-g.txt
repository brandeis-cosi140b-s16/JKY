I go out quite a bit. I also judge restaurants on peticular dishes. This place had the worst cheese burrito ever. It was made of white cheese? The same cheese they used for their queso blanco. Which wasn't that bad but MUCH to creamy for anything to be in a burrito. I guess I expect an orange cheese or at least a good cheese that is melty and hot. Not lukewarm and almost solid. Rice and beans were what they were. Didn't have high hopes and they didn't dash them. I just feel like it could have been so much better. I would never go back. Downvote.
