Second time I have come in this place mid afternoon both times on Sunday's and have walked right out because I receive no service at all. Literally. Walk into the bar and sit down. No bartender?Ask for a table from employees sitting down in booths. Get sat finally, no server anywhere to take my order? Need some serious help in this place. Probably start at the top.
