I think this place is over priced for the overly salted food and no flavor on the shredded beef burrito not good at all. Not to say the really slow and bad customer service. The entire time the two waitress were sitting down and it took them over 20 min to ask if we needed anything else. 
Sorry but will not come back even if I didn't have to pay. I'm not the one to ever review but this place is no good at all!
