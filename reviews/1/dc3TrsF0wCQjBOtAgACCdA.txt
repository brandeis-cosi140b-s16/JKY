How horrible to give me a terrible attitude while i am ordering food from your resturant. I dont care if your having a bad day, you shouldnt treat customers with such horrible attitude! 
First my bowl had no food in it! What is that when i have to keep asking to ut more in my bowl? I aske for lettuce i got literally 3 pieces of lettuce, asked for more please and she gave me such a horrible attitude... Had to ask again! 
Makes me sick i had to pay 7.50$ for half an oder of what i ordered! 
Crap service i cant believe this place! Check my photo!
