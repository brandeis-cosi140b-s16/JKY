Me and my girlfriend went here on our date night, since its less than a mile from our place! We got seated pretty fast, but it went downhill from there. Our waiter was nowhere to be seen, and at least 3 employees passed us by without saying a word. We were hungry and thirsty but after 10 minutes of waiting, we decided that they didn't need our business and we left! Very disappointed!! Luckily there is a Garcias right down the street, and we had excellent service as usual.. Don't waste your valuable time on La Fonda's
