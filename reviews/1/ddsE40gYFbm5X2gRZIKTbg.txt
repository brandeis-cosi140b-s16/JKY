I ate at the Sandbar last Thursday and I got food poisoning. I know it couldn't have been anything else because I hadn't eaten anything since breakfast and didn't have anything after. I had a well done burger and sweet potato fries which tasted great and I was up puking all night. I only drank one beer and I felt fine the next day so it wasn't a stomach bug. I will never go back again!
