This location is awful.  Ordered a chicken burrito and it was raw!  Service is bad, too.  I contacted corporate and they said the owner would contact me, but never did.  Hot sauce is different here, too.  I NEVER go to this Filiberto's even though it is the one closest to my home.  Filiberto's restaurants vary greatly which is too bad.  If they improved consistency and had better customer service, it would be great.  The food, when prepared properly, is very good and reasonably priced.
