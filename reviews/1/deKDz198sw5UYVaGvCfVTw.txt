I love Chipotle. For the price and the amount of food you get, it's a major bargain. BUT, this location sucks so bad. I moved into a new area and this is the closest location to my house. Of the 5+ times I've gone here, the quality has been sub par at least 4/5 times. The consistent issues seem to be long wait times (even if there are 6 people working the line), cold food, a 5+ minute wait on rice and meat (during and not during peak times), and poor customer service. I realize this is the only one in the area but if you can avoid it, you should.
