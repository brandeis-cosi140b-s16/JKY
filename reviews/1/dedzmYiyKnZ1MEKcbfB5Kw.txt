Not impressed, amigos. 
We came in with high hopes after reading the reviews. Only five occupied tables at 8:00 on a Saturday night should have been a sign. The weak tamarindo flavored margarita was the best part of the meal. We ordered chicken nachos, two beef burrito platters (which came with French fries...? Huh?) and shrimp/crab enchiladas. We waited at least 20 minutes for our entrees in an empty restaurant, and when the food came, it was incredibly bland and beyond Americanized. Our waiter never came back to check on us, aside from asking once whether we wanted more margaritas. (Not for $7, buddy. Main Street Station .99Â¢ margaritas, here we come!) We had to ask for our check three times, and even when all three of us declined boxes for our nearly full plates, he never once asked if the food was okay. 

We won't be back. Stick to Lindo, Super Mex, hell... even Roberto's! Very disappointed to have spent $70 on a poor meal with poor service.
