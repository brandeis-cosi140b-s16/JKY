What happened to you Sylvia's?!?! Have been going to Sylvia's for over ten years and have always been a fan. My recent experience was horrible. Service was terrible, was difficult to even get water! Several other tables were in arguments with the manager which made for a less than pleasant experience. Thought the food would still be good but nope! Food was dry and possibly microwaved. I won't ever go back, it's a shame.
