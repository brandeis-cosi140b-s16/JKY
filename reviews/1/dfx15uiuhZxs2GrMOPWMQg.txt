This place is filthy inside and looks like it is not kept up very well.  Service is slow even when they hardly have any customers. Their Tuesday tacos is good, get the shreaded beef tacos vs the chicken. The chicken is to watery and does not taste all that good. Prices are fair , food is okay but nothing special.
