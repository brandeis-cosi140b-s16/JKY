If you're looking for good Mexican food then stay away from this restaurant. I've had the worst meal I've ever had here, by far. The oysters we ordered were old...not fresh at all. The molcajete we ordered was supposed to include clams, shrimp, and scallops. They were not in there and when we questioned the waiter we were told that they did not have scallops or clams on hand. We were told they 'threw' in some extra mussels. The fajitas that we also had ordered were dry and unappetizing. Even the simple rice and beans were awful. The service was extremely slow on top of the awful food. My take - Stay away.

We found this place using a Groupon - Usually when using a Groupon there is no problem. With this place - WRONG. The Groupon purchased was $24 for a $40 meal. Upon presenting the Groupon we were informed not very politely that there had to be 4 people. There were 3 of us. That was the first caveat that this place was not going to be a good dining experience. The old oysters that we were served got sent back. When presented with the bill they did not deduct for the oysters that were sent back nor for the seafood missing from the molcajetes. They charged full price for their bad food. They proceeded to deduct the $40.00 Groupon but somehow the bill came out to the full $40.00.... $24.00 for the Groupon price plus the extra $16.00 that they made the bill out for.

So again....please don't patronize this restaurant as the food is awful, the service is awful, and on top of that - they do not honor the Groupon correctly. If there was a way to give them negative stars I would.
