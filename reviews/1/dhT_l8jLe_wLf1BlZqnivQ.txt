So I love to support small businesses and I read such amazing reviews from others but I will never return. The place was dirty, all the tables were nasty. They had no forks or ice for your drink and communication was difficult. I thought that, "oh well at least the good will be good". WRONG. Everything was bland and taste as if it came out of a can. The chips were stale and the chicken tacos I had were sloppily thrown together and dry! So disappointed.
