Called in for a Togo order and I asked the guy, David, what kind of shrimp dinners they have. He says, "All we have is a shrimp burrito." I say, "Well.....I thought there was garlic shrimp." He says, "Oh yeah, there's that and the burrito. I agree to the garlic shrimp even though I wanted ranchero. But, David insisted that it doesn't exist. I get there and see ranchero on the menu. I was totally pissed and the level of customer service was so low that I never return. To add insult to injury, David says he's the manager. Pitiful!
