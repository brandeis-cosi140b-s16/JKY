It's easier to come to this location as its close to my house, however its gone down hill in the past 2 months. 
As I was waiting to complete my order the gentleman on the line was so rude to the guy in front of me. He asked if they had corn, and the employee says "no, this is not chipotle " . Wow, ok. As its my turn now, I get my order quickly and proceed to check out. The girl at the register was really sweet I have to add. While I'm getting my drink there's customers stocking the soda station.

They need new management and a giant upgrade.
I'll definitely make the drive to a further location to have slightly better customer service
