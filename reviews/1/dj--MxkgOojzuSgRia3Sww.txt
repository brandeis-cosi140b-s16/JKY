Seems like every time I go the people working get my order wrong.They then get upset at me when they were clearly not listening or (I suspect) there is a language barrier problem... since this has happened more than once I make a special effort to say my order clearly and slowly. Also the employee in question always is really rude and acts upset when they mess up and they have to make the burrito again. For example I said no sour cream and they slather it with it.... etc. So I started ordering online for pickup instead thinking that would solve the problem but when we went to pick up our order they gave me an empty bag stapled shut with the receipt on it. No burrito inside. What the heck!?? The location is convenient to me but it looks like I will have to start giving it a pass because I've given it more than enough chances.
