My husband and I have been going to Salsa Cabana for the past four years. I have recommended them to several people as their food was great. We mainly went on Sunday night as there was a man that worked there by himself every Sunday. He also worked at Rosatis he was awesome. Since he left half the time the are closed on Sunday it is hit or miss but tonight was the worst. We walked in at 6:25 (they close at 7 it says on the door) and before I can reach the. counter in front of customers who are eating a man yells out to us we are closed and like hand motions cutting his throat . BAD BUSINESS PRACTICES.
