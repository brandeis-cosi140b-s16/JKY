PLEASE DO NOT EAT HERE! They are dishonest and will purposely rip you off!! All I wanted was a carne asada burrito. You know, with grilled steak, pico de gillo and guacamole. They charged me 7 dollars for a small burrito (half the size of chipotle) with, I kid you not, greasy low quality meat wrapped in a tortilla. They charged me for guacamole and there was not any. And obviously the pico was M.I.A. I complained several times saying that this was not what I wanted and they refused to make things right and sent me on my way. First of all, 7 dollars for a low grade meat burrito at a greasy Mexican fast food restaurant is unacceptable considering I can get an actual carne asada burrito for almost half the price and twice the side at Fiesta Burrito just down the street. If you're smart and want to get value for your money in this recession...than you better think twice before going here.
