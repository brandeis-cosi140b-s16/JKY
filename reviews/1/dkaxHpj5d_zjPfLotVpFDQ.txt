The only thing I can say about this place is that "it's better than Taco Bell". Actually "It's Better Than Taco Bell" should be its slogan.

The first thing that should alert you is when the owner (25-year-old son of a Las Vegas casino mogul) says that "there's no good Mexican food in Phoenix".

I guess charging $10 for some Fritos dip and $25 more for some "better than Taco Bell" food is the way to go. . . if you're a millionaire and don't care about your product.

I went here once to try it out, and two more times I was dragged with friends. It got worse each time. Really, it's not worth it. There are other places to eat horrible food and be tragically hip in.

But, hey. If you're holding your crisp 50-dollar-bill and can't decide between 40 tacos from Taco Bell or an incredibly lackluster meal surrounded by hipsters in an overrated restaurant... give it a shot.
