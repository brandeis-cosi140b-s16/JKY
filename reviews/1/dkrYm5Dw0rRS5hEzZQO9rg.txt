Use to love Cafe Rio when we lived in Idaho, went all the time! I was pretty excited that they were coming to Goodyear. First visit was barely ok, prices are higher, very slow no hard tortillas for tostada had to wait, breaking down line at 8:30pm and not great guest service at all. The second time was again like the first but something seemed very salty (beans or chicken?) to the point I couldn't finish it. The vanilla coke looked light so I waited for the cashier who had disappeared, so I waited till she returned and she was like oh yeah we're out, so you'll have to pick something else. Ok?
I use to love Cafe Rio as it was something I could grab that was priced well, fresh and everyone liked at home. What happened to the old Cafe Rio I remembered ?
