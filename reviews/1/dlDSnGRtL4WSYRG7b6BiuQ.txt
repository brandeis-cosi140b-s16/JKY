Don't come here! I called to order food for a company party. I specifically told them I need it at 10:50, got there at 10:55 to give them a few minutes. 11:20 the food is still not ready!!!! They made me late to the party. Never bothered to call and tell me it wouldn't be ready and they were not that apologetic either. There are a few other salvadorean restaurants near them, spare yourself, and choose anyone but this one!
