Mexican food..?? Far from it...save your money and stay away. El Torito food is 100% better than these. I have no problem paying for good food but $20 for one hard she'll taco which you can't bit the shell. Hard as rock and enchilada with green sauce.. Let say I spent most the night in bathroom sick as refunding.
