The food might of been okay other than I was given my friends food and vice versa!!!  We did not order the same food!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  The girl made our sandwich with Eric interrupting and being rude the whole time!  Who could work in that situation?  Eric ran his mouth from the time we walked in the restaurant until we left!  He flirted with the girl working and carried on an inappropriate conversation with the lady after us!  I think someone working should talk but within business like conversation!!!!!
