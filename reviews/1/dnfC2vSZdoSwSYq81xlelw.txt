as i was waiting for my raspados happily in line imagining the awesome taste..... i finally got my vanilla and pistachio snow cone. then i nearly threw up in my mouth when to my surprise a big ass curly hair saluted me ; /      i then walked back to the counter and noticed the owners mullet and realized that hair belonged to him!!! i nicely told them and proceeded to show them the not so fun surprise....and they nervously smiled and asked if i wanted a new one....NO THANKS!!!! ill have my money back.... word of advise raspados neza owners invest in some nifty hair nets!!!!
