I went a couple of times before they changed the name logo,only for breakfast. It was ok. Atmosphere not so good in the main dining. If you can't put out a decent breakfast,I'd hate to see lunch and dinner-it was adequate,but not great. And too many gnats,which was a turnoff. I much prefer the little place down the street --Mercer's. Clean,friendly,better food.
