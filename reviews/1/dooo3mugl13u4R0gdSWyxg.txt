Stay away!!!! The girl was rude as all hell. I asked for 3 tacos de res (beef) 2 tacos de pollo (chicken) a burrito carnitas 2 orders of chip and 2 guacamoles 1 carne asada burrito. Upon paying $40.00 I reviewed the order and questioned the tacos. I said excuse me I ordered tacos de res not asada. She very rudely answered you asked for beef I said yes not asada she said beef is asada I asked do you have shredded? She said yes but you asked for beef going back and forth a few times I said give me shredded period. She rolled her eyes said something to the cook he answered yeah well I have all day in Spanish. First time there and for sure the last time. What a shame. The food is not all that either maybe her attitude jacked it up for me. Mr Roberto time for a change in staff. The loosee location BITES
