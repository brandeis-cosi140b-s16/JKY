I wish I could give zero stars that's how bad it was. First off my order had rice but the lady that dropped it off was not my waitress and gone so fast I couldn't even say anything. My waitress no where to be found. I scrapped the rice off and left it on the side of the table in plain view. My chile relleno was so bland and the so called egg batter was only a cooked egg with zero flavor which I added to the rice plate. Waitress finally walks by does not acknowledge us. I have eaten only two bites. I finally have to ask bus boy for check. Waitress comes over gets money. I'm heated so say nothing. She comes back and says to me do you want a to go box. Are you serious? Bye the way at this point I have added everything back on the original plate and set in on the edge of the table. I just laughed and said no way. We will never eat here again!
