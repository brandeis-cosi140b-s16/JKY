I moved to Phoenix over 12 years ago. I've always been a lover of authentic Mexican food, I'm from Tucson so I know. I was introduced to this place to try so that I could satisfy my craving.  My family and I have eaten here several times over the years and the food was always decent.  I've always taken to go orders so I never got to meet the management or owners.  A month ago, I was passing through the neighborhood and decided to stop in to pick up two chimis for dinner.  Although mines was cool, the other that I ordered was incorrect.  Therefore,  not as satisfying.  I called and spoke with management and was told that I could come back at a later time to pick up my correct order that I PAID FOR! . I tried picking it up a couple weeks later (since I don't live in the area) and got the run around since the manager on duty had not told anyone about the mistake and replacement that I was due. Today,  I have the opportunity to speak with the alleged owner, Richard and he was very rude, didn't care about me and I wasn't rude to him at all. He had the audacity to hang up in my face because although I said I would pick up the replacement chimi sometime today,  I couldn't give him a specific time. WTF!!!  He can have that damn chimi, respect goes along way and I didn't see it. I'm not bitter, my birthday is tomorrow and I'm going to enjoy another blessed year. But,  la canasta don't EVER have to worry about me, my family or my friends visiting here again.  Your food alright,  but it will NEVER be more important than respect!.
