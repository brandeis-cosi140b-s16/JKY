Do yourself a favor and save your money you'll thank me for this anytime I've ever eat Roberto's I wake up the next day feeling like I ate a bowling ball the food is always tremendously greasy they do a decent late night crowd but its all the drunks trying to ward off a hangover I recommend you go to Fausto's instead much better food
