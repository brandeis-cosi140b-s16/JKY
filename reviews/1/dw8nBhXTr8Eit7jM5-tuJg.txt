I went with a friend here to celebrate New Year's and we were quite disappointed in the food. Our server, no doubt, was fabulous, but the food was completely subpar, especially when you have places like Maize, El Toro, or even Q'doba who seem to have gotten it right. 

Our guacamole left much to be desired. I make guacamole all the time, but this had a taste that it had been left in the fridge for a day or two, and was not a bright green color that would have indicated freshness. It was extremely acidic, but perhaps that was so you didn't realize the avocado was not fresh? The chips that supplied the guac were extremely flimsy, and not designed to be any kind of dipping chip, especially not with something as heavy as the guac. We did not ask for seconds.

The drinks were strong but it felt and tasted like cheap tequila. It didn't settle well with my friend and I. The names are cute and they sure entice you, but I'm pretty sure the chef/bartender/owner has had no real experience with amazing drinks.

The menu is surprisingly small, and they do tacos as basically their center focus, although there are some other things on the menu. I wasn't in a taco mood so I ordered the carne asada, and my friend the pork dish. The pork was good, the carne asada had a decent flavor, and the food came out fast. However, these plates were not worth $13. This same meal at El Toro or even at Maize would be cheaper and fresher. 

In summary, we were disappointed that we started our evening there, and even more disappointed when we left and went to Big Grove Tavern because for $13, they were serving roasted chicken and vegetables, something you know was high quality based on where they get their ingredients and the overall knowledge that their chef knows what they are doing. 

We give Wedge a year before it closes. Unless of course someone is brought in to give the menu and the chef a revamp so that people want to come back.
