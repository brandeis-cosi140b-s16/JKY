First I have to say that the food is decent. I wish you could review differently for food v. service! Have you ever been to a restaurant where you feel like you are an inconvenience just by virtue of the fact that you are a customer? The staff here is RUDE and no courteous at all. The food is awesome and that is why I went there but they really nickle and dime you. I ordered the vegetarian burrito and I was told that adding veggies ( TO THE VEGGIE burrito!!) was more than a dollar extra. Another couple said they were overcharged for their chips and salsa. The cashier told me that they now keep all of the hot sauce behind the counter because customer will take it! Next time I will stick with good ol' Chipotle!!
