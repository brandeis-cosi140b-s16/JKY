Nasty! Worst Mexican food ever!! I rarely give out bad reviews... but this place deserves it!! First off, I know food in Vegas can be a bit overpriced, but this place is the worst ever! First off, the service was terrible! I know it's a fast food type of place but that doesn't mean you need to be so rude when taking orders! Besides, this place is inside a hotel so service should be better anyways! Not all the workers were rude, but the girl taking orders and training the new workers was the worst. She snapped at not only the customers but also the people she was training and talked to people as if they were stupid and didnt understand English. The prices at this place are ridiculous go what you get- the worst tasting Mexican food ever! It was $10 for a burrito and the burrito was so gross. The food here is ridiculously dry! The burrito has rice (no flavor), choice of meat (I got a little bit of each - steak was disgusting dry, bland, and waaaaay overcooked. The other meats tasted sweet like dessert-gross!), beans, and cheese. We also got a taco platter for my friend's daughter. Worst tacos ever! My friend's daughter about choked on it because it was sloppily dry! All they put on it was a few shreds of cheese... and like 3 pieces of carne asana... NO lettuce! We couldn't believe it! I have never seen a taco so dry and stingy. It felt like the stuff was being weighed by the ounce! Look at my pictures if you don't believe how gross they are! There are other foods in the food court here at MGM. Go eat at the others ones! They are so much better. Also, everything here costs extra... and its super expensive too!  Something standard and simple as sour cream costs extra... and it was $1 for a tiny scoop! I will never never ever eat at this place again! Not only was it bad food, but it was terrible service AND expensive! If I could give this place negative stars, I would!!
