Never again. I was so excited to try this restaurant based on the reviews but was disappointed by their service. First, they served chips with salsa (which was good) but for a party of 5, they served very little. We asked for more and they told us they had ran out of chips. Wait, that wasn't even the problem. I was the first to get my carne asada burrito and our waitress says, "we gave you extra beans because we've ran out of rice. Is that OK?" I didn't want to be rude about it but what kind of Mexican restaurant runs out of chips and rice? Oh, needless to say, they served canned soda, and when we asked for another Pepsi...guess what they said? They ran out! I wouldn't recommend this restaurant. Rosita's place, which is a block down was beyond better!
