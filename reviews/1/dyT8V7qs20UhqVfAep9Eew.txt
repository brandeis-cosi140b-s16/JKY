I LOVE Taco Bell. I LOVE it! 

I HATE this Taco Bell. I have no understanding of why it takes MINIMUM 5 minutes to order and 5 minutes to get your food, when the 35th Ave and Southern is SO much faster, and the people are nicer. I don't understand why at 6:30 after work it takes MINIMUM 15 minutes for "fast food". If I ever want Taco Bell fast, I NEVER come to this one because there is zero hustle. I am swearing off this Taco Bell and will go to the other location forever now.
