Zero stars had the worst experience had the waitress be rude, demanding, & pushy. I was told to switch seats & to hurry up & order to pick something quick! When i go to a restaurant im paying for good food & friendly accommidating service. I want to be able to sit down especially if the whole place is empty wherever i feel comfortable. I want to enjoy my time in peace let it be relaxing just serve me whith a smile is that too much to ask.
