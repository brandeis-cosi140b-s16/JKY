Service was awesome.  But other than that, the rest is a trending spiral of disappointment.  The ambiance- none. The Food - almost approaching mediocre. The drinks- expensive and either watered down (hubs) or funny tasting (mine).  Not worth the price of the Groupon.  The best I can say is that their other location is worse so this location is a 1/2 step above.
