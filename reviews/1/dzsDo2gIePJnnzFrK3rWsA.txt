So over priced and extremely small portions. The waitress made us table side guacamole and it was inedible because she put so much lime in it. Also, my friend and I sat at the table and chatted for about 20 min and the waitress kept walking by with an evil eye. The place wasn't busy nor was it close to closing time. I wouldn't recommend eating here. So many other great Mexican places. Also the website doesn't show a menu.
