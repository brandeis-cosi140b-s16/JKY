I stopped by for a quick lunch today, but I am NEVER going back there!!! I ordered the two soft tacos pictured on their menu (one fish and one carnitas). Halfway through the fish taco I bit into something hard...and big and long!!! (I think the smaller, hard stringy thing in the first part of the taco that I ate around was connected to it.) I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THIS WAS! It wasn't like a kitchen utensil, it was more like a flat piece of backbone from a chicken. Before they gave me my money back, they poked around on it with a plastic fork and decided they didn't know what it was.

I'm glad I didn't have to eat the carnitas, they looked stringy and HARD and weird.

The best fish tacos I've ever had were at Baja (fresh fast food) in the Los Angeles area of California: these tasted awful and were literally oozing mayonnaise. I know what great tacos taste like, btw--the best I've ever had were next to the bull ring in Tijuana from a little vendor on the side of the road there in the 1980's.

I can't believe I didn't vomit after that horrible thing that was in the fish taco. I'm just crossing my fingers that I don't go through a bout of food poisoning tonight.

UGGHHH.
