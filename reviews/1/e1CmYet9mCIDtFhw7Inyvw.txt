I used to come here literally once a week. My staples were the cheese crisp, chips and salsa, Red Corn Chicken Taquitos, Cheese Enchiladas, Chicken Maxamillian and I have tried just about everything on their menu. 

I was here opening day at this location. I used to LOVE and adore Macayos. Until about one year ago. They hired a new manager. It started with a lot of great waiters who knew me by name dropping off like flies. Still, there were a few left and I perservered through crappy service to get the food. NOW every SINGLE time I go the soda is flat, the cheese crisp is not cooked correctly, and the service is aweful.

 It has steadily been becoming worse and worse since Anne, the manager started. I'm not trying to attack her personally but clearly she is not doing it right. My chips are always cold and I have even walked out because it was so crappy. This is coming from someone who has gone to Macayos since BIRTH. For 23 years I have been 'frequent' and since age 18 I went literally every or every other week. 

I LOVED Macayos, it was my FAVOURITE in the world, and now I cant stand to go.  It used to be a friendly, happy family atmosphere, with good food, awesome service and bubbly fizzy soda. No longer. Not since. I have tried and tried again to relive the glory days, but I think it has seen and passed them. I went to Macayos in Tucson and it reminded me of when this location was great. Sad times.

I have literally spent THOUSANDS here. But now I wont spend a penny, unless I hear management has changed.
