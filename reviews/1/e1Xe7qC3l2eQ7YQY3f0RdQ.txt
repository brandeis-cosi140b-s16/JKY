I ordered two items for carry-out on 7/28/2013.  I was very disappointed in the quality of my food.

I ordered a grilled chicken quesadilla with chicken and cheese only and a ground beef taco with beef and cheese only.

They messed up both items.  They gave me a shredded chicken with tomatoes and onions in it and it was all liquidity.  Then they put lettuce on my taco.  The beef was burnt.  I took a bite of each item before throwing it all away.  The chips were stale and the salsa were bland and did not taste fresh at all!  What a waste of $15!
