Update! This was our second time excited to eat here again. We ordered shrimp tacos, shrimp burritos, and kids Mac n cheese. All were absolutely pitiful. It was the nastiest shrimp burrito I've ever had. Even my 15 year old said her food was disgusting. We will probably not be back. It's too unpredictable!! 

This restaurant is clean and is decorated nicely. The cashier was kind and patient,  answering all of our questions. The food is served on real plates, not styrofoam or out of a take out box. The salsa bar was great and my enchiladas with steak were fantastic. The red sauce was grainy, thick, earthy, and amazing just like it should be! The menudo was just ok. Everything did need a bit of extra salt. The extensive selection of authentic Mexican food items was impressive. All in all, we will be back!
