I love this place, but the management and customer service is nonexistent. I ordered some food via drive thru for my friends and I, all on one tab. I drove out to their house only to find that all of their orders were there, but my dinner was missing. Great. I checked my receipt and I was charged for my rolled tacos, but they were nowhere to be found. The next day when I got back home, I called and asked to speak to a manager. The guy asked me why, and so I told him I ordered food the night before and was charged for food I never received. His response? "Well I don't think we can refund it. You should've come back last night." Excuse me, I drove out to Queen Creek only to figure out you guys can't complete a simple 3 item order. I won't drive back to Tempe unless you pay for my gas round trip, which won't happen. I calmly explained the situation and the guy just says "Well the manager probably won't do anything but you can call back in two hours when he gets here."
So who exactly are you to tell me what the manager can and can't do, and that I should've come back the same night? No sir, you can provide a little customer service and take my name and number down and have the manager call me when he gets in and just apologize. I'm forced to provide excellent customer service at my job, and expect the same.
Never yelled at the guy, never bothered calling back over $5 in rolled tacos. Not worth the hassle of trying to deal with these people.
