Haven't been here in a while and service not good tonight.  Husband had to go in to flag someone down for water after a long wait, an abnormally long wait on the patio.  It wasnt even busy so after the waitress made initial visit to our table she didnt come back to check on us for a really long time so food was going cold.  finally she came when I was 3/4 of the way finished but I tried to eat slower than the slow I already eat so that I could get the green salsa that I love.  After a really long wait maybe 15 minutes and honestly I think it was more like 20 she comes back with hot enchilada sauce.  I was so upset now because the whole meal was just crap cold and soggy since we had to wait so long in between each visit.  Finally she comes back and I tell her she brought wrong sauce and that I would like the green salsa please.  Again after a really long wait she finally brings the right thing.  Anyway it was yuck and it was cold, and soggy and not fun sorry I already said that.  I used to go here all the time but the visit prior to this one almost the same thing happened.  I had a cold wet soggy burrito by the time I got my salsa.  That was in May and i used to go at least once a week.  So since that last awful visit in May 7 months later I try again and wow it was the same and worse.  Bummer, used to love this place.
