As Chuck D would say "Don't Believe The Hype"....

Had high expectation after seeing this on Triple D, but after venturing into the barrio for some Latin flavor, I wished I'd stopped at Taco Bell instead. At least there would have been flavor to my meal...

The best thing about this place is the artwork on the building. Do yourself a favor and hit the Taco street truck on the corner for a real street taco experiance for $5 verse $ 13 for this epic failure of a joint.
