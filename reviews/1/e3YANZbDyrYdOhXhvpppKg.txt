If you're vegan I'd stay away from this place. I went in the other day with my mom super excited because of the location and how pretty it looked. Plus I was seriously craving mexican. Most places have a vegan/vegetarian menu or can accommodate me. Well they had two vegan items. One was a salad (who wants a salad at a mexican place? Not this girl) and the other option had a wheat flour tortilla and I can't have wheat. I asked if there was anything else they could do to help accommodate me and they said no. I then ordered just a side of beans which they brought and it was covered in cheese lol I didn't want to complain since I already felt like a pain and just let my mom eat the beans. I promptly left and went somewhere else to eat. Seriously disappointed considering  nice of a place this is and I love the location.
