WORST experience EVER!!!!! never have i ate anywhere to the level of grossness this place offered. They actually served me garbage for food. I ordered a chicken sandwich i got to work took the bun off put some ketchup then took a bite of my burger it was so stale and hard i immediately spit it out. So after being in shock of what just happened i took the bun off once again and saw some of my lettuce was black. And the worst part it that the chicken patty was grey with some spots of meat missing inside its really hard to explain when i called the manager she really was not too concerned with the quality offered me to remake the burger . I couldn't possibly eat at that location again. She then offered me a free burger coupon i had to go and pick it up at the carls jr. So when i got there i went inside for my refund and it was not the best looking inside either all the employees seemed to not even care that they served me that and they gave me a small fountain cup while i waited and the soda was flat. I then realized the problem is with management and not running that location right.  Lack of employee quality.   you can even see how  stiff the chicken looks on the pictures i took.
