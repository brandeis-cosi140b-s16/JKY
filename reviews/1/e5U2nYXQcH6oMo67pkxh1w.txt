In a nut shell:  the food is decent, but, it's the spotty service that prevents us from EVER returning.  We've given this place so many chances for our business, since 1997, as it's so close to our house, but the service sucks. The owner's son does not have his head and heart in the business, and he sure likes to BS with his favorite customers and neglects and is forgetful of his other customers. About a month ago, (our last and final visit), we sat and waited for  someone to take our order, 3 servers passed our table, including the owner's son, then he went to his friend's table and proceeded to hug them and BS with them while we waited. Based on our previous experiences, we knew we were going to have a bad service meal, and so, we just got up and left. We decided  to go to Pin Keow (Thai), and once seated, within 30 seconds, we were giving our order. What a difference !!!

Adios, El Burrito, we'll never dine with you, ever again !!!!!
