The one star is for Doc, the only good thing about this place. We went here twice during our stay at Ballys because it was convenient. The first time I orders a dish with braised beef. It was so fatty I didn't eat one bite of the four pieces on my plate. The second time we went the service was slow and the waitress was horribly rude! She was impatient and bothered because our party of 8 needed separate checks. Seems that would be implied but I guess not for her. The food is sub par and the staff seems like they would rather not work with the public. My suggestion, save yourself the wait and money and go downstairs to the subway!
