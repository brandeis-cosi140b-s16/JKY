Save your self !!!
Had the chili verde which had zero taste, green sauce tasted like it was from a can.
My wife and ordered margaritas that was liked a drink that sat for two hours. 
Service is totally clueless!!! Doesn't even know there menu.
It's the same cheap owner who owned the restaurant prior and it shows!!!
Left and went to a real restaurant never will we step foot there again.
The manager has no idea on customer service, 
The lettuce wraps had old lettuce, brown, piss poor.
It may be the only restaurant in the area but be real it is run like a high school cafeteria .
Zero stars
Never going back!!!
