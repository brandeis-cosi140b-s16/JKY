We got a groupon for Qdoba this past week.  Rude service.  Only 2 on staff in the whole place.  Line took FOREVER to get through.  Luckily our Groupon lowered the price to reasonable levels.  Normally this place is more expensive than Chipotle, yet not nearly as good.  Water from tap tasted horrible.  Every garbage can was overflowing with trash.  Dirty tables, etc.  Glad it was half off... but I don't think I'd even buy another Groupon here.
