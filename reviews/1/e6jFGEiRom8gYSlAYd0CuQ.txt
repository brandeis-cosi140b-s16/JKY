I went here and first off it looks like it belongs in Mexico.  The menu is unsatisfactory looking with no price for the food.  I ordered 3 burritos, one of which was bean and rice only.  $23 all together!  They said the bean and rice was $5!!  So we asked for a receipt and the totals did not add up to $23, the items were not what we had ordered and were crossed out in pencil with diff names etc.  I asked for a receipt that had the correct pricing and total so i can use it for a business write off and they got mad and told us to give the food back and they would return the money!! Fine!
