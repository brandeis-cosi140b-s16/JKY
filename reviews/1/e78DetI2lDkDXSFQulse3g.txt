I had dinner here once when it first opened.  I drive by here everyday because it's in my neighboorhood.  I don't know what happened but it's a shame that they closed their doors already.  This location is a great spot and the other restaurants there do a great business.  It's sad to see a restaurant open and close so quickly.  I hope the space won't remain empty for too long.
