My husband and I went here for lunch. He passes it on his way to work everyday and he said the parking lot is always full so it must be good. Boy, were we wrong. It was so loud you could hardly hear each other talk. The chips and salsa were the best part and even those were ok. I asked the waiter what the Baja sauce was and all he could tell me is that it is made in house and it is the number 1 seller. A very generic response. I ordered the Baja burro and my husband got the Patio Chimi. The food was served very fast. There was no cheese on my husband's Chimi. He asked for it, but never got it. The food was greasy and the flavoring on my chicken was horrible. We will never come here again. Thank good ness for a coupon. Next time we stick with our usual Mexican food places. At least we know we won't be disappointed.
