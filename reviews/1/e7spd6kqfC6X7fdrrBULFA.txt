I have been to this location many times. The food is okay. The staff is terrible! I haven't seen one person that looks pleasant working there. They don't even care what you ask for they will throw it on. If you tell them you don't want something they get completely annoyed. I hope the manager sees these reviews and tries to make positive changes around there. Why do they only have one cashier?! It's usually one that has no idea what they are doing either.
