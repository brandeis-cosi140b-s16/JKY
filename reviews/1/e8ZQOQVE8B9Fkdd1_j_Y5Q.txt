Just ordered $30 in food there and found a full size roach stuck to a chip in my nachos. Took them back to get a refund and showed the girl. Her first response - "guys, there would be food all over it" - as if we put the roach in there and pulling a fast one. Trying to say we are lying about it. Issued a refund but hasn't gone back on the card yet. Refund or not, I'm calling the health department and maybe the news. So gross, disgusted for life now. Thanks for ruining nachos for me and not believing me when I bring it to your attention. I hope this place shuts down.
