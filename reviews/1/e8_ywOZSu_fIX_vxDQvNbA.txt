I really hate to give any place a bad rating, I try to find the good in every place I go. Having said that this review makes me a little sad but more then a little cranky!

Note to self: If something is not on the menu then chances are you don't want to order it!!!  What mexican place doesn't have nachos on their menu? Well this one doesn't and as I was unfortunate to find out for good reason! 

The food here is just awful! The tortilla soup was cold, and a very bland version of tomato soup... 

I don't think this place will last long unless I am missing something profoundly different from my experience.... very disappointing!
