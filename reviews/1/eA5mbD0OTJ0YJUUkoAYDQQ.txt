Let me first start by saying the mole enchiladas were yummy,  The server was adorable, and the chips were great!

Now the bad: My family is vegetarian with the exception of me.  After constant assurances there was no lard or pork fat in the beans we ordered chips salsa, a veggie burrito and the fish tacos.  Both my wife and daughter (the veggies) became violently ill on the way home.  The server claimed there was only peanut oil in the beans which we believe to be suspect.  In addition, all of their salsas, with the exception of the habanero have chicken stock.

Bottom line: cute place, nice atmosphere, not going back.  Not putting lard in products does not make them vegetarian.  What a rough night.
