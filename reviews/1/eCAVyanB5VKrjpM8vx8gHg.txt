Service and food used to be so much better here. The staff is more interested in socializing with each other than the customer themselves. Even heard a few "F bombs" from one of the employees.  New management also. Didn't even get a hello. Used to all the time from the old management. Went without a drink for 20 minutes before anyone noticed...AND WE WERE SITTING AT THE BAR! AND one of the only ones left. SMH. So dissapointed. Used to really like this place. The only thing I can say are the wings are still good. No more Tacos and Tequila for me. At least not the restaurant.
