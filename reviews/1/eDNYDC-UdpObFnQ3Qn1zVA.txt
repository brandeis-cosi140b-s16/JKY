Went for lunch with friends today. They were doing construction inside the restaurant. Very loud hammering with tile floors that made it echo. Have the decency to close for a few hours rather subjecting customers to this obnoxious noise! Food was o.k. but waitress (Chelsea) did not tell me about charge for sauce on burro; just added it on.   Been here a few times but Will not be back! Much better choices for Mexican food and drinks in our state. Will be using my "Bob" margarita glass as a planter.
