It's taco Tuesday on cinco de mayo and for some reason this place is dead. That should have been the first red flag. We sit down at the bar after standing at the sign
That said wait to be seated for 5 mins while the ONE waitress at the bar looks at us not saying a word. We have to ask for menus that are thrown down in a pile. We ask what specials are and wait as another bar tender comes out. They two seem really busy at the computer for quite some time. More people come to the bar waiting. Another group asks for a waitress and finally leaves after no service. I think this place is poorly staffed and managed. 4 different groups left just in the time we were there without eating or drinking. This place should have been pack on cinco de mayo.
