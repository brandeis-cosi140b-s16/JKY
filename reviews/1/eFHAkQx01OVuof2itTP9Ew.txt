I visited Cafe Rio on Taco Tuesday.  One taco for $2, and for another $2 you can add beans, rice and a soft drink.  I thought this would be a great deal.  This was the strangest taco I've ever had.  It was greasy, but yet it wasn't fried.  Not sure how they accomplished that, but for that reason, I won't be returning.  Food was bland, at best.  

Like another Yelper mentioned, the height of the dividing wall between the food prep and customer area so high I had to stand on my tippy toes to shout my order to her.  I asked for retried beans three times, but nope, I got regular pinto beans.  They were still better than the taco!
