Came here for Cinco de Mayo. Margaritas were delicious. However the service was not  great. We went in around 5pm. The lights were so dim, we couldn't see the menu (which WE had to ask the server for) I asked 3 times for the lights to be turned up. They did and ten minutes after someone else started messing with the lights. It was pretty annoying. The server took longer than expect to take our order.  Once she did, she didn't write it down. (This always makes me nervousness because I feel they're going to forget something ) of course it happened. My order came out. But we were still waiting on my moms food. I asked the server about the food and she forgot to put the order in. She did apologize and I understand things happen. By the time my mom's food came , my fajitas were cold. I didn't say anything. By this time I just wanted to eat and leave. The server asked us from behind the bar if we were doing ok. To me that wasn't personable at all. Once we were done eating, I went to the ladies room and it was disgusting. Seems that nobody checked the bathroom for a while. It was very messy. My experience was not great and we won't be coming back to Hacienda.
