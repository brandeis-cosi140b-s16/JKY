Worst service ever. We waited for over 35 minutes for our meal. And when they finally brought our order, the ultimate fajita meal was missing. They gave us an excuse about them cooking the shrimp. We waited another 10 minutes, still no fajita meal. A manager came over to apologize and remove the meal we did not get from our bill. He also removed a  plate of nachos from the bill. First and last time we will ever step foot in an On the Border.
