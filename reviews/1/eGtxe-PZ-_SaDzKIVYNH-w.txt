I absolutely love El Pollo Loco. I absolutely hate *this* El Pollo Loco. Here's why:

I have been there three times. The last two times, they've gotten something wrong with my order. One time, they didn't give me any cilantro dressing. This time, they gave me half the normal amount of dressing, and they didn't give me the cheesecake chimichanga I ordered. 

Not only this, but the drive-thru is very, very slow. Each time I've gone, it's taken quite a long time to get my food, and each person at the window has to sit for one to two minutes on average (or longer).

Finally, the quality of the food I do get is subpar when compared to other EPL's standards. The chicken is overcooked and stringy, and the tortilla strips in my salad were soggy. Keep in mind that I got home within 4 minutes and the strips were still soggy even before putting the small amount of cilantro dressing I got into the salad. 

All-in-all, I was really excited for this location to open, but I'm horribly disappointed.
