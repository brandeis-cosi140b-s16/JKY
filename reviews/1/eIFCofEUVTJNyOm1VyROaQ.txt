First time visit disappointed
BEWARE
My daughter ordered Huli Huli
Chicken tacos and found a BIG chicken bone in her food.
Waited for other patrons to leave before I said anything.
No sorry no concern no nothing!
Luckily my daughter didn't choke on the 2" chicken bone.
Asked who was responsible for cutting up
Chicken - they need to be more careful !
All FIVE employees - said absolutely nothing.

I'm taking my money elsewhere where they care.
