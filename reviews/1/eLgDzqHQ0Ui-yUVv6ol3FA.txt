Well we ordered off of paypal sounded fun and new so we tried it. When I ordered I was given a time of completion. That time was 35 minutes.  So when I picked up at that time. My food was cold. The person that brought it to me said he didn't think I was coming. It had been ready for a long time. Needless to say by the time I got it home it was very cold. So cold that my cheese was not stringy and was just stuck there. The guacamole was just brown and black pieces of cut up avocado. That was on our fries, burritos, and the rolled tacos. (Please refer to the pictures I posted ) I ordered an extra side of pico de gallo @ $3.00 a side. I received a cup full of liquid salsa. Not the typical Freash chopped  tamatoes, onions jalape√±os and cilantro. Very disappointing because I ordered an side of $3 chips to eat with the fresh version of pico. Then I asked for extra green salsa. I was told there was plenty in there for me I wouldn't need any more. Mind you I ordered 4 California burritos, 2 Carne asda fries, 3 rolled tacos, a $3 side of beans, and a $3 side of rice. I was feeding 7 people.  So yes I did need more and we did run out. $60 bucks wasted on garbage.  Over priced for the quality of the food!!!! WON'T BE DINING HERE AGAIN! Even though the paypal part was great. The food and services was awful.
