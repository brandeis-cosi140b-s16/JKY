My best friend paid $450.00 to have their food for her daughters wedding.  Let me tell you, it was the worst!!!  The meat was extremely dry, the beans were runny, and they gave us NO tortillas!!!  The employees were pretty rude, they kept looking back at us and whispering to each other. There were only 2 employees that spoke proper English.  It was really disgusting the way we were treated, especially since I know we were the biggest sale they had all day!!!   I wouldn't recommend that store to my worst enemy!!!  I have to give them a star rating but in all honesty they don't deserve any stars at all!!!
