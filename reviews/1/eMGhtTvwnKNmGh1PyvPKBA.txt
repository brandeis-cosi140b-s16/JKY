Atmosphere is great, but service and food is horrific. I stopped in around 7:30 on a week night just wanting to get a quick dinner with my mom. Not even half the restaurant full, we sat immediately but took 15 min for our server to even say hello, and then grab us water. We ordered as she brought us drinks because we were in a hurry. Two simple meals took 45 minutes to come out (meanwhile, server does not visit our table at all during this time to check on us). The food was not bad but definitely not worth the terrible service.
