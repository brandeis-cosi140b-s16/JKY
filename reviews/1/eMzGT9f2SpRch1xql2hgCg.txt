Lol that is the worst food .. Salt and shit food if that's your thing.. Oh that's even if the girl in the drive thru Evan understands English .. Then they get upset when you can't understand them no receipt so who knows maybe she's stealing from the place hell I don't know but the food is not food it's salt on a brick the same stuff I give my horses
