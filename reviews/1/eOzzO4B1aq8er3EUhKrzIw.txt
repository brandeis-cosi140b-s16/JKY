My friends were roped into having their rehearsal dinner at Frida's when their original venue closed unexpectedly. It was unfortunate. 

We pre-ordered, but it took an hour and a half from the time we arrived to the time we got our inauthentic Mexican food. I got the carne asada, and the steak was tough and overcooked. The refried beans had that been-sitting-under-a-lamp crust to them. One of the servers started yelling out the names of the plates across the whole room, even though we had little stickers marking what we ordered. It was a hot mess.

Dinner was still fun (of course---it was a pre-hitchin' dinner!), but the margaritas and the sangria were the only high points for which Frida's can actually claim credit. Still, I'd never come here again.
