I have decided that I hate this place. It was almost a hard decision because their baja sauce is awesome, but there are so many things to hate that I have to be the "Paul Revere of Yelp" and warn all of you good people.

They are sneaky little weasels and want to take your money. I ordered a baja burro and the server asked "with guacamole and sour cream"? While she was nodding her head. So I said yes. The bill came and I was being charged an extra $4.00 for sour cream and guacamole that I didn't even use. I know what you are thinking, "that's your fault, she probably asked if you wanted to add it," but that is not the case. Same thing happened at dessert, we ordered the deep fried ice cream and we were asked if we wanted chocolate or regular, so we picked chocolate (the menu doesn't say anything about chocolate costing more money), but sure enough... A teaspoon of Hersheys is another $2.50. Fast forward a week later, the same thing happens to my coworker at the downtown location, they pay an additional $4.00 for sour cream and guac that they didn't even use. I am under the impression that the servers are actually trained to ask you in a way that implies that it is included to jack up your bill.

Look, their food is okay, but the prices are absurd. You can find much better Mexican food at half the price all throughout the Valley. Hell, you can go to Outback and have a steak, salad, bread, blah blah blah for less money. 

The decor is old and tacky, the last server we had hit on my wife while I was in the restroom... Seriously, he said "He left you? if I was your man I would never do that to you, I would treat you like a queen." Yeah, okay Macayos guy with your extra $4.00 that you stole, go on with your bad self.
