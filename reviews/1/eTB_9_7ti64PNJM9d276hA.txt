Worst mexican in madison so far. I went there with six friends, all getting different items. The enchiladas verdes were light on filling, sauce and cold. Covered in queso fresco and another cheese sauce. One friend had a veggie burrito, which lacked any more vegatables than rice and beans. another frined had the tacos, both steak and chicken were dry and lacked any flavor. a few people had the horchata and as one of my friends said: "from a box and not even a good box". All in all, one of the worst meals i have had in madison. I will not be returning, and neither will my friends.
