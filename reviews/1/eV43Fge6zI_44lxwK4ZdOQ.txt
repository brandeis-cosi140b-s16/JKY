If I could rate 0 stars I would. This store consistently gets it wrong. And each time I come back and think that I'll give them another try, they mess up yet again. 

Take the time to drive down to 99th & McDowell and go to the Chipotle there. You won't regret it the way I'm regretting once again today's choice.
