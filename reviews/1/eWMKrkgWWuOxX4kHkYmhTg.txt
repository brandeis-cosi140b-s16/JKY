So dissapointed. The negitive: Bland tortilla chips, carne asada torta served without beans and very tough meat. How they made guacamole lacking in avocado is beyond me but it was stuffed with so much tomato and other vegetables it was barely green!

The positive: 
The counter guy was nice enough and the dining room was clean and they DO cook in front of you.

I'm really not sure I could bring myself to go back in there. The food just kind of made me mad. It could be so much better.
