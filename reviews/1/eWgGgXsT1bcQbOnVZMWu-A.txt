I got a burrito here this evening and found a HAIR like an eyebrow size in it as well as a small nat like bug inside the tin foil.  I eat chipotle all the time and have NEVER found something like this in my food.  I highly suggest this location to be looked at by the health department.

I would go to any other location than this one.  Absolutely disgusted!
