I work downtown and was so excited this place just opened. First off--the bar, coffee area and gelato looks great. Things that would be pretty hard to mess up. I got a Mexican bowl salad that made Chipotle look like a four star meal. The barbacoa was WAY over spiced/flavored and there was shredded lettuce that was very minimal. The Spanish rice was saturated in seasonings and half way THROUGH my lunch I was feeling ill. I wasn't the only one, my coworkers had the burgers and all of our tummies are not doing well. I hope the quickly correct these bad reviews before this place becomes consistently avoided.
