hmmm.... maybe lousy burritos and poor service are acceptable for billy goats and those kids in the feed the children commercials, but not for me. I'm not even sure where to begin with this place. I know i'll begin by saying go to the chili's near security check in. I am a guy who loves burritos and sir, that was a crappy burrito. 
Flavorless meat, too much sour cream and guac; and oh yeah it was ICE COLD. Like fresh out of the fridge cold.
This is a public service announcement: STAY AWAY....STAY AWAY.....STAY AWAY
