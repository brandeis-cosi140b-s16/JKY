One word describe my experience horrible!!! Came here for the first time, but everyone knows what senior frogs is. 

We came in after a little wait which is to be expected, we were showed to our table which was still dirty, after it being cleaned we waited for our server for 20 mins we should have left but we had a coupon for drinks. 

Our sever Emmanuelle gave the drinks to wrong table, after noticing and people placing straws in the drinks he takes them off the table and gives them to us. Gross!!!We asked for new drinks, and he got upset. Our food was cold, and our sever never checked on us. When we tried to get his attention he told us we had to wait. We were the only table that didn't get balloons, when we mentioned it we were told we can get the ones behind the table.  

What!! I get that it's popular but what about customer service?? This place has absolutely none, the manager should take a good look at their management skills, and the team they have under them. I would never go to this location again.
