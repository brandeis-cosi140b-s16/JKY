Went on Taco Tuesday during lunch.  This place is gross and not worth your money.  First of all if you sit at the main bar, it smells like human urine.  Secondly the chips are stale and almost chewy, greasy and taste of rancid old oil.  The salsa was cold and I can find better in my jar at home in my own fridge. The guacamole was tasteless and boring, like nothing had been added to it at all.   The service was okay on a slow Tuesday and the tacos were acceptable but not the greatest.  You have to pay extra for a different salsa and it is too hot to consume.  It is too bad about this place it seems like a cute concept.  It could be alot better.  I do not recommend.  So sad and yuck!!!
