I love Chipotle's food and the fact that they are hormone-free in their ingredients. But I received the worst service at this location. When the employee refilled the salad lettuce, he spilled and replaced it back in the bowl and served it onto someone's salad. My sour cream had hair in it and the cashier was not attentive to my order, which led to an overpayment. The  employees' attitudes were very careless and a majority, not all, treated their customers with little respect. Very displeased with this location.
