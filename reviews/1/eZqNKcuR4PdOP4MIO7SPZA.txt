Horrible service.  Slower than a dying snail in the Tijuana heat.

Went there for lunch, ordered and had to leave 40 minutes later because my food never showed up.  At least I got a few chips to eat.  Gotta love not being able to have lunch on your lunch break.

I will never go there again.  

Gracias for nothing.
