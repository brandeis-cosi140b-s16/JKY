If I could give it a negative I would. Wayyyyy overpriced and $1.19 for a mini scoop of guacamole, I'm talking about the scoop is soooo small that I wouldn't even be able to spread it on this fun size enchilada I received which btw is a joke for $5.99. And the cashier was extremely rude. 

I see why there was no line when I walked in.
