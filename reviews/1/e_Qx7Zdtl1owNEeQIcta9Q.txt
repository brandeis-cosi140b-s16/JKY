Came here a few nights ago, on my way home from work, because I heard it was a good Mexican bar food joint. The service was quick, there were a few patrons at the bar, servers were nice, but the food wasn't worth the money, as it was rather bland. I didn't care for the music or the ambiance. Mostly, someone who I assume to be management kept staring, awkwardly at me almost the entire time... To be honest, I couldn't tell if he wanted to **** me or fight me...

Needless to say, I will not be returning. Don't waste your time here, with Mill so close, you'd be better off spending your time & money at a place that's worth it.

I was speaking about you, Mr. Tolan, but go ahead and keep acting like a smata$$... THAT'S going to make me want to come back
