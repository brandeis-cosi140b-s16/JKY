I hate cold food when it's suppose to be hot. We placed a pick up order and they messed it up from the get go. I asked for sour cream on the side and not on the food itself. When my wife arrived home with the food and found out there was sour cream all over the nachos and worst part is that the sour cream isn't soft it's like a bit  hard in texture. And the food was really cold. What in the heck?? To top it off she didn't get the drink order I also placed while putting my order for food. Apparently she cannot take drink orders until time of pick up. That just boils my bubble and will never consider going back. I just wasted money on food that is not edible, cold and not as good as it used to be.
