Attention Management:  Employees at this location are not adhering to the quality standards that are expected of all Chipotle Mexican Grills.

Line employees are taking shortcuts in not giving customers their full due, i.e. serving extremely noticeable smaller portions, and not sticking to the standard.

And since Chipotle is the McDonalds of the Mexican food world, how would the employees feel if they ordered a Big Mac and received buns with out a meat patty?

I'd rather you just rob me outside of your store, than to go inside and be greeted by smiley faces (great job by the way), but then charged $6.25+ tax for a small and very junior burrito - these are not the standards set by Chipotle.

I will be keeping a close watch on this location, and will give it another chance, but am hoping that the employees will come up short once again so that I can post the picture online with receipt.

Believe me, I would like nothing better than to escalate this situation to the corporate level.  Consumers in a post 2008 recession are tired of being taken for a ride.

As of 07/01/2013 - this location has received a C- in quality from me and will be watched and tested at an unknown time to gauge if the actions and lack of quality are still continuing.
