I have lived in copa since 2007 and I have eaten at this place once and never went back again.... This is in AZ which means we are pretty close to Mexico so naturally there is lots of Mexican food restaurants here (btw-my fav food)  and I can't believe that people actually think this place is real "Mexican" ... Gross, I'm white and I know this is a crappy excuse for Mexican food. Save your time and money and go somewhere else for Mexican... Anywhere else is better than this place. Plus the service sucked!
