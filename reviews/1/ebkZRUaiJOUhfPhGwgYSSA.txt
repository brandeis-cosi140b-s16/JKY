People beware! I found a piece of toothpick inside of one of the taquito's I ordered. Confronted the owner to bring it to everyones attention and said its pretty typical that would happen. My son was only two years old and he was eating. Owner of the restaurant is a heartless being and only cares about his money. Hope you get your bad karma hundred times fold.
