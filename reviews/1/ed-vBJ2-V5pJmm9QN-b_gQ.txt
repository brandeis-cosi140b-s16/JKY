We LOVE Stone and Vine and frequent it almost every week, which is why when the owners opened this restaurant , we were excited to give it a try.   We have tried it three times.  All three times the service was subpar.   It was a like committing a crime to get chips and salsa.  When we got them, we were pleased but only to find out tue extra salsa cost extra.   We are ok with that but it is courteous to let the table know    

We stopped ordering Margaritas the first night we stopped in.  Just could not get them right. 

After the third try with no improvement on overall service and difficulty in getting chips and salsa, we have given up.  We will stick with Stone and Vine.
