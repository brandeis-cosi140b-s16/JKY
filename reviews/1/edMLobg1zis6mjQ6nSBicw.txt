This Cafe Rio location is giving this amazing chain a horrible rep!! I've been frequenting Cafe Rios for years, starting with the original in Utah...but today's experience left me never wanting to return. Disorganization, long wait, and sub par flavor!! I just wanted a chicken soup...35 mins in line watching several employees running around, stumbling over each other, asking each other questions they can't answer and I finally have my soup that is cold and lacking it's usual flavor. What gives??? Hopefully the Cafe Rio powers that be will get smart soon and help this floundering joint!!! HELP!!!
