Only giving 1 star because you can't just put nothing.

NEVER eating there again!

I ordered a taco salad with chicken and absolutely no onions! when I received it there was a black hair sitting on it. I'm blonde so obviously not mine! I took it back up there and it looked like she was going to argue with me on it so I clearly pointed it out. They made me a new one but I couldn't sit down and eat now so I had to take it to go.
When I got home and I noticed that now it was completely loaded with onions!
When I called they told me that nothing they could do. Well I can't eat onions due to an allergy so I ended up throwing it away because they didn't want to remake it again or give me a refund.

Screw this place and their absolutely no customer service! Employees need to be fired, if you don't want to do your job then give it to someone that will and if the owners of this location don't care that a customer was treated like this then they deserve to be shut down
