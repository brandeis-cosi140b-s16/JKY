Seriously called them out today... Couldn't keep myself from saying something when I saw them microwaving the barbaquoa... I'm so disappointed... I mean damn. Right in front of me, my lady, and all their customers. Look! If microwaved yesterdays leftovers is what I ordered then it should of been on the menu cus anything less than fresh just made is  complete bullshit. Glad I put a stop to that crapp... Never again... To bad too cus I was rootin for them.
