Food was fair, place is ok except the glass on the table is broken and the place could use a good cleaning, especially the cheap the silverware (yuk). More importantly we were both overcharged for both dinners. Waiter questioned and was told there was an upcharge for the combination I ordered. This is not listed on the menu anywhere. Waiter agreed but no change made to bill. No reason for my dates dinner overcharge. Did not want to fight anymore in front of date so I paid. I will vote with my feet and not return. Unreal, left a bad taste in my mouth....customer lost for good.
