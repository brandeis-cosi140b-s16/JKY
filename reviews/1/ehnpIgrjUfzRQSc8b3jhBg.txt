I had previously rated this place a 4-star, but unfortunately I have to say after my last visit I will not be going to this place again. 

The food is still good, and the drinks fairly priced, but the service we received on our last visit was some of the worst I've ever received. Our server's name was Noelle, and she was truly awful. We showed up 2 hours before they closed, when plenty of tables were still sitting, and she treated us like absolute garbage. She hardly said three words to us all night, and seemed pissed in general that we were there. When I asked if they had any chips (not angrily...just a question. If she interpreted it as anger, I was careful to be nothing but kind for the remainder of our time there), she seemed taken aback and upset. When we ordered a trio of dips, she never brought us any chips. In fact, she spent her time mopping around our table while our trio of dips went cold. Eventually, as she walked past us for the hundredth time without asking if we needed anything, my boyfriend asked her to please take the dips back. She didn't ask what was wrong with them or offer to get us any chips, or even apologize; she just took the dips and dropped us a check. 

I'm not sure why we received the service we did, and I'm pretty upset, as I previously liked this restaurant so much. I am in the service industry as well, and was ecstatic to find a restaurant that served food late. However, I wouldn't return to this place if you paid me, after the service we received. 

To the girl who served us: I apologize if you dislike your job. I apologize if you were having a hard day. But have some pride in your job. And if you don't like your job, then leave. 

If you're going to go to this restaurant, apparently you should go before 10pm. They market themselves as a late-night hangout, but the servers don't seem to understand that.
