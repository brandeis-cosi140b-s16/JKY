Stopped by for two red chili burritos around 1pm on a Saturday.  They were out of red so I ordered green. As I waited and saw a few small groups of customers after me receive there order before me I asked for my order and the cook says "it takes a few minutes for the chili to boil" 45 mins after ordering I got my order. TWO RICE BURRITOS WITH SPOONFULL OF GREEN CHILI! Never again!
