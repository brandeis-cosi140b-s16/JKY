The food was good, the service was ok, but the band was HORRIBLE! 

They came by our table and started singing which we thought was cute. They ended up staying by our table and although we thought it was a little weird we thought they were being romantic. 

After 6-7 songs we stopped them. Once we stopped them they charged us $120!!! We thought it was a joke but they were serious. They said that they charge for each song. We never once requested a song and we never once were told that they charge. We were so upset and they would not let us go. Finally we have them what we had which was about $80. However we will never ever be back here. 

I'm pretty sure they were doing the same thing to other tables. I mean what type of restaurant would allow such a thing? Needless to say that because of this i would not return.
