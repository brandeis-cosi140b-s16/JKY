This is by far the worst location! The lines are depressingly dragging and the staff is extremely unfriendly and lazy. Every time I've gone in, called in to order, or ordered online there has been a mistake with my meal. I don't even know why I bothered with my last call in order (Jan. 28, 2015). The store has been open for several months now, you'd think they'd have their act together. If I could give zero stars I would. Please save yourself the annoyance and hassle and go to literally any of the other Cafe Rio locations.
