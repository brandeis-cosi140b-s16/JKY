Went here just for lunch with my family.  The food was ok and the chips were stale. However the owner of the store was working that day and he was rude to us and his employees. I do not recommend eating  here due to the owners extreme sarcasm and prejudice. I asked for a military discount and he replied he doesn't do military discount he'll give us an extra bowl of free chips. I'm dissatisfied with the ownership and have to say that restraunt is a pass.
