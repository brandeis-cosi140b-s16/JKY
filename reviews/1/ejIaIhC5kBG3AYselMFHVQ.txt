Garbage, total crap, with absolutely no taste, If you like bland hospital tasting food go here. no seasonings used, taco was so greasey it turned to rubber, couldnt bite nor chew, the taco shell had been rendered like beef jerkey literally. Very stingy with the meat, heavy on the cheap lettuce though. Stay away.  I think some people from California must have started complaining because its all tasteless.   Polite help though
