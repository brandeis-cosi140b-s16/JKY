First off, I want you all to know that I have been here 4 times and tipped them 15% every time.

So 

If you don't mind people charging your card for more money than they should, this is your spot.  Everytime I come here, I am told a price at the drive at the mic which is much more than the price on the menu.  Then I am told a even higher price at the window. And when I am handed the recipt and look at the price I can see that they added a dollar or two to the price that I was told at the window.  I have been there 4 times now day and night, and it happened everytime.  I don't know if it is the same lady every night around 10-11 but she is definitely negative in addition to this scam of a business. 

Just to make matters worse, I ordered a asada burrito on one of my trips.  When I got it, it was cold and burned on the outside.  It was way too obvious that they had reheated a previously made burrito that they had sitting around.  The inside of it was cold and the totilla was soggy.  

I am not a hard customer to please and I tipped these guys every single time my 15%.  But when I see a price tag of 5.99 and end up paying over 9 dollars for one re-heated burrito, I will warn others.
