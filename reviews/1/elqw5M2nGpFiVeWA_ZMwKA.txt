Will never go back to chronic taco, they gave me a serious case of food poisoning. Threw up all night the worst case I've ever had. Dunno what they did but maybe they have contaminated meat. Had the shredded pork taco and threw every bit of it up. Was just fine before i ate there. Wanna warn others if you choose to eat there to be careful.
