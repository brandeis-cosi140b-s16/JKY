My 1 star indicates the terrible service we received on my recent visit. We were lucky to snag a spot at the bar, and while it was busy, it was very normal for a Thursday night. In particular, Eduardo, was not only unhelpful, but blatantly rude one more than one occasion. He actually "shooed" me away when I politely raised my finger for a glass of wine, then proceeded to add to my existing glass(with wine still in it) when I asked for another glass and then urged me to hurry and hand him the glass so he could get my "half-pour" in and help other guests. I watched him the rest of our stay and he looked miserable and rushed. Word of advice: hire a new bartender!  So rude!!!!!!!
