one star only because their chicken is on point.  the salsa bar was a disgrace!  the cilantro was yellow, wilted & rotting.  the salsa was spoiled to the point that you could smell it! I brought it to the managers attention, asked her if she had fresh cilantro, she showed me the pitcher that had the same sad looking cilantro and said it was fresh.  wtf? and when I told her she needed to change out the salsa, she said it was fine.  I told her she was gonna get people sick, she rolled her eyes and disappeared to the back and never came back out.  SAD! ALERT, WHERE ARE THE FOOD SAFETY INSPECTORS!?
