This Taco Bell is one of those dual restraunts where it's a Taco Bell and a Pizza Hut. I got the PH1 combo. That includes a supreme personal pan pizza, breadsticks, and a medium drink. The breadsticks were perfect. And the medium drink was the same size as a large from McDonalds. The pizza. Well. It was soggy for starters. And after A few bites I realized the dough was still raw. Like sticky dough, uncooked. I ended up tossing the entire pizza after that. I was very disappointed and will not be returning.
