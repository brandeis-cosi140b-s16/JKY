My wife and I went to Secretos for a night out without kids.  My wife has frequented the Rokerj and Richardsons in the past and wanted for me to share in the experience.  We had great service in the bar, but as soon as we were sat at our table we never saw a waiter.  Yes, we never saw a waiter for 20 minutes.  We had a busboy clear our wine and beer glass, but no one seem interested in offering us any more service.  We finally left because we realized we were never going to be noticed.  We could have asked for help, but at the level this restaurant is stretching to be part of we should have not had to ask.  We ended up at Fired Up grill and had a great experience and fabulous food.  From now on my wife says no more cheap imitations- we will make the drive to the Rokerj or Richardsons.  I'm still wondering why they would give restaurant a name that is so close to secretions- just not appetizing.
