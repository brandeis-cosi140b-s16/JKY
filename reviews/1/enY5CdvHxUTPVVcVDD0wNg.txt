This crazy chicken location can choke on my fresh batch of cream!

I don't even think a complete review is necessary! I will just detail the conversation I had during my last crappy sit down visit.

ME: I would like a breast and a wing.
Employee: We don't have that ready right now.
ME: OK, how long?
Employee: Well we no have any made right now.
ME: Ok well that is what I am wanting so will they be making any? I see an entire char broiler full of chicken, you don't have any breast or wings cooked?
Employee: Yeah none is ready.
ME: I am willing to wait.
Employee: Ok but will be 15 minutes.
ME: Ok, well that is what I came here for so I will wait.
Employee: Yeah but is 15 minutes you wait.
ME: I said that is fine, are you trying to talk me out of a breast and wing????
Employee: No but will be 15 minutes to cook


ENOUGH SAID!

It is like going to the sex store and them being out of dildos, I mean come on!

How are you a place that is known for chicken and not have all parts readily available?
You mean I am the only person on the planet that wants white meat consisting of a breast?

I should have ordered the chicken tostada bowl that I ordered in my previous visit which was pretty good.
