Stopped at this restaurant in Sky Harbour airport, terminal 4, B concourse around 7 am on June 23rd. I ordered a breakfast burrito.  After one bite I knew something was wrong.  It tasted terrible and was cold in the middle.  I had only one bite and promptly through it in the trash.  Upon arriving in Miami I was sick. Food poisoning.  I was ill for 24 hours.  Shame on this restaurant, the employees and management that were working that day.  They do not care about their customers.  I strongly recommend you stay away from this place.
