Wheres the 0 star? It's horrible when people like here give you MEAT when you EXCLUSIVELY say you DON'T EAT MEAT! I had to take a bite to realize my burrito had meat in it even after I repeatedly asked them not to! Sadly i realized this at 1:30 AM when i drove back to my place and sat myself down to eat after a longggg day! Atleast I hope they will have the courtesy to gimme what I wanted next time I go there, bcs I feel robbed right now

UPDATE: I went back to return the burrito which they gave me with meat when i clearly specified NO MEAT, they wouldnt give me the burrito I asked for in return!! and they are so RUDE about it, and it doesnt help that they act like they dont understand English at all! One of the worst experiences, I feel CHEATED! Of course I know they cant read this review, its not like they would do anything different even if they did, I dont think they even care about Yelp!
