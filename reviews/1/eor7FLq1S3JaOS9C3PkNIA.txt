I was left disappointed even though my expectations were low from the beginning upon looking at the display counter.  My experience reminded me of a less healthy, less flavorful, less quality wannabe Chipotle. They should change the name to "Chronic cold burritos" because that is what they sold me. The canned beans, meat and rice were cold and I questioned the health standards by the looks of meat sitting in a tin uncovered and exposed. This joint was a hot mess as their store bought packages of tortillas lay all around and meat, cheese, salsa were all over the place, you would think that one of the 10 motionless employees standing back there would think to wipe up the residue and food scraps laying all over the damn place. I am beyond disappointed and want my money back for the two burritos we bought as I feel ripped off. 

The service sucks ass and is not the friendly excited crew that you would think Steve-O would have operate his joint. This staff had the personality of a Nun being presented with a dildo, it lacked enthusiasm or any sort of care in the world. Just because you have tattoos does not make you automatically cool, I have a few as well big deal so what I like to draw on myself.

Store bought tortillas heated up and stuffed with canned beans, cold meat and hard tasteless rice does not settle right on my stomach. This was our first and last visit to this joint. We will continue giving Chipotle our business, where the food is hot, fresh, tasty and clean that comes with great service. 

I have a feeling this joint will NOT be around for long.
