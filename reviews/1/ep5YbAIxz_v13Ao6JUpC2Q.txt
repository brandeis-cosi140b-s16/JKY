I don't even know where to start on this update. I stopped eating at chipotle because honestly it's not good and not consistent. I got a bowl with all the major components to making it good but it was far from good.  It just boring they need to add more options now, change it up a little aren't people sick of the same old stuff? Over and over again... They barley put any meat in the bowl anymore it's just filled with all the other things you shouldn't have more of like rice.. Even if you get light rice or no rice it's still not enough chicken. Maybe If you don't get all the other stuff they should make an expectation of putting some more meat? I don't know that's just a suggestion because you're still saving them money. Isn't it time to add some Sriracha?? It's kinda a big thing now. After she made my bowl she went and helped out the other people in line the other guy behind her was cutting up some stuff. So how am I going to get checked out?? I waited for about 2 minutes before someone came. The girl didn't even say it will like one second or I'm sorry. I just waited and waited. Staff sucks! Always new people. Chipotle is just played out and boring. Chipotle is just a snail in a race with cheetahs.
