This is the best place for dirty hairy sloppy tasteless mexican food. We dined in and had the worst experience for any chain. Upon entering,it smelled like it hasn't been cleaned in a month. The restaurant was not busy when we arrived,and we had to  wait  to be seated. Upon being seated, we ordered drinks. Chips and  salsa did not arrive until our meal arrived.  We had a visible dark curly hair in our meal. I had a piece of avocado skin in my guacamole. I noticed there was food on walls near our table. They didn't have covers for the kids cups, nor kids cups. The management should seriously consider an overhaul of their day to day practices. This restaurant would never pass the health standards of the health department.
