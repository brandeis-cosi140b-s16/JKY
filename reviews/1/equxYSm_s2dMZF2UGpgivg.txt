I've eaten at a dozen different Chipotle locations, and this is the only one that is consistently a bad experience.  The employees are very rude, and typically give you less than a spoonful of meat and condiments.  Don't even attempt to go in the bathroom, because it always looks like it hasn't been cleaned in weeks.  I would advise going to any other Chipotle location, as all other locations I patronize typically are welcoming and clean.
