This is the worst Chipotle location I've ever been to. They don't hold up to the standards set by Chipotle at all.  

-People here move at a snail's pace. Im not saying they need to rush, but the way everything is set up should make for a smooth and quick experience.

- If you tell them what you want they can only remember one thing you said. Example: "Pico and hot salsa." Then they just put Pico on and look at you. "Sour cream, cheese, and lettuce." Puts spur cream on and just looks at you. 

- Ordered tacos to go, when I get home with them, 5 minutes later, I have a pile of sour cream all over my "tacos" which now resemble a casserole of some sort. I can't even figure out where one taco begins or ends. So appetizing for $8. 

If I wanted crap I would go to Taco Bell. At least there a taco still looks like a taco and they keep the contents inside the tortilla.
