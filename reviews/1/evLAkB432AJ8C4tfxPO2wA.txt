I am amazed at the number of average or better reviews of this restaurant.  It is located next to "Uptown Alley" in Surprise, which probably accounts for much of its meager business (on a Saturday night, yet).

I have lived in the greater Phoenix area all my life, know many people in the restaurant business, have eaten at dozens of Mexican food restaurants in the valley and I can safely say this is the WORST Mexican food I have ever eaten.  Even Taco Bell is a step up.  Maybe two steps up.

Our waitress was friendly and the food came in a timely manner, but never were we asked how it was or how it tasted to us.

The shredded beef enchilada defies description except to say it resembled a beef enchilada with thick, brown gravy poured on top.  The rice was small, hard rice...obviously out of a huge bag with a little "tomato sauce" stirred into it.  The relleno looked like something you would buy in the freezer section at Walmart, then pull it out, thaw the bread-coated chile, and plop it on a plate with some sort of red tomato-juice sauce that had enough salt for the whole meal.

The margaritas are not worth stopping by for.....the salsa is thin and watery....so happy hour would not tend to make me so "happy" either.

Folks........save your time AND your stomach and go to Rio Mirage in El Mirage for a much better meal on the far west side.  Or....better yet.....spend an extra buck or two on gas and head into Phoenix.  Pretty much anything there is better.  The food in this place was not even edible.  I left most of my meal on my plate, paid the bill, and left.

Ugh!
