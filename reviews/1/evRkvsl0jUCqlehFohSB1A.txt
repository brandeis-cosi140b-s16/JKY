wow! just went there with my sister. Service was shity, lighting was way too dark, it was dirty and smelled horrible. I ordered a margarita, it was way too sweet so i sent it back and ordered a beer instead. After that the waitress ignored us for 20 minutes. We decided to get the check and go eat at a different mexican restaurant. When the check came the margarita was on it and i asked the waitress why, I did not drink it. She looked at me turned away and completely ignored me. My sister and I were planning on leaving her a nice tip because we felt bad we only ordered drinks, but after that, lets just say.... she wasnt too bright. Never going back to that place again!!
