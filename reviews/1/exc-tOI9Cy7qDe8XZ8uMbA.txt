Service was excruciatingly slow. It took three times longer because the waitress said the "grilled" chicken started frozen. Then they overcooked it and it was super dry. 

The manager never came to check on us or apologize for the super slow service.

Kids menu says "drinks included", but I was charged for the kids drinks. The waitress said its because the kids menu is for 10 and younger, but why didn't the menu or the waitress explain this detail when we ordered the kids drinks. The old bait and switch. 

I've been coming to Serranos for many years and tonight was our last visit.
