Terrible experience, don't sit on the patio. We waited at least 25 minutes after being seated for lunch.  Nobody ever came to our table.  Finally somebody showed up and went to 2 other tables who had showed up 5 minutes or more after us.  She didn't have the courtesy of saying "I'll be right there". The place was slow so there was no excuse.  Not sure if the food was any good. We walked out.
