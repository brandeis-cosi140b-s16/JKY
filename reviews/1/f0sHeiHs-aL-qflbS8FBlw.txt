Gross absolutely  gross.  We ordered oysters , fish burrito , Carne asada burrito , and popcorn shrimp. I will say this the oysters were huge but after eating the other items I refrained from eating all the oysters but managed to try 2 not that bad.  I was more scared to eat the rest of the oysters  after tasting the hard Carne and dry rice in my burritos.  Will not be going back.
