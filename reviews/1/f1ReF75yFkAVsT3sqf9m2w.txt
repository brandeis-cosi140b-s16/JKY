I'm sure the food would be better if they had more professional employees. I used to be a regular, now I hardly step in. The best times were when Mike and Sherman ran the bar. Mike is one of the most professional, upbeat, positive employees that ever worked there. Recently things changed and the old miserable bartenders were back in place of Mike. I'm sorry but Ofelia is a bitter old miserable person and she is extremely rude and she is slow. Omar has no personality and is boring. Now I've been coming here a long time on a regular basis but over the last couple of months this place has deteriorated, the quality of the food is not what it used to be and more over just the public display of unprofessionalism of the staff. I witnessed two female employees argue and call each other a b*tch in the dining area. The employees openly talk bad about each other in front of customers. I was in the bar once and Ofelia referred to Sherman in a derogatory racial slur as he walked away from the bar area. I've never witnessed such unethical business practices in a dining establishment.  The majority of your staff is extremely unprofessional. Your restaurant wouldn't survive a day in the real corporate world with the level of unethical behavior that occurs there. I stopped by today and I asked to sit on my regular section with Mike, I was told by your hostess that Mike no longer worked there that he was fired. Not only should that information be confidential from a human resources perspective but the smile on your hostess face sealed my decision to not come to your establishment again. I turned around and left. I have hosted numerous business functions there and now I will be hosting them at other places. I think your staff needs a complete overhaul starting with your management. A business is only as good as the management hired to run it and I'm sorry to say you suck at it.
