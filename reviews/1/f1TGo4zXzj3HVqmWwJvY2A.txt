Eight of us went to Manuel's today for lunch, and I can say that the service was the WORST I have ever seen in any restaurant.  

Six of us got our meals at the same time, while the other two (who ordered the daily special) got theirs  EIGHT MINUTES AFTER the rest of us.  

We didn't see the server again until he brought our bill.  We had asked him for separate tickets...and only got one.  We never got a single refill on the iced teas that four of us paid $2.50 each for...ten bucks would buy a LOT of tea bags.

An 84-year-old woman in our party asked for her water in a styrofoam cup with a straw, which the server said he would bring her but he never did.

The food was unimpressive...greasy and fried.  I would go to Taco Bell before I went back to Manuel's, which is overpriced.  I wouldn't have minded the mediocre food, but the service sucks like an Electrolux.
