A friend came over and decided to bring lunch with him. Five stars for his thoughtfulness.

He brought one of those box meals for me, why I do not know as it is too much food. All I can assume is he thought, well he is fat he can handle it. 

I suspect the taco was supposed to be spicy since it has a dull red color shell, not spicy. The burrito and crunch thing and taco all tasted the same, no difference at all. It tasted like mush, squishy soft horrible texture. I do eat at taco bell every now and again, but get the simple taco because it is usually full of lettuce and tomato with little beef. But this meal was incredibly awful. But hey the orange drink was good. I forgot about the cinnamon thingies, they gaged me. Who eats these things?
