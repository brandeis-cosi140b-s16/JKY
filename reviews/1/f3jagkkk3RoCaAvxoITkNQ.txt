My husband used to go here for the Menudo on Sunday, he says it was as close to his Grandma's that he has had yet.

We no longer go here because of the health ratings that this place has had. They were almost shut down because it was so bad. Apparently the kitchen is very dirty and in need of a lot of repair.
