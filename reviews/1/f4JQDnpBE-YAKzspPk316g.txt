This place isn't even deserving of one star. We came to eat at noon on a Sunday. We were a party of 4, the restaurant was empty and the service SUCKED!! It took the waitress 20 plus minutes just to bring us our drinks (2 sodas and 2 bloody Mary's) the Bloody Mary tasted like pure tomato juice  When our food finally did come the food was overly salty and half our order was wrong. I asked for a side of sour cream and was charged $2! WTF?! This place is way over priced and too Americanized. Not authentic at all. It was a total waste of our time and money!
