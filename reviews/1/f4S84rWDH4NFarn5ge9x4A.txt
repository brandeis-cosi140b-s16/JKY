Mediocre food. Been here twice and I probably won't come back again- there's gotta be some better Mexican places.
First time I ordered a taco salad and it was all meat with like two little shreds of lettuce. I had to ask for a bowl of lettuce to make it somewhat of a salad lol.
Second time, chicken enchiladas and it was dry as hell. If I ever have to go there again I'm just going to drink haha
