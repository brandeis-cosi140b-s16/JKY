This place occupies an old FARM BASKET so it looks like a barn. It is always dead. Really old & worn looking. Kinda smells moldy. I made the mistake of ordering lunch one day. 2 tacos combo(with Rice & Beans)
It was ALL cold & flavorless & Pricey. Family works next door for 3 years and has eaten there just the 1 occasion. Service was ??-How can you tell when they just NOD!! Way better Mexican food in the neighborhood.
