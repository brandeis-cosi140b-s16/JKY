No chips and salsa?  What!?!?  WHAT?!?!

Seriously...I can't think of another Mexican restaurant in the area that doesn't offer free chips and salsa....

We ordered food for the 4 of us (2 adults and 2 children) which consisted of 2 Chimichangas, 2 tacos for my wife, and 2 kids meals.  With 3 drinks, our bill came to $41 and change.  This place is definitely more expensive than most Mexican restaurants in the area.  The waiter didn't give me ice in my water, which made it very tepid.  The service was slow as well.  I don't know why everyone is rating this place so well.  I'm used to getting free chips and salsa at Mexican restaurants, especially for $40+ for 4 people.  WE definitely won't be back here.
