I had a very bad experience at this restaurant where I found a fairly large chicken bone in my burrito.  I could have choked on this!!  Their response was very nonchalant.  They told me it happens, can't always get all the bones out and did not even offer me any discount.  Are you kidding me with that response?!!!  I had to almost beg for a discount and explained to them that had I choked, it would have resulted in a law suit.  Needless to say, I will not go back.  Shame on you La Unica!!
