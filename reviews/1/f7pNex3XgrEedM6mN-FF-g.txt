So sad!! Food was cold and not well seasoned unlike the original location. The cook got upset that I nicely asked to get fresh tortilla because it wasn't warm. The other staff were nice. The only thing this place has going for them is there bottled coke! Sucks such a great rep the original place has and this location just ruined it for them!
