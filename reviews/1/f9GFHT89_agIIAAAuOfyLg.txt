I came here with a group of people while we were in Vegas because I had heard nothing but great things about it. I'm not one to complain BUT our visit was a horrible. First off, our waitress was a bitch. I'm sure she's not always like that (I understand sometimes people have an off day)  but her service was just horrible. I ordered the nachos, they were nachos, lots of cheese, sour cream, guacamole, tomatoes, a bunch of little hairs, and onions. Yes, I said hairs...not only one but a bunch. DISGUSTING! I quickly called over our waitress and asked if I could speak to her manager. (With attitude) she asked me what was wrong and I pointed out the hair to her. When the manager came up to me he seemed shocked that there was hair and repeatedly told me that all his cooks are in hair nets and properly groomed. He then offered me a free drink and asked if I wanted another order of nachos. I said no thank you to the food but I'll take the drink. (The margaritas are gross btw) then as my friends continued to eat their food, my friend finds a hair in her tacos. YES MORE HAIR....by now we're disgusted and just want to leave this place. We will never come back here!
