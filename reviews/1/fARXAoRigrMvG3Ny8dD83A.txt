The beach without sunglasses. Your birthday without cake. Binge drinking without a hangover. 

Some things just don't feel right without the other.

Take guacamole more example.. the obvious main ingredient is avacado. But avacados plucked from the teet of a holy tree rooted in its native soil of Machu Picchu and blessed by the Incan god of creation could not sustain a decent guac when placed in the hands these jokers at Paradise Cantina. 

How dare you... I repeat, how dare you serve me guacamole with the consistency of hummus! Guacamole sans diced tomatoes, onions, and cilantro is like a grilled cheese sans heat. It's like a french dip without the au jus. It's like a massage without a happy ending for christ sakes! I could go on... pizza without blah blah blah. 

We ordered entrees after the guac even though I knew better. They were bland and lazily prepared. The waitress called the torta a sandwich. 

I'm off to decompress. Maybe a massage...
