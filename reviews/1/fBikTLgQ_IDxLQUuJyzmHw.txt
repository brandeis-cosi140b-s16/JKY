After waiting 20 minutes to have our order taken, an additional 15 minutes to get our water, another 15 minutes after that to get our food, and then 20 minutes after we finished eating to get our check, I was way less than pleased with the service. My boyfriend got the torta del rey ~ the rubber "hot dogs" in it ruined it for me. It also smelled weird. Too much going on maybe? Ick! Glad I didn't order it! I got the carne asade burrito instead. Which actually means bean burrito with a few tiny pieces carne asade mixed in. That was really annoying. The beans did taste good though. Over all extremely unimpressed with this place. Maybe we went on a bad day, but neither of us think we'll be back to find out. Bummer!
