DISGUSTING. From the atmosphere to the food. Old, run down, holes in chairs, wobbly tables, dirty restrooms... Immediate turn off from the get go. I thought maybe the food would be ok, it was not. I had the two shredded beef taco combo. The shells were store bought, not homemade. The tacos, beans, and rice were soaked from a ridiculous amount of liquid on the plate, I am assuming from the shredded beef. It was less than mediocre food. Here's the kicker - the waitress even screwed up our tab! She did the math completely wrong. She totaled up food, tax, and gratuity (6 or more you get 16% gratuity added) and it was $176!!!! Whaaaat?? The real total was $82. Ugh. Got it fixed and left. This morning I am layingj in bed feeling incredibly sick to my stomach. Started last night... Worse today. Do not eat here!!! Cook at home or go to a better place for Mexican food.
