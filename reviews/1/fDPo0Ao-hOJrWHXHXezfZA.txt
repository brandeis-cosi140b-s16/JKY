The new location was very pretty, but that's where it ended. Hostess wasn't very friendly. Table was wet when  we were seated. Food was mediocre at best. My husband ordered a plain burrito, meat only. It came out with cheese. The waiter couldn't understand why that would be a problem. Turns out my husband doesn't like cheese, but there are lots of people that can't eat cheese. It shouldn't have been an issue and he shouldn't have had to explain why he didn't care to eat it. My enchiladas came out in an unappealing watery sauce. Service was incredibly slow and getting beverage refills was a hassle as we had to chase down the staff. Won't be going back!
