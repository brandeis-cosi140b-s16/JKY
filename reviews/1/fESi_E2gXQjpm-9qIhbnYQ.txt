Ordered for lunch at work yesterday and all of us agreed that for the price it was not worth it - it was just okay.  Steak Chipotle Burrito was big; but, like most places they are made in such a way that you just get large pockets of one thing in each bite.  Panchero's at least mixes theirs a bit.  The steak was gray with a  non-discript flavor; but at least was chopped small enough that it didn't seem chewy.  My spicy salsa was not apparent in the meal.  The jalape√±os were all lumped together in one of those aforementioned pockets.

Chips were okay, tad greasy but good salt level. Guac tasted like it was the prepackaged stuff you can buy in plastic bags in the produce section of the grocery store - it had that weird citric acid aftertaste that you don't get with fresh made guac.  

Did I still eat it?  Yes, I was hungry and I paid for it!  Was I disappointed? Yes, I had heard good things about the place... Live and Yelp, I mean learn!
