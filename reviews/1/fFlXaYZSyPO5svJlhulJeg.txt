Had lunch there today, one of the most rundown dirty restaurants I think I have ever been into, the carpet was filthy and old, sat at a booth and it was so worn out I was sitting on a board, Was hesitant to order food but we all did, I sat there and looked around and started realizing how filthy this restaurant was it was dusty the ceiling had big stains on it all the seats were worn out the walls were smudged and dirty the windows were filthy, I started wondering what I had got myself into, I will get a chili Relleno dinner and it was discuss, it was some chopped up chilies from a can with egg batter which was like an omelette wrapped around it I told the waiter that it was one of most disgusting chili Relleno I have ever tasted, and he told me yeah a lot of people don't like it and turned around and walked away never offering to take it off what I'd like something else, he just walked away, no music was playing in the entire restaurant we could hear ourselves talk because we were the only ones in the restaurant and now I know why! This salsa was disgusting tasted like cheap tomato sauce, The chips are pretty good it would've been nice if they would've been warm instead of cold, I realized the lazy hostess manager server all set around  instead of cleaning since there's nobody coming into the restaurant they could've got a rag and wipe things down! They seem like they just gave up...
