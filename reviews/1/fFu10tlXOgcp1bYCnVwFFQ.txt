Extremely disappointed in this place. The only thing mexican about it is the name & decor. Came here Sunday morning for breakfast only because Hash House a go go was so packed. This place was empty & we still had to wait a while for any kind of service. Ordered their house special Chayo breakfast, on the description it said huevos rancheros with green & red enchiladas but when we got the food it was regular scrambled eggs with chilaquiles. For a place that calls itself a mexican restaurant I expected an authentic dish.
