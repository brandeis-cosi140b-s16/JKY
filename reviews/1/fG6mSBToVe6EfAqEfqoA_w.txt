I love Cafe Rio. The Eastern location has never disappointed me; however, in the past two online orders I've done for this Blue Diamond location, there's always something either missing or incorrect. Normally, I would disregard if something was missing if it wasn't anything major, but today, I ordered a chicken tostada, extra lettuce, black beans and no rice, lime on the side. My container had five bites of lettuce, a handful of cilantro, no lime to be seen, and beans in EVERY SINGLE BITE. Why would I pay for an extra 2oz of delicious tomatillo dressing when there's no lettuce!? The normal 2oz of dressing that it comes with was TOO MUCH for what I had today. 

I feel like I am eating sour cream and cilantro with chicken and beans that happens to have bits of lettuce. HORRIBLE. UNFORTUNATE for such a known name to have such terrible results when it comes to constructing food that is in a food line that only requires someone to read down the list of what to put onto a container.  I am extremely disappointed. I cannot believe I'm considering driving down to the Eastern location just to get the correct order and have a decent amount of food in my container.
