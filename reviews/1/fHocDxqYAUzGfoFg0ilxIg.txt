This place is just horrendous. The first time I moved here we went looking for a good Mexican place to eat and found this place.  Our food tasted like it was microwaved and not authentic at all.  This is a white man's version of Mexican food. I might as well buy canned Mexican meals or frozen ones, much cheaper that way. Don't come here if you want a days long of stomach aches and regrets.
