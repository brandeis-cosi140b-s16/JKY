We've lived in Las Vegas for 5 years and have yet to find a decent restaurant for Mexican, Sushi and even fast food or any restaurant. We have never had bad El Pollo Loco anywhere but here.  Chicken is reheated, and many times they don't have mixed pieces at dinner time!! I have had to call ahead to make sure it's available and often times it's not.  "Do you have breasts, thighs, wings?" The say yes but they can't put a friggin' mixed box together! Sad case at Lake Mead and the one on Cheyenne and Buffalo.
