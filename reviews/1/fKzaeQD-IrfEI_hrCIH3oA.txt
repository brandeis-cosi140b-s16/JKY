Worst service I have ever had.  After asking for a carnitas burrito three times at drive through, saying my order ever-louder, the s##thead at the mic refused to take my order, was abusive, asked to me to come in so he could beat me up.  Take note owner, 8:15pm on 9-8-15.  I guess it is my fault his pa system blows.  What a s##thead.
