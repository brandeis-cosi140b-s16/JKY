Been here for about a half hour now. Have our margaritas, but they must be picking the avocados for the appetizer guacamole straight from a tree in California... We had two waitresses? Each of whom told us that the prices on the menu are not correct, but higher and they were getting new menus tomorrow... We actually ended up leaving! They didn't make us pay for our drinks, which was good, but wow! I wouldn't be surprised if they still hadn't put our order in by the time we left.
