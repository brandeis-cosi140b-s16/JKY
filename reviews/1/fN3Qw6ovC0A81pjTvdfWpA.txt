Pasquals is pretty good at all locations- except THIS one. The service here is so bad. The first time I came, I came at about 2pm and stood for a good 5 minutes at the awkwardly located host stand. The bartender, and the two servers who were in the other rooms clearly saw me and did not come to seat me since the host was m.i.a.. Finally the host came, I was sat, service was meh, food was still good. 

The second time I came back, hoping to experience better. Same dismal service. There was 1 host and 1 server working with 7 tables. Not even a bartender was on yet. (it was 4pm). This man was running around crazy and of course his service was so horrible because he had way too much on his plate. 

Both times I went I never saw a manager. This location has got to get it together. They might as well make it a counter service place with how horrible the servers are, possibly due to the fact that is doesn't seem to be properly managed by anyone.

 I will not be back anytime soon.
