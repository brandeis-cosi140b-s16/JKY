Walked in on a Thursday night.  It didn't seem to be too busy, all the tables near the bar were open except one, and the waitresses were chatting with each other near the patio.   Entering alone, I would normally sit at the bar for my drinks and maybe a little food.  They were all taken, (and I found out quickly it was for good reason) so I positioned myself near the televisions so I could watch the game.  

Menus were on each table so I glanced through them while waiting.  The third quarter of the Colts- Titans game had just started when I sat down.  I decided to leave once the Titan's had scored about four minutes of game time later(which probably means I had been sitting there for 10 minutes).  The waitresses gave me the once over when I walked in and then not a look after that.  

I guess they don't need business that badly.
