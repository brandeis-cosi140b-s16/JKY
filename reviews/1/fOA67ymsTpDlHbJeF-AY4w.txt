I love Mexican food and feel it's kind of like pizza...hard to go wrong. I was wrong. The food at Ixtapa Joe's is not good. It's bland and where there is flavor it just tastes wrong. The only thing that makes the food look good is the service. We literally waited 15 minutes for a side of sauce. It took 2 hours to complete our very simple meal. I spoke to the manager and he is just an awful person. He pointed the finger at the servers and told us if we wanted our bill adjusted it would come out of their pay. How terrible is that?! As if they cooked the food? He did offer me a gift certificate, which I declined. Don't go. It's not worth your money or time.
