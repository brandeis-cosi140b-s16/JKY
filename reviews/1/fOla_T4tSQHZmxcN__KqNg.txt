For some bizarre reason my wife likes this place, and I don't know why. So I end up here once every 6 months or so, and every time the food gets a little worse. It was decent for super Americanized Mexican food years ago, but everything from the burritos to the tacos is just bad now. The service however has stayed the same this whole time, but as it started out awful, that's not saying much
