I'm a Chicago native and know a heck a lot about good food; however, most of food here was very disappointing.  Was a dinner treat and felt that $300 was a waste to be blown for our table. The fish in the fish tacos was so bland and had too much onion that it was an overkill.  Pretty much could have eaten a handful of red onion and that was what the fish tacos were like.  The $30 fish based soup wasn't as good either.  I would rate Taco Bell or even Del taco way better just solely on their soft tacos.  Salsas were bland that just the store bought salsa molcajate would fare way better.  I think the best food was the Oaxaca steak dish that the table next to us had.  Lets just say my eyes got a better deal than my mouth.  Just looking at theirs seemed tastier than what majority of us on our table were putting in our mouths.  Please save your time and money by finding the nearest chipotle or Roberto's.
