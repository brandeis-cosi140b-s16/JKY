Came in on Saturday for tacos.  It used to be really good there, even under the new name, new ownership etc...  I ordered the California tacos and they were served COLD.  There was no flavor and it really wasn't cooked at all, it seemed like someone in the back had some boiled chicken laying around, cut it up and shoved it in cold corn tortillas.  It really pissed me off to pay for specialty tacos with no flavor and cold meat.  The salsa bar sucked too with no flavor, and chips that seemed old.  I will not go back.  However, there were a lot of people drinking beer and the patio looked inviting.  So maybe people just go to drink or something.  My boyfriend ordered the tri tip and chicken platter.  He said it was just OK.  Our lunch was $22.00 with no booze- not a good value.
