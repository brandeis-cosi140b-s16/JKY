I really don't care for this place, at all, and was dragged here twice by a friend who loved it.

The whole restaurant is large and empty with no decor. It's like an enlarged tin shed. 
The menu is confusing. 
The girl working talks to you like you're stupid if you don't get or like how the menu works. She couldn't fathom that I just wanted my food plain. "Are you sure? You get it in a taco or a burrito if you want!"  But chica,I DON'T want. I am here against my will and I just want normal Chinese or Jamaican food, not some weird bastard child they had with a Mexican.

The whole concept to me is like what I do when I have random leftovers in my fridge and tortillas; make burritos out of the leftovers. It's not something I would pay for. Maybe that's personal, but I find jerk chicken does not go in a tortilla well.

The food is either bland or so hot you can't taste anything else. The second time, it made me extremely sick in my nether regions for the whole afternoon. 

Never again.
