Taking a redeye from Phoenix to Atlanta and was hoping for a drink before the flight to help me sleep. 

After ordering my drink, the bar tender looks at my Florida ID, notices the small crack down the middle, and says he can't accept it. The crack, more like a small fold really, is made from all the bar tenders bending it in the first place! Many Florida IDs have the same mark. 

I knows the laws, and I know it's to the bar tenders best judgement here. Hire someone with some common sense. This made a rough night on a redeye even worse.
