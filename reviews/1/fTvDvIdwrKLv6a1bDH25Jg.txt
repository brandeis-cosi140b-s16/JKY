On May 5 my husband and I went to have lunch to celebrate Cinco de Mayo.  The chips and salsa were good but I will never return to a place that served me a spoiled shrimp cocktail.  When I told the waitress that my cocktail was spoiled her reply was "you're not the first one to say that".  Than why was it still being served.  Lucky for me I noticed the fowl taste and fizzle in my mouth that I immediately discarded it.  It's probably the only thing that kept me from getting sick.
