I've been to half the Filibertos in Phx since the first one opened. While living on the East Coast I yearned for a late night Fili run and would do so whenever visiting. 
I've moved back and been to this location at Gilbert and Baseline and foolishly keep going back. Here are my grievances:
Prices way up
Quality so so (usually just a bean and cheese burrito, but cold and for $4.03?)
Attitude. C'mon. It's Filibertos. Don't judge me at the counter.

Bottom line is, two bean burritos with cheese and a medium drink for $12.50? I may as well be in NYC. And then the attitude. Just don't need it. I'll hit Ricardos up the road. :)

I'll keep hitting Filis here and there but this one is finally gone over the top and lost me. They just don't care. There are plenty of folks driving thru and their tills are running over. Clearly there is no pressing need to maintain a charade of friendly service to mix with their high-priced fast food.
