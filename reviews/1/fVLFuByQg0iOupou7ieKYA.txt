7:30pm 11-23... 2nd person in line guy attempts to do a take out web order... Has no clue what he's reading or how to complete the order... I wait 5 min 10.. min. 15 enough.... You have 5 ppl in line now who know what they want at this time.... Still haven't been acknowledge by any staff.... It's not rocket science... 4 employees standing around and not a single person can start a fucking order.... Never ever again.
