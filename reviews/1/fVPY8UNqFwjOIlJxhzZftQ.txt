Disgusting. Food was cold, and no taste. Servers had no clue what they were doing. Sitting around on phones while I need a drink refill. I won't come back and I defiantly won't let my friends and family waste their money here. Atmosphere seems like they could make this place something but they don't even play jazz music. Strange.
