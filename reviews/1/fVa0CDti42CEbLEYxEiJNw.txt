My husband & I stopped for dinner.   After waiting for a bit & watching others walk in after us & then be seated before us,  I was a little irritated.   I went up & said something to the girls & was seated almost immediately.   The table that we were seated at was sticky to touch.   We were seated very close to the other tables around us (not enough space between chairs).  But then to see what I think was ground beef on the table from the customers before us..........GROSS!  We are long time customers of Popo's, both restaurants.  If this is what we are gonna look forward to from your restaurant, then I think maybe we'll find another Mexican food restaurant to eat at!
