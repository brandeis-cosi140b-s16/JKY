SO I love me some 'Bertos' anything since Ive moved into the valley... all the Bertos confuse me.. is it Filibertos? Because Im confused.. well, maybe its a blonde thing I just dont get.. BUT this aint NO Filibertos, yo.. 
I went to EriBertos this morning.. as I have a few times before since moving to North Phoenix.. First.. S L O W.. secondly, can we say H A I R in my food.. ugh! Nothing worse.. okay.. stomach is turned.. and money is wasted.. I guess I didnt need huevos rancheros anyway.. but when that kind of negligence takes place.. it doesnt deserve even a one star.. boo Bertos!
