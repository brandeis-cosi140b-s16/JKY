This place was an utter disappointment. I walked in around 11-11:30 when they should have been prepping for the lunch rush. The tables and floor looked like they hadn't been cleaned since the night before. The food was pretty bland. The person wearing the chef coat took our order, he was sick. Coughing everywhere, handling the cash and not once did I see him was his hands. Luckily he was not preparing our food, but nonetheless it was pretty disgusting. Stay Away!
