Much like the other Mexico City locations the food here is pretty good. Unfortunately due to the terrible lunch time service I don't think I'll be returning. My party of 7 arrived at 11:45, before the lunch rush hit. We ended up not getting our food till after 12:45. When the food was finally delivered several orders were wrong (asked for just sour cream, given everything but sour cream, ordered two tacos, given and charged for the 3 taco meal, etc.) After sending one of the items back to be corrected we asked for our checks, and asked if they could be separated. We were told that they wont do separate checks for groups over six because "it takes too long." Finally after being there for an hour twenty (only have an hour for lunch) we were able to get out of the door. Though the food was good, due to the service and long wait I will not be returning.
