Upon entering the restaurant we were greeted by a bartender. I went to the restroom and upon my return found my husband still waiting to be seated.  After a few minutes together, we asked the bartender if someone was going to seat us or if we should seat ourselves.  He replied "oops, sorry about that, I can seat you".  We should have left right then and there because for the rest of the evening we were treated as though we were invisible. . Our waiter was disinterested in us, and we waited over 45 minutes to get our food on an evening when the restaurant was not full.  The food was OK., we did enjoy the wine selection.   My husband and I are accustomed to high-end restaurants and thoroughly enjoy mom and pop restaurants. We would not spend money here again.
