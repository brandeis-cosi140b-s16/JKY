Ate in for lunch.

The good: Beer was cold, and service was fast.

The bad: To start, it smelled like there was a plumbing issue in the restaurant. I ordered the "vegetable" (note, not "vegetarian") tacos lunch and was served tacos with beans, cheese, lettuce, and tomato. Was expecting roasted or sauteed vegetables, not beans. And I certainly expect onions and cilantro rather than lettuce and tomato at a taqueria. The beans were flavorless, the rice not much better. When I asked for the fountain soda that was included in the lunch special, I was given a completely flat soft drink. Finally, in my opinion, the prices are a little high, and I was not offered a receipt when I paid.

Overall: Would give them a second try, but certainly wouldn't pay for it.
