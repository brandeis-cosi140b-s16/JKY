Went to this location last night, got a pretty simple family meal that comes with 2 sides...AND SHOCKER...one of the sides was wrong.  I asked for rice and mac&cheese, got rice and beans *bleh*.  I think I'm going to just start tracking the "mess ups" on Yelp!  So sad...it's LITERALLY every time I come here, something is wrong.  First time, missing a burrito that I was charged for, second time no chicken on my salad when I asked for no pico...third time no tortillas in the bag, and on and on.  This was my SIXTH VISIT!  0 for 6 is pretty sad...Too bad there isn't one closer to me.  All I can do is laugh...it's hysterical.
