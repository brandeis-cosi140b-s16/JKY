Below you will see a review submitted by Natalie A. Unfortunately, I was a guest in her party during the experience she also reviewed. I came to Yelp to save others from what we went through without even knowing she commented... and reading her review, makes this so necessary. In whatever line of work you do, you encounter people who consistently want something for free and hope to take advantage of "the customer is always right" motto. I assure you, I have no problem paying my way. We called around looking for a fun happy hour spot and decided on Macayo's. I'll point out that neither during our call to check about happy hour, nor when we arrived did any staff member mention that happy hour was only in the bar area. We were seated in the dining room and ordered drinks, appetizers and dinner. Upon receiving the bill, someone in our party questioned the happy hour pricing. The server seemed timid and just left the table to grab the manager. Honestly, I had no problem just paying it and leaving but when Erica Martin came to our table, my tune definitely changed. This woman has no business being in the hospitality industry. She basically said TOUGH LUCK with an overkill smile on her face and a male shadowing her who said nothing. (She should not be training anyone) Again, business is business and there are policies... but come on, knock off a draft beer and thank everyone for coming. Then learn from it and inform your hostess staff to relay these policies to your guests. Not her, and this location is going to pay for her mistake. I made sure to tell everyone I knew about how we were treated. And yes, she went right to the hostess stand and began mocking us, ensuring that we heard. For a middle aged woman and from a management standpoint, completely ridiculous behavior.
