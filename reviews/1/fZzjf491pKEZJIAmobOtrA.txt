Arriving at the restaurant, the lunch hour hostess (ink covering her left arm) directed us to a dark corner booth. When asked if we could sit by the windows,  she rolled her eyes and pointed at the empty booths available.  Perhaps she should work in the back of the house instead of greeting customers.  

Our server, Christa, was very polite and professional! She did a fantastic job and almost changed our opinion of this visit.  Our order was very good and very hot!  

We noticed that the lunch hour hostess was training a new employee.  Big mistake, she needs to be retrained herself!  After coming to this restaurant for about six years, this will probably be our last visit!
