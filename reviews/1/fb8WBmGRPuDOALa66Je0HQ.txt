I realize they're in this business for the money but jeez being my first time here it would've been awesome had you told me to wait 5 minutes and I'd get my tacos for less than half the price. Or at least give me the happy hour price. That alone would have proved to be great customer service and wouldve made a customer for life. But thanks for nothing guys. I wont be back.
