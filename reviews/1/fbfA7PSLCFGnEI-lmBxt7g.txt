Not going back! Been here a few times, food is okay and view is nice.. My last visit was last night with family from out of town. We had a party of 6 (2 of which were small children) and when we put our name in we were told it would be a 20 minute wait. So we waited and waited and 40 minutes go by. We go up to the hostess and ask how much longer, she says 10 more minutes and that we were next to be seated. Okay cool we were fine with that, so we sit back down and wait. 25 more minutes go by and we go back up to the hostess. I asked her how much longer it would be and she says 10 more minutes! Ugh! I ask to speak to the manager at that point and she says she will get him.  I sit back down and the hostess comes over to us and says it will just be 10 more minutes she promises. We said we have had enough, and walk out! I understand you give an estimated time to wait and I understand they cannot control how long your wait will be, but why say 20 minute wait when it is really 1 hour and 15 minutes? That is a pretty big difference, and the hostess doesn't even send over the manager when you ask to talk to them? This whole problem could have been avoided if the hostess would have just been honest about the wait time. We could have decided to go somewhere else from the beginning instead of having to wait forever then leave still hungry!
