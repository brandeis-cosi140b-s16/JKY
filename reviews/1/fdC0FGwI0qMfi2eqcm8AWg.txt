Overall horrible experience... I'm usually not the person to leave bad reviews but this place needs to recognize bad customer service if they want customers to return. We came in, the place was busy we got seated almost right away which was great. Our server, a shorter gentlemen with dark hair who seemed rushed managed to get us drinks then chips and salsa were placed at the table. We did finish the first basket of chips and salsa quickly then asked for a refill which seemed to annoy the server but as a customer if I request a refill I want  to see it happen. He must have passed by three times and still no refill. Not only did he try to avoid us by not giving us chips my sons soda just sat empty. At that point we just never asked him for anything else. Bus boy was nice enough to grab another soda and fresh chips which I appreciated. Food came out about 45 minutes later, food was good just bad service.
