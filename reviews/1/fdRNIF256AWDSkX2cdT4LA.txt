So I decided to try the "amazing" burrito bowl... I dot know where to begin..

The rice was dry and hard, chicken didn't taste like chicken, the rest of the ingredients didn't stand out and just tasted weird. I could barely choke down half of it before giving up... I have eaten many of their offerings, none have come close to this atrocity.

I can't believe Lorena Garcia put her name behind this! If in were in her shoes, no matter the pay, I would not disgrace myself like that..    

They should take this off the menu today!

P.s. If their bathroom indicated the quality of their food - I would give the a minus -100
