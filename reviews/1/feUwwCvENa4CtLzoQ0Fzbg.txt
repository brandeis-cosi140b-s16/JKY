WORST MEXICAN FOOD IN PHX.. I ordered the hard shell chicken tacos and they were horrible!!! The shells were store baught  and tasted nasty!!! On top of that the chicken was cold and pre cooked and in tiny cubes .. The Worst tacos ever!! I Also  ordered a carne asada torta and that was horrible as well .. The bread was cold, hard and old.. The meat was cold dry and very little of it,, had I opened my containers of food I would have asked for my money back on the spot.. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyway!!! Still the worst
