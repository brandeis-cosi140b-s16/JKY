I am a vegetarian, and they served me meat instead of a portabella taco that I had ordered.  I took a bite, and then realized immediately it was meat.  The bartender called the manager over, and the first thing he did was say (in front of me), "She already ate it?!", as if I was trying to scam them out of a taco.  I then showed him that I only took a bite, at which point he apologized and they put in another order.  Then, when my meal came out, the taco came on corn tortillas after I had ordered flour.  The bartender argued with me that they were flour, and again the manager was called over, and he confirmed they were corn, and took my plate and put in another order for flour.  The entire experience was just chaotic and unorganized.
