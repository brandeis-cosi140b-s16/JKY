A total disappointment, especially since we dined as a large group on our last night in Vegas and were hankering for Tex-Mex. Despite the fact that it was located in the Palms, Chili's would have offered better drinks and food.

The restaurant itself is a bit dated, and dark. While the menu items descriptions sounded tantalizing, what was delivered to the plate was terrible. My low carb twist on chicken with chorizo sauce ended up being a dried-out chicken breast served with a blah diced zucchini and squash mix. My husband's carnitas were so unlike the traditional pulled pork presentation, he actually challenged the waitress that she had made a mistake - couldn't have been what he ordered! Alas, their take on carnitas was chunks of pork tenderloins smothered in onions and served with beans and cheese. 

The margaritas were hopelessly awful. A "small" house marg on the rocks arrived with way too much tequila and little lime juice/mix; after a return to the bar the second drink was a little better, but others in the group had much worse. One marg tasted like key lime pie; another was so watery and slushy it might has well have been a lime popsicle crushed in a glass.

Go for a Corona and their chips and salsa. THAT was good, and that's about it.
