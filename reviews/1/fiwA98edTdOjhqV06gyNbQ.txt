Beware of food poisoning and terrible service.

Ordered:
Whole Tilapia
Carne Asada Plate (food poisoning) 
Machaca
Shrimp Cevice (this didnt get me sick)

I had been there many, many times with my family.  I was willing to tolerate poor service in exchange for cheap and decent food. 

But then one day... I ordered the carne asada plate and everything on my plate was hot... except for my meat!! Oh they warmed it up for me... 
But, the real question is WHY DID I EAT IT AFTER THAT? 
I got food poisoning. 

Never will return
