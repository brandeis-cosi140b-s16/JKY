Stay away from this place if you want to get sick. This place is a filthy,disgusting hole in the wall. The place was dirty,dusty and filthy stain up the walls. And the bathroom was grosser than any place in Mexico I have been. Food was gross and chips and salsa came out of a bag. I have never seen a restaurant this filthy in Phoenix.
