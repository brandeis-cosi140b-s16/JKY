My husband and I ate here last night for the first time, and we will never go back.  We didn't know that it is really only a place for drinking, not eating.

The chips were greasy and all broken in small pieces.  The salsa was not anything I would want to eat again.  My husband ordered the tortilla soup and he said it was ok.  I ordered the fish tacos and took one bite.  It didn't taste right.  My husband tried one bite and had to spit it in to his napkin.  They were bad.  Spoiled or something.  My side of sour cream was warmish, not cold.  My husband tried his chili cornbread and it was burned, greasy, and not cooked through in the middle.  I had ordered a side of guacamole and it was overly salty and did not taste fresh or right either.  

I noticed that there was a prep area near the edge of the restaurant where waitresses cut avocados and scooped them out.  Bottles of their "salsa" were left out and not returned to the tubs of ice, where I assume they were supposed to go.  It did not look clean or well maintained.  Vile!

We told the waitress that the fish tacos were bad and they did take it off our bill, but to be honest they could have taken everything off the bill.  Nothing was worth paying for!  No wait, my husband had a margarita and he said it was pretty good.  So that's it.  I guess the Salty Senorita is a loud  annoying place to have a good margarita and a decent bowl of tortilla soup.
