Mexican Food is suppose to be a lot when they serve you Chips and Salsa. We had to pay extra $6.95 and the plate has ten tortilla chips and about 2 spoon of beans. The service is horrible. That poor girl is clueless and is over price for the area first and last time at this place. Tables are dirty. Why do thy have ten people cooking and one waitress who does everything in the front of the house ? No very friendly people. Food is just OK.
