If you are looking for a place where you are treated like the food they serve, Eureka! You have found it!  From the water bottles, cups, cigarette buds and make shift sign all prior to entering the restaurant, should've read the writing in the wall.  Upon entering and being sat by a pleasant host/server(highlight of the visit) the bartender who served us was cordial but I asked myself "why does he get to eat prior to us?" It was 12:20 in the afternoon and he and the other employee were eating while we were waiting for them to serve us the food in the window right in front of us.  I was feeling sorry for the glassware that walked by us because it was violated by the server/bartender with all of those fingers up in it.  The food, honestly why serve it?  The milkshake concoction they called refried beans accompanied by the 2 inch tortillas for $11.95.  Words of wisdom to the owner, please re-evaluate your standards from the front door to the back!  Oh yea, the hungry bartender never washed his hands after the violating of the glassware or the shoveling of the food into his face.  That and the chip cloth that comes with your chips being immediately re-used, not right at any level.
