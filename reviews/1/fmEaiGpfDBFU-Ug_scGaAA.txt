I love El Pollo Loco, but this is the first one Ive ever been unhappy with. I went in pretty early in the day. I'm not sure if the chicken wasn't prepared like normal... or if it was yesterday's. The skin was so tough, when normally that's what makes it so delicious. 

The reason it's getting one star though, is because this store obviously has a sewer problem. Walking up to the store it smelled great. Inside was another story. At first I thought it must just be because they had the bathroom doors open for cleaning. But eating in the dining area it was still an overwhelming smell. It was stronger by the soda machine, where only water and soda is going in the drain. So definitely do not eat in!!!! It really ruined the food. But I wouldn't return for drive through either, since they're trademark chicken was a let down. 
There's always a silver lining, so I will say that the staff was nice, friendly and fast.
