I was injured walking into Calico Jack's because of their negligence.  You'd think they would have written a injury report.  Went back three times the next day to speak to a manager and was told to go to small claims court.  By the way, never got to speak to a manager. This place is a joke. Never stepping foot in this place again, not even if they paid my medical bills and then gave me free dinner and drinks.
