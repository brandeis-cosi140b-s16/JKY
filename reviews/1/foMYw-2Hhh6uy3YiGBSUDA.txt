I usually do not give bad ratings; I find that you can give grace to a place, and understand that not everything is perfect all the time. However, we show up at 6:40p, order the fish tacos - greasy, over-cooked in the way that caused them get really dry (and the addition of cheese was interesting) - we also order the Pollo Torta - are charged for the Torta and tacos, and gave a good tip. Then we are told that they ran out of Tortas, no bread (very unfortunate, if true, unless they restock on Sunday mornings?). We then order the Five Pollo Taco deal and are asked to pay the $0.45 difference. Okay, I understand that it is hard to make money in Phx sometimes, however, it would be nice if the tip could have covered their lack of bread. We sit down to wait, our food comes out, and we are told they are closing. ??? At 6:50, not 6:59 or 6:29. We are hurried out the door with our BAGGED food, door quickly locked behind us. We get five minutes down the road, and magically there are three, NOT, five tacos, and they have nothing on them. Maybe the microwave used to heat the tacos 'ate' the other TWO. (Who uses a microwave to cook 'Real' Mexican fare?) Great, exactly what I want from a local place that I just over-tipped. Anyway, I know to avoid this place now. Good luck finding your way in the Phx restaurant scene.
