I was recommended to visit this restaurant.  I was told the food was the best. I ordered a tamale w rice and beans. It was the worst. It was wet and soggy, tasteless. The rice and beans were mediocre.  Normally I don't waste time on these reviews,  but I could have easily gotten over the tasteless food.  I told the girl I didn't like the tamale,  she took it away... and didn't say a word.  A simple 'would you like to try something else?'  Nothing..... my daughter went up to get a refill and I had her ask the girl if I could get a tostada instead of the tamale... she brought me a tostada... we get ready to leave...the girl yells ' mam...the tostada? I said thank you it was better. .. she said no you still have to pay for it!  I said I thought it was a replacement for the tamale... she said well ok but the tamales 2.00 and the tostada is 2.25, you owe me a quarter. I was in complete disbelief.  If you lack in customer service,  I don't care how good or bad the food is.... I will never visit or recommend an establishment.
