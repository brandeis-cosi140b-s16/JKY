Took another couple out tonight and had the Mexican pizza special.  (Pizza and two drinks for $20).  We sent the first pizza back we split back because it was unevenly heated and cool in spots. Should have given up there. It may have been reheated but that didnt help.  Greasy and so much cheese it was just nasty. Dont bother.
