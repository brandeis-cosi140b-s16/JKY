We sure didn't have a very good experience. The server was pleasant, but got a lot of stuff wrong, ie: no silverware, wrong order, empty drinks, wrong info on menu item even after asking the cook. The fact that we were her only table made it all that much worse.  Food was really awful.  It is hard to mess up Mexican food, but they did it.  The "relleno" was a plain pepper with cheese whiz and no sauce or spice or anything, the enchilada was hard and nasty, the beans and mild salsa were both anemic looking and tasteless.  The tacos were just  "ok" . The only good part was the hot salsa.  Save your time and money and try something else.
