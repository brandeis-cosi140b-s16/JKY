Have come to this location in the past and today I had the worst service experience in my life. There were 2 employees that very rudely handled a request that was very small. Then when I let him know he was out of line, he became even more rude. Between arguing with me and not listening and having to ring me up twice that was enough to make me want to walk out. THEN one of the employees involved had the gall to come over and asked how we were while we were eating. I let him know the food is fine but that does not change my thoughts that I will never come back to this location.
THEN when my husband went to get a lid they gave him a coupon for buy 1 get 1 free.... As one last sad attempt to save themselves. I personally will never step foot in this location again and will rethink even choosing Chipotle as a whole. If this is how the company trains their staff then I will not support or contribute too. Goes back to a simple rule when it comes to service, it's not what you are saying but how you say it.
