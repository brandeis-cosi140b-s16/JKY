The ribs that my friend bought were very dry and difficult to chew.  My sandwich was cold when it came out and the wait staff were non-attentive.  The chips tasted old and I was dissatisfied with the service we received.  The restaurant was almost empty and we still had trouble getting the wait staff's attention. Will not be returning because without my permission upped my final bill by 3 dollars (I have the receipt)
