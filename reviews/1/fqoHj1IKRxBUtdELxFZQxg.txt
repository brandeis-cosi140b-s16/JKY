Not a fan of this location at all. I love chipotle as a whole and it's a great company   This location makes me think different. I usually go during my lunch break and it is usually quite busy but there service is terrible and they give you barely any rice or veggies but charge you an arm and a leg for there tiny portions. I went there yesterday and I'm pretty sure I got food poisoning. They need to step up there game.
