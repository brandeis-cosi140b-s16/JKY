Not pleased with this place at all. The waitress took our beer order and didn't even ask if we wanted a regular or large. My wife ordered tacos and once again wasn't asked what type of tortilla or sides she wanted. It came out as a huge soggy mess that you couldn't even pick up. The "state mandated" well done burger is a bunch of bull that changed years ago. The home fries that came with my ground beef hockey  puck where cold and there was no site of a chimichuri sauce to be found (unless the green mayo is their version of it.)
