I don't really know what the heck I just ate here, but I thought I had ordered a Carne Asada burrito.  They gave me a bunch of meat, guac, salsa all wrapped in a fried tortilla...where is the produce??  It tasted like a gigantic greasy abomination...im sorry but that is not a burrito.  I'm not sure of the quality of the meat, but I think I'll try and find a better place to go for my lunch break.
