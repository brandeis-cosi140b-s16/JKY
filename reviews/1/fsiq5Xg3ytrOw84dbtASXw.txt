This place has gone downhill. The staff is slow and the orders are rarely correct. They post hours til 4 am on weekends but are rarely open past 3. They say they open at 7 but I had to wait 15 minutes for them to turn the computers on. Just go further down east wash if you need a crappy taco fix. But if you get Tamara in the drive thru at night,  you're golden. That girl is awesome.
