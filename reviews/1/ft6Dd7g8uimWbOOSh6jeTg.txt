We didn't even stay to eat.  The place has great curb appeal.  That didn't save the trip.

1.  Staff was not friendly.  Only two people were on duty.  One was standing behind the counter staring into space or watching TV.  The other was sitting down eating.

2.  Doesn't appear to be too clean.

3.  Pricey for a little hole-in-the wall place.  Not a sit down restaurant and some of the dishes are $10!

4.  They serve "off" food.  Tongue.  Other weird assorted animal parts.

We stayed, read the entire menu, and then I whispered, "Olive Garden?" and we left.  Not worth a trip.
