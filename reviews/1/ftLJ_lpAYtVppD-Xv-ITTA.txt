I come to this place a lot, tonight a LOUD drunk at 6:30 pm was running off customers. What is worst they keep serving this drunk!!!  Juan was thinking it was funny. This drink could kill someone later tonight  Sitting at bar like I normally due. Not sure I will come back manager on Dufy should of handled this BEFORE he got more shots and then more beer. It almost 7 pm and he is still going strong and again VERY loud including using the F work this is a restaurant with small kids, come on someone throw out this drunk! Or put him in a cab at lease STOP serving him,
