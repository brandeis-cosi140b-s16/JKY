I ate here one time shortly after the restaurant opened and paid with my debit card.  Today I noticed on my bank's website that the debit charge from May was debited from my account in late September; more than four months later.  This makes me very suspicious as I have NEVER had a debit card vendor wait four months to debit my account for a purchase.  As such, I will not eat at this establishment again.
