"YAY! I was a fan" until last night. Me and my wife used to love this place, it was on our top 3 Happy Hour spots. Until I tried to order a "Tequila Mockingbird" and the whole place was stomped, no one knew what was in it. The bartender literally asked everyone in the restaurant and the owner what was in it and how to make one, she also asked me what was in it. So I told her how to make one, she tried, it wasn't that good but I didn't tell her that, because I didn't wanna be rude. I strongly believe with all my heart that this restaurant should change its name to NOT have "Modern Tequila Bar" in it. Because the only thing they know how to do is pour pre-mixed drinks into a cup or pour beer out of a tap. I go out to bars to get drinks I can't make at home if I wanted to pour myself a pre-mixed Margarita from a bottle I would just stay home. If you want a sophisticated Tequila Cocktail drink then the "Canteen Modern Tequila Bar" is NOT the place for you. I personaly will not be going there ever again until they change their name and take out the word "Tequila" from it.
