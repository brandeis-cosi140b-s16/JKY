Here's another sucky airport bar with crappy food.  I ordered the nachos as they only had a few food items on their menu.  They sucked!  They were wet and flavorless. Make sure to ask up front to separate alcohol on your check.  I asked when the waitress brought me the beer I ordered and she told me they were already on one check.  WTF?  Go back and separate them then!  I will not be back here.  If you are looking for food before your flight I suggest stopping off before you reach the airport.
