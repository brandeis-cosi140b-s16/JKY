Went with a large group of 15+ people. The first problem was they only gave us 1 waiter, so everything took forever. The waiter never came back to refill my water or offer me another beer. Our first order of tacos came out cold, when they replaced them, they were the wrong ones.  Keep in mind the restaurant wasn't busy during this. The food was just ok and all I could taste is spice from the hot sauce. I feel bad for the waiter for the lack of support, training, and management
