Friend talked up the place. I was very disappointed, the cashier who was not new kept asking the cooks for help ringing us up, she did not know the prices of anything and ended up overcharging us. When we requested easy ice for our horchata she literally filled the cup with ice. The lengua was the antithesis of what good lengua should be and was barely recognizable and the tortas had the brownest avocado I've ever been served.
