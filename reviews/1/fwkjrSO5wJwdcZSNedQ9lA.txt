Very disappointing dinner at Pepe's!!! After being sat in a sauna for what was like 20 minutes, and being asked by every server if someone took our drink order, we are finally get drinks. Then the waitress vanished for another 10 minutes and comes back and takes our order. Then finally 30 minutes later we finally receive our food. The look of the food is good, A beef chimi Rice and beans. First bite, it taste like it was fried in fish grease. The chimi has no real defined taste, bland fishy. The Guacamole taste like frozen store quality. 
After sweating with inedible food, we finally flag down a different server, because our server has vanished, to get a box and our bill...
 Another long time Phoenix restaurant gone down hill... So sad!!!! Poor service and low quality food!!!
