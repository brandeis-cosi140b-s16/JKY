Honestly, I swear that my husband and I have nothing against Aliante Station but I find myself writing yet another bad review for one of their restaurants. The other review- PiPs.

I love mexican food (heck- I love all ethnic foods) and was really craving some Mexican. My husband is not a big fan but indulged me. I wish I had chosen a different restaurant. I ordered the combination plate of Tamales and Enchilada verde. My husband ordered the Enchiladas De Mariscos (basically scallops, shrimp, halibut enchilada w/. usual fillings). 

There was nothing special or wonderful about the combo dish. In fact, it was lacking in favorite and the rice was very bland. As for my husband's enchilada, it was gross. There was just too much seafood in the shell and quite frankly the choice of seafood was not very complimentary together. I think the restaurant needs to replace this item with only halibut and replace the exisiting shrimp enchilada with a citrus shrimp (grilled) enchilada.

Only good things about this restaurant: great margaritas and the complimentary chips & salsa. 

Would we recommend this place? NO. 
And now it will be even tougher to get my husband to go to a mexican restaurant! In the meantime, I'll just continue eating at the food court (dunkin donuts is the best before a Sunday matinee).
