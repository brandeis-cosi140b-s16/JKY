I will never eat at this location again. My wife and I ate here and ended up with food poisoning. We have 4 in our household including our young son...no one else in the household ended up sick...because my wife and I were the only ones to eat chipotle that day. We normally love chipotle and eat at their other locations often. This was our first...and last visit to their westgate location. Place was real busy when we went so maybe that equals lack of cooking food properly or likely handling food improperly. $23.00 wasted and a night of sitting on the bathroom floor...not what I had expected from chipotle.
