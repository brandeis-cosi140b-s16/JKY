What a joke $7.00 and $8.00 beers common!  I ordered a pork taco, they asked me if I wanted a side of sour cream and guacamole, I should of asked how much - $1.99 for guacamole and $1.29 for sour cream, WHAT!!!  The taco was dry and shell soggy  and I got 5 tortilla chips. Run away as fast as you can from this place! Oh one last point, service was awful!
