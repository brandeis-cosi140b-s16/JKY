I would like to start by saying that Roberto's has often been the destination my family and I would eat at. We normally love the food, however, food can only go so far when it comes to customer service. I am unsure if all locations follow the same "uncaring" attitude this location seemed to have, but for the sake of the business, I hope not. 

Tonight we ordered 2 beef burritos along with a variety of other dishes for carryout. We often find ourselves spending  well over 30-40 dollars for the entire family, and we do this quite often throughout the year. The 2 beef burritos were EXTREMELY salty, and we decided to call the location and ask for 2 new burritos to be made, specifically Carne Asada. The employee began to tell us that there is absolutely no salt in the ingredients list for the burrito, which I found very hard to believe. We decided to go to the store and speak with her, but the best response I could get was "It's not my problem you didn't like the food, it's your problem." Also, we were going to be held responsible for paying the difference for an order that was already misunderstood to begin with, and in theory, pay for the burritos that tasted awful. I cut many companies slack that support outstanding customer service because it is in human nature to make mistakes, and if the company is going to compensate for their misunderstandings and mistakes, there is no reason to be upset. A company that does not exercise this notion is destined to lose customers, and as one myself, I will find it very hard to mention Roberto's in the next conversation that includes dinner options.
