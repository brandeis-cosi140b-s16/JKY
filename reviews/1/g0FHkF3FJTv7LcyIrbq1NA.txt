First of all there's a police substation in the lobby now. So, as you're waiting to be seated you are oogled by the police officers. Unfortunately this is not just a momentary bad vibe, it's the theme for the evening. the dining area is reminiscent of a Warsaw gulag with the owner of the restaurant and busboys literally standing watch and making patrols as if they were prison guards , all this in me pursuit of preventing people from stealing dinner? Meanwhile the service was terrible, we came thirsty and eager to drink and eat and left thirsty. We only saw our waiter perhaps 5 times the entire evening. The only positive thing there was to say about the entire evening was the food was average. There was nothing really negative one can say about the food.
