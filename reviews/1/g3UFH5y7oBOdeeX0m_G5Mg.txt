I had a really bad experience yesterday my first time at this location . The Mexican Cashier has a freaking attitude ! She doesn't know anything about customer service . She try to charge me for everything even when I ask for a to go box . She denied that she didn't have horchata I'm like really! I end up getting nasty soda . If you want to waste your time keep going to that location with nasty ass people like her . I will never be back . Can't complain about the food it was really good . But the nasty customer service I got will make me never stop by again .
