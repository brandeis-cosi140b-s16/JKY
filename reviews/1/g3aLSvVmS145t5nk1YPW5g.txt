This was bland Mexican food.  We enjoyed the chips and salsa, but should have probably left then.  I had the steak fajitas and although the portion size was huge (how does anyone fit all that into 3 little tortillas?), it was missing seasoning to indicate to my mouth that I was eating fajitas and not just strips of steak, peppers and onions.  I think with a decent drizzle of cheese and a bun, it could have been an ok philly cheesesteak sandwich.  My husband ordered a burrito and a chile relleno.  The burrito was ok, a bit boring, but edible.  The chile relleno was missing a key part, the pepper.  The menu stated that their chile relleno version is a piece of bell pepper covered with meat and cheese.  In reality what he got was just a blob of overly salty cheese.  My husband who eats just about anything couldn't stand it.  The rice and bean accompaniments were also pretty blah.  Maybe they had an off night, but I don't think we will chance it again.
