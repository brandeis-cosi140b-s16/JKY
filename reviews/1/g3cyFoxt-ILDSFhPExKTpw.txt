It's simple, the food it yummy, the staff is (was) friendly and they have a full bar. 
But here is the trick, if you are anything like me then u are always eating it at home since I'm not about to haul my 3 little munchkins in there for mommy to get a margarita with her chips and salsa. ... So, don't forget to order your chips and salsa if u have a take out order since it's an addition charge.
My absolute fav thing on the menu is the nacho supreme with shredded chicken. My kids love the shredded beef taco or cheese enchiladas.
Don't forget to use their mobile app for coupons and their loyalty program.

---after a horrible customer service experience there recently, I'm done with this place!
