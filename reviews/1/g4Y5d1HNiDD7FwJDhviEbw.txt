I wish I read the reviews before trying this restaurant! 

We ventured to the Fulton Ranch Promenade to try this Mexican Restaurant. We never had a chance to try the other restaurants in the same location that seem to stay open less than a year.

My husband and I ordered water with lemons and were disappointed to see that his lemon slice had a large black spot on it, and my lemon slice had several brown spots on them. Yuck, I don't want to squeeze that into my water. Why would you serve this to a customer?

Our server spoke less than five words to us. We understand English is not her primary language. However, she could have been cheerful and welcoming towards us, especially with our small children.

Yes, the chips arrived in hot dog baskets. The busboy was prompt and friendly, however, the chip basket was so small - he could not help but touch the chips with his hands while serving.

The food tasted similar to frozen food entrees I had the pleasure of eating while I was in college....I thought those days were gone. 

We look forward to the next restaurant that opens in this location.
