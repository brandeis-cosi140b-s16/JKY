Went for lunch but they have no lunch menu . Dinner prices for lunch is way too expensive . When we walked in it smelled like a restroom . Ordered a beef burrito and had no beef in it . All beans , lunch came to seventeen dollars including tip . Alot of money for a bean burrito . Never going again ever .
