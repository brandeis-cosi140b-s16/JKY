I have eaten at Woody's restaurants in Phoenix from the mid-sixties (El Nido on McDowell) until as recently as a week ago at Macayo on Central.  Late in the afternoon on Saturday, we went to the Tempe location for the first time, and were very disappointed.  The food was as good as usual, but we had two issues.  First, I ordered a standard Margarita.  I hadn't eaten since morning, so had an empty stomach, and I could tell that there was no alcohol in that drink.  NONE.  Eight dollars is pretty expensive for a glass of Margarita mix.  Second, when our server brought the bill, there were two mistakes in the restaurant's favor totaling two dollars and 29 cents.  All together, about $10 overcharged!
