Terrible place. Service was awful and the food was no better. Ordered the overpriced veggie nacho platter. Was hungry so didn't mind paying airport prices  but expected to something edible. Not so. The salsa had gone off. The pinto beans were undercooked and the guacamole was brown. Top that off with chips that went doggy in thirty seconds and there you have a perfect airport meal - NOT!
