Over priced food!  Have gone several times and have experienced long waits each time; and the assemblers of the food put lime on my food twice after I said no. I also got corn instead of flour tortillas. Too many mistakes for a four dollar taco. The allowing of writing is insulting, writing by hundreds of teenagers with bad language and inappropriate content. Go to Los Tacos on Sahara and VV. Much bigger tacos, better prices and better taste.
