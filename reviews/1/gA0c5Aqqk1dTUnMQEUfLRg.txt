I brought my family of five to the restraunt  because of an ad that kids eat free. The waiter didn't explain that drinks had to be ordered to get the deal (nor was it on any of the posted ads). Our bill came with a different ad explaining the restrictions. We were charged full price, and left we the explanation that "rules are rules." They were complete jerks and were happier following the "rules" instead of losing out on two drink orders to keep my family's business. Oh, the food isn't much better.
