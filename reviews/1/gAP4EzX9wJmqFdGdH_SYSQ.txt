We were in route from Phoenix to Tuscon and needed dinner. I looked up a few places online and Eva's seemed like a reasonable option.

This restaurant has EVERYTHING it needs to be successful:
* A cool atmosphere-- check!
* a great menu--check!
* Good drink specials--check! check!

Despite all of this, this was hands down the WORST Mexican dinner I have ever had in my entire life. (I eat a ton of Mexican food).

First of all, the service is terrible.  Our waitress did not know what beer was on tap, did not know the drink specials or happy hour dinner apps and didn't give us appropriate drink refills.

The food takes the cake for being just plain awful.  I ordered tortilla soup and one of the happy hour nachos, my husband ordered a combo meal and my cousin ordered a steak rice bowl.  After one bite of my soup, I was completely done (tasted like it was burnt), my husband and cousin could stomach a little more than me but still felt like the food was sub par at best.  I mentioned to the server that I was disappointed with my soup and all she could offer was to take it back to the kitchen (no replacement option or comp ticket). 

Bottom line: Would I ever eat here again?  Nope.  Never.
