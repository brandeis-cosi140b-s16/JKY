Everything is a scam my wife told don't go back I should have listened. They post all of this Happy Hour stuff when the check comes its either the wrong item or the wrong day then they blamed it on the supplier for printing the wrong cards. You order something from the menu the check comes its a different price there excuse is we forgot to change the menu price. You have to pay what the check says. You talk with the manager he just says there's nothing he can do.  I am still waiting for a credit for a double charge I think the only way I'll ever see it is if I dispute it with my bank.
