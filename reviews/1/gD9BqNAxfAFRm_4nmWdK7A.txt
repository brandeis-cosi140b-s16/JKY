Great restaurant but you may as, well skip the shuttle service.

This year like last the driver was late.  So late we had to bag.  

I even went to the effort to call the restaurant to confirm my reservation and the shuttle well before our time.  

Not sure I will be going back.  On a positive note the drivers are consistent.   Consistently late.
