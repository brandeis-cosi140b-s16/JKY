In town for a business meeting and hoping for a good Mexican restaurant nearby.  Yes, this is a trendy place in Scottsdale that people go to park their $20,000 BMWs and oversized SUVs and think that living there actually means something in between their salon appointments and residential real estate sales.  Now onto the food and drinks.  Ordered the cucumber jalape√±o margarita for $13. Amazingly, it was delivered to me in less than 1 minute so I'm sure it was prepared that morning in a pitcher and tasted like any generic margarita I've ever had, just spicier.   The food was also mediocre. I ordered the tacos and was told it was small but I didn't expect 3 tacos that are 2" in diameter and delivered in less 5 minutes. Clearly this also wasn't cooked to order and probably just heated up.  Absolutely nothing memorable about this food. The 4-star reviews just baffle me and I wonder if it's the scene more than the food. Given the location, it's clearly the scene.
