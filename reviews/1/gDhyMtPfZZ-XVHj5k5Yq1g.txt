Are you looking for authentic Chinese and/or Mexican food? Do you enjoy unique fusion combos? Is it important for you to get good value in terms of quality/quantity vs price? If you answered yes to any of these questions, do not bother eating at this place.

The decor and service are top notch, I will give them that. But a restaurant is about food first and foremost, and those things should be there to complement the experience, not make up for bad food. I had the Golden Pigs, the Lamb Pot Stickers, the Har Gau, and the Swallow a Cloud. The portions were ridiculously tiny: I could've fit all six pieces of Har Gau in one bite. The noodle soup was really bland. 

Everything about the restaurant looks unique, fancy, and pricy: all usually good indications. But not here. Here, "unique, fancy, and pricy" are the indications of pretentiousness. Don't be drawn in.
