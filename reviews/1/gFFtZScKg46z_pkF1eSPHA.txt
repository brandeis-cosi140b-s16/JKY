Pretty disappointed with this place based on the previous reviews. I got the four rolled tacos special. The rolled tacos were flavorless and lacking meat. Guac was alright but not enough to help the flavor of the tacos. The beans were incredibly salty and I probably wouldn't have been able to eat them besides the fact that the rice was incredibly bland and eating them together balanced them out a tiny bit. I got the lemonade which was mediocre, but my friend who got the pineapple drink thought that it was so sweet she couldn't drink any of it.
