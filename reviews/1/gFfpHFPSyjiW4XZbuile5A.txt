*shakes head*

I am baffled. Truly baffled. How does a place like this stay in business?! It's kinda...crap. Well, not kind of, it is.

I've been there on about 5 different occasions. The first 3 were cringeworthy. I have to confess that all the times I went was because I happened to be close by and the people I was with were all gung ho about it. Truth be told, if they had waited about 10-ish minutes, I could've had them at a different mexican restaurant -- a million times better than Serrano's.

The 4th time I went, the chicken enchiladas I had were so incredibly good, I felt that it made up for the previous times. I happened to be in the neighborhood several weeks ago and dropped into Serrano's.

Nuh uh. Nerp. Nope. Hell to the no. F*ck no. Never again. My chicken enchiladas was gross...and I've never called any mexican food gross. This was pathetic beyond description.

Avoid this place. The only truly redeeming quality were the servers we have had each time I've gone there - fast, friendly and courteous. Sadly, it's not enough to make me want to go back.
