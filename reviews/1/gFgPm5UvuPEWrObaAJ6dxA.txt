So I see a new spot at the end of the strip called super burrito... Let's just say that I am SUPER disappointed!!!!! 

Let's start from the time I walked in there were two people flirting with each other, I then started to ask about prices to which the female didn't know.  She began to take my order and then all of a sudden was interrupted by a  kiddie shoving match flirting session again while I stood there and waited  to complete my order. 
So I ended up paying $9.04 on top of the $0.45 debit card charge whatever no biggie. 
I was excited because when you go to Baja they give you a full plate. But when I look at my to-go plate which was not even a full size to go plate it was not even full it was a little over half full. I reached out to the cook and asked him is this all I get for over $9. He said yes.  I asked for a little more, he said "no". I informed him that this was disappointing and that I would not come back. He responded with "that's fine" in Spanish.  I was shocked at the response so I informed him I will now leave a review about this place. Again responding with "that's fine". 

At that time I requested my money back.  it usually takes a lot for me to write a negative review but this place was horrible unprofessional/ portions were small/ employees don't know their own product and they are too busy horsing around and flirting. I will never be back and will make sure I spread the word.
