Service was horrible, it took too long to get seated (empty lobby), took too long to order food @930 at night..., and get out tasteless food. Our waitress disappeared several times. The tilapia was blan, served without lemon.  it took so long I was full from eating the darn chips and salsa... This is not the gracias I remembered from 25 years ago.
