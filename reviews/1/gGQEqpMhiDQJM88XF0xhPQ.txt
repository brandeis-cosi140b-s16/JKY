Avoid this place! I had some beef tacos and they have to be the WORST I've ever had in my life! I have never seen taco meat like this? It looked like they first boiled a steak and then chopped it with a claw hammer and seasoned it only with black pepper.
My wife had the steak buritto and encountered the same lousy beef.

 I went to this place because I was nearby and a yelper had given it 5 stars?!? I can't even imagine how drunk this person must have been to give it 5 stars. 

Did I already say? Avoid this place!!
