Bad bad bad. We do not go out to eat often but will definitely not go here again. Hockey fans were going into the arena, so it wasn't busy. Picnic tables outside were low - maybe set up for a midget and I am short - 5' 1". Waitress was terrible - unattentive - very very slow getting drinks , chips etc. food was less than adequate. Do not waste $$ here Taco Bell would be better.
