wow.  used to so much like the ones by us in central phx
 expected so much more.  no chips, you have to pay for them.  no marinated carrots, you have to pay for them.  poor customer service young girl started an attitude when we brought these questions up to her.  tea was out.  cashier kept disappearing in the back and kept us waiting every time we asked for something that we expected to be offered in all the other fillibertos. we should have taken a hint when the parking lot was empty at 5pm
