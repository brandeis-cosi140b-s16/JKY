Bad cucumbers like most Roberto's. But usually the asada fries are good at all the locations I've tried. 
I paid $10 for a small portion of Arne asada fries that was presented like soup, drowned in runny guacamole and sour cream. There were barely any fries. And I kept having to spit out weird pieces of meat. Also topped with way too much fake cheese.
