After moving here almost 2 years ago, we've eaten here several times. Have enjoyed the food up until this past Saturday when my son and I both got food poisoning after eating the chicken burrito and enchiladas. We were sick all day Sunday and when I called the restaurant Monday to report it to the manager, the girl on the phone said there wasn't a manager to speak with, so I told her and all she said was "okay, thank you". No I'm sorry, nothing. I will not be going back ever. Very disappointed.
