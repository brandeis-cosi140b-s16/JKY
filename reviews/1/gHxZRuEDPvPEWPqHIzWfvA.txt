First of all I love Chipoltle just not this one! On many a Friday night they are usually out of one ore more items at 6:30 which is ridiculous! We ALWAYS have an issue with this location. The food is great but something is not clicking here. Hope someone reads this that can fix the problem in the kitchen. Until then I'm going to Moe's!!!!
