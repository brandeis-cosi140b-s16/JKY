DO NOT GO HERE!  We were seated at a dirty table and waited 10 minutes without service after asking 4 people for water.  We left afraid to even try the food.  Sadly no one even sad anything to us when we left.  This place won't be in business long.  It's probably already on the skids.  We went someplace else and were very happy.
