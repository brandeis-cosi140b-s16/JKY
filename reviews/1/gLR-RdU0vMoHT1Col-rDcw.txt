We had made a reservation @ Los Dos for 9 people including 2 children. Imagine our dissapointment when we arrived to find that our reservation had been given away because we were 5 minutes late  with parking and getting the children out of the car..There was no offer to make us up another table right away although there  were several empty tables. No apology was offered.  I guess since it is a successful  restaurant  they now feel that they can treat their customers  with contempt.
