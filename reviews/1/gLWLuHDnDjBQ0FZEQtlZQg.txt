I appreciate the response from management but this was a very disappointing meal. I didn't touch the rice and you can see how small of a portion I was given, the sauce was watery and tasted terrible. I dropped $30 in your restaurant and with all due respect, that's not a mistake I'm willing to make again. Arizona is loaded with quality Mexican Restaurants so unfortunately it's one strike and you're out. 

I've  been going to Macayo's for decades and I always thought the food was good. Not sure what happened tonight but the sauce for my chimi was horrendous and inedible. I picked it apart trying to salvage any portion but finally gave up. I've been living in Chicago for the last decade so I'm not sure if it was a bad night or a change in quality over the years but either way this is not the place I remember. 


Disappointed :(
