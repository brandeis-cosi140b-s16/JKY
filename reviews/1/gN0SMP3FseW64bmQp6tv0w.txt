I have enjoyed the exceptional outside patio here several times. The food is average but I love the patio. I decided to call and make a reservation for our company Christmas party in mid December, I was told by Anthony the gentleman that answered the phone , that "they don't take reservations". I was a bit stunned, I was bringing 14 people for drinks and food but they told me it would be first come first served. Not really the way to plan a holiday party with invited guests, not for me anyway. I questioned the policy but to no avail. I eat out frequently all across the country one of my personal criteria for an exceptional restaurant is one that takes the needed steps to accomodate the customer. Such is not the case here. Just a side note last years Christmas party with the same head count was a $2,200.00 tab.
