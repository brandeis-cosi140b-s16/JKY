Was on the hunt for tamales and wanted to give Carolina's a try. It was a Saturday afternoon and the place was packed! There were people waiting for tables. I ordered a red beef tamale and a green corn tamale. My friend got the combo with a red beef and their "special" green chicken tamale, which the cashier said was "really good." We waited a long time to get our food. When it finally did come out, I was shocked to see how small they were! Holy cow. Not only that, but they were mostly masa... hardly any meat inside. What a disappointment! I'll go back for mini chimis, but tamales? Never again!
