The atmosphere is nice but steer clear of the food and drinks. My friend ordered a mojito and the basil in the mojito was brown and wilting! As a "bartender" how do you serve something like this to your customers?? Do you not even look at the product that you are making for someone? It gets better (or worse!) The queso dip with chorizo was horrible. The chips were stale tasting with tons of seasoning on them. The queso tasted like cardboard and the chorizo-um three little chunks of chorizo?! I hardly call that queso AND chorizo dip. Tacos were on special that night and I was highly unimpressed with them. I could make a dozen tacos at home with a higher quality of ingredients for the cost that I spent on two tacos here. Service was sparse and somewhat scattered.
