After a long wait just to order and another long wait to get my food, I get a beef quesidilla where the beef is extremely over cooked and crunchy.  They don't even give you a side of chips for what your paying.  Poor service and poor food, I would give this place  a negative rating if I could. Should have complained to management but too hungry to wait in that long line again. Never eating here again.
