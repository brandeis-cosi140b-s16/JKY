Giving this restaurant 1-star is being really generous!! First off the restaurant is small so you have no privacy and everybody can hear your conversation. Next I thought the lady working there was going to hit me cause I asked if they make homemade tortillas or not. I got the green enchiladas combo and then she comes back saying they ran out of green sauce. Then she tells me they ran out of tamales. The food portion were so small I thought it was an appetizer. There were barley enough rice and beans to cover the plate. Finally the total came out to 26 dollars for only two meals which we could've got breakfast and lunch at  Carolinas and El Norteno for the same price. The people who say this is "authentic" Mexican doesn't know what real Mexican food is!!
