Hey, we know what we're getting with Filiberto's... cheap Mexican grub in large quantities! Some Filiberto's are clean and somewhat nice, this location definitely isn't one of them.  The dining room was dark, grimey and dingy, the tables are too high for the bench seats, and whats with only turning on a single light in the entire space???  The restaurant had a weird odor ( I probably don't want to know what it was) and our food was all extremely over cooked, probanly spending an entire day under the warming lights because most people have abandoned this location.  Every single thing in the restaurant was worn out and dirty. Time to spend a few bucks on a rehab or close this dump down. What a waste of a meal!
