My 18 month old son has diarreah 3 days still after going here and I as well the second day.  I passed up a few other Mexican restaurants on the way here thinking I can trust the quality more since it's across the street from UNLV but an uneducated assumption I must admit.  If you are used to cleanliness and quality I highly recommend avoiding
