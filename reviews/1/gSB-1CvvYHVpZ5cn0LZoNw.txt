Ok, I just want to say, the guy behind the counter says they are not the same people who owned the one on T-bird. This place is identical to the old one. I'm smelling something fishy here or these people bought the name and concept before the old place went under. I am sitting here waiting for my food so I will give an update on how good this one is.
Ok, I had my tamales and everything else I ordered that night and I have to say, not half as good as the old one. Sorry but its true. I used to go buy tamales every Christmas at the one on T-bird and they were fantastic. The tamales I bought from this one were dried out and bland. I threw most of them away. I dont think I will be coming back for anymore tamales or anything else for that matter.
