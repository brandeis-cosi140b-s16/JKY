Why would this take 20 minutes?  Not a very expansive menu.  I had to repeat myself to the first and second "burrito artists" as part of my seemingly simple order (chicken burrito, no rice, black beans) to the first person, followed by (pico, hot salsa, sour cream and cheese) also I received a rookie roll (you know, the exploding burrito.) finally I was not spoken to by the register teammate until I asked if I had gotten a drink with my combo of burrito and chips, I did not and was asked "Do you want a drink?"  I answered what I first assumed to be a rhetorical question but promptly paid my $12 for a sack of poor service
