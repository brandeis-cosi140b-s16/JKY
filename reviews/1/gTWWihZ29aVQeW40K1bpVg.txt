There isn't many places to eat off off Ironwood and Ocotillo area, so we goto Filbertos once and a while.  Every time I go inside the girls behind the counter have the worst attitude.  They are not polite or professional what so ever.  I have also called in an order for pickup and even on the phone they are rude.  When I call in or pickup and they give me a time that it will be ready i still wait about 15 minutes or my food.
