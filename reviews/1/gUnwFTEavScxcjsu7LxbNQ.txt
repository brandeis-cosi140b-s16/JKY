On Halloween (10-31-14) the servers/employees tried to start a fight with people walking away from the bar for no reason at all. Screaming curse words and taking their shirts off. If this place is ran anything like its employed I highly recommend a new venue. Would not feel safe bringing my children here at all. Not family recommended.
