My husband and I thought we'd be able to have a nice little dinner at a Mexican restaurant, but it turns out it's party central. We saw girls walking in with slutty dresses and heels, and saw people in the back partying. If that's your thing, go for it. Looking for douchebag central instead of a restaurant? Drink away. This is for you.
