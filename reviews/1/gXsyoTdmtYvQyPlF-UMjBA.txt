Worst chipotle I've ever been too, staff is talking in back nobody cares about he customers. Each employee has their own prerogative and that's not the customer. I'd rather drive to the one at arrowhead if I had time but I work right next to this one. I wouldn't reccommend this location to anybody GET NEW EMPLOYEES!!!!!
