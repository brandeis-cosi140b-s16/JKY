Sorry folks, on the strength of Yelp we stopped at this place on the way from Hoover Dam to Las Vegas, and it is closed. The restaurant that has taken its place is called Bradley's "Dam" Restaurant and I am sorry to say we would have been happier if we had eaten at the A&W up the road. The service was quite good, but the room is ugly and bare, and the prices pretty high for subpar food. The $8 burger was like something my high school cafeteria made, and the $9 beef brisket sandwich was gray and dry. The fries were decent but nothing special. The baked beans were delicious. The house salad had only three choices of dressing - thousand island, ranch, or bleu cheese. The iced coffee was just drip coffee over ice and tasted like brown water. I've happily eaten in dozens of quirky roadside diners over the years but this place was pretty Dam bad. Sorry, Bradley.
