Drive thru service was horrible. 

Was rushed off the drive thru radio while ordering. There wasn't even any other people there. Then wen I got to the window, I didn't get a "hi hello thank you you're welcome bye" at all. I just got a rude stare, even got an eye roll when I took a second paying exact amount of coins.
