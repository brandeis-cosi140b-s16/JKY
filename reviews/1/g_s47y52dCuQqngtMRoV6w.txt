The place is noticeably dirty, customer service is practically non existent. As for the food, it is pricey and everything tasted like it was re heated at least 2 or 3 times. Tortillas (for the soft tacos) were old and pretty 'gummy', the meat had no seasoning and tasted old, the burrito was greasy and tasteless. Finally the nachos were just a big blob of gunk ... A big pile of greasy, tasteless gunk. Don't waste your time in this place, I know I'll never come back again.
