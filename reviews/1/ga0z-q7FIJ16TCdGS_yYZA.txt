We had a groupon for this place and he did not honor it. Apparently they didn't go through the trouble of actually preparing for the amount of people that would come for the groupon, so they just didn't bother with trying. So we didn't even get to eat here, but from what I saw the food looked average and the place was fairly dirty. This place doesn't deserve the one star yelp forces me to give them.
