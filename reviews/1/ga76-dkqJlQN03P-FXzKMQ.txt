This was my first time there as my friend bought me dinner for my birthday.  He knows I love good Mexican food.  I must admit at the beginning I really love the food. The service was just OK perhaps we were late. I really planned to give good tips as I asked how late the waitress would work caused we'd stay after dinner to dance.
One thing that I felt like being scammed as there was a 15% tips on the bill without prior notice.  I do know many restaurants will pre-add 20-25% service charge for party of 5 & above (with signs) but not 2.
There are many restaurants selling liquors that is the highest profits business but don't fool customers who are drinking. 
I was still sober as I need to drive.

If they have fine print for that sur-charge, pls show to me with light.
Sorry if I've upset anyone to this place. On my way home, I felt so thirty that I poured a liter of water into my body once I got into my house. Perhaps caused by the seasoning they put in the food.

I'll still visit this place as there is food, drink & dance.
