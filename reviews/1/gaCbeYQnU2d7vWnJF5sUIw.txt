Well I use to stop and get the $5 burros here and they were decent, as decent as a $5 burro meal can be.  My last visit I decided to try a chicken meal.  I got the 3 piece with corn and fries, came with 2 tortillas.
Soda-Ice cold no problems.
Toritllas-warm tasted good
Corn-Previosly frozen over cooked
Fries-Soggy/limp -too bad seasoning was good
Chicken-Dried out, pieces were 1/5 of a normal piece. I measured the leg it was the length of my index finger maybe an inch around-maybe.  

So basically for $8 I got some warm tortillas and a coke.  I couldn't even eat it.
