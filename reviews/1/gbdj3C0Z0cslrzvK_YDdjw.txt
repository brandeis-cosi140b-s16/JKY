The service is the worst we have ever had here.  The manager took our drink order because our waiter never came.   The food was ok, nothing special and it took forever to get anything done.  This place is not expensive but I would rather pay a higher price for the great service and great food versus ok food and lousy service.

We will not go back to this place unless we are with a large group who chooses to go here.
