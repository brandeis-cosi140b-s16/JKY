Don't waste your time. For some reason they feel they can increase profits by giving you portion sizes for meals that wouldn't qualify as an appetizer in most restaurants.  
I had the skirt steak. $19 for a piece of meat that was less than 4 ozs.  About 1/4 of it was fat.  Tortillas were hard and rice was basically disgusting. 

Not worth the money.
