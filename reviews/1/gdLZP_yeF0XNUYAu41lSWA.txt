I was very excited to have a Mexican restaurant so close to where I work. Sadly, this is not the place for me. The best thing about the place is the bartender. He is friendly and attentive. Maybe if he ran the place, it would be better? As for the rest, the service is slow, the staff rude and the food bland and flavorless with weird tasting cheese sauce. Sorry Charanda's. I will continue my search for good Mexican food in the South elsewhere.
