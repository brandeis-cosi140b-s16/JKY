The owner has her picture on the wall about how her parents gave her the restaurant and now she is a successful corporate owner. The food tastes like its worst than kroger. It's definitely "Americas" taco shop because there is not one bit of Hispanic in the flavor of that food. I'm actually saying this, TacoBell is more Hispanic........
