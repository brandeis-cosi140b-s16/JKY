This place was horrible. The food was dry and tasteless. The "Cuban" bread was plain white bread smashed in a press. We split an appetizer and a sandwich and they were both a joke. The meat was way overdone, dry, chewy, and way overpriced at $12. The papas were boxed mashed potatoes with a bland sausage in the middle. 2 potato balls for $6. The service was OK, but there is no "legitimate " reason this business should still be open. I will never return.
