Over priced for the lack of flavor.  The chips were very bland, we kept adding salt to the sasa. I had a taco and cheese enchilada w/beans and rice.  Half of the food tasted canned or defrosted. The meat was rubbery and bland, my husband actually made a game out of how long it took him to chew the meat.  I had coffee with bad creamer, got a new coffee still got charged & couldn't drink the second one.  We won't go back.
