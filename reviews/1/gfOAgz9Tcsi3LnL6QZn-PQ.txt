Hi Yelpers! I had lunch here w/my b/f today and don't plan on coming back. We were completely disappointed in the food here. First of all, we got seated in a tight booth, then a scary, bald headed bouncer looking guy wordlessly brought us some chips & a carafe of salsa (seriously? a carafe for only 2 people??), our food was served VERY oven hot, had to wait like 10 minutes before we could dig in.

Maybe waiting for the food to cool off wasn't the best idea because my ground beef and mashed potato style burrito plate covered in their red suiza style sauce started separating (pools of grease were forming on top of the sauce...very unappealing to say the least). I thought I liked their spanish rice when I first tasted it, however it was too peppery. The refried beans were probably canned. For my burrito, I thought they'd use "papas" type of potatoes (those in N.M. know what I'm talking about!), but it was like mashed potatoes stuffed in a burrito along with the ground beef. The description didn't say they added in sliced jalapeno peppers...ugh, was unexpected and I just decided to choke it down. My b/f's enchilada plate didn't fare well either. Certainly nothing to write home about. On a good note, we liked our beverages, iced tea and Pepsi. How can you screw that up? lol! 

So yeah, we don't plan to return. Just wanted to try something new in the neighborhood. Better luck next time :)
