You can't get anymore authentic than actually going to Mexico...San Diego was pretty close though. But now that I live in Las Vegas I can't seem to find a Mexican restaurant that can live up to Mexican authenticity. 

So I did a drive-thru order for a chicken chimichanga burrito. Got the order paid about $9 with the extra $1 debit/credit card charge. Hmm.

Brought the food to my hotel room...ate it. Disliked it. Too salty. Got mad. Threw half of it out. Still hungry. Went to Jack in the Box. Got an order of tacos and stuffed jalape√±os. Called it a night. 

Would I go back?...No.
