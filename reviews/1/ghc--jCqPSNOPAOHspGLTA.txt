Never Again! 

Based on the other reviews here we tried the chicken burrito and chile relleno. Without exaggeration the food was inedible in the case of the chile relleno and almost so with the burrito. After our experience, it's hard to believe that most of the other reviews aren't plants. The relleno was a burned, greasy mess, and the chicken in the burrito seemed to be a mix of reasonably fresh, combined with old, dried out, meat. 

I suppose it's possible that we just happened to arrive on a bad day or when the dishwasher was filling in for the regular cook, but nothing could persuade us to give this place another try.
