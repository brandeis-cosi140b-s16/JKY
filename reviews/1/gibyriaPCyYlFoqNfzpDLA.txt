I was super excited because I just moved to this side of town and couldn't wait to try this location. Got an order of super nachos to go, got home, started eating and immediately stopped when I bit into something hard. When I took it out of my mouth to see what it was, I was absolutely disgusted and instantly puked. It was a chewed off finger nail inside of my nachos. I could not believe it. If I could give 0 stars, I absolutely would. Never again will I be stopping here. This may have been a fluke but that's completely unacceptable on any level.
