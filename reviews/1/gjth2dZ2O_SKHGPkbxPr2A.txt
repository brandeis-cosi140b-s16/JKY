so this was my first stop over here after i got off the plane for my 49er weekend....it was rite next to dave/busters....shouldve went to dave/busters first & never step into this establishment =x....i knew not to even look @ the menu when the free salsa tasted nasty...i think this place is for peeps that dunno what tru authentic mexican food is...it gets one star since there are flat screens showin college football...our bartender was classic...we asked for hefenweizen....he said "we dont have that beer here"...then we asked can we have a blue moon...he said "sure~we have that"....that made my day
