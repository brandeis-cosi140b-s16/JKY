Wife and i were returning from a family photo shoot and decided to stop for a little dinner. Originally planned to stop at Macayos but the Litchfield location was crowded so we figured we'd try Raul and Theresas. They have a good reputation from their Avondale store so how could it not be good? Oh, in so many ways! Service was okay ambience was dreadful, portions were small. Had the cheese enchilada and chili relleno plate it was scrambled egg on an uncooked green chili with some kind of cheese that was unidentifiable since it had no flavor. Enchilada had same cheese and was less than lackluster. Wife had taco and enchilada plate and the taco shells were so tender they crumbled all over the plate. As we left the only comment I could think to make was 'well, we tried it" Guess if we want real authentic mexican food we'll have to travel over to Garcias Las Avenidas.
