This is the worst Robertos I have ever been to! I ordered chicken nachos yesterday and today my girlfriend and I both have food poisoning from them. 12 hours and we still havent stopped throwing up from both ends...hate to be crude but this place is shitty!!! Dont waste your time or money.  The parent company ought to shut this location down and fire all the workers in this location!
