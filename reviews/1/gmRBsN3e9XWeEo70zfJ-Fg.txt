Dang!! I would NOT go back here!!!
The cashier was bland the first time I went here. Oh well, right? Second time I came here, the cashier (different one) was separating change, saw me, and looked back down until she had separated all $7.62 of the dimes and nickels someone had paid with. Okay, fine.

I told her my order in English (six breakfast burritos- two potato, two ham, two bacon). Then she gave me a death stare and asked what kind. I didn't get a "hello" or "thank you" or "please sign here" when she put my credit card receipt on the counter and walked away. I had asked her for pico, which she didn't ring me up for, and then she tried charging me $7 for pico, which comes in free-flowing abundance in other places. Forget that noise.

Also, I used to work in a Spanish-speaking kitchen when I was younger, so to hear the cashier and cook talk trash about me while I was waiting for my food is totally uncalled for. I suppose if you don't speak any Spanish and can tolerate surly angst from a $4 burrito joint, it's still possible to go there when everything else is closed.
