Zero stars.   Manager was an awful, miserable human being.  People at the bar asked if the audio to President Obama's speech could Be turned on.   She said no because apparently, the most significant presidential speech since 9/11 was "too political".    A few minutes later, one of te waitresses asked her to change one of the other TV's to cnn somewhere else in the restaurant because a customer requested to.  She barked back at the waitress "no, it's on enough TVs.  Tell them to move".  
What kind of customer service is it to tell someone to pick up their entire meal and luggage to move?   

I am soo glad this happened before I ordered my food.
