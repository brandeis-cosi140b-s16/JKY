I'm pregnant and craving Mexican.  I hadn't been to this restaurant in years and decided to give it another try.  Being on a budget, I didn't have that much to spend on lunch for my boyfriend and I.  First thing that turned me off was printed in the menu.  Only 1 refill of the chips and salsa before they charged $1.99 for more.  Also, only 1 refill on drinks (which were absurdly expensive for iced tea and lemonade: $2.25 each).  Any restaurant that charges that much for drinks and limits your refills to 1 turns me off, especially here in the desert.  My boyfriend had a chimichanga with shredded beef which was pretty good and I tried the enchiladas with "mole" sauce.  It was absolutely disgusting.  I sent it back and asked for chicken enchiladas with green sauce.  Decent, but not worth $10.49 they charged for simple enchiladas.  The chips were nothing to write home about, honestly a Fry's bag of $1 would have been much more appealing.  The salsa (a trio of regular, green and hot) was bland and tasteless, albeit spicy (which didn't help my sudden need to suck down the limited drink I had ordered).  I am reliving the food even now as it gave me horrible heartburn and left me feeling extremely nauseas.  I will never be going back, ever again.
