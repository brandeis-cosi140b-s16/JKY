This review is for the new location at E Brown and Ellsworth -- as of today it is not yet listed on Yelp, so I picked the closest location to it. This occurred around 3:30pm on 10/18/2015.

I had a quick trip to the Basha's in the parking lot and decided to run in real quick and see about getting a few things to go so I could try them out. When I walked it, it was pretty empty inside, one family at a table and a few people at the bar. The waiters were hanging out in the kitchen area and the bartender didnt even acknowledge me coming in, he was far too busy with whatever conversation he was having at the other side of the bar to be bothered. After a good 2-3 minutes of sitting there, being completely ignored, I left. Very disappointing. I probably wont be back, there are far too many other good options where I am treated like a human being. 

I am sure the food would have been good had I actually been acknowledged by the staff in the restaurant. I was actually pretty excited about a seemingly reputable Mexican place moving in near where I live. That excitement has turn to resentment and disappointment. 

If you are thinking about stopping by the brown and ellsworth location, forget it, go to Nando's, their service is far better and the chicken burrito's are second to none.
