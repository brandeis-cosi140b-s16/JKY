Seated at a booth that was tight and very uncomfortable.  The table wobbled terribly.  An easy fix that has obviously been ignored !Bean dip was bland and chips seemed a bit stale!  Ordered Chimichanga de Carnitas.  Very dry!  Had to use sour cream to give it flavor and some moisture.  Beans and rice were less than tasty .  Won't be going back !
