Love Cafe Rio, have for years. HOWEVER, this location has the worst customer service. The workers are too busy goofing off & talking to each other when they should be listening & talking to the customers. Been to this location three times & each time they skimp on my order & flat out forget to put all the ingredients on my orders. Top it all off they overcharge for things & it takes forever for the cashier to do her job as well.  I no longer go to this location. I'll spend the extra gas and go to the one in Centennial Center or W. Sahara.
Management don't be surprised when this Lake Mead store goes belly up if you don't get some trained and mature employees.
