We were fooled by the amazing reviews on Yelp, and decided to dine here last week.  We were a group of 4 girls staying at The Ceasars.  We were super excited to have some Mexican food at a place that is so highly rated.

Man - were we wrong and disappointed!!

Service: We were seated promptly and our waitress seemed friendly.  No issues so far.  We ordered our drinks and an order of guacamole for the table. We ordered our food (more on this disaster later), and started chatting.  After 20 minutes, our waitress stopped by to see if everything was ok.  We asked her what happened to our guacamole, and she said "Oh no - I forgot...sorry".  Yup - we knew she had forgotten.  

Food:
3 out of 4 of us ordered the following:
BLACK BEAN & CORN ESQUITE SALAD
baby bibb | chipotle aioli | corn tortilla strips | panela | avocado 12

****WARNING******
- This salad appears to be vegetarian on the menu (check the description above), but came with a big piece of chicken on the top.  Our waitress confirmed this was vegetarian, we saw no mention of chicken on the menu, and here comes a big piece of chicken. When we asked the manager about this, he completely ignored the question and said that he would get the salad re-made.  Of course you will, but where does it say chicken on your menu?  No answer.

- This salad is $12 on the menu, but we were charged $18 on our bill.  Seriously???
********

This salad is awful.  There is a big piece of green covered with big chunks of cheese, corn, black beans, and very very spice dressing.  The dressing was so spicy, that I could barely eat 2-3 spoons.

During this whole process of our orders being messed up, our waitress didnt come over once.  She knew the order was messed up, knew she had told us the salad was vegetarian, but not once did she come by, apologize, and asked if we needed anything.  She just stayed at a safe distance.

We did not finish our food, left the salad as is, and told the manager about our disappointed.  He did not charge us for the salad, but that's besides the point.  Maybe the tacos, or other things on the menu are great as the Yelp reviews look amazing.  But our experience was terrible....both in terms of service and the food.

There is a plethora of restaurants at The Ceasars, so next time I am at Ceasars, I will avoid this one and go to the other restaurants.
