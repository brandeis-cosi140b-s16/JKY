We don't come here often & usually the previous times we sat in the bar area. We chose the dining room this time...... Probably in hind site a BAD decision.
     Had a nice table although our server who seemed OK, had some issues putting in our order AND the table next to us also, as about half came out wrong..... There was 2 of us and the table next to us was 2 people so I am not sure what happened, maybe the kitchen?????! 
    Another server kinda took over as I am guessing our original server was over whelmed ~ our new server tried but the damage was already done~
   As my husband said to me "Bring on Chick~Fillet
