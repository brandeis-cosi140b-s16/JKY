i ordered a pastor burrito w/ chips and salsa. ok, here we go. when i ordered the burrito, the person taking my order asked "with everything?" and i said "yes, please" because i like everything with everything. all that came in there was pastor, rice and refried beans. no onions, cilantro, salsa or anything. now, i know every place does their food different, duh, that's why i like trying new places all the time but in my opinion, this burrito was missing a lot. it consisted of mostly beans, and they weren't good all. i think they could have taken a lot of those beans out of there and put in one more ingredient. also, this was the saltiest food i have ever eaten, ever. i couldn't tell if it was coming from the beans or the meat, which means it was probably both. i think the salsa might have been really salty too but it was hard to tell, since i was putting it on chips as well as the saltiest food of all time. oh yeah, chips were stale. i'm bummed because i was told this place was good by a couple of different people. i don't know them very well but i know i can't trust their taste in food now.
