I go here cause it's right around the corner from my work and not much is open for my lunch break at 4am. The people taking orders haven't gotten my order right on the first try once. Food is usually pretty...blah.... Even for a crappy Mexican place. Today I got my breakfast burrito and get to the last quarter of it and start feeling something crunchy. Bacon, egg, cheese, tortilla. What's crunchy? Eggshell. Ok. Fresh eggs. It happens from time to time. But I seriously got enough shell for about 1/3 of an egg. I'm done. Avoid this place. I know all of the "berto" restaurants are about the same. Find another one.
