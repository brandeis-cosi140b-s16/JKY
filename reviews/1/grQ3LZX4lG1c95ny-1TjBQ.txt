Horrible Mexican food!   I would recommend Tia Rosa or Nandos. I think it is just a cheap versions of better Mexican food that is close. Maybe their dinners are better but their lunch is plain, except the bean dip us good. I won't go back, I think it used to be better. I haven't heard anything good about their catering either.  I had a friend say it was soggy when it arrived. YUCK!
