I can't understand why this is listed high on searches. Waiters have attitude. Definitely pricey but food is very average and even disappointing. Very bland and no flavors or spices of Mexican food. They do not carry rice, beans or chips. Overall disappointing visit because  our hopes were high. BTW Nothing for vegetarians and staff seem to be very proud of it.
