If I could, I'd give this place no stars.  NASTY, NASTY, NASTY.  I ordered a breakfast burrito with ONLY potatoes, eggs and cheese.  Simple enough right? I got home and opened it up to find half cooked potates, wet eggs, and barely any cheese.  Oh and they added ham to my order along with tomatoes and scallions.  I tried a bite and it was DISGUSTING.  I promptly threw the food in the trash.  Oh, and the price??  RIP OFF.  I can go to almost any "berto's" and get the same thing, done correctly,  for just under 4 bucks... they charged me over 5.  I will NEVER eat hear again.  Don't waste your money guys..... Taco Bell has better food. :(
