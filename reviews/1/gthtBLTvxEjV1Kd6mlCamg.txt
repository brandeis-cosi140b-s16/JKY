Wow...usually I love coming here. But this was literally one of the worst restaurant experiences I've ever had!!!! Our waiter who looked like a manager or maybe an owner he had no name tag on so lucky for him. He was the rudest man. Walked away while we were talking to him multiple times and did not make eye contact once with any of us. He looked out the window while we were ordering. The food was ok...and it would of been really nice to have cheese dip with our nachos but while I was ordering cheese dip he walked away. Its the beginning of dinner and there is only one other booth with people in our section. I am still sitting here waiting for a refill which me or my friends have yet to have any refills or offers for refills and multiple waitresses and waiters have walked by and looked at us and kept walking. My friend was sitting here sipping ice loudly trying to get their attention. Seriously one of the worst experiences I've had in a restaurant. Expect no tip and definitely no smile from me. This place is a rude hole with a bunch of lazy people in it who obviously don't enjoy doing their jobs. Its so obvious its rude. Dont go here unless you enjoy being extra private and not bothered at all. No refills or check ins. God knows what would of happened if i ordered alcohol. Thank you Monterey for fucking up my dinner which I didn't even want to eat by the time it was brought to me!
