Was in for a party. 20+ people. Got treated like an idiot.  I understand the gratuity being put on larger parties.  When you remake something you got wrong you don't ring it in again, take off one item and leave the grat for it.  Happened on 2 checks.  Got it corrected after 10 minutes.  One check had 3 beers but the keg blew on the third. Server promised more once its changed.  Never came. Time to correct that.  Take the beer off. Thanks, kinda.  Grat goes up!  Well its adding the entr√©e remake that was taken off again. Server's job to figure it out.  Finally recalculated tip on my own and can't wait to call my bank and tell them that the amount they finally do charge me was not the authorized amount.  It made a good night with a lot of good friends and sub-par food horrible. Don't go here.
