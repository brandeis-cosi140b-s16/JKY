Don't even THINK about going to this place at the Las Vegas airport.  You're better off going hungry, or with an overpriced protein shake from one of the food stands.  I'm not even sure where to begin -- the service was so slow my co-worker and I almost had to cancel the food we ordered, or miss our flights.  When the food arrived it was bland, tasteless, and worse than anything I could have thrown together at home blindfolded.  Later in the day, the quesadilla I ordered and only partially ate caused me great intestinal discomfort.  Dirty, bad food, poor service.  Ugh!
