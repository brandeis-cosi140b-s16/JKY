Note: this was the Tacos N Ritas at the Venetian hotel food court.  The counter worker was nice.  We got an enchilada plate with rice/beans, and a taco plate with rice/beans, an order of chips with guacamole, and two regular-sized margaritas with an extra shot in each.  Total was $62.  OK, Vegas, right.  But the food was a big FAIL. Taco and enchi were average.  Beans (black or pinto, no refrieds) were flavorless.  Rice was just plain white rice (no tomato or onion or any flavoring), with some grains hard/dried.  It bore no resemblance to what the rest of the world knows as Spanish rice or Mexican rice, it was just poorly cooked white rice.  The guac was fine, but came in a tiny cup, approx 1/3 cup.  Basket of chips might have been the worst ever.  Not only flavorless, but the texture -- each chip was partially soft/chewy and partially hard. Maybe they were made/bought a few days ago, then left out to get stale, then nuked or something?  I don't know.  But really, really, DON'T waste your time/money.  If you are at the Venetian, try the Grand Lux Cafe, a few steps away, you'll get delicious food for about the same amount of $$.
