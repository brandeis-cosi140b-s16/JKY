Tonight my sisters and I walked into Mundo to grab a quick drink before going to a concert across the street . As we walked in the hostess' both were extremely rude and seemed annoyed with our presence . They blankly asked us whether or not we had a reservation and barely gave us time to say no we just wanted drinks, before saying we were not allowed in because the bar was "too full." While looking at the bar we noticed it was busy, but not busy enough to turn away 3 women who only wanted to grab a quick drink and did not mind standing. All of us being locals and in the hospitality industry are extremely upset with how the staff handled the situation and from now on will not consider or refer anyone to this restaurant.
