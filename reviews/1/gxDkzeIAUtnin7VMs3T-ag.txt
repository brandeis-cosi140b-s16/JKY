The Mr. wanted enchiladas, we were in the area, I agreed to try this place out, neither of us had ever been.

He proceeds to order cheese enchiladas with no onions and is told, everything is pre-made with onions!...WTF!! 
I wanted to leave but he decided to try the Fajitas, I got a tostada and tortilla soup. Not even picture worthy. Tasted like premade crap, and La Victoria canned beans!

SO let's just play a fun game with the name here:

Sounds Like: Garcia's

BARFcia's
GROSScia's
Diarrhea's

I think you get the picture.......I would not recommend going here...
