Horrible service and the most incompetent employees I've ever dealt with. I made the mistake of going there today. This is after months of not going there because of the last time they fucked up my order. This morning I went in there to get a taco salad. The bill came to $7.57. I gave him $23.11 because the taco salad was supposed to be $8.11. The cashier told me it was $7.57 so I just handed him the $23. He gave me my change and the receipt. He handed me $.43. I told him that I gave him $23.. He continued to argue with me saying that I gave him $8. I called the police and then I called the corporate office. The corporate office called me back 20 minutes later and said the cash register was balanced. The manager took the $15 and pocketed it to cover him and his employee. When everything was said and done not only did I not get any of my change or any of my money back, I didn't even get the taco salad. I would never go there again. I urged each and everyone of you to stay away from there. When they make mistakes, they refuse to make them right. This isn't the first time that this has happened here either. Please stay away from here if you value your money.
