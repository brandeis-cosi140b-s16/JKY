Placed an online order.  They needed this up so bad. We ordered fire grilled nachos, a kids meal chicken quesodillo, 8 Oz guacamole and 8 Oz quesodillo. They completely forgot the guacamole and the queso, and didn't include any of the extras that come with the kids meal. I call and Chris answers and makes me wait. When he comes back he hums and hahs, but can't figure out a solution. His response is to come back next time and they will refund it, I asked if we were supposed to just rely on them at a future date. He also verified the sides that come with the kids meal (lettuce and Pico De gallo) but then started we should have added them as extras?!?! So they are part of the meal but we should have ordered them separate? Has to be the worse case of incompetence I've ever seen. I will definitely never return to ANY cafe Rio and will discourage others!
