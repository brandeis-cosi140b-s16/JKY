Most Del taco restaurants have good service. This is the worst del taco I have ever been to. Nearly every time I go through drive thru they mess up the order. I have to check bag every time and almost every time they forget something. Recently, I checked the bag and everything was in there. Then I got home and the burrito I ordered without cheese (food allergy for my son) had cheese in it and my chili cheese fries didn't have chili on them. So not only do they mess it up by forgetting things, now they mess up what they put in the bag. I called manager and all she said was, "I can get you a free burrito when I come in next time". This doesn't make it right. The entire meal should be comped since I was already home.  Horrible.
