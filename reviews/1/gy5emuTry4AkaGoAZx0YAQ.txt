Went to this location a few weeks ago and ordered a 4 piece meal with cole slaw and rice with extra avocado salsa. Got charged for a 4 piece meal. Got home and had a 3 piece meal with rice and beans NO AVOCADO SALSA.. Annoying? Yes? Life changing? No.. Notified corporate of my little problem got a free $5 meal voucher (which I haven't used).. Went back today and ordered a 4 piece meal with cole slaw and rice. Received a ONE PIECE SKINLESS BREAST!!!??? Went back and spoke to the Manager Janette and advised of her of the error. The first words out of her mouth was "did you touch the chicken?" I said I had gotten home, opened the box and immediately returned. She said that it was my fault as I had obviously ordered a #4. I advised her that a single piece of skinless chicken probably wasn't worth the $7 and I would like the 4 piece that I had ordered. What did she do?? SHE CHARGED ME AN EXTRA $2.70 FOR THE ADDED CHICKEN THEN SIMPLY ADDED 3 PIECES OF CHICKEN TO THE BOX!!!??!! 
WTF happened to customer service!!?? I am going to completely avoid this location from now on. That $5 voucher will go in the trash and I will advise anyone who cares to avoid this place at all costs!!! 
I uploaded pictures of this ridiculously insulting meal and receipt!!
