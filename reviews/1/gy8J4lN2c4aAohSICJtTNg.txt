use to enjoy coming here, but on one occasion was seated, and than waited 15 minutes for our drinks to come. when they did come the margarita i ordered wasnt among those drinks. a table that had been seated after us had drinks, chips, salsa, and margaritas, so i felt a little upset.
reminded the server about the margarita and she was like oh im sorry ill get that right away. when i finally received it, 10 minutes later, it was the worst tasting drink ever. i couldnt drink it. it tasted like watered down margarita mix with no sweetner and no tequila. returned it. waiter, the owner herself, takes our food order. we watch as our food sits in the window (know it was ours because it was only one other tables and ourselves in the restaurant and they had their food) and server after server (they had at least 4 there, including the owner) ignores the food. after waiting 15 minutes, we get up and leave. went to ajo als. much better food and drinks (they know how to make a margarita). wasted an hour of my time for sub par chips and salsa and tap water. wont be back ever.
