Do human beings actually eat this garbage?
I used to have a co-worker that ate here five days a week and even he called it "Toxic Hell"
I first discovered Taco Bell in Phoenix Arizona in like, 1968 (I know, I'm a fossil). 
Taco Bell back then only existed in South Western states. 
Believe or don't, back then it was like ten tacos for $2, And they were pretty decent.
My ex-wife and I used to go to Taco Bell about once a month back in the 80's and get burritos-they were ok, but definitely "junk food".
Then in the 90's my son's friend worked there and he swore the beef was delivered freeze-dried and had to be heated and rehydrated before it could be served.
Last year (2014), after being assaulted with Taco Bell TV ads for years I decided, what the hell, try it again, give it a fair chance.
I ordered a simple taco-had to spit it out-I wouldn't feed that to a dog! Yuck!

P.S. Statistics prove that the most likely place to get a drunk driving arrest (in this area anyway) is within a 100 yards of a Taco Bell around 2 am...cops know where party people go after the bars close....don't believe me? Google it.
