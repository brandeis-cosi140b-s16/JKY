Oh, Otro. We used to love your food. The service was never stellar but that seems to be the trend in so many  new restaurants. 
I have a business within walking distance of Otro and we frequently order lunch to go. The Inca salad was my favorite with an amazing blend of flavors and textures - quinoa, pepitas, yulu seeda, a bit of the elote corn, cranberries and surprising tastes of mint and basil. The dressing with the accompanying half lime was a perfect complement. 
2 weeks ago, a friend and I ordered the Inca salad with chicken (on my recommendation ). The chicken was half raw and I  called to complain. Whoever answered the phone asked us to bring the salads back for an exchange.  When I explained that my lunch break was over I was offered a gift certificate for  $25 to be emailed to my phone.
3 days later I called because I hadn't received the certificate.  They apologized and asked again for my email address.  I  called 4 times over the course of 2 weeks. I never got a certificate from Otro,  so I decided to walk over and see what the problem was. After much blame passing,  I finally got the certificate. 
Several days later,  we ordered lunch with the certificate. The Inca salad was missing several key  ingredients and when we called to complain,  Otro asked us to carry the salad  back for inspection. They explained that there was a miscommunication with the chef, who failed to notify them that certain ingredients had run out. They offered me extra chicken and blueberries,  which aren't even part of the salad.
I used to love this restaurant but after this poor treatment,  (and for the sake of brevity, I'm not including several other mishaps, including a shrimp ceviche without a drop of shrimp ) I won't return.
