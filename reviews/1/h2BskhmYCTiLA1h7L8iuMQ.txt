Warning: DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PLACE! Terrible service! I've had multiple items on the menu, and they've all been below average. BTW, if you're looking to have a burrito with the usual items (meat, lettuce, tomato, rice, beans, etc) be prepared to have 1 menu option (The 3 lb burrito) that runs you 13-15 dollars, and MORE if you want grilled steak (of which they will give you 5-7 SMALL pieces). Margaritas are OK, but be prepared to wait.
