DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME/MONEY! 
Service: Terrible! We got there at 9pm and  their hours showed that they closed at 10pm. This didn't matter to the staff-who locked the doors at 9:07, put the salsa trays away and pretty much closed shop around us by 9:20. 

Food: Not that great. I love al pastor fries and will try them first at any taqueria. But these were  bottom of the barrel fries to say the least. Sour cream was slightly curdled, avocado tasted at least 1 day old, fries were drenched in grease and the meat was dry and somewhat crispy!

Overall: I'm pretty sure inside the restaurant was hotter than it was outside! (102F today)
I will never go back and I would advise anyone else the same!
