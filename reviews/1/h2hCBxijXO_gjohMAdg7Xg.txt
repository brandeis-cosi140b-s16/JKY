Seriously the worst dining experience that I've ever had at an airport...the waitress, Maggie, was negligent, rude, and unapologetic after making mistakes. The menu doesn't state that the nearly alcohol-less margaritas are $13/piece. (We got a virgin strawberry marg that tasted the same as the ones that supposedly had tequila.) I asked the waitress for the virgin marg in a plastic cup with a lid, since it was going to be for a child. She stated that they don't have children's cups and that they didn't have to go cups with lids. She brought the children's drink in a glass container. Very soon after, the virgin marg was spilled. The waitress then replied, "oh, do you want me to get you a plastic to go cup with that?" I asked why we didn't get one in the first place, and she replied that she forgot. She then brought out our really subpar food, which none of us got to eat because we were busy cleaning up from her mess. She then brought the bill, which was $114! We asked her about it, and she replied that she comped our virgin marg. We replied that none of got to touch our meals because of this "mistake", and she shrugged her shoulders. 

I don't feel like I am usually very critical of waitstaff- I have waited tables before, and I know how hectic it can be. But this was far and away some of the worst service I've received.
