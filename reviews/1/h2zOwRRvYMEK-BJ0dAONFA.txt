So disappointing.  Been there at least 10 times before with a good experience, but after tonight....we won't be back.  Ordered a chicken burrito sans onion....full of onion so my onion-allergy husband was unable to eat his entree.  Ordered nachos without sour cream....coated with sour cream beneath the cheese.  Pushed those aside.  Calimari was fine as were the drinks.  Server very pleasant.  When we pointed out the food issues she was great in apologizing, but that was it.  No re-do offered; nothing taken off the bill, lesson learned. Important to add, we were 2 of about  6 customers in the place.  Can't chalk the food up to a busy night. Adios.
