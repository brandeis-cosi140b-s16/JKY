Service was slow.  I ordered my dinner without beans.  Came with beans.  Asked for a new plate sans beans. They brought my plate and I started eating and found beans under everything.  Mentioned it at check out and she just apologized and did nothing to make it right.  First and last time I'll eat there. .
