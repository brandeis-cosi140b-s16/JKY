Screaming screeching children that the management said was just fine.
Our really nice waitress said some nights it's like daycare in there. 
Several of the tables around us left with their food in a carry out just like we did. The food is pretty average.... a shame for the wait staff who are really nice except the manager who was snide 
The name of the rude manager is Jill ...I hope the owner sees this. I have never written a bad review but this experience was beyond the pale.
