My friends and I went here for dinner one night, and I wish we hadn't. We were hankering for some Tex-Mex type food, but this place, while it looked promising, was a major fail.

We were seated right away, but that was the only positive of the evening. We ordered chips and salsa. The salsa tasted alright, but the chips tasted like they were poured into our bowl from one of those $2 bags you find at the grocery store. Blah. The food we ordered was INCREDIBLY salty!! Salty to the point where it was nearly impossible to eat it! Everyone ended up only eating about half their entree as a result, and even that was a bit of a struggle.

Two in our group ordered mango margaritas, and both of them said they weren't very good at all. And then the waiter... He was MIA for most of the night, and I felt like taking our order, refilling our drinks and checking in on us was a bother for him. I don't need my waiter to be uber-friendly, but he/she SHOULD at least be attentive and a little personable. Bad food, bad service.
