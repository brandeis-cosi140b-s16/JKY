Diner beware.  Food presentation is very nice but quality and taste are mediocre.  More troublesome are aspects of the experience that raise concerns about business practices.  A scallops dish (note plural) actually consisted of only one scallop diced into three slices.  Before dinner, we had drinks at the bar.  Our order was made four minutes before the end of happy hour but was entered into the register once happy hour ended (so we were charged regular pricing).  Practices like these may be subtle but struck us an exploitative business orientation that is alienating and a restaurant unworthy of support.
