After giving it a try two more times, I am still not impressed. Yesterday we were the only customers in line and it took us 5 mins or more to get helped. Why you ask?  There were three employees working on a faxed in/online order (who wasn't in the store) while my family and I were just standing there.  The customer service is horrible here. Nothing has improved. The tables were nasty and no one made any attempt to clean them. If the other one wasn't so far away, I would never step foot in thus location again.
