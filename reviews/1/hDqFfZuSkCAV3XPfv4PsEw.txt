This place doesn't even deserve one star. My boyfriend and I went there on Cinco de Mayo and we had reservations for 8pm. When we got there they weren't busy but there was a group of 5 that had been waiting for almost two hours for a table. We sat ourselves, had to go ask for menus, had to ask for chips and salsa, and had to ask for our server to come take our order. My boyfriend got food poisoning that night. For being such a fun location and environment, the service and food sucked.
