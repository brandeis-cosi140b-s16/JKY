Rude ass bitches, it's not my fault that you can't ring up a simple order and YOU had to redo it multiple times. Don't give me attitude when I double check you rang me up for the right thing since you were having so many problems with my simple order of street tacos and a water bottle. Then when I check my receipt I notice it says the wrong thing so I double check with another worker if that's the correct order and she goes "that's what it says sweetie". Beyond annoyed with their service.
