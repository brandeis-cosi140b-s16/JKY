OK so writing a bad review for this place is almost like a high school kid kicking a defenceless baby , it just does not make any sense. But what I have to say is to important. DO NOT EAT AT THIS PLACE EVER!!!! Seriously I understand that not everyone likes taco bell or has the time to make food at home but eating this food is not a option it is a dare. Like I dare you to eat that taco and not spend most of the night on the bathroom floor with your face deep in the toilet bowl.

I would give this place a half star if I could because the only thing good about this place is the fact that they are cheap enough for the people who are crazy enough to think the stuff they sell here is food. This is not a review it is more like a public service announcement. 

Attention great citizens of AZ do not eat here unless you enjoy, then have the fast talking guy from those medication commercials read a list of side effects (eating this food may cause bubble gut, late night trips to the ER, stomach pumping, the shakes, and forced consuming of various intestinal aids such as tums and pepto bismol) lol.
