Worst experience ever.  Restaurant was not busy and my group of 8 was told we could not sit together inside or outside. Hostess was rude and so was the heavy 50ish manager who claimed she was also the owner (I seriously doubt it).  We were all astonished at the treatment we received when simply asking to be seated together.  Quote from the manager "some people are just not a good match for a restaurant."   Seriously?  Stay away!  Read the other reviews.
