We live up on the Northwest part of town and basically have no options for "street" style tacos. Even though Taqueria El Tizon isn't really NW, I wouldn't say driving here from any part of town would be worth it. Like others have mentioned, they do have good pricing but that's where the good stops. 

My son and I ordered 7 tacos to share, 5 of them were al pastor. This was easily the driest meat I've ever gotten at a taco shop. I could have dealt with the dryness if it at least had some flavor. It was lacking flavor completely and the fixings didn't help in any way. Neither the onion or cilanto were fresh and the pineapple was definitely sitting out for a long time.

For the other tacos, we went with carne asada which seemed to get okay reviews and that's exactly what they are...okay. The meat was nowhere near as dry as the al pastor but still basically flavorless. They also top them with beans, onions and cilantro. Just like the other tacos, the fixings were far from fresh and the beans were just about as dry as the meat. 

I was close to giving this two stars because of the carne asada but the service was terrible and this restaurant is friggin nasty. There's trash all over the floor, the salsa bar was a disaster and none of the tables were clean. Then to top it off, when the cashier/waitress brought out our food, she dropped a whole piece of my wifes quesadilla on the dirty table then just left it there. Accidents happen, no biggie. But to just leave it on the table is stupid and is exactly why the restaurant is so dirty. She just didn't care...and I don't care to ever come back!
