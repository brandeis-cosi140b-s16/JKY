So sad. Looking forward to having a good chipotle burrito. Called ahead and they said they open at 10:45. Hundred degrees out waited in car with air on till 11 o'clock. Doors finally opened walked in to women behind counter making food or not happy skimpy tiny portions of meat. 250 for one tiny scoop of meat ripped off. Will never come to the store again.
