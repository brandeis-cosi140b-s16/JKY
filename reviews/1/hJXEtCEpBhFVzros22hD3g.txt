Went after it been open a couple weeks. They made a big deal about complimentary chips and salsa. Really? At a Mexican restaurant? The house salsa was bland and tasteless.  We ordered the verde salsa that we had to pay for. Also bland. Next the tacos. We both had the Carne Asada. The meat was so tough you could hardly chew it. And the tortillas were gross. Not just soft but you could wring the oil out of them. As another reviewer said they tasted raw. YUCK! I'll go next door to Chipoltle next time.
