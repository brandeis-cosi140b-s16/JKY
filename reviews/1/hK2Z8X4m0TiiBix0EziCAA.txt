Over priced. I ordered fish tacos & fish were basically just thrown on the grill & cooked it that's it.  No seasoned or anything. I have to put salt &a pepper, lots salsa on my tacos or taste very plain.  My server was very nice but we totally ignored by owner.  He went other tables how they were doing but he never came our table to checked on us.  Well, I could made better tacos my own anyway.  Won't go back there.
