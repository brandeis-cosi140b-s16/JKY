Most of the reviewers must have been high or drunk when they gave this place such high praise.  Went here with a friend for lunch today.  First off, there was no ac.  No ac in the middle of the summer?  Hopefully it was just broken.  The food was very subpar compared to any bertos out there.  My friend got a regular beef enchilada and it was stuffed with onions and green peppers.  Wtf?  I ordered the California burrito and it was very bland and not very tasty.  I had to dump salsa on every bite to liven it up a bit.  Finally when we left, my friend had filled up her drink and accidentally left it near the soda dispenser.  She walked me to my car and remembered, so she went back in.  They had already thrown it away and refused to give her another cup.  I will never come back to this dump again.  If you're looking for an amazing taco shop at 3:30 in the morning, head to Taco Migo near the intersection of I-10 and baseline.  I've never been disappointed with the food or service there.
