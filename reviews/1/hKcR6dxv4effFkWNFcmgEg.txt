Been going here for 3 years but I cannot take the service any more.  Food is fine when you get the right order.  The drive through is a nightmare.  The speaker is broken and you cannot understand them and they cannot understand you.  For the most part, the service is very good.  But, like most restaurants of this type, they really do not care if you get good service or not.  This morning was the last straw.  3 times now I have not gotten what I ordered, or the way I ordered it.  Today, the DT was very busy, and I ordered a Bacon Egg Cheese burrito, with 2 fried jalapenos.  My favorite. the person taking my order, a male, does not speak good English.  I had to repeat the order 3 times to him, and then made sure that the girl at the window, knew what I wanted, green sauce with 2 fried jalapenos.  What I got was a potato burrito, red sauce, and pickled jalapenos with carrots.  Really sick and tired of people not listening to what we order, and not paying attention.   I estimate I go there 10 times a month, for around 80 bucks a month spent times 12, that is 960 bucks a year I spend there.  Time for other people too, to find another place to buy mexican food, some where they appreciate your business instead of taking it for granted.  Sorry Federicos, last straw.  I wont be back.
