This Taco Bell location deliberately keeps your change.  NOT KIDDING.  If they owe you $8.26, they round down and give you back $8.00.  I swear, I couldn't believe it the first time, let it go.  But, then, THEY DID IT AGAIN.  This time, I asked for the correct change, and they acted like no big deal.  Didn't even apologize.  I guess they help themselves to your change as a "tip".  I told the employee that he couldn't do that, and he looked at me like I was crazy.  I got my change, and I won't ever visit this location again.  If you do, make sure they give you the correct change.  Perhaps they split the overage when they close the registers at night.
