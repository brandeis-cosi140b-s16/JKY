If it was possible to give this establishment zero stars that is the rating I would give it. I live right near here so if I want Taco Bell this is regrettably the one easiest to go to, and every time I give them a chance they never fail to disappoint. They consistently A. Don't get my order right or B. Give me the wrong food or forget an item I paid for entirely. I would never recommend going here unless they're giving you free food and even then I would think twice about it.
