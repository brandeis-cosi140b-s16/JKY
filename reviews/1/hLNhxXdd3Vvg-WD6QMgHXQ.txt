would not recommend. Our visit started off bad. The "hostess" or what we thought was the hostess started off extremely rude when she sat us down.. We were meeting 2 other people there and my husband and I beat them there so we got a table and sat down first. When our friends arrived, the "hostess" turned out to be our waitress as well, just looked at our table and finally 5 minutes later came to take our order for drinks. 5 minutes later we received our water. 15 minutes later she walked by, and said she would be right back to take our order. In the next 10 minutes she went to another table to take their order and ran food to 2 other tables. Then she came back to us, and in a rude voice asked to take our order for dinner, very impatiently. The whole night she did not have a smile on her face, very impatient and rushed. And the restaurant was not even busy!! There was maybe 5 tables that had customers. Onto the food, I just ordered an appetizer 7 layer dip, as we had eaten earlier and was still full, my dip was bland. I have had better 7 layer dip from a grocery store. My fianc√© ordered 4 street tacos (btw you can not mix and match different kinds of meat, you HAVE to get 2 of the same kind) he said they were bland and nothing special. Overall, horrible experience, bad food, not authentic Mexican, will not return
