Always a disappointment! 

The food always makes me feel like I can make it at home which defeats the entire purpose of going out for dinner. The main reason I have gone back is because my friends enjoys the margaritas and I am always willing to give a place with tacos another go. Everytime has been a let down. 

Honestly its my least favorite place in Madison.
