GROSS!!! I threw my burrito away it was so bad!! First understand I like two things from hole in the wall mexican places; bean and cheese burritos and nachos. Yup...that's my list. I know I'm not creative with my choices but what I like is the easiest thing to make so I rarely find a bad one. My fianc√©es friend goes on about how great this place is, so when the craving for nachos hit we went here. I didn't order the nachos because they put nachos cheese on it. I want real shredded greasy cheese, not Taco Bell crap. I ordered the bean and cheese and almost spit it out!! It was whole beans!! Not refried, not slightly mashed, not nothing!! They opened a can of beans, heated them, dumped them on with a slice or two of something they wanted me to believe was cheese, and kinda grilled the tortilla. I ate three bits and after dumping hot sause on it I finally just threw it away. Next time I'll stick to what I know is good; Roberto's!!
