I went there for the first time a few months ago after wanting to check it out for awhile, and honestly was NOT impressed. The food was gross, and I actually for the first time ate a taco that was the worst taco I have ever had (and I have never come across a taco I didn't like). It was almost sweet tasting. Also, for two days after eating there I had major digestive problems. My stomach hurt and was upset. I hadn't eaten anything out of the ordinary except for eating there. The service was okay, food was delivered quickly and the environment was okay, prices were typical. No reason for me to go back though.
