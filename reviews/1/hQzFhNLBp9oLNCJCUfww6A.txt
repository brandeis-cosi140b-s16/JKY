This is the closest one to my house which is unfortunate. There always seems to be a lot of turnover and there is always someone new. The service is horrible with managers that just do not care. They are the worst chipotle ever. Either meats are charred and over cooked or really under cooked. Rice crunches which is wrong. They struggle to get people through the line because they stop everything to coach a new person and lots of just standing around while food gets cold. Get some good management (can't be too difficult) and keep the employees you have.
