Typical low quality restaurant where they do not care about the food they provide customers or a certain standard of customer service.  I had 3 tacos - pork, chicken, carne asada.  The pork had a huge slimy piece of fat - disgusting, there was a lot of grissle on the carne asada.  Its not a good sign when Filiberto's is much higher quality.  SouthEast Gilbert customers love great food and reward restaurants that serve it with their patronage, but we have a lot of restaurants pop up, like Tacos 'n More that think they can make a buck by pushing their low quality standards - not here, sorry...
