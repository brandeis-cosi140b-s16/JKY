This place was one of the worst el pollos I have eaten at. No clean tables to sit at, the trash cans in the place had nasty gunk all along the top on the outside and the salsa bar was scary. The salsas looked anything other than they had been prepared that day as advertised. The chicken I had was slimy and pink in the inside. Pretty much turned off to this establishment.
