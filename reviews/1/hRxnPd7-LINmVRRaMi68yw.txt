It costs too much, the food sits all day, and they charge for anything.  You ask for one more olive...that's 25 cents.  I could go to Chipotle and receive a better product.  TV's in the resturant shouldn't constitute for higher prices with the sub par food that is being served. They skimp on everything so you have to ensure that they make your food correctly.  The taco bowls just sit in the open subjected to flies or any other pests that may be around.  The chips are not crunchy and the queso is very over priced.  The only positive thing about this spot is the nicely chopped lettuce and Tabasco (which was used to cover up the taste of the food).  Overall, there are better choices if your looking for a quick tex-mex fix...hit Chipotle and get more bang for your buck!  If you do take a chance...don't say I didn't warn you.
