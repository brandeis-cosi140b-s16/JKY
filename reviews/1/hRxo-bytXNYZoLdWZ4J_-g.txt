Yearning for a burrito I stopped by Don Tortaco for a chicken burrito. I got what amounted to chopped and torn chicken rope in a cheap tortilla...no lettuce, no cheese, no rice, no beans.  I hadn't read the small print and was informed that this is all "extra".  "Extra"?  Isn't that what a burrito IS?  It's like ordering a BLT and finding out the B, the L and the T are extra.  When I brought that up the girl at the counter I got that epic shrug that let's you know they just don't care.  

All that aside the quality of the ingredients was so poor and suspect that no amounts of condiments or other ingredients would have disguised the fact that that chicken had been running marathons in the desert before ending up in that burrito.  
A seriously a grim experiment in Mexican food.
