I went to China Poblano with my family at 10:00 pm on a Saturday night. We were seated promptly. Our waiter was terrible. He didn't explain the menu and was not helpful at all. Most of the plates can be shared, but we didn't know how to go about ordering. We all agreed that the experience could have been a lot better had we had a waiter who was helpful, happy to explain the menu, and had a personality. If I would have caught his name, I would have definitely called management.  The food was so so.  Definitely not worth the prices.
