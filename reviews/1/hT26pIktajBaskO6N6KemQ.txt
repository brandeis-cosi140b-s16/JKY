This location as Scott F. noted was `the go to` location.  Emphasis on the `WAS`.  You could always count on fresh tasty food late night and early morn, when nothing else of quality was open.  Well not anymore.  Ordered a Bacon and Egg Breakfast Burrito, got it home and it had runny undercooked eggs and mystery meat(not Bacon).  The end result:  Lets just say 2 hours later Montezuma and his revenge are alive and well.  Stayed away for a month and went back one late evening recently.  Well the quality has "plummeted" and stayed at a culinary low.  The Churros were old and dry. The Fajita Extreme Burrito fell apart at one end after the second bite. Of course it was the opposite end from which I was eating.  The Fish Taco had old dried up cabbage, you know the kind that sits around in the `fridge and gradually looses it's color before mold sets in and the fish patty was burned beyond recognition. The Burn Unit at St. Joe's  Medical Center wouldn't have touched it.  It was inedible.  It looked like it sat at the bottom of the fryer since Montezuma physically roamed the earth.  How a cook/chef could serve something like this to customers is beyond me.  Went to their website and filled out a comment survey.  To date there has been no response. Hence this present review.
