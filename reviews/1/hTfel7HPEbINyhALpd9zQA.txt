Boo-urns. This place was awesome back in the day. Now its complete garbage. We went there today and the place looked kinda skanky, thought it was just cause we were there in a slow time of day. Nope its just shitty now. We ordered super nachos and tacos. well they were out of Chicken and elpasdor (spelling?) . So we went with Carne Asada. It took them about 15 minutes to make our food ( which I dont mind if im waiting for fresh good food ). And when we got home we realized that our nachos were fries! Wah wah wah. And they were gross, not fried all the way through and the Carna Asada tasted like it was from a horse rather than a cow. Im sad that this place sucks now. But they seem to not care about the customers anymore and for that I say " Shame on you Rigos Tacos ". I will drive a little further for Tacos El Gordo next time.
