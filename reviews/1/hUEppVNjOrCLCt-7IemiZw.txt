I used to work downtown and went to Frida for lunch all the time. I thought it was great!  Note the past tense. My friends and I (including 2 toddlers and a baby) arrived around noon for lunch. We sat on the patio outside and had the place to ourselves. Our server wasn't very friendly. I asked her where the tostadas were on the menu and she said the menu was new. I was really sad ( I LOVED THEM!) but ordered enchiladas and a taco for my son.  I also ordered guacamole and was very disappointed. It's creamy texture makes me think it wasn't homemade which I find to be unacceptable at a Mexican restaurant. The waitress never refilled our chips. The salsa was watered down (I don't remember it being that bad). I asked for sour cream for my enchiladas which never came. The waitress came back to ask if I had received it and I said no. She asked if I still wanted it and I said yes. I needed something to wash down the dry enchilada. I am not sure if she charged me or not. I was also surprised by the prices--a root beer was $4 and I was charged extra for ground beef in my enchiladas! I ordered a steak taco for my son and the meat looked inedible.

I must disclose the fact that we weren't the quietest customers. Dining with 2 toddlers is tricky so I got my son a bag of popcorn and he proceeded to pour a lot on the ground (I am very sorry for this). Later, the patio started to get really crowded and my son and my friend's son were getting loud so we asked for our check.  I took my son away so he wouldn't disrupt anyone else and waited for my friends to join me. About 15 minutes my friends came to find me saying they had to look for the waitress to run her credit card. You would think she would want such loud customers to leave as soon as possible!
