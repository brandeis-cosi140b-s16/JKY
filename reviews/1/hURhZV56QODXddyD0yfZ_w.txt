I really liked cafe rio the first few times I had it but this last time was terrible I'm not coming back. First off the people in the kitchen have no people skills, like I'm doing great thanks for not asking. Secondly maybe you should stir the food before you serve it, you know so it's hot? And lastly flour tortillas don't belong on tacos! Not to mention how the hell does a Mexican joint not have a salsa bar? 10 bucks for that when chipotles next door? Yeah right.
