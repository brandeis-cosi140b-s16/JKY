My Migos took me here during lunch. They said it would be great. They lied. The unfriendly girl who attempted to make my burrito failed and after what seemed forever fumbled her way through it. I took a bite and the burrito was cold. My Migos also hyped up the free chips and salsa. The chips were stale and and the salsa was bad. It's the reason they're free. I still ate my because it was $7 for a burrito. Both my migos owe me $3.50 a piece. This place lacked flavor and and most importantly...fuck. #NeverAgain
