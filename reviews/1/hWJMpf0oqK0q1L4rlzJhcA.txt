Went to Que Bueno last night with my date.Chips and salsa were average at best.There was a bug on one of the chips.I understand these things can sometimes happen so we let it slide.She had a casadia and I had beef fajitas.The casadia looked like something a child made.The fajita was HORRIBLE! The "beef" was not flank steak but some low grade beef that was overcooked,rubbery,flavorless and grey in color.Refried beans were put on the sizzling plate and burned right to plate.Service was good and the place is pretty clean but the food is just awful!Will never go back
