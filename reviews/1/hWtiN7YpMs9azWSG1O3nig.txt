I'm done with this place, I've lived in this area for 4 years and finally, I'm fed up with this place... The food isn't bad, but it isn't great either. Just another Mexican restaurant. But ever since the change in ownership, the employees especially the girls that work the drive thru are slow, and they don't listen. Hot do you ask what kind of sauce you want, red or green ? You tell them red, but they give you nothing but verde sauce... The New ownership needs to hire some people that can work a drive thru window, to take your order get it right and get you out...!!! It shouldn't take 7 minutes for rolled tacos...
