Unbelievable that the staff is too lazy to accommodate a party of 8. "We are not going to accommodate you and I am not going to argue with you" is something you should NEVER hear from management at a restaurant. I am absolutely floored by the condescending attitude of the manager and apparently the owner's son. They refused to put two tables together under the guise of a fire hazard.  Our group frequents east valley restaurants and usually with even larger parties. I can say for certain we will never visit this location again.
