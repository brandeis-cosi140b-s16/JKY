HORRIBLE service here. I've unfortunately been here probably a dozen times, and EVERY time I've had bad service. I've heard other people say that the only reason they are still in business is because there aren't a lot of other options around in the Foothills, especially places with patio seating. 

I usually have to re-order items several times, because they will tell me they're bringing my drink or food, and then it never shows up. 

I've even sent back drinks after they brought me the wrong drink, and they poured it into a different glass and sent it back to me?! 

But credit where credit is due, their ceviche is very good. So is the salsa, the guacamole, sopapillas. Avoid the street tacos, they smell like a diaper. Most of the rest of the menu is hit and miss, even from one day to the next.
