this place should be renamed flacos.

I've stopped in a few times for street tacos.  
This place started sucking worse and worse.  
Portions got smaller each visit.  Im trying to get gordo pronto.  got tired of the place and never returned.  

found a place called polibertos on baseline in tempe.  i can get twice the food for the same price as gordos.  

i hope the owner sees this and tries polibertos.  adios!
