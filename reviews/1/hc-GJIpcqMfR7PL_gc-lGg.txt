Can't describe how bad this place is...was hoping for some good Mexican to replace Baja Fresh location and all we got were cheap ingredients in bland tasting Mexican slop. The guac is from frozen, cheese is cheapest shredded stuff you can get, oily food, hardly any spices. Taco Bell is better than this place and much cheaper...won't be returning.
