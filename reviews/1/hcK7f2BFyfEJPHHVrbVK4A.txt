We went there because it looks laid back and the music was good.  I was most excited for the street tacos.  I'm pretty sure they didn't drain the meat before slopping it into the corn tortillas.  In turn they broke and were soggy. A complete MESS.  We also ordered some chicken nachos which were less than par.  We took a bite of each taco and less than two chips off the pile. We left hungry and annoyed. A bummer because the inside of the place had a great feel.  I would go here if you're looking to enjoy chips, salsa, and a beer.  If you want good street tacos you are better off at a roach coach.
