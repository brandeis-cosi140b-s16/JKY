Will never be back again. I took my 3 girls after church. I ordered a seafood enchilada ala carte with white sauce, they gave me red sauce. The 3 little girls ordered kids meals , one of which was wrong!!  How can you screw up a pb&j?? I'll tell you, they made it on a tortilla after we requested it be made on bread. The kids meals don't include a drink. So for 1 adult meal, 2 kids meals, and one ala cart item our bill was $47 bucks!!  I vowed then and there to never return!!!  Perhaps if the food, flavor, service and atmosphere had been worth it, I would reconsider. But they failed the test on every level!!
