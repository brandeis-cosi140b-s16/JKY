Full disclosure, we only came here because we had an entertainment book coupon & wanted to try somewhere new. 

When you enter, you have to duck under this huge metal staircase that takes up half the restaurant & leads to a small seating area above.  Really bizarre & I'm lucky I'm short because I would have knocked myself out.  

After perusing the limited menu I chose ropa vieja, with black beans & fried plantains.  The sauce the meat came in was almost like a bbq sauce & very strange & not very good.  I've had ropa vieja at plenty of cuban restaurants & IN Cuba, I know how it should taste. The only thing I enjoyed were the plantains.  Everything was pretty bland, which I'm not sure is due to the location or what. 

Also, my biggest issue with the evening was that Grey's Anatomy was on tv in the dining area, so while I was suffering through my shredded beef in red sauce I had to watch a surgery with blood & gore on a tv because it was directly in my line of site, I would have had to look at the floor in order not to look at it.  Gross.  

also somehow our meal came out way higher than it should have been, our check should have been under $15 with the coupon & came out over $28.  So sodas are 5 dollars each??  but I was too tired & grossed out to argue.  

Needless to say, NEVER going back!
