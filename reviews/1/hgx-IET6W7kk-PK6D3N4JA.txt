So here's the thing, I've been coming here for years.  Food was generally good, relatively quick and the chips/salsa bar has always been dependable (although I was bummed when they got rid of the pico de gallo a few years back).  Fast forward though, and lately it just hasn't been the same.  Food quality has been slipping, chip bar isn't as stocked, service is slower, etc.  Today was the last straw.  

First, they now charge a $2 surcharge for chips/salsa if you don't spend more than $5.  I get it, the economy is tight, but when you already charge $2.25 for a soda?   I was willing to forgive though, but when I got to the chip bar, they didn't have any of the flour chips out-or even a space for them.  So you pay for the chips, but the best ones aren't there anymore.  Then when I was eating my bean tostada, I bit down on something sharp --I spit it out and realized that a 1/2 inch sliver of a broken plate was in my food.  It broke when I bit down on it, so part of it disintigrated and I couldn't get it all out of my mouth.  While the manager did apologize and promptly brought me a new tostada, I definitely would have prefered a refund at that point since I could still feel broken glass in my mouth (not very appetizing). He brought me a refill of guac and that was it.   Being a long-time customer I expected better than that, esp. after such a dangerous, and frankly disgusting, mistake on their part.  That was it, I won't be back again.
