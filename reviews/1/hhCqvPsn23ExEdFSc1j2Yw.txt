I frequent El Burrito because I love the food they serve, however, after time after time of HORRIBLE service I refuse to go back. Every single time I've been to This restaurant it takes a minimum of 15-20 minutes for anyone to take our order, and usually there's only 1 other table occupied in the restaurant. I once waited 45 minutes to receive my check while a waitress sat down at a table and decided to watch American idol auditions. The last straw? I went last week, left a tip on my card. And I just looked on my bank account, they added an extra 2 cents on to my tip. I specifically left a total of $30.00 and it was very legible , no room for question. And they had the nerve to add extra money? Absolutely ridiculous. This place should be shut down. I once heard the owner yelling at the cooks in the back saying he wasn't going to pay them that day. This place is a joke.
