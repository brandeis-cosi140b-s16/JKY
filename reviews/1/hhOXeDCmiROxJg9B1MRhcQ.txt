This place was absolutely disgusting. I read the reviews thinking it might be worth checking out.  The chicken in my chimichanga was very fatty and had very little flavor. My wife's enchiladas were also disgusting they had some weird cheese that looked and tasted like shredded string cheese. The salsa wasn't too bad but the chips were hard and cold. 

There was only one waitress for the entire restaurant which was very disappointing because we had to wait for a good amount of time to order our food and to get our check.

Overall, I will never ever go back or recommended it to anyone. We only ate several bites of our food and had to go somewhere else because the food was too disgusting to eat.
