Why bother reviewing? To warn my fellow Yelpers of course. 

It was bland and unfortunately there is such a thing as a tasteless burrito. The salsa was boring as it was all heat and no flavor. The blue corn tortilla wrap they use tastes like recycled cardboard and the price was an added insult. 

This was clearly a mistake in the culinary pantheon of airport layover meals. 

Stay away. You may find more authentic Mexican at Chipotle.
