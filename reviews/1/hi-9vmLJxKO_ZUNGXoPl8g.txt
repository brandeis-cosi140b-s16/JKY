Ugh. I've never eaten at a Federico's, Rodiberto's, Pinocchio's or any other O's before and this was the last time I'll ever do it. Came back late from Anthem and didn't feel like cooking - this place is brand new, we've eaten at just about every Surprise food establishment and against my better judgement I suggested that we give it a shot for proverbials and giggles. The food was just DISGUSTING. I got a burrito and cheese enchilada combo and had to photograph it halfway through. Here's the pic (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Lhaj-hGoMgw70_vbFW9a9Q?select=nHDw95uHdll5qMAp3RY19A). After bringing the "meal" home (we live a mile away) the burrito tortilla was almost completely cold and I'm 100% convinced it was store bought. No doubt about it. Leathery and foul, like eating something directly out of the packet from Frys. After pulling it apart to remove the green peppers I noticed that there was maybe two tablespoons' worth of shredded beef in there, barely enough to fill a taco let alone a burrito. I had three bites of the thing before discarding it and almost retching - the entire experience was like mowing down on a spandex shirt that someone had just worked out in. The enchilada containment space looked like the locker room scene from the movie "Carrie" - see photo for proof. Rice was okay. Beans were okay, but pureed to the consistency of mashed potatoes. Barely any flavour at all. The wife's mileage was the same - she flung her carne asshola burrito after a single bite and wound up pouring a bowl of cereal for dinner. I tentatively bit into the kid's cheese quesadilla and almost couldn't strangle it down. We didn't need another Mexican restaurant in Phoenix and certainly not in Surprise. I hope this place goes down the gurgler in short order. A rare single star from me.
