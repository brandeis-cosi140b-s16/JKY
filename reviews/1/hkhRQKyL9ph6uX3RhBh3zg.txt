terrible service. we had a group of 7 and the waiter refused to split the tab even though the rest of group who came a half hour later did it easily with 6. the guy also didnt like questions. unbelievably terrible and slow service.

food wasn't terrible but not good either. no idea why they call it tex mex...and suspect how this place has 4 stars . 

i really have nothing good to say, even the drinks were overpriced. $10 bad margaritas. instead of the 2 stars i wouldve given, id like to knock it down to zero for being incredibly sick the next day due to the food. dont go here, trust me.
