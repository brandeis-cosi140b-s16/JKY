Went there Sunday night  -after reading some reviews. Wow were we wrong !! Slow , inattentive service, hookah went unattended even after we asked for more coals. Asked for a drink , which I never received. When we politely told our server what our issues were, she didn't even really seem phased. It's a shame as it had great ambience and had potential as a great place to chill with friends for drinks and hookah, food is not even an option at this point. Will not return.
