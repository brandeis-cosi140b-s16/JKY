Very nice decor, but thats about it. I ordered a carne asada burrito,  but i got 90% beans, 5 % steak mixed in with spicy guacamole. I asked the cashier if the burrito was spicy at all and she said no. The owner was in that day i went, i wish i would of told him about the burrito, but i wanted to get outta this place. My wife had the chicken torta, and you guessed it, not enough chicken.  I think they pre cook all their meat, and have it sitting for a while  This place is very expensive , you would be better off going to la bonita market, and i hate to say it, but robertos tack shop. They have a marketing strategy that says cooked by mexicans. Im thinking those mexicans they refer to must of grown up rich or had some type of culinary training (and not in the good way) in America, not mexico, because this food doesn't taste authentic to me. Granted, its better than tex mex which is utterly disgusting.   Stay away from this place. Usually i try a place twice before i give up on it, but once was all this place needed.
