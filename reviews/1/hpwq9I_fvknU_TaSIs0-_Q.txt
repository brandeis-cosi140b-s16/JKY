I would give zero stars if I could. Very annoying waitress and food was awful. I ordered nachos with no meat but honestly have you ever heard of nachos with potato, sweet corn and courgette? I honestly felt ill after a few bites. I told the waitress that I didn't like them and in all fairness she offered another meal but my bf had finished his and I didn't fancy waiting again so I said no but that was it, no refund or free drinks....nothing. A little bit pricey too considering the food is pants. Save your money and go elsewhere.
