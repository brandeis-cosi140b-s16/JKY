very disappointed in this place.  I went there last night with my wife and son. we asked if they could add a scrambled egg inside my sons beef burrito. We were told no because they were too busy in the kitchen. I asked for the manager who came to the table.  I explained the situation and he says "nope we're just not set up for that."  I asked why is it any different than putting egg on top of an enchilada?  He responded with "You should know we just don't do that."  And walked away.......needless to say the food could have been the best on the planet but my experience was over.  BTW, the food was mediocre at best.  They make it super hot to simulate New Mexican food. I'm from New Mexico and it was nothing like the food there.  Lastly I ordered the red chili ribs.  They were not ribs.  it was just a plate full of carne adovada that had been cooked in a pot.   Unfortunately I will not be back mainly due to the managers lack of interest in being helpful.
