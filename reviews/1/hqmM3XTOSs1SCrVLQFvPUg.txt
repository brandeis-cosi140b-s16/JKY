last night i had dinner with guests at C4.  what a disappointment.  since the wait person was new, he couldn't answer many questions on the menu, but that was no big deal.  i ordered the blue cheese burger medium  rare.  what i received was a well done burger with a whiff of blue cheese.  my guests were also disappointed in their meals.  we were asked if we cared about desserts but just wanted to leave for obvious reasons.
