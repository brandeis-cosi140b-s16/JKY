I ordered steak nachos. My order sat in the food window for 10 minutes after it was ready.  Then my waitress took it out from under the heat lamps and sat there for another 3 minutes gossiping about another employee while my nachos got cold on her tray. By the time I got my nachos, my steak was cold and my chips were soggy. I definitely will not be eating there again.
