If I could give this place a negative rating I would. My wife, 4 year old daughter and myself stopped in for lunch expecting a nice lunch. Well, as we all know they play Latin music in their establishments. On this particular day they decided to play whatever they wanted. While eating I noticed that there were F-bombs ad S-bombs being played over the speakers. I asked for the manager to complain and he gave me some excuse that they have no control over the music. BULL SHIT!! I asked for the corporate number and gave them a call. Turns out they have assigned stations that are to be played.
  I have no complaint about Baja itself, I do have an issue with this location. AND for the little sharpy eye brow wearing Mexican bitch. Who the hell are you to tell my wife that my daughter doesn't look like here? you might want to keep you papers near by just incase a few of my INS buddies decide to stop by for lunch.
