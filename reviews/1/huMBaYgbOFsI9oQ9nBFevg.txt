We really wanted to love this place because it's so close to our home.  We went for Happy Hour. This is a dive bar, which is fine, they have their place, but the set up is a bit confusing. You have to order food and drinks at the bar and they will bring the food to your table. 

We ordered a large pitcher of mango margaritas and two quesadillas. The bar tender misunderstood and made regular margaritas. She said no problem, I can fix it, and dumped some mango pur√©e into the mix, rather than start over. The result was a congealed, gloppy mess. 

The quesadillas were nothing special, perhaps a little overdone and dry. Hard to imagine a Mexican food place that can't get the basics down. 

All in all, it seemed like a good place for cheap buds with regulars hunkered down at the bar. But I do t think we will be returning.
