If I could give it zero stars I would. It is always empty no matter what day or time you are there and it's no wonder - the service is by far the worst. The food is not good either. I have been to Moes in other locations throughout the country and this one is terrible. We have been there a total of four times and this is what has happened - 1. Walked in with my husband, there were 11 workers and not one person said anything to us. I finally had to ask, "is someone going to take our order?" 2. We were charged for things we did not buy. 3. We were again charged for things we did not buy. My order was wrong. The kids menu says they have apple juice and they don't leaving my three-year-old, who gets juice only as a treat, extremely upset. I asked to speak to a manager and was told there was not one on duty. I asked to be reimbursed for the overcharge and was told they were not able to do it and I had to return when a manager was there. Unbelievable. They stole from me!

After visit 3, I called the store and spoke with The manager, Brianna. I told her what happened, she said to return to the store with my receipt and they would comp the value of the receipt. 

Visit 4 - had to wait for the workers to call Brianna. She denied the comp. I even spoke with her on the phone. I gave her the date and the time that we spoke. She said she remembered our conversation but did not remember saying she would comp our meal. 

We left. Absolutely disgusted with this place and will never return.
