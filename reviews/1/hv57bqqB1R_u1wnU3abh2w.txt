Stopped in with my friends to enjoy a raspado and had the worst customer service experience. As soon as we walked in the door the owner approached us and gave us a flyer for the boost mobile store down the street, I thought it was a bit odd. Am I here to get a raspado or to have a pushy guy give me a flyer and tell me to go buy a cellphone?

We placed our order and stood in front of the other counter where he was preparing our food. As we're waiting another customer shows up and instead of having the lady at the register take her order he stops making our raspados and goes over to the customer and gives her a boost mobile flyer! It was just so bizarre, my friend tried to tell him she wanted her ingredients mixed together and he was completely rude and condescending.

He doesn't know how to talk to people and isn't a good business owner in my opinion. I ordered the rompope flavor and it was okay but I would never go back to this establishment based on the way my friend was treated.

I also think that the people giving this place 5 stars either didn't deal directly with the man I'm talking about or don't speak Spanish because if you do you'd pick up on his extremely bad attitude.
