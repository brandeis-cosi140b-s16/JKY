I have eaten here twice (hoping my first experience was just a bad fluke... but sadly it wasn't). The service at this place is HORRIBLE. My first visit, I told the waiter that this was my first time and he said "that's nice" and just walked away. It took forever to get drink refills, salsa for our chips, etc. The waiter just didn't care and treated us like we were inconveniencing his otherwise very lazy day (FYI, we were one of 3 tables in the entire place... it was pretty dead in there). The sad part is the food was actually pretty good, so we decided to give it another shot. The next time we went, the service level was just as bad even though we had a different server (a waitress this time). Asking for extra water, salsa, etc. seemed like such a chore for her... and she'd disappear into the kitchen for long periods of time, then come back with one little thing for one of the 3-4 tables of people (again, pretty dead in there) and would then disappear again... it really seemed like she was avoiding the customers. For such a small, dead place... you would think they would be trying to WOW their customers to drum up some new business, but no... they don't want you here. Customers are just a nuisance to them.
