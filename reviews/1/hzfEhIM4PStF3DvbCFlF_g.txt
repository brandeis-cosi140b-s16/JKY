First time at visiting a Rubio's restaurant. 
I was really craving some Mexican food and this was the closest place. I ordered a burrito and a churro, my lady ordered the balsamic salad.

The first hint should have been that the staff did not know how to pronounce anything in Spanish correctly. A second hint should have been that I was the only Spanish speaker in the restaurant.

Overall the service was slow and poor, even taking into account the dinner rush. The quality was lacking. The salsas were fresh (the only plus) but even the hot salsa was not actually hot.

Overall, poor service, bland tasting food, and even blander salsas. Next time I crave Mexican, I'll go elsewhere.
