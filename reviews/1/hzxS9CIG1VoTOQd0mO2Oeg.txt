Terrible service!! My husband and I sat at the bar to order food and drinks, the bartender walked away after our initial order for two mimosas and menus.  They were out of champagne and I guess menus since he did not ask us if we wanted anything else.  We decided to sit at the community table because of his lack of interest in waiting on us.  When we sat down at the  community table there was a tip next to where we were sitting, a different server picked it up but never acknowledged us.  Then she walked by us 5 times before I finally asked for a menu which she threw on the table!! Wow, the people must really hate working there, the worst service ever!  We decided to leave, who needs that kind of abuse.
