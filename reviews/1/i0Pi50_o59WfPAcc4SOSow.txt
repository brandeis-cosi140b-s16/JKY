It's a pretty place with the plants and twinkly lights and the managers were nice, but I would never go back there nor would I recommend it to anyone. The waitress was very rude about my request for a meat-free meal. She claimed they could not make any substitutions, including my request for my meal to be of the healthier variety, which was an option listed on their menu ("spa mex," I think they call it). We got a new waiter, who was happy to accommodate me with a meatless burrito. Unfortunately it was no good. It was soggy, lukewarm zucchini inside a soggy, lukewarm cabbage leaf. The whole thing was watery with no substance and little taste. In addition, our meal took at least 45 minutes to arrive, despite it being a half full Wednesday evening, and it was so dark in the eating area we could not see our food. The managers tried to be extra nice after our first waitress was rude, but it really made the whole thing uncomfortable and awkward.
