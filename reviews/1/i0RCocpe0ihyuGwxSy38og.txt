This place is a terrible excuse for a restaurant..  Service, poor, food below average and the management is very unprofessional.  They would rather argue that the food is good rather than accommodate unhappy guests.  

BTW dont order the shrimp tacos, they are tiny canned or freeze dried and nasty!

Dont waste your time or money!  Thank god this is not a chain...
