Tried it once, I'm going back to Roberto's right around the corner.  Apparently going through the drive-thru at 3PM really pisses off the young lady working the window.  The only verbal communication from the cashier was to tell me how much I owed - No greeting and no goodbye from the staff.  I'll gladly take my business elsewhere since my patronage is not appreciated here.
