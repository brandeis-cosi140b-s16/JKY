Visited for the first time today... Stopped in today for a couple California Rolls. Was in a rush to get back home for an online training class so I asked for them to go. Got home & they'd only given me the rolls. NO ginger, wasabi or anything. It occurred to me that perhaps this being a spot with sushi variations that perhaps they don't have it but I called anyway to ask. Server said that they DO have it, but only if you're dining in. :-0 I guess she heard the disappointment in my voice so she offered to pack some up if I wanted to come back. So we drove back & got the Ginger, Wasabi & Soy. Finally got back home & ate. Utterly disappointed. The nori was soggy & like, wilted & the flavor was more pungent than I've had before & because the rice was bland it really stood out. The wasabi was also horribly bland. No bite at all - the ginger had more punch than the wasabi! I always thought it was difficult to screw up a California roll, but I guess I was wrong! Some of the other menu items looked interesting though so I'm willing to trust that I just ordered too simple & am willing to try again with one of their specialties. That said - I won't make an effort to go again because the service sucked. I REALLY hate being inconvenienced for something I'm paying for.
