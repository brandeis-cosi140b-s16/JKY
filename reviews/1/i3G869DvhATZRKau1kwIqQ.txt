My husband and I were in the mood for Taco Bell the other night, so we went through the drive-thru. We repeated our order several times to ensure accuracy, but when we got home with our food that was the last word I would use to describe what we got. 

Both of us asked for the new shredded chicken and didn't get it. We thought that maybe they didn't have it, but then they should've said something. Both of our sodas had run out of syrup, so we had to dump them out and I asked for no tomatoes, and instead got tomatoes on everything.

This is the closest Taco Bell to us, so we are stuck with it. If you do have a choice, choose a different location.
