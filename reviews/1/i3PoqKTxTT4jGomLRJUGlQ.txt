I have nothing bad to say about their food, it is absolutely to DIE for.  This would be the reason I originally chose to have my bridal shower here,  the food and their beautiful patio.  We had been working with Kyle since mid June on dates and times.  We settled on a date and time with the agreement to reserve the entire patio.  I was so excited, amazing salsa, tasty margaritas and special memories for my special day.  This all came to a screeching halt with my followup call to Kyle today.  I'm fairly sure he double booked the patio, but have no proof other than the fact that he didn't remember a thing (even though we corresponded via several emails) then after several hours and endless questions he calls me back to let me know we could have only a small part of the patio.  I didn't want "part" of a patio I reserved the ENTIRE patio but now he decided it was his "busy time of year" and that would no longer be an option.  BEWARE if you are attempting to have a large party here, the catering kid, Kyle, needs to brush up on his customer service skills.
