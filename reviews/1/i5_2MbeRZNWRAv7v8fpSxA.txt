This is, by far, the worst Cafe Rio in the valley and I typically love the food from this chain. I've given them repeated chances to improve and I'm disappointed with every time I visit. The food prep area is incredibly messy, the crew seems understaffed and over their heads, and they're always out of various menu items. You don't wait until you're actually out of something to start making more...plan ahead! The customers in line, me included, usually get impatient with the poor performance. 

I've never seen a manager or anyone that I could identify as a manager and it doesn't seem like they're interested in improving the quality at this location. This consistently poor customer service explains why this location is usually empty during the typical busy times and days. 

Come on Cafe Rio, get your sh*t together!
