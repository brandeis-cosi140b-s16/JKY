It actually breaks my heart to write this review. Any other time I have been here I've always received excellent service and the food has been awesome....until yesterday...
My boyfriend both worked  half days yesterday so we decided to meet at Lindo for lunch. We sat at the bar because it was lunchtime so obviously we knew it was going to be packed. The bartender was really nice and served us right away...then it all went downhill. My boyfriend order the chicken crema y rajas, i ordered shrimp mojo de ajo. When the food came out, mine was chicken instead of shrimp so I sent it back and the bartender apologized. It was fine I had time to kill anyway. Boy oh boy... As the server put the plate down, all the juice spilled all over my dress!!!!!  It was HOT!! But sh.. Happens!! When I looked at WHAT was on my plate .....it was the poorest excuse of ajo I have ever seen in my life!!!! Very watery, no garlic, it tasted like lemon water with a bit of tomato!!! I know this dish well since I order it all the time. At this point i start getting mad!!! The bartender said she was going to get the manager which we waited and waited and waited and waited but she was too busy getting chips for the five gentlemen that were seated at the bar next to us. Being a manager you might want to take care of the serious problem at the end other end of the bar first just saying....
At this point I am soaked in shrimp, tomato lemon water. My dress is ruined..and Im still hungry. My boyfriends appetite was ruined so he just boxed his up. All I got was an apology and the shrimp removed from the bill. This was THE worst dining experience I ever had. Its sad that it had to happen here. The manager should have done more on her part to rectify the situation. Not everyone in management deserves the title. 

And p.s.... I never got my soup either. :(
