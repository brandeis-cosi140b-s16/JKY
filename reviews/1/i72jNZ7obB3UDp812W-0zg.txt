This place is a stink hole! I havent been to this place in years and now I remeber why!! the decor is crap and dirty, i hesitated to even order food afraid of what it like when they prepare the food YUCK!!! I had a buy 1 get 1 free coupon so thats the only reason i went .
 Sausage burrito was salty, potatoes was old (extra .60) and it looks like generic yellow cheese( extra .50).
 Im done with this place I wish you the best of luck if you choose to eat at this dump.....
