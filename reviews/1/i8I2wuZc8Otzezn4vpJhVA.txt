I was desperate for food during my layover a the Phoenix airport and fell upon Barrio Cafe.  Not many vegan or vegetarian options.  I ended up ordering some kind of veggie sandwich, which was okay.  It came with this delicious yellow sauce that made the sandwich edible. I was told that it was tomatillo sauce- yea, I'm pretty sure that was inaccurate.  

What was disappointing about this place was how unwilling they were to accommodate your dietary needs.  No substituions or changes... you order what's on the menu. That's it.  And no salsa or chips to start-- I was told they didn't even have traditional salsa in stock... Rather rude staff too.

And, of course, prices are quite inflated to properly exploit your hunger during your airport visit.

I encourage you to bring some snacks before going to this airport.
