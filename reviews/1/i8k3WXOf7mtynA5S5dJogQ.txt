This location at the airport is a gross injustice to ANY traveler!  Ordered a simple "2 grilled chicken tacos"....came on corn tortillas, which quite literally fell apart upon picking up.  It was all a big pile of disgusting on a tin foil wrapper.  I will be forgiving on the price since it was at the airport and nothing is reasonably priced there, but when you can't even do tacos that are edible then ya best pack your bags and move out.  After a day of good travel, it was this dreadful taco joint that simply ruined it.  Should have opted for the Smashburger next door.....hind sight.
