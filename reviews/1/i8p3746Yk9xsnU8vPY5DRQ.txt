I would never in my life eat here. When I was there for their nighttime activities and people were throwing up I couldn't help but think...why oh why would anyone want to eat here. No offense but it was dirty and seemed like a sleazy place where younglings hang out to behave like they would in Mexico. And, how are girls supposed to get dressed up for a place that literally has a floor made of dirt. This would be one of my last options if I wanted to go out. Especially since I don't drink beer and that seems to be there most popular special. I did go to the one in Chandler though and it was soooo much cleaner! I liked that one much more!
