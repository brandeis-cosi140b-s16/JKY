Seriously?

It's fast food, it's simple food and it's still as inconsistently screwed up as possible every time I've tried this location. 

Hard shells were beyond stale, I'm not sure how you even manage this when you guys would be going through so many, leaving them out ? 

Ordered chicken... My whole order was chicken..as confirmed on the order screen when I ordered and as it states on my receipt. Did I receive one product with chicken? No.

I don't do fast food often, but I do like to indulge here and there, sadly the taste was so bad I literally can't imagine ever going back, not just this location but any toco bell ever. You killed my taste buds.

Hire managers that actually manage.
