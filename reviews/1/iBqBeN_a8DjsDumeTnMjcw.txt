update: ** i took down a star and now only giving 1 (i would give zero if i could) Worst fast food service at this location i'm sorry i tried giving them a few chances but i am appalled. The weekday lunch drive thru employee is very rude. I asked for sauce when i drove up to the window and she told me i should have asked for it when i ordered and got all angry. The lady at night is not any better either, she NEVER gets my order right and can't understand anything when you order. Her english is fine so im assuming she just sucks at her job. Always gets my drive thru order wrong multiple times (even since i last posted) Forgetting my utensils, salsa, messed up my drink and even forgot the extra shrimp i ordered. Cmon i want just one order right for once. Its the same two ladies every time and i have a lot of patience but after the 10th time it gets on my nerves. My mom who loves pollo loco says the same thing about those ladies as well. MANAGEMENT please do something about this if there i start seeing my order come out right ill change my rating. 

Food is pretty decent to-go mexican, with okay prices. Every time I been here they get my order wrong!! I have had to go back in drive thru several times already to fix my order. Food is fresh and the chicken is okay. Sauces are good. But yeah I choose del taco and taco bell over this any day of the week. I got a shrimp burrito and they put barely any shrimp or rice.
