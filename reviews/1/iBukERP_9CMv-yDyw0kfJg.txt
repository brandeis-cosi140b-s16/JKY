Before today I would have given this place 3 to 5 stars but today I will be finding another Chipotle location. The service and management has been sliding downhill the past 6 months.   Today we got half the meat we usually do on our bowls. My husband asked about getting a little more and was told he would get charged for double meat.  They did not have forks and when I asked the cashier Samantha if we could get forks she said "we are out of them".  I asked her if I was supposed to eat a salad with a spoon and she shrugged and looked annoyed.  No apology.   No customer service. They could use some basic PR training.  And a good manager.
