We (party of 8) had a 5:30 PM reservation. When we walked in we noticed plenty of tables available. After waiting 10 minutes, we asked the young ladies at the desk and were told it would be a few more minutes. As more and more people came in and were added to the list, all being told 15-20 minutes wait, we asked again when we would be seated. Needless to say, the tables in the center of the restaurant stood empty. At that time we were told that they were waiting for a party of 44! Who takes a reservation for 44 people on Saturday at a popular neighborhood restaurant leaving 20 to 30 people on various size groups waiting for tables? After another 10 minutes, it is now after 6PM, the tables are still empty, the crowd getting bigger we were told it would be a few more minutes. With that, we made a reservation for another local restaurant and told them we were leaving. The manager and one of his staff chased us out to the parking lot telling us our table was ready now. Really? And, when we left, the 44 people still had not shown up. Very poor management! My friends and I will never return to this place.
