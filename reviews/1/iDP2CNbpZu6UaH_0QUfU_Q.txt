My husband and I are chipotle addicts. We were visiting family out in surprise and soon learned that going to this location was a terrible mistake. I kid you not, the burrito contained eight chunks of chicken... and that's being generous. When we said light hot sauce they poured it on and don't know the meaning of customer service. We will not be coming back to this location ever again.
