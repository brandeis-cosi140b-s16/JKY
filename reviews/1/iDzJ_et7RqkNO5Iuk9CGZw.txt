I am so upset to come here and place such a large order late at night with no one really there so obviously it shouldn't be that hard to get the order right. 

It's another fast food spot that you don't expect customer service from but the least they could do is get the order right. I call to speak to a manager who Ofcourse doesn't speak English that well and if she does she sure didn't sound like it on the phone.  

As she sat there telling me what she did to our order I'm explaining to her that it's wrong with missing items she talks over me to correct me. I will never understand how such people are hired to run a store. I'll be calling again in the morning in hopes I talk to someone who understands customer issues.
