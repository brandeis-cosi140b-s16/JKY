Last time I visited, I placed an order online. I know, burned in the past, but thought I would give it a second shot. The online ordering site allows you to pick a time, and gives the people there at least fifteen minutes to get your order ready. I selected a time, and was at the store 5-10 minutes after the time it should have been ready. When I got up to the cash register, the girl there had to print out my receipt and hand it to the people making it. After a few words with them, they stuck the receipt with my order on the wall. 

I had to stand there waiting another ten minutes before she went over there again, and had to tell the guy at the beginning of the line that I was there waiting for it.The place where I work only gives me a half hour for lunch, and the lines at this place are notoriously slow, so I thought I would be safe ordering online. 

The food is definitely not as good as it used to be. In fact, the bowl I got was pretty watery. Not something I'm used to from chipotle. 

All in all, I don't think I'll be going back. And I dont think I will miss it.
