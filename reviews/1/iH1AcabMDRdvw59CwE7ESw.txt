This place was pretty terrible. Only went because we had a groupon, server did a good job but the food was terrible. They had a DJ at 4 in the afternoon on a week day, it was just all around bad. Perhaps a better option for the younger crowd that needs to feel like they are in a night club. Won't be back.
