We went in 4:10 on a Sunday afternoon. There were people sitting at the bar and about 3 tables occupied outside. One couple inside who hadn't been served anything at the time we entered. Sign said to seat yourself. 5 waitresses walking around made eye contact but never came over, smiled, nothing to acknowledge our presence. Finally after about 10-15 minutes, someone came over. She got 2 menus when there were 3 of us. Took our drink order and came back with water, chips and salsa, and our drinks. My iced tea was without a lemon (a first for me) when I tried to get the waitress to come back she just kept walking. I have a pretty loud voice. Another 15 minutes of more waiting and I shouted to get the attention of a different apathetic waitress for her to get a manager. The manager came over and try to make it better but I had enough got up and left. Even if the food is good I'll never know because I won't go back due the crappiest service I've ever experienced.
