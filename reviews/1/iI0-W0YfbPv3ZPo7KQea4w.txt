Stay away from this Rubio's if you want to be charged the normal price and not twice as much. Had an argument clearly on my receipt but I had paid for an extra set of black beans the manager at the counter did not give them to me and charge me for them again. I took my receipt back he still could not understand it ended up leaving and getting frustrated over $.89 worth of black beans. What happened to the customer is always right


This is the second time that I've been to this Rubio's and I always wonder if my order is going to be complete as I feel like they don't understand what I am ordering. I eat at a different Rubio's all the time and never have an issue it seems to be this Rubio's in particular. I love Rubio's but stay away from this one
