Service is usually very sloppy in this location and they often mess up orders.

Figured I could be more descriptive.. My family loveees tacos. With a passion. But every time we seem to visit this location we're lucky to get our orders correct. Plain is plain! -_- it's cool to stop by when the Diamondbacks win, but eh, we've moved on :(
