I had never been here before, but my friend and her husband go there all the time and love it.  We got a groupon and went for dinner.  The groupon was for two dinner entrees (for up to $12.99 per meal) and two jumbo margaritas.  

We told the server right away and he seemed annoyed.  We ordered margaritas and was told it was only the house lime; no flavors were included as those were extra.  When we got our margaritas, my friend had a black bug in hers.  We flagged down our waiter and he didn't apologize or anything. He just said "Oh. I can get you another one."  Our food came out which was good, but the server never came to see how our dinner was, the bus boy did though who was very nice.  After we finished, the server came over to bring us our check and we have him our groupon.  When he brought it back, the groupon didn't cover all of it and we had only ordered exactly what was on the groupon.  The check indicated that only $45.97 was applied.  We checked the groupon fine print to make sure that there wasn't a maximum dollar value that we missed and there wasn't.  We asked the server why there was still a $12 balance and he couldn't give us an answer.  So we took it up to the front to the cashier and asked nicely to speak with the manager.  She said there was a maximum value on it but we asked where that was indicated.  She said it was in the fine print, but when we showed her the fine print, it was not there and she could not find it.  She didn't want to help us and felt annoyed that we were asking about it. Finally after her reading the fine print for another few minutes said "oh well it should be in there".  She didn't apologize at all and finally changed our bill to the correct amount where we just owed tax and tip.  She blamed it on groupon saying that the price in things have changed and that groupon didn't reflect that.  The food was just okay but the customer service was absolutely awful!
