yuck! I'd actually rather eat Taco Bell then go to this place again. I got take-out from here the other day (beef taco and cheese enchilada combo) and it was not good AT ALL. The taco shell was store bought cardboard, not freshly fried and authentic and the beef was ground beef, not authentic shredded beef. It also had the tiniest sprinkling of shredded cheese and lettuce. The cheese in the enchilada was all rubbery and solid by the time I got home and ate it  (mind you I only live 5 min. away). The rice n beans were nothing to call home about. Definitely not authenic mexican food and definitely not worth your money. Will not return!
