First of all I hate giving local businesses bad reviews but after going to this place twice I had to review it.

I know they are not known for their nachos but I love nachos and when I was told they had good nachos I wanted to try it asap. The first time I got chicken nachos. They were covered in Chicken. I could not taste the chips, cheese, guac, because it was just all chicken. They give few chips. Literally I picked off a pile of chicken on a plate and I still had more than I knew what to do with in the nachos. I kind of wrote the place off because the nachos were almost inedible. 

Then comes tonight. I was craving nachos again. They are so close that I figured I would give it another shot and just get them vegetarian this time. Again they were skimpy on chips, when I said no meat they did not offer any beans or anything to substitute the beans. So I got the guacamole again which they charged me extra for. When I got the total I asked if I was charged the same as with meat and the unsmiling person ringing me up said yes. Not only did I get charged the same as I would have with a pile of meat on my nachos but they charged me extra for guac! A few chips and some cheese should not cost 9 dollars. I can go to Tico's and get vegetarian nachos with veggies, beans, guac, etc for a similar price and they are twice as large. 

The cheese was completely hard and there was more pico than chips. Really unimpressive.

They could learn something from chipotle and give the vegetarians their guac for free if they are going to charge them for the meat they are not eating.

Never again.
