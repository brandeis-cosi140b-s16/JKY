I came here on a Saturday night with my Girlfriend as I was craving Mexican food. (I should have known better). Being from Los Angeles and Mexican I am very picky when it come to Mexican food as I always compare it to my Grandma or moms mex food). 
First, we came in and the ambiance was weird and nothing of Mexican culture except for the low rider bike on the ceiling and maybe the cooks. 
2nd the waiter was nice and provided us with salsa and chips. Salsa was nasty and tasteless. 
3rd I asked the waiter about the Carnitas plate and he highly recommend it. My girlfriend got the steak nachos (going for something simpler as they can't mess up Nachos). 

We'll let me say the Carnitas were awful and the nachos sucked. I would have rather eaten at Taco Bell. Probably better off. Man I was sooo upset. I asked to speak the manager. The manager of Asian decent ( nothing wrong with that but here's the reason why I said this) asked what was wrong. I said the food sir is not good at all and we cannot take another bite. He said its authentic mexican food. Really???? He was rude and just didn't care about our concerns and just took my girlfriends nachos off the bill. I just did not want to argue to a pointless issue. If you want better mexican food I would suggest eating off the strip where the locals go.
