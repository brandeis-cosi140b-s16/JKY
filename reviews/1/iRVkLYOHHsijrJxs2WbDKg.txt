Went to   Rudy's today  for the first  time  and was so disappointed  in the food. Ordered  a   taco salad it came with   a bag full of salad mix with a sprinkle   of hamburger   meat and cheese .  My husband 's meal was just as do appointing so we sent the food back. My husband   paid for   the ice tea and the waitress   told him that the manager   makes them pay for any food sent back  even   when it's not their   fault .My husband   spoke with  the  manager   and he agreed   that  he makes them pay for the food and walked away .  Wth...I will never  go   back . I hope   this stops   other's   from going as well.
