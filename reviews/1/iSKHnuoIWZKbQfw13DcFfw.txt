Okay, I know Pittsburgh isn't exactly a hotbed of amazing Mexican food.

But holy cow was this bad. 

Caveat: nice staff, friendly ambiance. I'd go back for the bar. Just not for the food. 

Everything was tepid when it arrived. The beans were congealed. The chicken tasted like it came out of a can. No dressing on the salad. 

I'm the worst cook in the world and my burritos are better than that. Yikes. 

I don't have especially high standards, which makes it all the more amazing that I thought this was awful.

Sorry guys. I wanted to like your food!
