We have been here before and we liked the outside seating.  It was an ok restaurant but, after today we will never return.  We sat ourselves in the outside patio.....hostess said he would catch up to us!  It was a disaster.   Dirty dishes all over. Tables were all dirty.  Waitresses walking over menus on the ground. Our waitress was almost half alert.  Never to return.
