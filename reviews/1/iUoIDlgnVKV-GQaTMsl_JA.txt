My family and I were very disappointed with this restaurant. The food was not appetising and tasted bland. The dishes we chose were very standard but didn't taste as good as Taco Bell. Plus, we all had stomach aches afterward for the rest of the night. The wait staff was disinterested in us. We never got more chips or water. They never took our plates away after the meal. We had to wait to get our bill. We won't be back, mexican food is not that hard to make tasty, I just don't understand how they missed the mark so badly.
