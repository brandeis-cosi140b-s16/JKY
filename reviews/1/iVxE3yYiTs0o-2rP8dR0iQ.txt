Went to see them at Chowdown Uptown an was super excited. Fish taco sounded awesome but got there to learn they ran out of fish early and despite a sushi menu were not offering. Waiting 20 minutes for 3 tacos was the final explosion. The girl out front explained they cook everything fresh, in a big event like this wouldnt it make sense to do things in batches? By the time people got their food they were pissed off. The tacos were under-seasoned with barely any sauce so all that was tasted was the corn tortilla.
