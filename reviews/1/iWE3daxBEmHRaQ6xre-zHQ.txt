You don't expect the highest quality food when you go to a Fast food restaurant. This is a one-star review because the employee helping us today rolled her eyes when we told her that one of our orders was wrong. She wasn't wearing a name tag so I can't call her out specifically but if you can't provide decent customer service (which at the bare minimum is at least not rolling your eyes) then you shouldn't work at a place where you interact with customers.
