The first time we went here was okay, just a regular taco bell. But, a few weeks ago my husband went and picked up food and ordered my food with no onions or red sauce. Once home, I found out all of it had onions and red sauce even though the receipt was correct. And then tonight, my husband went a grabbed food again, got all the way home and we realized that my tacos were missing. Messing up my dinner once sucks, messing it up the past two times we've gotten food there and I am done.
