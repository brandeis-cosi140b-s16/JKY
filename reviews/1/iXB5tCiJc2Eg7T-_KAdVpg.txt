Never going again. I had been a frequent and loyal customer for six years . They recently hired a new cashier who is rude, argumentative, and will over charge.
I don't spend money at a place which treats me rudely. 
P.S   There is a Robertos Taco only a block away , so from now on I will go to Robertos
