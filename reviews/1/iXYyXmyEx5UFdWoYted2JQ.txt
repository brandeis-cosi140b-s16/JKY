Drain the oil out of the meat before you put it in the burrito! Listen to all your customers on yelp and change!! Complete and utter laziness. This place could be so great open 24/7, has a nice drive through. Pat down the oil how difficult is that. Recently ordered a California burrito, high quality ingredients but oil was seeping out the bottom. Had to stop halfway through because I was so disgusted with myself. My plate upon stopping (because I can't say finishing) looked like the Black Sea so much oil. Change people change! Will not be retuning until I see change.
