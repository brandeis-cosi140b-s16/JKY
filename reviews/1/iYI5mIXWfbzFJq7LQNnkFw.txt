My wife and I ordered Tacos there which we ate at home for dinner. My wife had terrible food poisoning, but I was relatively fine, so I assumed it must have been something else she ate. 

I then ate the left overs (2 pork tacos) the following day and I too have food poisoning. 

As I ate, I noticed that meat came apart a little too easily and was slightly slimy. I thought that was just how it was cooked, but in retrospect, it had the texture of really old meat. 

Eat here with caution, especially during the days when they're not busy. They probably just keep reusing ingredients from previous days
