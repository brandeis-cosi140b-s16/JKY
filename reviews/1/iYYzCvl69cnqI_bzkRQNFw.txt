Yep.....una estrella!  Someone accidentally listed this in the mexican genre. This was taco bell with nice decor and a bar.  If those are the kind of boots you wear go for it.....not me.  Granted i did not partake in the alcohol, so maybe around 10PM on a friday night with a few beers maybe the tacos start to look and taste beautiful.  A tactic many establishments use....turn down the lights, turn up the alcohol....they'll pay for whatever i put on the plate.
