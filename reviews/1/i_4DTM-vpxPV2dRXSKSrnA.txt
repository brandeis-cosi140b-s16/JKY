Maria's used to be the place my household went to on a weekly basis. We spent a few months away and come back only to be disappointed. My tacos al carbon was rubbery meat in stale flour tortillas. No queso fresco, no onions, no cilantro. The refried beans looked unappealing and still had the tinny taste of the can. My rice was so hard I could have put it in a bag and resold it at the store.

My roommate got a combo of a tostada, beef taco, and a Mexican stew burrito. There was sauce from the burrito everywhere that made everything else a soggy mess. He also said that it had no real flavor.

The bf ordered.the chicken fajita taco salad. Instead he was given a regular chicken taco salad. It was also so soggy that it fell apart on first contact with a fork.

Maria's has also expanded the menu and it doesn't do them any favors. It is the same fare you can find at any hole in the wall and none of it is authentic. Another strike against them is that they are now charging for soda refills. This I could understand if they were doling out individual cans but they aren't. So it now costs 2.25 for your first glass and a dollar every glass after that.

We will no longer be frequenting Maria's.
