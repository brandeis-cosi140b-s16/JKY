If I could give this customer service a zero I would . Me and my boyfriend ordered this morning 12/20 @ 10:30am . We pulled up to the drive thru and as we ordered the rep maribel sounded annoyed that my boyfriend was not sure what he wanted to order . Once we ordered she stumbled with our order when repeating it back did not provide us with an amount and than as we pulled up we saw she was on the phone going on about how she can't believe some guy did that (so rude) she than asked for the second time if we wanted sauce and we told her mild and hot . Than marble grabbed our credit card swiped provided us a receipt and pretty much tossed our bags of food at my boyfriend . (WITH NO SAUCE) we waited for her and she came to the window and we told her about the sauce and again asked what kind we told her and she through it in our bag and gave a snarky remark about enjoying our food . Thanks a lot Maribel from order #70!!! (WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE)
