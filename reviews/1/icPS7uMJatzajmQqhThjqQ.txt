I called this location to ask what time they closed which was 1 AM. We showed up 5 till close and at the drive through they told us they were closed. "We thought you closed at one" the drive through lady told us it was one. When we told them no it's 5 till one, that's why we called, they started to tell us what we could order off the menu.
