What an experience! After going to this establishment for 15 years  it has officially hit rock bottom.

Rice:  No taste and under cooked
Burritos:  Chicken inside was excellent. 
Decor:  OLD and needs a redo and cheesy.
Workers:  Mostly teenagers with no management. 
Prices: Cheap but that's all its worth
Summary:  Its day has come and gone!
