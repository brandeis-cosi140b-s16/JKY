This place makes Macayos taste authentic.  In a city full of incredible Mexican food, how do places like this stay in business?  Salsa is from either a can or jar.  C'mon guys, even this fat white boy from MN can make killer salsa in 10 mins.  Chicken chimi covered in chili con queso sauce had no spice or flavor.  Beans tasted a week old.  Rice was good.  The only thing Mexican in here is my waiter and I'm sure he doesn't eat this slop.  Skip this place and head to Raul and Theresa's!!
