Food is good of course because it is Chipotle but the employees at this location are rude! Had an altercation with an employee because I was waiting on part of my order and the cashier was confused and frustrated and I let her know what I had ordered and the employee next to her attempting to help was rude and quickly said "oh so you know what everybody ordered!?" I said "no but I know what I ordered and no need for your tone!" I was very angry about how this "employee" had to put in her two cents in and give me an attitude because she doesn't know how to do her job! She was a short haired brunette trying to look like Justin Bieber! I won't come back to this location and if I do and see this employee I'm throwing a full drink at her!!
