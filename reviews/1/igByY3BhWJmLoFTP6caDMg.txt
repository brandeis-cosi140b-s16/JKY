This visit was awful here. The employee who didn't have a badge but was Asian screwed up the entire order. Was charged for guacamole which I didn't get the bowls were made wrong and the line was out the door. Customer service was awful. My chips and salsa was no there. Talk about a nightmare this is the worst location I've ever been to. I understand it's fast food but really I've had better service at food truck then this awful location.
