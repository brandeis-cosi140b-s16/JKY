How can a fellow Yelper rate this as a 5 and me a 1? Maybe it was an off day?

This place is absolutly beautiful! 

The service was average to slow, considering I was 1 of 3 tables. 

The chips were bland and the salsa was crap. If you took strained canned tomatoes and added an onion powder from the dollar store and a little salt. That was the salsa. Totally crap. 

I ordered the appitizer combo, thinking it would be a good way to sample a little of everything... that was the thought. 

it had a mole` type covered enchilada with chicken in it. The mole` was decent, but it was very sweet, no spice at all. Maybe this was dessert?
The rolled taco things had zero flavor, the chimi was alright but anything fried with sour cream on top is. The sope or whatever was ok, but again had zero flavor, the beans had zero flavor, the cheese which I think was Cojita was good but not enough on anything. 

I really liked the decor, but would have preferred the chicken from the guy cooking out front of the store. 

Totally disappointed. I think this is my first 1 star for a business that is still open...lol
