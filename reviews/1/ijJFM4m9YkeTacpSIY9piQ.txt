Why I tried this place a 3rd time idk... Maybe because I like their table top guacamole but not this time the girl making it didn't know how to even pit the avacodo way to much lime juice and salt. But that's not the main compliant my friend ordered the soup with pork in it. She barely could eat it. The pork tasted like it was old and over cooked.  This was her first time here I really hoped to wow her with the guacamole but no and very disappointed with the food again. Waitress acted as if she didn't care of we were not satisfied she was more into the bigger table she was serving.  Last time ever for me. Had to give 1 star doesn't even deserve a star
