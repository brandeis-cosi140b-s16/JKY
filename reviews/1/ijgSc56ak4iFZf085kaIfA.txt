If I could give this chipotle zero stars I would. When my husband and I walked in (we are white) the three (non-white) employees literally turned their backs to us/completely ignored us, no greeting, no "we'll be right with you", absolutely nothing!!!! The male employee actually continued telling a story about something and was laughing while we tried to gain their attention. The chick making the food realized they were fucking up and tried to be as polite as possible and so did the register chick. It was too late. Luckily they have to make the food in front of us bc I'm certain we'd be eating spit if it was a restaurant where it was made out of our sight. Two (non-white) people walked in while our food was being made and they were immediately greeted with smiles and "welcome to chipotle", WEIRD! I'm not shocked that these people were hired though because they seemed like they could pass the "mirror fog test", the one where the only qualification is that they can fog up a mirror placed under their nose bc they're breathing. #SORRYNOTSORRY
