Tried Gordo's out for dinner. Went through drive thru. Took 20 mins to receive food. Ordered enchiladas, chicken chimi, nachos in cheese and a kids meal with taco. It cost $39! Was really surprised! You can eat at Serranos for cheaper and about as fast. Was really hoping for this experience to be different! Staff seemed over whelmed and not very friendly.
