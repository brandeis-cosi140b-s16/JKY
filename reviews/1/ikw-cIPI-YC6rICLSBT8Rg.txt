I tried this place for the first time and ordered their special on Sunday of enchiladas,eggs, and beans. My daughter ordered the taco salad. The chips and salsa arrived with a small bowl of chips and huge bowl of salsa ( very amusing). The chips had a burnt taste to them but did not appear burnt. Did not eat emm. When our plates arrived the taco salad was typical, served in the fried tostada bowl and her words were, "it's ok". My plate looked ok until I noticed I had only one fried egg on my plate...strange..they usually come in pairs. When I mentioned this to our waitress, she said there should be 2 and said she would get it taken care of. A few moments later she arrived with a plate with a very raw egg on it. It was not even fried...it almost looked like a poached egg...but raw.I showed our waitress and she said that it didn't like right to her either , but the cook told her to serve it to me. I was upset...with situation and asked to speak to a manager. He arrived and I explained the events and he said.."well I didn't see the egg, so I am not sure what happened". I assured him it was raw and he said he was sorry and that he ask the cook about it and he left. he did not offer any compensation for it and as a matter of fact the waitress is the one that gave me an employee discount. The manager did not appear to care about the situation and the cook obviously could not even cook an egg...I will not return.
