You know the foods horrible when you start the review with, "the waitress was very friendly". The chips were pretty good. Salsa was spicier than expected. The carne asada tastes like boiled meat with no flavor at all. The adoba tasted like boiled meat with chili powered. Beans and rice weren't too shabby. Service was slow. Margaritas tasted like a cheap party mix. 
I suppose all I can say is that the food will make a turd ;).
