Let me start by saying that I LOVE El Pollo Loco but this location is giving them a bad name.  Was there once before and I felt I had walked into a high school cafeteria. Employees with off the clock employees being just too loud and making feel out of place. Food was ok. I decided to give this location another try and I was asked if I can wait 45 minutes for chicken unless I want fried up chicken that's been on the grill for hours. That chicken looked like dry skin on bones yet it's still on the grill. Will not be back to this location ever again.
