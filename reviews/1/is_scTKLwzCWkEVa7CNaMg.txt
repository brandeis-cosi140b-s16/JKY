Stay far far away from here unless you like food that comes out of a can into the microwave and onto your plate. I couldn't eat my meal at all, I had a chicken chimichanga that came out soggy there was so much water left in the chicken. I tried to eat the chicken but it was nasty and fatty. The rice and beans where hot on the outside and cold in the middle. Even the booth we where set at was dirty and had holes in the vinyl.  I will never go back.
