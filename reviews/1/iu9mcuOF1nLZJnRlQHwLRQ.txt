Came here before a pool party with my friends. We had bathing suits on but were still covered in wraps. The hostess told us we could sit at the bar. And then the bartender told us we just had to make sure we stayed covered. After ordering and getting a few drinks the terrible manager lady came by and told us we had to leave because we had swim attire. After telling her we weren't staying at that hotel and were already told two people we could stay there it wasn't right that she was making us leave. She gave me a dry apology and said she could make our food to go. Poor service and poor attitude. If you're not going to serve people in certain attire and you're a half bar in the casino not even a real restaurant on its own at least have a sign posted. Or honor what your employees already said could be done. Period.
