Smelled like raw sewage in the parking lot. Wasn't greeted as we walked in and had to wander around aimlessly until someone finally saw us even though thr place was empty. To top it all off they were out of the ghost chili which is a key ingredient in their signature dishes. The waitress was slow and unapologetic.
