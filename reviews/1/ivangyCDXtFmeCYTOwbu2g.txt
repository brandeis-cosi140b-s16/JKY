First off let me state that if it were possible to give them less than a 1 star I would. I ordered the barbacoa enchiladas with refried beans. I had felt fine all day until this meal. The best thing here were their chips and salsa. The whole meal tasted rather bland. There was no difference in the seasoning at all on the plate. The margarita was decent at best. We only saw the server for orders and the check which by the was just a receipt they had no tray or book to present with it. as I was out on date night I didn't want my girlfriend to worry about how much the tab was.When other tables were checked on regularly in our area. Then when we left we saw a group of about 12 servers just hanging out by the door when we left. Needless to say I won't be back. I could have gone to filabertos spent less and received much better food and service. And to add to this horrible night when I get out of the car to go see a movie I feel nauseous and throw up in the parking lot not even 20 minuets after leaving. Then when I call to inform the manager he seem to accuse me of trying to receive a free meal. If your looking for a good fun dining experience do yourself a favor and go else where. Because I for one am never coming back here!!!!!
