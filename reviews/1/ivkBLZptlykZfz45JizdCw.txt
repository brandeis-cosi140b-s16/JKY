Tried this place because it's one of the few places in Chandler I've never been to.

Great free sopapillas but those are hard to mess up...The free dips that come with the thick chips are spicy salsa, a jalapeno cream sauce, green sauce, and a bean dip that had a weird flavor I couldn't put my finger on.  Regardless of charging 3 dollars for an extra basket, we didn't finish the first basket because we didn't like it. My bill came to 37 dollars for 2 adult entrees and a kids entree. Loved my chicken enchiladas, but my fiance hated his combo meal of hatch chili and cheese enchiladas (they were out of tamales so he had to double enchiladas) and my 4-year-old ordered cheese crisp. Service was OK, a little slow and she pushed a bus tub cart around the whole time to carry things which was a little weird. 

Wouldn't come back with my family, Valle Luna and Abuelos has much better mexican food, less heartburn and service for the price so we'll continue to go there! If I knew it was more expensive and "New Mexican" I probably wouldn't have came here, I'm an Arizonan that prefers regular Mexican food.
