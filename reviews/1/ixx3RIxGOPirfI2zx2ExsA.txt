1st off, ordered Chicken Tacos to go and started out with no flour soft tortillas so I had to settle with corn tortillas. Not my personal preference but ok. Also ordered a chicken burrito. Went down the line and asked for chips and guacamole and they said they were out. Asked for cheese dip and said they didn't have any and had to settle for salsa dip. When I got home to eat it, both the tacos and burrito were really cold. Not even luke warm. The chips tasted stale and really salty. Not the best 1st experience.
