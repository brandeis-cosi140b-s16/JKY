If i could give no stars i would. Used to love this place but the last couple times i been there, maybe 2x this past year (i dont eat there as often anymore) have really sucked. The ladies are rude and have attitude. I called my orders in both times and both times the food was not ready and had to wait 20 mins or so for my food. I asked so whats the point in trying to call an order in- the female rolled her eyes and walked away from the counter. The food isnt as good anymore, and totally not worth the drive to the ghetto anymore.
