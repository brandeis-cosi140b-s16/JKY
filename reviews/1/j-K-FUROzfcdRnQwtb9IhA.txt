I came here a second time and ordered the flan and horchata and man was I disappointed!!! The flan is so small I thought it was toddlers portion. To make it worse it tastes like plastic and serves it with lemon. Wtf is that?? The horchata is not what u would expect. It tastes like u just bit into a coconut.  It's terrible.  Save yourself the time and anguish and stay away!!!
