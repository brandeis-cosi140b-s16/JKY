Do not EVER eat here!!! Or the tacos at least. I went with a friend of mine and her sister. I got tacos and they got other menu items. I am just getting over a 36hr food poisoning! The food wasn't even that good. I have had way better tacos. The people I went with weren't impressed either. Do not waste your time or risk your health at this place!
