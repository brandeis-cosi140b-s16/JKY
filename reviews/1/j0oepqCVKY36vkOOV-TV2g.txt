I had tried Viva multiple times several years ago and gave up on them due to repeatedly getting take out orders wrong.  I decided to give Viva a try again this week and while my order was correct, everything else about my visit was blah.

The cashier was rude and clearly did not care about any aspect of their job.  They responded to my greeting with a blank stare.  My drink was served covered in soda all over the outside of the cup.  My food was put on a tray and was placed on a counter no more than 10 feet away from where I sat.  I was told to come get my food, rather than have it brought to me.

I ordered the 3 chicken enchilada lunch special.  The food was bland and tasted like no effort was put in to the production.  The chicken was dry and unseasoned and the enchilada sauce was tasteless.  I get more flavor down the street at Taco Bell.

When I was finished, I took my tray and plate to the waste area.  On top of the waste area was a restaurant kitchen tote that was full of dirty plates.  It was absolutely disgusting and looked like it had been there building up all day.  

Overall, save yourself the agony and go elsewhere.  The people running this business clearly don't care about their food, the dirty facilities, or to make their customers feel welcome.
