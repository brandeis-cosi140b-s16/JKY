Terrible customer service.  I went through the drive thru. Ordered a Super Burrito with Chicken.  The guy said with what. I repeated with chicken. I heard a click then waited 5 mins before a truck pulled behind me. I then said "hello".. Got no answer...then the guy started  literally whistling at me through the speaker. I then just drove off without my food. That's ridiculous!
