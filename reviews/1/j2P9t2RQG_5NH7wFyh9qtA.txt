I would rate the food but i cant. I ordered and paid for food that I never recieved after 45 minutes.  After asking the manager about my food order she said that she didnt have a transaction or ticket for my order so i would not get my food.  So Im a liar? Are you kidding me? I am pretty sure the cashier stole my money and didnt ring in my order.  I even contacted Fuzzy's online and they still have not returned my email.  WOW.
