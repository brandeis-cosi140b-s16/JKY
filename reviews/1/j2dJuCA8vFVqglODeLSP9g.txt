We were thrilled to finally get a Cafe Rio in our area.  However, after several visits we are ready to say goodbye to our new location and travel back to the Stephanie or Eastern locations.  The service here is horrible, the restaurant is freezing cold and the food is less than mediocre.  The servers are rude and when I ask for extra pico, I am treated like I am asking for something impossible!  

It is time for management to step-up and take control and make some much needed changes!!!
