Nobody speaks English well enough to get the order right. The pico De gallo is all onions with one or two flex of tomato and cilantro. Everything is made very cheap with no quality ingredients.  There wasn't a customer in the place but every table was dirty. Makes me wonder about the cleanliness. My advice...go elsewhere.
