not the best place for non spanish speaking tourists to go to. they f*cked up my order when i asked for cheese no beef and the girl rolled her eyes n and i asked for the guacamole n pico on the side and they didnt give it to me at all. she gave me my order n shut the drive theu window on me before i left. i opened thw box n the enchiladas were cold n the cheese didnt even melt all the way through. i ended up tossing the whole thing. wasted my $5 on this piece of sh*t order. 

again, dont go here.
