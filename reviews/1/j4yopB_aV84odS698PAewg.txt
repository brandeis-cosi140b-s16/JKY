Anyone who gave this place 5 stars must work for the restaurant...

This place sucks!  Everything about our meal was bad.
We had a reservation and still had to wait 20 minutes
The margaritas were an absolute joke.  We had to send them back... they came back with new ones and they tasted just as watery as before.

Chips and Salsa  - mediocre
Drunken Chicken Nachos - not good.. watery.. no flavor
Mahi Mahi Tacos - not bad.. a little bland but not terrible.. the beans that accompanied it were awful though
Margarita - arguably the worst margarita i've ever had
