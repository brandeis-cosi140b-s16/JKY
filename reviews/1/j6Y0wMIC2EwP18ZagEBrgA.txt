I'm not sure where to begin but from the moment we walked in the door the service was terrible. Our server had absolutely no personality and nor did anyone we saw. Then the food, mediocre at best. My tacos were not chicken, (which is what i ordered ) and for $47 (including tip) for LUNCH with NO cocktails I think it is safe to say we will never be returning. I work down the street as a hairstylist and unfortunately will be sharing our experience. Any Mexican restaurant that charges for chips and salsa automatically looses points. What a disappointment.
