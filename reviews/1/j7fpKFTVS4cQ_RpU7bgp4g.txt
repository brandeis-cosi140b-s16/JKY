0 STARTS IF I COULD 
I've heard many people say this place is so good, me being a Mexican person, knows what Mexican food is, this place BY FAR isn't anything close to Mexican, plates are full of cheese, and greasy.  The chips they brought out taste stale, and the oil they cook the chips must be old, the salsa was rotten had a bitter taste, like when tomatoes go bad, the food oozing out oil, and the beans on my tostada were going bad, ugh this place is just a disgrace to say it's "FINE Mexican food" what a joke. Not to mention this place looks very dirty inside, smells dirty and can't even replace there cracked window up front where customers can see in and out, they taped it to hold it from shattering more. What a waste of 20.00 and a ruined lunch for me and my mother today, I WILL NEVER COME BACK TO this place again, there is better REAL Mexican food out there folks. 
 thumbs down to this nasty food
