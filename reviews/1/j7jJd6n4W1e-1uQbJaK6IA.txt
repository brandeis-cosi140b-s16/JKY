I'm rather new to the area & have only been to this location twice, but both times were not good experiences, at all. First time, I ordered a chicken quesadilla just to find an almost 2 inch long, half inch wide bone in it. Called to let them know, not expecting any compensation, just a friendly heads up... I got a very rude girl on the phone with an attitude & short responses, lacking any sort of empathy, apology or customer service. Tonight, decided to give them another chance, this time for "Taco Tuesday." Ordered a large number of tacos, both chicken & beef. Once ready to eat, noticed that the chicken in our tacos were still completely raw. Not just a little pink, completely raw, rubbery & all. It's funny that the girl at the counter seemed rather confused when I questioned how my order was ready so fast. Unfortunately, it's one of the few places that stays open late around here, but I will not go back again. Both of my situations are examples why careless businesses get shut down.
