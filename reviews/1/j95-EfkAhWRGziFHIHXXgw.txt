My buddy and I have been at a conference at the Fluno Center from August 10-14.  Mon, tuesday of that week I went across the street to the Taco Bros at 12pm to try their tacos.  Each day their door was locked. I didn't understand because their hours clearly stated open at 11 daily. On wednesday I was excited to get some tacos because I saw someone had wrote a new review on that location on Monday August 10, and gave it 4-5 stars.  I gave the taco shop the benefit of the doubt thinking maybe their was an emergency or whatever.  On their website they seem to really enjoy making So Cal tacos and seemed like experienced guys who were proud of the food they served.  I decided to return.  It wasn't a big deal because it was right across the street.

The door was still locked and the lights off.  The hours of the door clearly state open daily at 11am.  My buddy went to the hairstylist next door to ask what's up with the Taco Bros and they said "No I don't think their closed but they are not open very often"

What's up with that? What sucks is that according to Yelp, there are no other 4-5 star taco joints downtown Madison. 

I am pretty sure I got the right location, the location was cross referenced on google, yelp, apple maps and their website and confirmed by the hairstylist.  

Sincerely,
Hard up for some tacos in Madison.
