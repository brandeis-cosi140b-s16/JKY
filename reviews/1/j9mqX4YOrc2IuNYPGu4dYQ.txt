As a loyal customer to this traditional Mexican restaurant, I brought my family over today to share with them some amazing food and a good time. Had I known it was going to take 3 1/2 hours to eat, I would've just gone to Roberto's. Knowing how busy they usually are on Sundays, I called ahead to put my name down on the list. We got sat almost immediately upon arrival and that was probably the best part of our experience. We sat and waited 35 minutes before alma took our order for the appetizer, 40 minutes to get the appetizer and almost another hour to put our food order in. Tables came in after us and left before us repeatedly. Long story short, service sucked and they get 1 star because the food was great. After I did NOT tip, waitress walked over to the front and told all her co workers and they all turned to stare, what they didn't know was how horrible she treated us. And as a small whole in the wall, she only had 3 tables to attend. It's a shame how great I thought of this place.
