Very clean and the staff is wonderful, but that's whee the good news ends. We have been there twice just to make sure. We had a different dish on each visit and sampled each others dish as well. So four different dishes on two visits and not one of them had any flavor in any item. The food is bland and of low quality. They wouldn't even be good at half the price. This was a waste of our time and money.
