I tried Taco Loco one Saturday afternoon a few months ago when I had one of my very rare, but very strong Mexican cravings (which really has more to do with having an early afternoon margarita then it does the cuisine).   The first offputting feature of this restaurant was the fact that I had to request, and then was subsequently charged, for what ended up being the most unimpressive set of chips and salsa I've ever had.  Since I wasn't impressed with the salsa, I ordered the guacamole hoping it would be better.  But to my great surprise,  I discovered what is likely the only guacamole on earth that does not make me want to grab a spatula and clean the bowl.  It is very difficult to spoil guacamole for me, but they did it with the garlicky-smokey-not quite sure if it's supposed to taste that way or not-flavor.  I was very sad about my chips and salsa/guacamole experience since that's usually my favorite part of "Mexican dining".  Well, that and the margaritas.  

The tacos were equally questionable as the guac. I believe I ordered the carnitas tacos and something about them was just....off.  Another reviewer mentioned old, wilted lettuce and I experienced the same thing, which just makes you wonder about the rest of the ingredients.  My husband ordered fish tacos and wasn't impressed either.  After tasting my carnitas tacos, I was really glad I hadn't ordered fish tacos.  That just seems like something that doesn't come out right too often, and here it could have been scary.   

As for the margarita, nothing sticks out in my mind other than the fact that I only ordered one, which probably means it was just, eh.  :-)  

We won't be back here.  There is now a much tastier, albeit "chainier", Mexican restaurant serving up scrumptious salsa, tasty tacos and mouthwatering margaritas right across the street.
