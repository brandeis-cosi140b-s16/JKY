Filthy restaurant, where are the health inspectors?..  We went mid day, the place was near empty, asked to sit outside, she said there was only one waitress out there so we couldn't, we asked for a booth, she said there wasn't enough in our party.  She sat us at a table in the middle of the restaurant surrounded by tables that hadn't been bussed, they were never bussed while we there.  My water glass had paper stuck inside the glass, the food was inedible.  We sent the cold fries back and they return with fries five minutes later just as cold.  We gave up and left, leaving most of our $50 meal uneaten.  Still felt sick afterwards...  Stay away from this place!
