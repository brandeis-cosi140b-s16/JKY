We have wanted to try this place for awhile. Yuk I can't even say it was american Mexican sad to say we would have been better with Taco Bell. The service was poor and the enchilada sauce tasted like cheap canned sauce. We love a good taco shop this is not it. My fianc√© says they should be arrested for pretending to be a authentic Mexican place lol. The shredded beef chimichanga woah they fried the lettuce in the burrito. Never again
