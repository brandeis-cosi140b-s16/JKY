Worst service ever experienced in the Tuke.  Food decent if you ever get the server to put it in.  Ordered 2 coors lites no less than 4 times with 4 different servers- all no shows.  Horrible service - no organization. First and last time!  Waitress admitted she was new and it was bad experience- come on mgt get it together!
