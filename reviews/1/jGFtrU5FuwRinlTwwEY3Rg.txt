Horrible. I only go in for tacos. But no more. They just have no flavor. And .99 cent Monday, tues. and wed. Are gone, witch makes them even less worth spending money on them. The last time I went was the last time for me. I ordered 3 tacos and asked for and paid for extra cheese. When I got home and opened them up, I realized I was ripped off. At best  a pinch of cheese. Just not worth the money or hassle.
