I have given this location so many chances and it always fails me! Lacks flavor (a lot) the rice is always dry and chicken is always over cooked so basically I always end up with a dry / bland burrito. Not to mention I ordered online at this location today and put in the notes "extra cheese and sour cream please" got home started eating and had big globs of cheese but not a drop of sour cream. Dry rice and chicken and guac had no seasoning. I will not give this location anymore chances. Closest to my house but i will now make the drive to the rural and baseline location where I am always satisfied and in heaven when I eat there.
