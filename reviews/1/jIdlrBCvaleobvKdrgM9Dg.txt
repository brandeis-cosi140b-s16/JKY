I used to like this place. Today i went for lunch and the price i paid ($7) for a 2 piece combo meal was waaaayyy over priced! The chicken pieces i got were tiny. More like half a thigh & leg. The black beans and veggie's  i used to love. THink they switched up the black beans brand and im not a fan. The veggies were hard, not steamed. Overall im disappointed with the changes. I dont think I'll be going there as often anymore
