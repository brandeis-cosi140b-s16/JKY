I was very disappointed with the churro "dessert". The description in the menu stated that it would be "fruit-filled", and served with a "chocolate dipping sauce". The dish arrived at our table last night and my husband and I just stared at in blankly for a second, no words, since it wasn't at all what we expected, and it was completely different than the menu description. There was absolutely no explanation given, but the churro had no fruit filling whatsoever (it was like a plain gas station churro) and no chocolate dipping sauce, just a drizzling of caramel. It tasted ok... But how can you say one thing in the menu and give something else? Probably not the best practice.
