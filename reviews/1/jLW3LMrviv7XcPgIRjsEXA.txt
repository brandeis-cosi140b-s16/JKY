I brought my family in for dinner, we eat here a lot since they opened this location, but we never have had the kind of service we received tonight. The girl at the counter, time was 7:00 pm, tried to ring me up for taquitos when I ordered 2 orders of the shredded beef crispy tacos. She then argued with me about it for several minutes, until she finally conceded that she made a mistake, at that point telling me I'd have to wait about 5 minutes for my tacos. When I finally got to dressing my tacos, the other girl (not the same one from before) put a sliver of meat into each shell, and gave me a look like I was wasting her time. When I asked for more meat, she looked behind her as if to get permission or something, and then proceeded to add a little more beef to my tacos. After dressing them with my requirement, I told her that the next set of tacos would be the same, and she acted like I was trying to get something for free. Her exact words were "did you pay for that?". I nodded yes, and she proceeded to heavy sigh and begin stuffing my tacos with the shredded beef, again leaving very little in the shells. I do speak a little Spanish, and I could hear them talking about me behind the counter. I will keep it clean here, but the term "stupid white boy" was uttered more than once. I expect a level of professionalism from the places I patronize, and these people were no where near that level. I love Zaba's, but I'm afraid I won't be back to this location. Very unprofessional, this is the quality you expect from American fast food restaurants. I never expected this from Zaba's. Very disappointed.
