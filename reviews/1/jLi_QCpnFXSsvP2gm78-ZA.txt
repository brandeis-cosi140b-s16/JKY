My group really, really wanted to love this place, due to its close location to our house. Unfortunately, the whole dinner was nothing but disappointments.

- Only one waitress for the entire dining room. Service was incredibly slow, drinks were not refilled, was attempted to be served someone else's dinner, then had to wait what seemed like forever to get our check. We had planned to get dessert but decided against it since service just took so long for everything. This was only partly the fault of our waitress, the establishment simply needs to hire more waitstaff.

- Sauces on our food tasted tinny like they had come from a can. When there are so many other options for Mexican food in the area, you need to make sure your sauces are good. I don't know if theirs is homemade or not, but it certainly didn't taste like it. My enchilada was super watery due to the sauce and skimpy filling on the inside. Not only that, but the flavor was bland too.

- One person at our table ordered a margarita. After he finally got it, he commented the taste was also bland and unimpressive.

With places like El Jalapeno and select chain restaurants nearby, Cuco's needs to step up its game. Stop cheaping out on service and the food. Until then, we will not be coming back.
