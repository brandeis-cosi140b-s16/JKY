I will never return to this place! The service was horrible the waitress was beyond rude and when I expressed to her the fact that I had never had such poor service and that I would not be returning she told me that that was fine...
She NEVER refilled my ice tea and when she filled my husbands she had an attitude. We went for the Friday fish fry. The family has been going for years. The food was cold when we got it and we had to wait 15 minutes for a fresh plate of fish. I guess that is one way to keep the customers  from eating to much of the all you can eat fish! The place was not busy so I can't place blame on that. She just didn't care!!!
