I live by this location unfortunately and I am continually disappointed here. I love chipotle's product and i hate to give them a bad review but this location is definitely the worst I've been to.

I go to chipotle to order hard tacos but half the time this location is out of the taco shells. This REALLY bums me out as i usually go in with an appetite for only hard tacos. Usually, i will reluctantly order something else instead but my last trip there i had to leave without ordering as i was tired of paying for something i didn't necessarily want. 

This is my first 1-star review on yelp as i usually only review places i love but im tired of making the trip out just to be disappointed and have to scramble through a lack of choices to find somewhere else to eat. Please either order more shells or stop being lazy and make more shells!
