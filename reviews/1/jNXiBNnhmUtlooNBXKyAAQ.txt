I ordered super nachos to go and paid with the credit card. When I reviewed my receipt at home I noticed the cashier took it upon herself to give herself a tip without my permission. This is considered theft and she should be fired and arrested for stealing from a customer. This is so unbelievable and I am beyond upset known this type of thing happens. The cashier knew there was no way I would catch it cause I didn't have to sign the receipt. Please be very careful if you visit the restaurant and have to pay with your credit or debit card.
