I didn't get my debit card back, the cashier ether stole it or handed it out to another customer.  When the manger came out she refused to look for it, apparently at her size checking the floor under the work station was more difficult than she wanted to deal with.  She stated the only thing they can do, is call the police and have the employee searched, but when I said ok lets do that, she back tracked and refused.  I have cancelled the card of course, but it is just a pain in the butt to deal with, plus the cashier an the manager were so rude and disrespectful about it. I remember when customers were supposed to be treated with respect.  DO NOT TRUST THESE PEOPLE WITH YOUR CARD!!
