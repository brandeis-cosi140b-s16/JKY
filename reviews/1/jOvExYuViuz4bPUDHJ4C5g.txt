If you like burdening staff by your presence, stale chips, dry chicken, cold rice and mildew flavored fountain drinks, then Jim's Burros is the place for you. Food used to be decent and now it's gross. If you plan to sit in the front patio area be sure to bring Raid spray to kill the spiders. I'm not sure this place will last in its current condition...
