Not satisfying at all

Chiliquilllies were plain nasty. Soggy chips with green sauce. Waste of $8

Beans have no flavor. No salt, no garlic, pepper or onions.

My cheese in the bean and cheese burrito wasn't melted. Nothing beats a Taco Bell bean burrito 

Shredded beef taco was the best.

Carne asada burrito was full of onions from guacamole and the meat chunks were chewy, tasteless and too big

The fresh salsa was made from  un ripened tomatoes, had no heat or cilantro 

Too bad the $8 per burrito locks you into buying the whole thing.

Casta rasa, round corner cantina and the taco stand in front of Reyna foods has way better casual tacos

They charge for chips and salsa. 

Chips look double fried because they are very greasyy

A waste of $35 and the food left a bad taste in our mouths
