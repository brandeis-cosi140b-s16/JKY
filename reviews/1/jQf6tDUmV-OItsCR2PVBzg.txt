I expect better from chipotle. There was six people in my party and we were all excited to eat here as we where coming from rocky point and decided not to eat in anywhere in between.   We got in line asked for green salsa and guess what???? NO GREEN SALSA!!!  Seriously???    Steak??? 4 min wait which I can understand as it happens but then I they forgot my nephews quesadilla.    We then go to the drink station and the water dispenser is loose, NO NAPKINS and then no kids for my drinks, I then go sit down and I have to clean my own table . Come on chipotle. Here is my assessment of this store.   Restaurant definitely seems understaffed and the only staff that is available is more worried about the back end. Get your act together. I'll be back again on Sunday and give this location a second chance.
