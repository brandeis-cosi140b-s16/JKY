I've been a loyal fan of Burrito Bandito  for Nine years, but I'm done now. It really used to be one of my favorite places, back when Steve owned it. I often said  " the only thing this place needs is to serve beer and it would be perfect" .
Now with a new owner,  its a bunch of kids jammin out to Slip Knot and Disturbed serving cold, over priced,  flavorless tacos.  RIP B.B.
