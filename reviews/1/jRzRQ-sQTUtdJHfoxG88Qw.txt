The first thing I has to say about this place is that it is NOT Mexican. They need to change the name of this place or something because this is not Mexican at ALL. 
I rally hate this place and about every single person in my Mexican family hated it. 
Every single one of them agree that it is not Mexican at all. 
Taco Bell would be more Mexican than this. I'm embarrassed of this place. 
I've eaten here 3 times and I hated everything. My parents hate it too and we couldn't even finish our meal. 
I have no idea how anyone could eat here. 
I eat almost anywhere and I hate making bad reviews but this place is just that bad.
If people like it then that's fine and all but I can't stand that it's called Mexican.
