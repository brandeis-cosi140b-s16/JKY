The food isn't all that great as I hoped it would. I ordered a steak burrito with pinto beans, brown rice, pico de gallo, sour cream, and cheese. The beans didn't taste fresh, the rice was a little hard, and the steak didn't look all that great either. I can honestly say the franchise Mexican grills taste better.
