UGH.

One, they don't honor groupons or restaurant.com certificates on any happy hour items. Two, the food is definitely not the best Mexican in the area. There are far better places within a block or two. 

It's overpriced and definitely not easy on the stomach. We had margaritas, beer, the chicken nachos, and some 1/2 taco baskets. Today, all three of us have some serious stomach issues. The nachos were large (and for $15 they should be) but they had cheese, onions, refried beans, jalapenos, chicken, and sour cream. We had to ask a number of times to get our salsa refilled (there was never enough, and only one brought each time). The tacos didn't taste like much, just deep-fried shells without much flavor.

The ONLY thing I liked was that refried beans are served with the salsa and chips. 

Go anywhere else.
