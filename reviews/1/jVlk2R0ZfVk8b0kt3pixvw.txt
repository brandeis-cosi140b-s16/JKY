This place is just terrible. Although it appears clean inside, the servers were inattentive and seemed to all hate each other.

There are virtually no vegetarian options. I ordered a veggie quesadilla. When it finally came out, I unfolded the 5" tortilla to find uncooked onions, wilted lettuce, cheese, and a small smear of guacamole. I didn't even take a bite. I took it back to the counter and asked for my money back. I was so disappointed. 

I should say that I am very thankful they were willing to give me my money back, but I will never go there again. Not worth it.
