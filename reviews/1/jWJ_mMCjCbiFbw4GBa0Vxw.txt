An overall lackluster experience. The chips, salsa and beans were good - however there were three of us studly men there for lunch and the chips didn't last long. The empty basket remained for a while, but eventually was refilled. 

I went with the spinach enchilada lunch special with rice & beans. It was average. The waitress was cute and that was a plus, but she was also slow. It took a little long to get the food, too long to refill the chips and too long for the check. 

I would definitely avoid a special trip to come here, but if I were at the Arizona Mills and wanted to eat somewhere that wasn't the food court and not the Rainforest Cafe, I guess it would be this place...
