We walked in on a Tuesday night with our child. The Yelp info said it was kid friendly. It most certainly was not. We felt like we walked into an American Apparel ad or an Of Montreal concert. The place was packed with 18-24 year-old drunk kids.  The only things missing: face paint and glow sticks.

We had about a 15 min wait. As we were being taken to our seats, one of the waitresses said, "Who brings their baby to a restaurant?'  To which I replied, "We do, you ass!"  Nothing like a 22-year-old punk with a holier-than-thou attitude trying to ruin your night!

The food was only mediocre.  We all agreed that the tacos were overly greasy and all kind of had the same flavor.  Margaritas are margaritas.  The "empanadas" were not empanadas I have ever had.  They most resembled empanada-shaped eggrolls.  The best part of the meal was the chips and salsa. They also charge extra for a refill of the salsa.  I've always thought it was lame to charge extra for a condiment.

Overall, the food is not bad for a cheap Taco Tuesday.  I'd keep the kiddo at home next time. However, If I decide to bring her somewhere it will be my decesion and not up for review by some blond, jerk-off waitress...thank you very much. I give it one star because of the rude staff (even just that one girl). I don't have time for poor service and bad attitudes when I am paying for food that I can make better at home.
