I love the food here and always have but my last visit had the worst service I have experienced anywhere in a long time. Waited an hour for our food which if it were busy would be understandable. We were the only people on the dining side. After seeking out our server for our food it came out and was served to us cold. We knew it had been sitting there because the order obviously went in when the server entered into their iPad. We had to then seek out a server for our check and proceeded to wait 20 mins for the original server to bring it to us. When your meal ends up being $140 you would expect to have at least decent service. 

Really disappointing after we raved about Los Dos to the friend we brought along. We expressed our frustrations and the server returned a blank stare. It's sad because since the food is good they really don't have any incentive to change their service practices.
