Not very good. I'm a foodie. And I happened to have a ravenous appetite which should have masked even mediocre food. I ordered the chimichanga and it was blah.  Thick doughy crust and minuscule amounts of pulled pork. The rice was was large grained white unseasoned rice and tasted like it had been in an unsealed cardboard box absorbing surrounding odors. The refried beans were plain.  It was just a pretty poor quality meal for the $12.59 airport price tag.
