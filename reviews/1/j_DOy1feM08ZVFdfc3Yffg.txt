Can this place get any more disgusting? I sure hope not. First impressions are always lasting ones and I can tell you this was the final time for me dining at this pollo loco. Not being able to find a clean spot to sit at in a somewhat empty dining room, not good. I can say we must've just missed the lunch hour rush, because the place was not crazy busy. I'm talking every table was filthy, full of food. Not only the tables but the floors. Literally every table had food caked beneath it. It looked as if a 1 year old child got a hold of the food and threw it everywhere. We were there for a good 30 minutes and not once did any of the employes come out to wipe the tables or sweep the floors. All I could think of was if its this filthy in the front, I can only imagine how filthy the food prep area is. Called the manager and he gave a lame excuse about not being to mop because it was unsafe at that time. Hmmmmm have they ever heard of a broom? Wiping tables down to make sure there is a clean table for your patrons to sit is the "safe" and sanitary thing to do for your customers. The lack of cleanliness was just the beginning, the final straw was the hair in my daughters chicken. See ya pollo loco.
