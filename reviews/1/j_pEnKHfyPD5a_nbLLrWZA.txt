This is the second time this has happened. We ordered a burrito to go and used my debit card, today i saw that once again the charge was for EXACTLY 2.00 more than I signed for. This happened a month ago which is why I haven't gone in there but today my kid wanted a burrito. 
I should file a dispute over this but I want to warn you, make sure you don't pay 10.00 for a single burrito, no extras no nothing. 
Maybe we wont go back again...... I may turn this into local media as well.
