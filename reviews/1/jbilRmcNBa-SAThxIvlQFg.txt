I would of given it 5 stars but the owner of the location seem really rude with her employees and Me and My group. The food itself wasn't that great either for the time we had to wait and when they made a mistake with one of the orders instead of giving Me another dish, they tried to fix the one they made the mistake with thinking I wasn't gonna notice it was the same one.
