Wow- another Phoenix area Mexican food disappointment. Went here on my way back from the airport. I was told I had to try this place near the airport- "looks  like a dive, but the food is awesome." Nope- the food tastes like how the place looks.

I ordered a chicken "burro" dinner- which is a burrito in this part of Phoenix I guess. It had boiled, "runny" chicken and some salsa in it. The chicken water was running down my hands as I tried to eat it and all over the table. The beans and rice were good- but not the best. The chips were okay- again not the best- and served in a bag with a tie around the top, like buying some chips form the grocery store. (I prefer warm chips) The red hot sauce was very good, though. The staff was pleasant. 

I think this place has more of a cult following than food that is good. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I went to a similar concept restaurant in Mesa- Backyard Tacos- and it was in different league than this place.

Oh- the place is worse than a dive. (physical building)  I don't know why the city doesn't condemn the inside of this place. I've been to many dives- but this was a sub-dive. Please someone tell me a good Mexican restaurant in Phoenix. 2 years and still haven't found one....
