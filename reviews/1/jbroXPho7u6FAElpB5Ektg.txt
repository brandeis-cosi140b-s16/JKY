The Filberto's I am reviewing for is the same company, but located at the corner of Chandler Blvd and Kyrene. It is new so I could not find that location on Yelp.

So I recently moved to Chandler for a few months on an internship, from Southern California. So I know about good Mexican food. When I got here at 6:30pm on a Sunday night, I was the only customer. No more customers came in while I was here. I ordered two chiles rellenos for about $6. 
When the food arrived, there were two giant chiles rellenos covered in red sauce, cheese, pico de gallo, and guacamole and sour cream. They looked amazing. When I took a bite, the food was cold. Not room temperature cold, actually cold like they took the box out of the refrigerator. I figured it might just be the toppings, so I took a few bites deep down, and it was cold all the way through to the peppers. I took the box to the front, and the cashier gave it to the chef. They began to argue in Spanish. Unbeknownst to the chef, I speak some Spanish myself. He was saying that the customer should just take it home and reheat it, cause they don't have a microwave. Finally, he decided to throw the dish on the grill to try to reheat it, which any chef should know will causes chiles rellenos to fall apart. I guess they didn't have a toaster oven, convection oven, or salamander either. They informed me they would make me new ones.

Now, surprisingly, the first set of chiles rellenos actually had a very good flavor, for what I could perceive through the cold temperature. This second set they gave me were nearly burnt, crisped to a dark brown. They were about half the size of the first two, and had almost no cheese. The guacamole was cut way down in quantity. I must note though that they were hot.

So in a nutshell, do not ever go to this chain. Their recipes may be good, but they hire terrible chefs with terrible service. It is unfortunate this chain dominates the Chandler-tempe area for Mexican food.
