I started eating at this location about 2 years ago in January 2008.  I was a regular and ate here about 2 times a week for 2.5 months.  The next thing I knew, I had hepatitis A.  It was pretty horrible. I was sick for a little over a month.  The doctor said that I probably caught it from someone handling food who was infected.  The only place that I started going to that was new, was this Chipotle. I'm just saying, I'll never eat here again because I'm 90% sure this is where I got it from.
