I really wanted to only give this restaurant a half star, but Yelp does not allow that. To begin, I don't even know how this place has 4 stars and falls under "Mexican food." I arrived at this place under the false pretense  that I could get some decent Mexican food. How wrong I was. First, I thought we would receive chips and salsa when the water came out, but I was wrong that would be at an additional $3. I ordered a bean and cheese burrito with red sauce. While you would think this would be an easy ask it seemed to be very difficult to do. While the server was very nice in getting this done the burrito was HORRIBLE! The beans tasted as if they were thrown from the can to the stove for about 2 min and then out to us. The rice was crunchy and did not taste like regular spanish rice. Needless to say I will not be back for Mexican food.
