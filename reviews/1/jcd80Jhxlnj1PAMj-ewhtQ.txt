Despite the negative reviews, I gave this place a shot....Basically because I was craving mezi food and I was starving. I ordered the carne asada burrito and chips and salsa. 

The food overall was not even mediocre. The burrito was tiny! Similar to those littlle miniature .49 cent bean and cheese burritos that del taco used to serve. Only these little morsels are about $8.00.

Then I dove into the chips and salsa, which were $1.99. The salsa was served in a decent sized cup and it was pretty good. As for the chips, they were horrific. God awful. It was obvious they came out of a bag and they were stale and full on salt licks.

Then I tried the rice and beans.... Rice was okay and the beans were out of a can and cold. 

I can't wait to get home to Orange County and have real mezi food.... However, this flight may be spent in restroom with Mr. Montezuma!
