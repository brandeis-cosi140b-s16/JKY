We were on the run last weekend and we had to drive thru the taco bell for breakfast, the sausage burrito was listed as 1.29 on the menu outside but it rang up $ 2.29, when we questioned the difference, she told us the menu was wrong, I told her I would pay the MENU price, and not what her register rang it up as, she seemed huffy that we called her on it. Sadly enough we will never venture there again, based on this MANAGER'S attitude!
