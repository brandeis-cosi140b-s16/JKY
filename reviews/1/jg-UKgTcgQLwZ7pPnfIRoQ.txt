Thought I'd give this place a try with 3.5 stars considering that was the best option I had. First of all, they have no idea what Gluten is...being a national chain in Las Vegas(all types of people coming & going). So after I painstakingly worked through that discussion with the manager I placed my order, they called it surf & turf but it was really just a couple of lackluster, soggy tacos. They had way too much sauce on both tacos and overall just not very good. The reason for the 1* is that they served me cold retried beans with my crappy tacos. I would just dodge this food court all together.
