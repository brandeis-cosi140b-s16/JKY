No matter how good the food is, when the waiter is an obnoxious twit who cannot be bothered to do his job? Here you go.

I was stuck in a corner: the plight of the solo diner. My server took ten minutes to even show up, in this half empty restaurant. Barely a glance and NO WATER. I haven't seen him since.

Forget the entree, forget a second glass of wine. I just want out of this disaster.
