Worst Happy Hour. EVER. In fact, my group of friends labeled it our "Friday UNHAPPY Hour".

1. The music is INSANELY loud, prohibiting a normal conversation even if the person is sitting right next to you. 
2. The DJ is absolutely TERRIBLE.
3. While the free food concept is great......it was all kinda gross.
4. The server acted like she was doing us a favor.
5. The mix of people is really odd and kinda creepy. Old creeper men, weird ghetto younger men, and just a few of us business types. Really not the scene for a happy hour with business associates or 'sophisticated' friends.

The ONLY good thing I have to say is that they can't mess up tequila.
