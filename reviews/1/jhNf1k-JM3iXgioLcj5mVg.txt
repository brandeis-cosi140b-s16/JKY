I went here for lunch today because I love their food.  However, I was really disappointed when the waiter cheated me and my friend out of our money.  I asked for a margarita (while looking at the specials menu which was $5.99).  He asked if I wanted a fresh margarita and I said yes, while looking at the specials menu.  Next, when we ordered our meal I said I want a lunch special $5.99 (substitute the tostada for an enchilada).  And my friend said the same.  We got our check.  He charged me for a regular margarita ($12) and both of us for a more expensive meal (close to $9).  When I complained about the drink he said I told you about the FRESH margarita.  I was like you saw me looking at the specials you should have explained the difference in price.  I did not realize the difference in price for my meal until I got home.  They are thieves.  Do not go here unless you want to be tricked into spending more money than you expect.
