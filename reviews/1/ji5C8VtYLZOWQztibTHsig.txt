I had the WORST experience at Caldero! We were the ONLY customers in the entire restaurant, but it took forever to get any service. We waited 10 minutes to get our chips, another 10 minutes just for water, another 20 minutes to place our order, and almost an entire hour to get our entrees. We were a large group of 17, but the wait was ridiculous. Good thing I had cash on hand - they probably would have  taken another 20 minutes to run my debit card. Never again will I return to this restaurant!!!
