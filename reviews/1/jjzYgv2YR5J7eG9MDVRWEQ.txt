First of all, the poor woman the owner has at the front desk is so old she can barely move. 
I stood there for almost ten minutes, in front of the register before someone said anything to me.
Their prices are ridiculous for the portion sizes I was seeing.
I asked the woman if I could have chicken put in a reano and she proceeded to scoff at me and that's where it all started.
She (I'm assuming she is the owner) was beyond rude.
The reano is 7.99 and she wanted to charge me 14 dollars to have the reano and a side of chicken .
I walked out.
Not only were they rude but their service is HORRIBLE.
