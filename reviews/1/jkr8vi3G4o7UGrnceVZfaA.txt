So they claim to be open till 11pm. We just walked in at 10:14 and we're greeted at the door with "I'm sorry we already did last call just a little bit ago and we are gunna close a little early." There were at least 15 people still in the restaurant and closing a little early doesn't mean doing last call an hour before you close. How unprofessional and just plain bad service. I understand it's tuesday and everyone wants to go home but you decided to be in the service industry. Needless to say we won't ever be back to support this place.
