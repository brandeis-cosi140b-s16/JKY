The restaurant is clean and open. The food...
My wife: "nothing special ", my dad "do you see any fish in my fish tacos?" Then when we left he said 'make sure you write the review as horrible'. As for my meal: the ceviche tostada had a funny flavor I wasn't used to so I couldn't eat it, which in turn made me not want to eat my flautas, and I was really wanting flautas. I did eat one and it was nothing special just shredded beef that was dry in a flour tortilla then deep fried.  Will not be returning or recommending.
