It's so sad that a place with delicious food has such horrible service.  

I went Sunday for the second time.  The waitress was either new or had no idea what she was doing.  When she greeted us she took our drink orders and a side order of guacamole then asked if we knew the new prices.  We said no and then she said she's be back.  Never told us anything about the prices?  

Then we ordered fajitas for two. Took about 20 minutes before the bus boy asked us if we needed anything and we needed our guacamole.  Luckily they serve you the tortillas and salsa....Even longer after waiting another waitress brought the beans,rice, lettuce plate for the fajitas.  Before our appetizer was even made.  Then our waitress brought out our guacamole and made it and didn't bring us more tortillas.  So we had the fajita sides and guacamole just sitting until she brought our chicken and steak fajitas.  She finally brought over the tortillas and I had to ask for the fajita wraps. Now the fajitas are delicious and the food is aways good but it took well close to 2 hours for our dinner.

Service and management needs worked on because there are many other Mexican Cantinas in the area that have awesome service and kind workers. 

The bus boy was the only one who seemed to care and he did an amazing job helping everyone else out and being kind and caring to the customers!
