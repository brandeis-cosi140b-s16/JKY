We have been to this filibertos many times in the past with good service and great food however today ( which by the way will be our last time ) the food was really bad, we ordered supreme nachos, shredded beef taco and a I think a chicken taco ( I ordered a grilled chicken taco which the lady at the registered repeated back when she took our order ) all I can say is what a disappointment .......
