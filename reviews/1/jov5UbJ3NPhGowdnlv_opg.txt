Waste of time coming here for lunch!  Came in with three co-workers on our lunch break and service was horrific!  We immediately asked for extra bean dip.  Our waitress, Stephanie, took our drink order and said she'd be back to take our food orders even tho we were ready to order right then.  She proceeded to go behind the bar and make some drinks and ring some orders and check on other customers.  She finally came back with our drinks but no bean dip.  We waited and waited and waited for her to come take our orders and finally had to ask to get someone else to serve us.  This turned out to be the manager.  We had ordered four lunch specials and one to go.  After waiting some more she came back and said we could get the to go order only at full price so we declined.  We finally got more chips and salsa from our original waitress who brought two of everything even attitude.  By this time we had been waiting for at least 30 min since the manager had supposedly put our order in.  We got up and asked for the manager again since at this point we were running late for work.  She's nowhere to be found until we get up to leave.  She comes out with our food as we're half way out the door saying "they tried their best"!  No apology.  She offered to box it up but for what full price since the special is full price to go!? No thanks cuz they probably spit in it anyway!
