Stopped by for a quick lunch on a Sunday.  Parking lot didn't have many cars.  Now I know why.  This place needs a good cleaning (inside and out).  Parking lot had trash everywhere.  I had to wipe the table off with a napkin before I could sit down.  Staff didn't seem too interested in working if you know what I mean.  Management must have taken the day off.  I won't be back ... Ever.
