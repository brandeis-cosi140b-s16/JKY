Wanna be Chipotle with rude servers behind the counter. Food sucks, staff sucks. Coulda had our business but the rude attitudes pushed us away. Never again. If I was the airport I'd fire em and replace em with a McDonald's. How dare a service oriented business treat customers so poorly. It's a wonder they ever lasted this long with only 2 stars.  It's a black stain on the airports reputation.  So sad!!! 12/18 @ 4:41. If ur the owner I'd fire everyone on duty. Every employee started arguing with the customer. Just sad!!!
