I don't know where to start, I'm just glad it ended. WORST Mexican food I have had in a while and the service was atrocious. 

Now, most place Mexican places have a little chips and salsa to get you started, but this place didn't. That was OK though, because it was lunch and I didn't want much. It should have been an indicator of what was to come.

After about 10 minutes a waitress finally came over and I ordered a three item combo because I wanted to try a sampling of their fare. I'm glad I did because I don't think I could have eaten a whole plate of one food item. The enchilada had terrible sauce (possibly previously frozen), the carne asada taco was the smallest ever and the tamale was as bland as can be. Beans were awful, but I can say that the rice was OK, but that's about it. Oh, the tomato was great though! 

So, I finished what I could manage to and started to finish reading the CityLife mag I got on the way in while I waited for the check to come. Well, I read the WHOLE THING and never saw anyone! I got up and went up to the counter to pay. I saw why my check never came. The WHOLE staff was standing around laughing and texting. No wonder!

I paid the bill and left without a tip and I ALWAYS tip at least 15%, sometimes 10% if the service is really bad. Ouch!

Needless to say I won't be back because there are plenty of great Mexican food establishments in the area.
