Worst chipotle experience I've had. Waited forever in a not so long line. Asked for medium salsa and they put hot on it. Sweet tea was out when I got my drink cup and I asked them to refill it and it never got refilled while I was there. Chips were stale. A/C unit was leaking and dripped on me. Very dissatisfied with this chipotle. It is one of my favorite restaurants and this one let me down big time...
