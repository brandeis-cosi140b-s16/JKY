ROACHES!!!???!!!! 

We always loved this restaurant (despite the usually slow service) but May 1st 2013 will have been our last time ever eating here. 

I am a couple months pregnant, my 6 year old son and my husband were given our entrees and as I leaned over for my second bite of fajitas I see a roach hanging out on  the table between my dinner plate and my fajita platter! 

My husband scooped it up with a napkin. We all just sort of froze out of disbelief! When the waiter stopped by a few moments later, my son announced there had been a roach on our table. My husband discreetly handed him (Mario) the napkin. He didnt seem too frazzled by this. 

Mario informed us that the owner have been spending a lot of money trying to fix their bug problem! Umm??? Hello??? They know they have a serious problem and they are still serving costumers??? 

I left the table and went to the car. When my husband showed up I asked him what they did or said about this. He said they gave us 3 dollars off our meal! Wow, thanks! 

There is a call being put into the health dept. on this issue. ROACHES and food dont mix!!!!
