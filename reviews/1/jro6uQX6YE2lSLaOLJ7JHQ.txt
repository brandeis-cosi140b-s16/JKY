Yuck!! If I wanted store bought Ortega taco shells I would have made my tacos at home. How can you advertise that you are a Mexican Food Restaurant and sell pre made taco shells. The beef was dry and nasty. The service was horrible. The server took my order and dropped off the food. I should have ordered from the outside window. I still gave her an undeserved tip. I will say that their breakfast burrito with chorizo is good. I will not be back.
