I would not recommend this place to anyone.  The food is not what everyone else makes it out to be.  The restaurant owner really seems to like it though because they charge an arm and a leg for the lame entrees. 

We were told by our server that we could not have any custom orders.  All we asked for was an additional enchilada on a  children's plate.  This request was way too complex for anyone at the restaurant to execute.  STAY AWAY!!  My family and I will never return.  It's a shame because we live within walking distance.
