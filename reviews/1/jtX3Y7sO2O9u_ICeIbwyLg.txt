I would not feed their food to starving ethiopian child. I ordered the chilis rellenos. It was a bowl full oil to start. The batter on the chilis had the texture of soggy bread. The chilis themselves had the consistency of tire that was filled with mozzarella and corn. I am about 90% positive they were frozen to start and just placed in a bowl and microwaved. The overall consensus of the group of 6 I was with was the same or worse. I was nauseated by the smell of my brothers fish which could smelled over the entire patio which was similar to the smell of a tackle box. Everyone is is basing their review off the patio seating but there was nothing more special about it other than the fact it was outside. The most genuine thing there was the mr. Pibb and my discontent.My favorite part of the meal was excusing myself from the table and smoking a cigarette. Even the margaritas and chips and salsa were subpar...didnt know that was plausible. Go to taco bell...
