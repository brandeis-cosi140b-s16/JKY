Ugh.  

This isn't Rivas Mexican Food--it's Torres Mexican Food now, and we seriously wish we never went.

My burro was mediocre at best--absolutely no depth of flavor.  It was like one a large version of one of those frozen, microwaveable burritos from 7-11.  My wife's and daughter's chile relleno plates were actually awful--they left the seeds inside the chiles, making them much too hot.  My daughter is Mexican in heritage and grew up on good homemade Mexican food from her Nana.  For her to complain that the food made her mouth feel like it was on fire really says something.  Even the jamaica was no good--really too sweet.

The final straw came with my bathroom visit.  It smelled like there was a natural gas leak in the men's room.  There was no soap, no paper towels, and the toilet paper roll had bloody fingerprints on it.

Yup, you read that right.  Grossed my ass out.  We are all seriously hoping we don't get sick now.  Never again.
