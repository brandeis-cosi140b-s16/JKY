El Enconto
August 5, 2015
Bad service, good quesadillas, and very clean.

On August 5, 2015 I went to El Enconto.
 I ordered quesadilla and a flan. If you go to El Enconto I recommend you don't order a flan. My bill got mixed up. It was partly our fault because our group arrived at different times and it was confusing. So... if you go in a group all of you should have the same bill.

Overall it was a bad experience. I don't want to go back soon!
