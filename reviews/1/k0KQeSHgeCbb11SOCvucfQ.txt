What we received were cold  burnt chicken.  They were as black as they could be and they were not even warm.  They were not helpful at all because they were about to close.  Well, we paid full price.  What more do you need to know? Of course they didn't give us any refund.... as expected.

 Update: The corporate contacted us and also we spoke with the general manager at the store and he was very apologetic. We received a refund.
