I would give this place no stars for the service I just recieved. I come here all the time with my family and today went to have lunch place was not to busy when we got there got sat down hostess was very friendly got out chips from the hostess then just sat and sat. People started to come in for lunch and the waitresses got there drink orders and food and still nothing for us over 15 minutes just sitting there with our menus and not one waitress said anything to us . No drink no I will be with you in a minute nothing!! As I was finally fed up with everyone around us getting there drinks and food orders I left. I told the manager how we were treated and walked out. I have never had such terrible service at a resteraunt. And we eat out every weekend.  They just lost a loyal customer !!
