What a change from the previous location.  This place is set up a lot like Matta's.  You order your food, pay for it, and it is brought out to you.  Chips and salsa - are you kidding me you have to pay for chips and salsa.  The utensils are the cheap plastic forks and knives you buy at the dollar store.  Service is almost non-existent.  You had a great business I hope this new business model survives.  I won't be going back.
