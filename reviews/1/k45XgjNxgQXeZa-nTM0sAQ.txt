I'm literally obsessed with chipotle but this location wasn't very professional. My boyfriend and I went today 11/29/15 at 5:30 and I went and ordered a steak bowl and it was at the bottom of the steak and wasn't a lot left. Steak didn't look appetizing at all. Asked her if they were making new steak and she look annoyed and said "no, there's enough" then scooped half a scoop in my bowl. Asked for a "tiny bit" more and she just looked at me and ignored my request. Then as we were paying they brought out new steak. I asked the friendly cashier if I could have a small cup of the new steak since I got barely any and it didn't look appetizing and he was nice enough and got some for me. As he was getting it, she looked annoyed at him and was like "that's for you right?!" And when he explained it was for me she looked at me and rolled her eyes.... Rude.
