It has been 6 years since I last went here, almost to the day, and not much has changed besides the staff. We went here right at lunch time and were surprised to see just one, little old couple sitting in the dining room staring at us like "what are you doing here?!!!" The staff behind the counter immediately pounced like they were bored to tears. I ordered the same exact thing I ordered six years ago. A veggie burrito with brown rice, black beans, corn salsa, guacamole, and lettuce. My dining companion ordered the barbacoa burrito with everything on it. 

I love second chances bro. For me, for you, for everybody unless you murdered someone. However, Burrachos second chance went down the tubes. The burritos were not good. The guacamole was mushy and bland, the corn salsa was just heat, no flavor to the rice or beans, the lettuce had that nasty, bitter taste to it that makes you go TING! as your eye twitches, Neither of us finished our burritos, and that is pretty serious. 

Now some of you might be saying "well you didn't get any cheese or sour cream on yer burrito!" and you'd be right. Homey don't play that. But know this, I can go to Chipotle and get the same exact burrito, and it is just soooooo good that I forget that dairy even exists. This just isn't the case at Burrachos.
