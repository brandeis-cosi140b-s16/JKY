Let me say this up front:  I **LOVE** Chipotle.  I eat it at home, I eat it on the road for business.  Sometimes I will eat it twice a day.  I've eaten the "secret menu" items like the fabled quesorito.  I've eaten it all over the country -- after Chick Fil A, it is hands-down my favorite fast food/fast casual concept.

That being said ... this is unquestionably the worst-managed Chipotle I've ever been to (and lucky me, it's my neighborhood store).

How on earth can they be out of ingredients so often??  And I'm not talking like "hey, do you happen to have cilantro for that?"  No, this is like "sorry, we are out of chicken."  WHAT!?!  CHICKEN!?!

And not just once.  This has happened multiple times.  Tonight it was barbacoa and mild salsa.  Seriously ... "we are out of mild salsa."  Said no Mexican restaurant, ever.  Except Chipotle-Matthews.

This place is perpetually understaffed, and it makes me want to not come here because they have done the unthinkable and ruined a near-perfect product that requires all the brain power of pushing a button on a copy machine to get me to a point of perfect customer satisfaction.

Zero stars, @$$ clowns.  ZERO.
