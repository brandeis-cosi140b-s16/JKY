I wish there was something to write about here . I was imagining walking in that I'd be able to enjoy my love for Chipotle style burritos & bowls with a little Hawaiian flare - but a presence of flare there was not. The staff was emotionless and lifeless , just like the food. The best thing I ate was a cranberry agave sauce that I was given to me when i asked for HOT sauce. It was super sweet but wasn't even close to what I was asking for. I would never recommend this place . Save the money and just hit Aloha Kitchen.
