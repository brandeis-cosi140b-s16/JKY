Ok, let me tell you this: ANYBODY WHO RATED THIS PLACE 5 STARS COULD NOT HAVE EATEN AT AN AUTHENTIC TAQUERIA...EVER. Because if they did, they would have easily ripped this place. I mean, c'mon, they throw some so-so carne or what they call carnitas into a tortilla, throw a pinch of cilantro & spoon a little guac and call that a taco? The carne asada was salty and I've made better carnitas in the oven. They didn't even use the "real" chico tortillas and they were single, not doubled up, like every other taqueria I've ever been to in my whole life! The salsa bar was ehhh ok...I guess...But I just couldn't get over how half assed their tacos were. For a place that calls themselves a "Taco shop", I expected a helluvalot more. I guess it's cool that they're open 24 hrs, if you can't think of anywhere else to eat...At least the coconut paleta was good...
