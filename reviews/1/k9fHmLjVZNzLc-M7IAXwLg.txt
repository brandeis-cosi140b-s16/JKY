I went through the line and ordered the "mission," one of their "signature" burritos. The employee then tried to charge me extra for EACH INDIVIDUAL item normally included in the burrito on top of the normal $8.99 price. So this was turning into a $18.00 burrito bc she was trying to charge me twice for everything that was listed on the menu. She made a huge deal out of it and called her manager and pretty soon every employee was crowded around staring at me. And then the manager backed up the employee. So I walked out and they lost a customer. 

Too bad, because I was hoping this would be my go-to place, since I work nearby.
