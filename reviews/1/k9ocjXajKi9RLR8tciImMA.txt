My visit to this place was not only disappointing, but it made me sad to think that this place would probably go the way of Planet Hollywood in a year or two. I had the Carnitas and I had to cut (or should I say SAW) into it with a knife and fork. My friend's crab enchiladas were underwhelming. I was heartbroken that yet another famous Latino is slapping his name on a "brand" that will probably fail instead of actually checking out the food and making sure it's edible. Very beautiful decor, and nice (but not terribly sharp) staff is about the only thing I can say about this one.
