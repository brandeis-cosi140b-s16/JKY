Very disappointed but will give a pass.  After a phenomenal first experience two weeks ago at the new location in East Liberty, our second experience was the complete opposite.  I know its still in the soft opening phase but things need to turnaround pretty quickly.  The service was horrible.  It started with no wine glasses and went downhill from there.  the guacamole was almost inedible and the queso was also not very good.  My friends meal was missing two ingredients and they had to bring them on the side.  All of our meals were very dry.  Nothing about the meal was very good.  The waiter couldn't answer any questions because he kept saying he was "vegan".  He also ran the same credit card through twice.  I know they are still working out the kinks but things need to improve quickly for this location to succeed.  We will go back but will be waiting for this to happen
