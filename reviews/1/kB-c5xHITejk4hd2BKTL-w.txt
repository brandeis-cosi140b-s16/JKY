I went to this restaurant to order a half order of super nachos. After I got through approximately half of them,  I found a black pubic hair with the root still attached. It indicated that it may have been placed in my food on purpose. Even if it wasn't, I'm so disgusted that I'll never eat there again. And I'm so disappointed because I really like their food. This happened on Tuesday, August 18, 2015. I don't know if a health inspector has visited, but after my bad experience, I have to question whether one should visit there. It's obvious that washing hands and wearing gloves aren't top priority. I just hope I don't get sick from this.
