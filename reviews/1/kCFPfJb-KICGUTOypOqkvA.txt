Customer service and food presentation was great, but none of it tasted very good. I have a stomachache after eating only a few bites of the chimichanga. Also ordered sopes, a breakfast burrito, and quesadilla. It all tasted really similar, like the oil they used was bad or something. Really disappointing, because the food looked awesome but did not live up to my expectations, especially with all these great reviews.
