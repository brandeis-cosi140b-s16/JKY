I had heard this place had really good food...unfortunately we didn't get a chance to try it.  I could not believe the way the MANAGER treated me.  I am not the person to clam it was because of my race but when 3 other families were sat before mine, and I was the only one who didn't speak Spanish, it left me wondering.
