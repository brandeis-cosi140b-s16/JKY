We decide to stop by last night and give this new restaurant a  try. We stood at the counter for several minutes and were not greeted by a host or server. There was a staff meeting in the bar area and they paid us no attention. We left without being acknowledged by any employee.  With all of the excellent mexican restaurants in town, we probably wont bother with another attempt.
