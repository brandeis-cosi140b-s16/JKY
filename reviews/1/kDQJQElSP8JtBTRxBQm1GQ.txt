While I applaud your efforts to clean up your menus, I am completely disgusted with the way the employees treat others. Case in point, while driving up to you restaurant, last Thursday, your employee gunned past me to cut me off and hit his breaks, at the red turn signal, on Rock Springs. This caused me to hit my breaks, and have my groceries spill out of the bags. The light turned green, and off he drove into the parking lot and walked right on in to work. I took a picture of his car, because he needs to be made aware of his careless behavior. I chose to go to In n Out burger, instead. I am keeping what I would really like to say out of this only as a professional courtesy to your company. I will not step one foot in this location, ever.
