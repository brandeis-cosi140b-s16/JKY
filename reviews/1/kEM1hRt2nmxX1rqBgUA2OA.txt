Every 5 months or so I end up here, not because I really want to but because I don't have time to go somewhere else better.  Each time I eat here it reminds me of why I avoid it in the first place.  

I've tried several things on the menu and basically everything is horrible.  By far the worst thing is their rice.  Its a real problem for a Mexican place when I (who is not Mexican) makes better Mexican rice than they do.  It is oily, without any flavor and today it was undercooked - meaning it was still hard.  Disgusting.  

Its a real shame that a place like Carolina's isn't in this location - you know a place that actually makes enjoyable food.  

Do yourself a favor and make the drive to Carolina's or El Commadore, but if you don't have time for that, grab a microwave burrito at the Circle K and it will be better than this place.
