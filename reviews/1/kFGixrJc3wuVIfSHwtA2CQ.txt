Teresa should not be allowed to be a manager at any restaurant!!!!  I called to complain about the food, prices and service and she told me quote: "If you want it better than go to another restaurant"  Who says that about a place that they manage?????  She wouldn't let me get a word in edge wise and then hung up on me!!!  We got a carne asada plate, green chili burrito and 3 tamales which by the way came enchilada style which we didn't know was served that way and wasn't stated on the menu that they were served that way and when the server brought them to the table she said "that's how they come" and refused to take them back and bring us tamales plain.  We also had to keep asking for refills and she never bothered to come check on us.  The place wasn't busy at all and the servers were just standing around talking and for the little bit that we got our bill was $43!!!  Seriously???  We will never, ever go there again and if you were wise you wouldn't either!!  There's plenty of other places in town to get good Mexican food!! STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
