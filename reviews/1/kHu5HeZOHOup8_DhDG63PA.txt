I have heard so many fantastic things about Julio's Too, so I was really excited to try it today. I was so disappointed though!! I ordered the lunch special K which was a tasteless green corn tamale with rice and beans. The tamales was flat out horribly bland, even the melted cheese on top was bland. I ordered a fish taco since I didn't like the original plate ordered... what a waste!!! It was just a (not-battered) fried fish filet on corn tortillas with cabbage. 

Pros: best corn tortillas I have ever had... I ate them plain. They serve Pepsi and the tortilla chips and salsa bar was good... But that's it! 

I will never go back, except to maybe buy corn tortillas to take home and make my own tacos.
