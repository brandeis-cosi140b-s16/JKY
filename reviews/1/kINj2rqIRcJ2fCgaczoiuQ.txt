Sun rise cafe is MUCH better plus has more cleaner seating. The absolute only reason I go her is for my husband and Molly she's a very nice good waitress but the last time I was there, we had a new waitress who was absolutely terrible and rude It only took 10 minutes to get my drink then never did a single one of us get a refill extra napkins nothing just a 30$ check! Not worth the money I was so upset about the price vs the quality of the greasy breakfast burrito. Never enough seat wait time is ridiculous and is so HOT in side it's like they never heard of air conditioning!
