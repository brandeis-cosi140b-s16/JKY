To all neighbors in the Cave Creek area, beware this is without a doubt some of the worst Mexican food in the state of Arizona. Take a look at other reviews, I can tell you that the guacamole is nowhere near fresh this is straight out of a cryovac bag. The quality of the salsa is straight out of a number 10 can, not fresh what so ever. The chips are served cold. The red sauce as well as Christmas sauce very disappointing a lot of heat and no flavor. The service is mediocre at best, our server had absolutely no education on the menu. When I ask the server, what's popular here he replied by saying are tacos sell really well.... with that being said, that's a red flag if the tacos are the most popular item on the menu.

The same owner runs and operates this new facelift removing the Cocomo Joe's banner but still putting out the same crappy low quality food that is probably purchase from Restaurant Depot or a broad line distributor and all the cook in the back continues to be worried about is how cheep is the meat today, what's the best price you can get me on cheese, etc. and in no way spending a few extra pennies for quality ingredients to make the community happy and pleased with this new facelift.

A message to the owner, you did a facelift to your location giving the impression that something new exciting and high quality was coming to our town, very disappointing. You still have maybe have one more chance to redeem yourself, hire a real chef and  hospitality manager and get your s*** together so that people will continue to come back and enjoy themselves. If you do not take a drastic course of action which may already be too late your business will fail.

If you would have just simply change the menu at COCOMO, added more entertainment cleaned up your act there you would have saved probably hundreds of thousands of dollars on your face lift and gotten a better  response from our community.
