Not really impressed by the quality in the meats. 
I ordered a Carne Asada, Al Pastor, and Carnitas. And they all had, weirdly, the same taste. Overly greasy, no flavor, and no texture. Even with the condiments on the tacos. Lol 
It's obvious by the other reviews that these folks NEVER really had GOOD tacos.

I'm pretty much a taco connoisseur, LA native, so I've tried the best! 

However, their service was great! 

I wouldn't go there again nor recommend them.
