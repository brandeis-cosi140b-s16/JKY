Great service and wonderful server but the food coming out of the kitchen was not good!

Times are tuff I understand, we have to cut corners....I understand but when the chips taste like "Blah" and the salsa has that tin-y taste its time to regroup and figure out the priorities.

My buddy had chicken tacos and gave them a 2 and I had the stacked enchiladas and gave them a 1.  I would not call this Sonoran food I would call this Tex-Mex and that is what I just got done putting up with for 20 years!    

Ajo Al it is time to up your game!

Please do not discount this establishment based on my experience...give Ajo AL a chance and form your own opinion.   I want independents to excel but I also want to be wowed!  Did not happen today, but the employees have life and the place has a good vibe!
