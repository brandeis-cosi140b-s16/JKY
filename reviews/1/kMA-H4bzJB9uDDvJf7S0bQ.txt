Worst carnitas fries I have ever had out of all mexican restaurants. I had out 2 huge pieces of fat in my fries and maybe on good piece of meat in half of order. I have never been more dissapointed in my life. Ridiculous. How could a cook even think to serve us such shit. I would not even serve this to my dogs. Disgusting!!! So dissapointed!!. NEVER AGAIN!
