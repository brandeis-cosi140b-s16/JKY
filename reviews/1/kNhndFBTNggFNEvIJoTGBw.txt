Aunt Chiladas: bad name, even worse food. I'm sorry, but I can't recommend eating here.

I think this restaurant's proximity to the Arizona Grand hotel is the only reason it's still around. We were staying at the Arizona Grand, and decided to order take-out for our group of five people.

I ordered a chicken burrito with rice and beans as a side. What I received was a soggy burrito, with half chicken and half shredded beef (I don't eat red meat). That was unfortunate, but they didn't include the beans either- there was only rice as a side.

I thought the salsa was decent, but the chips were extremely greasy and not really worth eating.

Bottom-line: I'd pass on this place if I were you- there's lots of good Mexican restaurants around here more deserving of your business.
