Was not even greeted or acknowledged when entering the building. The lady that made the food did not wash her hands or put on gloves after being on the phone and who knows what else. The carne asada meat was old and just reheated. Poor experience. The food did not taste good and was lacking in flavor on top of already having old meat and dirty hands preparing it. Will not be coming back.
