This taco bell is ALWAYS incredibly slow. Today I sat in the drive through for 20 minutes before I even ordered and there were only 3 cars in front of me. Then I waited another 10 minutes to get my food. If they weren't so slow this would be a great taco bell. it shouldn't take 30 minutes to pick up some fast food.
