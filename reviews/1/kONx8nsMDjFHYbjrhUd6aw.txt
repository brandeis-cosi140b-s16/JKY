Breakfast burrito this morning was inedible. The potatoes were big and unweidly and sorely undercooked. Staff was not prepared for opening 30 minutes after opening time. The cashier was still moping the floor and the cook was in the back loafing and the chairs were still upside down on the tables. Ordered chicken breakfast burrito, but chicken was heavily spiced and poor quality today and the whole burrito was a hot mess. At 6 bucks, it was clearly a ripoff.
