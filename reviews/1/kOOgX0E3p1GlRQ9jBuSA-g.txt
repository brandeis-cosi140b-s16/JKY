I visited this location last night and was disappointed to find a note on the door that they were not accepting any more GROUPONS at this time? I didn't know you had an option to accept or not accept. We were so looking forward to dining with them. I will definitely be reaching out to GROUPON today. Do not participate in a program if you ate not willing to honor it all the way through.

The location on Woodlawn is awesome....too bad the coupon is only for Central Ave.
