Food was horrible. Absolutely horrible. Everything was salty down to the beans. How do you manage that? Ordered 4 different plates and all were salty. Chorizo was the saltiest out of all. Also they messed up our order by shorting us one. We came back and they just laughed. Very bad customer service. Will never go there again.
