Were do I start. The costra was burnt to a crisp, and yet they still served it. The chips were stale and when we brought to the supervisors attention rather than addressing it she told us that's how they are, and they were just cooked not long ago. As we watched her walk into the back with her lunch she came back out to get chips for herself. And within two minutes she popped up at our table with a refund apologizing for the chips, but wouldn't take the time to try one initially . She chose to be subtly confrontational . When I showed her my inedible costra ( the infamous ) she said its supposed to be browned. Gotta see the picks to believe it. Under see photos. 3 rd and last visit was today . Only a matter of time before doors are closed. No business can be that oblivious to the product they are selling.I had to give it one star that it wasn't worthy of so I could complete my review.
