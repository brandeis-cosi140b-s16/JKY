Years ago I rated this place fairly well.  Back then I enjoyed it a lot better.   Today I was so disappointed and frustrated.   Ordered the Fajitas Diablas and then had to wait 15 minutes before I received the tortillas.  I tried to eat without tortillas but the meat was so salty I really needed the tortillas.  By the time they arrived everything was cold.  Only got 2 tortillas too which isn't enough.  I would expect 3 like most other restaurants.  Bad service, good has gone downhill.
