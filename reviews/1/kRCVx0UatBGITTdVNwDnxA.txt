I hate to give them just 1 star. I used to come here a lot for lunch with my former coworkers since it was close to our office and the food was awesome! I loved their salsa bar at lunch and their steak fajitas. Tonight, I decided to take my whole family (parents included) and was very disappointed. My son accidentally spilled his water, and in the process of us trying to clean it, we realized how filthy and dirty the floor was. It was terrible. After we ate, my husband found a floss (that kind that is individualized and what you usually bring for travel) on the floor next to our table. I seriously feel so gross right now after eating there tonight. Never again.
