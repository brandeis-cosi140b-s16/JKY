I was here for lunch today and got the quesadilla with the works. It came in a puddle of water. Apparently the quesadillas are frozen and when ordered the toppings are placed on, nothing but cheese was inside, and then microwaved which explains the puddle of water.

When I showed this to the waitress she said she would tell the chef and the manager. I think she meant cook, I can't believe they have a chef.

Apparently neither the cook nor manager cared because neither one bothered to stop by my table and ask me about it or to see it.

The waitress never came around to give me a refill on my tea or salsa either. I had to flag down the chips and salsa girl to get a refill on my tea and salsa. So the service wasn't any better than the food.

Needless to say if you're looking for good Mexican food. with good service, in Wickenburg, Anita's Cocina is not the place for you or me.
