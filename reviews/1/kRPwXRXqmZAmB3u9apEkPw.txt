One of the only Korean restaurants closes and it gets replaced by...another Mexican grease pit. Charlotte has ENOUGH mexican restaurants and we don't need any more. The food is terrible here and the drinks are too expensive. Charlotte needs unique food and restaurants, not the same old stuff we keep getting every time the mexican restaurant owners see a vacant building. Seriously, the best thing this business could do is close so maybe a decent restaurant could replace it.
