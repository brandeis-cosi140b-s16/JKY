Usually love this place. But tonight I tried ordering to go and the guy Daniel kept fighting me on the menu and that I was ordering wrong. I have been ordering the same thing since it first opened. I know what it is and what it comes with. He was arguing  with me. So of course I hung up. I called again 10 min later to try again and maybe get someone else and he was still fighting me on it. I hung up because at this point I am furious. I am calling tonight to talk to a manager because customer service is #1 to me and he made it horrible. I love this place but his fighting me is making me not want to go there for awhile.
