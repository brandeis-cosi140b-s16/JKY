I had the fish taco for lunch and it is totally tasteless. Where in Mexico do they eat fish tacos with thousand island dressing? This is a low budget resturant that offers an all you can eat buffet for lunch which I did not try but seems to attract the locals. If you care about the taste of food then I would recommend to stay away.
