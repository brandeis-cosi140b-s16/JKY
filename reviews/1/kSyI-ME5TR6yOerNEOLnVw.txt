Wow!! That's all I can say at this place let me start! Family members have been talking about this place for a month so I can try it out! It was so horrible their service was lacking so much I wanted to walk out we order the Menudo the waiter came back and said they ran out when it's Sunday every Mexican restaurant should have some then they said they had the white Menudo so we order that 15 minutes later the waiter came back and said they didn't have that one either that's the only reason why we came to this place for the menudo!!! Anyways we thought they would do something for the lack of service they didn't even offer anything to make the service better they overcharged us for nasty food and horrible service I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone..
