I've gone to this location several times and they were phenomenal each time. They had great portions and were really quick and courteous. However, this time around, when I placed an online order, they forgot and order and I had to come back after arriving home to find a meal missing. When I finally got home the second time, I ate my bowl midway to find a metal black brown piece of wire in it. It wasn't a twig. And when I called in to tell the store of this, my only option was to come back in to file an incident report. 

Now, we have to go through each order to make sure nothing else is in there.
