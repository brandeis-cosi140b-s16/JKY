No thank you for responding. I know you might have great tasting food but unfortunately that wasn't the case when I was there. It was a little to salty and about the staff I would of appreciated if they came back asking if everything was ok, but they didn't. I was actually excited to go there due to the some good reviews on your restaurant but I wished it was a little more pleasant and employees more excited to work there. I would of asked for something else but due to the lack in timing of the waitress I was to hungry to even wait. Hopefully you continue making changes and it all works out.
