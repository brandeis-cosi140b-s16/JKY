I love chipotle but this location BLOWS! 

One of the girls was flirting with some guy in line and ignoring my order. He handed he chocolate milk over the counter and all three of the employees had a drink while preparing food. It was disgusting. 

I also had to ask an employee 4 times to change the diet coke because it was out but he was to busy standing around to get it done.
