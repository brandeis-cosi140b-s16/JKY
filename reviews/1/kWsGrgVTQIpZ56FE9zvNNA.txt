First visit was last visit.  Tried it for dinner.  Nice setup outside with table and chairs, very pleasant.  One person working cash register and creating the food orders - not a great idea in my opinion.  The ingredients are all contained in a Subway-type bar and then assembled before you.  Problem is nothing was fresh tasting or very appealing in general.  Maybe it's different at lunchtime but I won't be back to find out.  When I need a burrito fix, I'm going to Chipotle.  The owners of Kokopelli need to do the same and they will soon understand  - it's the food, stupid.
