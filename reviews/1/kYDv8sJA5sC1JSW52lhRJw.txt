Disgusting. The food was just ok, the service was abysmal. I ended up getting gum on my pants and the owner came over and said "sorry, happens all the time."  She didn't comp our meal or offer anything other than ice. When I tried to clean my pants she berated me telling me I'm doing it incorrectly and that she wasn't paying for my pants even though I never asked her to do that. If you eat here check underneath your table for gum.
