Place stunk as soon as we walked in bathrooms were a mess and the carne asada tasted old and nasty the water was nasty. Halfway through my burrito my son spilled the red salsa all over my plate and im glad he did cause there was a bug in it I spit out what was in my mouth threw everything out and left. Im sure they must have had a bad night tonight but will not be going back.
