The nice thing about this place is that they are "trying" to serve authentic mexican food, however, while they have good intentions, what they prepare  is a debauchery of it. 

While they serve some of the classics, their choice of ingredients just plain SUCK!  their tortillas are very dry, not warm and moist.  They managed to double their tortillas up, which is correct, but they didn't cook them properly! They definetley "heard" about corn on the cob smothered in mayo and parmesean cheese....but you have to use real ROASTED sweet corn....not half-boiled yellow corn!  

Their salsas are bland, not fresh and vibrant.  their meat is underseasoned and bland too.  No dynamics between dishes.  This restaraunt is trying to mimic authentic mexican food, but is failing miserably.  

Nonetheless, if you have never experienced real mexican food before, you may still be fooled into thinking they serve good tacos.  

Everything they serve "looks" just right, but the taste is far from accurate. If you are the kind of person who would get satisfaction from purchasing a knocked-off pair of air-jordans...this place is for you!  If the painted on fake carbon fiber sole that rubs off as soon as you actually look at them bothers you, I would reccommend making tacos from home like they should be.
