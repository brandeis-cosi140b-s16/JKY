This place is right by my house, so I was excited to walk there in the summer for margaritas. Well...Their margaritas are decent, but grossly overpriced. No big deal, we'll go on Mondays because margaritas are half priced. Too bad the service is atrocious!!!! I don't care how good the chips are, or how convenient it would be to walk next door for Monday night margs... Because it takes FOREVER to get anything you order.. Including water! It's even worse if you sit on the patio. We gave it 3 tries, no more. During our last visit, we sat on the patio and waited patiently for 15 minutes for our margaritas to arrive. After those 15 minutes, two women sat at the table next to us, ordered margaritas and got them WAY before we did. It was the same server, so maybe she got confused.. But it never dawned on her how long we had been waiting compared to the other patrons...No apologies or any sigh of hustle whatsoever. Boo!
