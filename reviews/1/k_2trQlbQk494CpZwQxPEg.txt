First time there and last time there. The waitress came over and it was awkward.. felt like I walked in as they were closing (noon, 2 hrs after opening). The place was dead silent except for the cooks music in the far back. The food came out and the main dish was not tastie.. took 3 bites and I was done. On my way out I thought that Filaberto would have tasted better and costed less.
