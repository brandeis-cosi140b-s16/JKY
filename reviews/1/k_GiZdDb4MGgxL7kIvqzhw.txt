Disappointing food for the high cost.

The ceviche ($10) does not come with raw fish cooked with the acids of a fresh lemon, but rather it is canned, cooked fish sitting in bottled lemon juice. The duck taquitos were dry, like frozen ones that were microwaved a little too long. (And they still sold for around $10 for two taquitos.) And the seafood in the paella ($21) was overcooked, and in a sauce that tasted a lot like Chef Boyardee sauce.

My colleagues enjoyed the fish filet dishes, though, so perhaps it may be best to just avoid the dishes mentioned above.

Besides that, friendly service and a good beer selection.
