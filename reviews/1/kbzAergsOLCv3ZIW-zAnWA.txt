This place is awful.  I ordered a lemonade and a burrito.  Waitress took 5 minutes to grasp I wanted lemonade and not pink lemonade, then couldn't tell me if they had Corona or Dos Equis (I couldn't think of a simpler beer request or I would have made it).  They brought me the wrong food twice and then everyone I was with was done eating, so I never did get my food.  I ended up driving thru Filbertos on the way home for my birthday dinner.  They were rude, inattentive, and incompetent.  I wouldn't recommend anyone go here for any reason.  There are better Mexican restaurants nearby like Arribas or Raul & Theresa's.  Don't go here.
