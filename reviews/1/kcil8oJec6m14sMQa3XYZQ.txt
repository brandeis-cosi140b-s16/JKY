Really wanted to try this place for the first time, called to get their specials and place a to go order for everyone at work. $4.99 chicken chimichangas, score! Only problem?!? Can't get that special "to-go" it's dine in only!!! To-go price is double, $9.99! Major bummer since we can't close up shop and all go out to eat, why can't they accommodate "to-go" orders, you know, people working for a living who could really use a special price?!? Oh well, guess it's Filiburtos again instead, kind of unfortunate!
