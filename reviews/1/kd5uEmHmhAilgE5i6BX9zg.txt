Darn darn darn.  I was really hoping that I was going to be able to give a great review.  We had the all you could eat tacos for $ 10.00. that is the special this weekend.  Don't have the ground beef or shredd beef unless you would like to start high blood pressure medication. The salt content is horrific.   The pork tacos were very good . the first three were very good.the rest were " where's the beef" tacos...it took 3 tacos to make one due to 1/3 the meat in each.    
Melissa did take care of us and the rest of the staff was very attentive.  Beer was cold.
