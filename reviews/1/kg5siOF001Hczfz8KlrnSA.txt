I should of known better. An empty mexican restaurant on a Friday night is never a good sign. 

I got the taco plate. 3 tacos (carne asada, shrimp, and barbocoa) black re-fried beans and rice. The carne asada didn't have any flavor and the tortillas tasted stale and cold. The rice and beans was just as disappointing. 

My wife got the Carne Asada Fries. The fries weren't salted and soggy. Meat was dried and had no flavoring. And the cheese, the cheese was the worst part. Cheese tasted like it came from a cheese-wiz bottle. Man. That was the worst part. Lastly, my sister got the Ceviche that came out brown and looked nothing like Ceviche. 

I could never recommend this place. Sad to say. Great atmosphere, but the food is awful
