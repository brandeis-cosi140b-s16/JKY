Sorry to say... I wanted to like this place.  Great patio and curb appeal but its a Jaguar Body with a VW Bug engine.

My wife and I were sat immediately as it was a Tuesday night and not hopping.  A man showed up immediately and took our drink order and identified himself as Joe, the manager.  He quickly disappeared to never show up again.  He evidently did not let our waiter know, nor did he care that we sat without our drinks.

I have to point out that our waiter was excellent but even he as tentative as he was could not save the operation from itself.  (Forgot his name but he must have been 6'8", great attitude)

We sat next to the display kitchen where we watched countless dish sit at the window.  This place was NOT busy and they could not get the food out to customers in time.   Seemed as if there were at minimum three "managers" on duty and they would sit by the window, chat, while the expiditor searched for the appropriate waiter, with evident frustration.  My wife ordered the filet and I the steak tacos.  (Note:  these too sat at the window less than 10 feet from our table till I caught the expiditors eye and had him deliver these to us).

Filet was acceptable... little overcooked but acceptable.  My steak taco's were a joke.  Like someone else mentioned in a review, they must think the customers are stupid.  My taco's were LOADED with iceburg lettuce and MAYBE an ounce of steak in each.  Might as well have been a vegitarian version.  Gringo flavor..... 

There is no excuse for this operation to be so confused still.  I believe it opened in October....  Note to TQLA....  Get it together.  You wont last long in Gilbert.  You wont survive just on the bar crowd, food MUST get better and be served hot.  Competition is coming right down the street....  and this group will eat you alive from both perspectives.   Ended with a quattro leche dessert....  No good either.  Think COLD WET BREAD......  Might have been ok had it been warmed through....
