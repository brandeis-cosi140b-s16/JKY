I can honestly say I have never been so dissatisfied with the customer service of a restaurant as I did with Chipotle. Not only was their service an extreme inconvenience, it was just plain rude. While I was there, the works decided to say each other's names in what sounded like a song. This annoying activity dragged on for quite some time. It continued as I tried to order, and the person serving me decided that it would be a good idea to join in on their singing festivities rather than serving me. They cut me off when I was trying to order and then she ended up getting my order entirely wrong. The burrito I received was tasteless and probably one of the worst things I've ever eaten. It is because of this failure to serve me probably that I did not enjoy my experience and I have not returned since. I cannot believe the workers still have their jobs after being so incredibly disrespectful.
