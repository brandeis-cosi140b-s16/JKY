Terrible! Guacamole was like green jello. Nothing was fresh. This wasn't even really Mexican food. I asked for a side of refried beans and was served a side of pinto beans with bacon and pickled peppers in it. Disgusting. My friend and I sat and talked for awhile and they cleared our table but left the jello and salsa - never refilled
Our chips. I LOVE Mexican and am really not hard to please-in fact I've never been to a Mexican restaurant that I didn't like. This was a first. I will definitely never go back. The service was ok..... I would go somewhere else if I were you. There's an On The Boarder nearby that I'd opt for.
