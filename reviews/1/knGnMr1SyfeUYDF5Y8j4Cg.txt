When we walked in the place had a funny smell, but forgave and ordered food anyway.  The building is not very well kept, it had rained and they had buckets catching water where the roof was leaking.

I ordered the #15, which was a bean tostada taco and 2 rolled taco.  The price was great, just under $5 for all that food.  However, it was not even worth the $5 I paid.  The other people I was with got their food first and thought it smelled a little off (the got rolled tacos).  I got my food and it had the same weird smell to it.  I gave it a try and tasted a rolled taco.  It had no flavor except the bad after taste.  The food may have been going bad, at least it smelled that way. Ended up throwing it away!  I will not be returning.  Do yourself a favor, go to one of the many other Mexican food places and save yourself the disappointment.
