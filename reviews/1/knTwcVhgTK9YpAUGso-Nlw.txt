Third time coming here, and I wish we would have gone to rubios instead, I brought my wife and five kids here after a Monday night movie, food tasted good, but when we got home my 12 year old threw up his chimichanga, later my 14 year old complained of a stomach ache, and later had diarrhea.  It's now 4:30 am, and I'm writing this review on my iPad sitting on the toilet with the runs worse than montezuma on a bad day. My wife seems fine and my other kids only had the strawberries and cream.

The owner wasn't there, and I think the young staff sabotaged our meal, because when we left the whole kitchen staff came out to the register, watched us leave and with an almost laughing tone in their voices waved and all said goodbye, which by itself was weird.  

Their fire roasted jalape√±os are fantastic, but I will never come back.  I feel sorta jipped, I loved the previous visits, and even tipped the waitress 15 bucks on a 35 dollar check just because I had such a good time the visits before.

I wish I could post 0 stars, but in order to post a review you gotta pick at least one.  We will never be back.


I'm editing this post because when I got out of the bathroom (a half hour later), my 10 year old daughter who only had a egg and cheese casadilla was bent over in pain and says that she feels horrible and that her stomach hurts.  (At five in the freaking morning)

Thanks a whole heck of a lot Moreno's Mexican grill, I hope our family pain made your staff feel good about themselves.
