Possibly the worst service I've ever had in Madison.  A hostess once tried to take away the table we'd just been seated at because some friend of hers wandered by and wanted to be seated immediately.  I've often had to wait quite awhile for waitstaff.

The food is nothing special--not BAD, but definitely overpriced.  The half-price margaritas, the only reason I ever go there, are pretty good, but they recently instituted a requirement that you purchase like $10 worth of their overpriced food in order to get a table rather than being confined to the bar.  Not worth it.
