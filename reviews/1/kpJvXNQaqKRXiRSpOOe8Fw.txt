It takes at least 30 minutes to get through the drive through, the service is bad, and the burritos are almost always made incorrectly. It costs about $10 for 2 bean burritos and they're always running out of beans. I come here because it's 24/7 and right next to my house, but I think at this point I'd rather eat crumbs off the floor.
