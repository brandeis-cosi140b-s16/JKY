My first question to Frida's owner regarding the women's bathroom is this: You seriously think it's okay to allow customers to go in there? Knowing he'll say, yeah, sure, why not, my second question to Frida's owner is this: Are you f-ing insane? Do you see things most people don't, like cleanliness when there's only stained toilet seats and pseudo stalls? Do you see quality when others see terror? Do you see dead people with spray cleaner and mops? You must, because seriously, your bathrooms are like my first apartment: super ugly and super scary. The place is so dark, Sherlock Holmes couldn't find the toilet paper with a treasure map and Blackbeard holding a torch to light the way.

I also want to know why their rice and beans tastes like water. The rice isn't an M&M, yet it melts in your mouth. Not a good quality for a grain. The beans may or may not be legumes.

Why You Should Be Embarrassed to Own this Place: I make better rice and beans than you, and I'm f-ing Native American. Get a handle on your menu and your louvre, and I'll consider going back.
