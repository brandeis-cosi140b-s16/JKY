When I am being lazy and don't really care about what I am shoving down my gullet I head down to the local super market and grab the following: Pork butt ( I then boil it in unseasoned water), canned black beans, clearance special leaf lettuce, store brand artificial cheese, roma tomatoes, and rice-a-roni  spanish rice, as well as some off-brand chips.... and some tomato sauce.
I get home have a few beers, cook the pork for 5 hours in boiling water, and then I throw all of the listed ingredients in a bowl and chow down.... at this point not caring about flavor, seasoning, or overall enjoyment from the meal other than to just plain eat.

If you like to get this type of food fast and from a restaurant! Go to Jester's. They are really killing it. Ragu based 'hot sauce', and the food city label to match. Do yourselves a favor and start buying your pork cooked at Food City, it will be a exponential improvement. 

I am pretty sure that when the statistics come out concerning restaurants and their 90% failure rate..... Jester's is the type of place they are talking about.

Start over. 

Seriously fellas...... Better get back to the drawing board.... People do not want what they can make themselves! That is the whole point of going out to eat... Set yourselves apart by doing something different and have someone to come in there to show you some good recipes. Would hate to see you fail but with this type of food, in this area, doom is in your near future if you dont get it together!
