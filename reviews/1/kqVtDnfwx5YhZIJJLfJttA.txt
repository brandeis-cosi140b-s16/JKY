Saw all the commercials and thought I'd try it.  HORRIBLE!  I had the chicken taco which should be hard to mess up but boy did they.  The taco was so greasy and the chicken was chewy.  The "toppings" were not good and after eating it I felt sick.  I have never returned to a Del Taco anywhere else and do not plan to.  I had to give it a star so I can post but otherwise I would not give it anything.
