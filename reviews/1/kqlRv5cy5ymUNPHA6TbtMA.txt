Better Mexican food can be found in the Valley, at a much, much cheaper price.   $16.00 Chimis that were small, and lacking in any really value for the money.   At this cost, the Chimi should have been hearty in portion, but was pathetically small. Cheese Queso at $8.00 --- was greasy, hard and disgusting.   Was dining with a friend that is a chef, and he was stunned at the price and the quality.   Service was good, but nothing to rage about.   Spent $44.00 before tax on two of us --- and that did not include alcohol.    

Not sure what Mucho Gusto the rest of you have been dining at --- but it certainly was not the one in Tempe.   Come on people --- expect more for your hard earned $$$ and vote with your feet.
