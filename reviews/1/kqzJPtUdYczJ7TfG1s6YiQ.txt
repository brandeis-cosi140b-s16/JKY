The service left a lot to be desired. I sat at the bar for 10 minutes before I was even asked if I wanted a drink. There were about 10 other people in the place so I am not sure what the problem was. I ordered a to-go order and a beer while I waited. About 5 minutes after ordering, I still didn't have my beer, but the staff found plenty of time to chat it up with each other. Finally got my beer and my to-go order. I ordered the Asian Shrimp taco and the Mexican tots. The taco was the smallest taco I have ever seen and had very little shrimp but the flavor was good. The tots were good and the picked jalape√±os were very spicy which was a great addition. I would not recommend this place as they have a lot of kinks to work out.
