my girlfriend ordered a chicken quesadilla and was given a beef quesadilla.  Last time I checked a beef quesadilla would be a taco not a quesadilla.  The shell was overly soggy and nasty. The ground beef had no seasoning or taste.  If this place is suppose to serve mexican food they have definitely missed the mark. Taco Bell does a better job and they are a fast food restaurant. The owner of this place needs to learn how to cook food properly.
