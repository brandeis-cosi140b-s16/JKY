Overpriced, mediocre food.  The food is overpriced to begin with, but that's not all.   Elvira will nickel and dime you for EVERYTHING.  I've NEVER heard of a restaurant charging you for the freaking to-go container!  LAME!  Not only is it overpriced, but the staff couldn't get our order right to save their lives!  We had to go back TWICE to get everything correct.  The food wasn't anything to right home about either.  Our enchiladas weren't even rolled up, they were just folded over tortillas topped with lukewarm sauce.  Fail!
