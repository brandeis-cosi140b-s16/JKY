I love this place, but tonight was definitely a deal breaker. Someone who works there had both of their young kids, about 6 and 5 years of age, running around the restaurant, they were back by the grills and behind the counter. Who knows what they touched and got in my food...kids are dirty. Also, the people who worked there were giving out free food to many different people and the kids. 

I understand that this is a Mexican restaurant, but these like are very racist. My boyfriend sat there waiting for about 15 minutes for our food, and a Hispanic woman came in and got her large take out order within minutes. 

As good as their food is, tonight definitely changed my opinion on this location.
