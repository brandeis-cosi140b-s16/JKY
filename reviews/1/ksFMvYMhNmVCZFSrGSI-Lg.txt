We always go to the chevo's in chandler which is delicious, the one in ahwatukee is different for some reason.  Ordered the chicken rolled tacos today there was a tiny lil piece of chicken in each one, so basically I had 3 rolled deep fried tortillas yuck! :( No flavor what so ever.  Also ordered carne asada taco the meat tasted old like it was cooked earlier and just thrown on the grill to get warm.  Very dissapointed!!
