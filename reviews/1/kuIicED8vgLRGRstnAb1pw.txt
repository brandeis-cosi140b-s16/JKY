This place is trash always dirty. They slop your food on your dish. The staff just don't care about working here. Who ever does the hiring process here should be let go of this duty.  How hard is it to layer a taco, and scoop rice and beans. The staff here could not even work at Taco Bell or Dell Taco. Only gets one star cause I do like the pork here. I live over in this area every time I go to this place its allways trash that's why I have not been back in a year. So I thought I try it again. I was disappointed that this place has not changed. Were you order your food is always dirty and a big mess with food slop everywhere. This place does not practice clean as you go.   I'm finally done ever going to this place. Hope this review will help people to choose to go some were else besides having an awful experience that I have when I have been here.
