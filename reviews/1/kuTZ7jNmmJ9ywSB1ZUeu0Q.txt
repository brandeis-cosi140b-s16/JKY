We ordered before a wave of people came in. It took forever to get our food. Twice I asked employees to check on our order. Both times they cut me off and told me they were too just to busy to check. Both times I explained that people who ordered after me had already eaten and we're leaving. Both times they cut me off again. When they finally slowed down they realized that they did screw up, one of the employees that cut me off brought the food out. No apologies, no a acknowledgement...just Below average luke warm food.
