Terrible service. One waiter took the drink order. Another took the food order. 40 minutes later, after having to practically tackle a waiter to get refreshed drinks, they discover nobody put the food order in. Talked to the manager and he didn't seem bothered. I think he was dealing with a problem with another table. I wouldn't try this place unless you have a lot of time to waste.
