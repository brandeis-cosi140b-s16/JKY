I was shopping at the Nike store and had a taste for Mexican so I figured I's stop in Fresca's and try it.  I waited 15 minutes for a "steak" burrito and I am not exaggerating, but it was simply the worst food I have ever eaten.  The steak tasted like that cow died in 1987, and the rest was just a mushy mess. It was $6.30, and I threw away $6.00 of it. If I was starving, I would eat my own hand first.
