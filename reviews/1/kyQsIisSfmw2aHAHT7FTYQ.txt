Long wait for boring Mexican-ish food on styrofoam plates.

This is a mix between chipotle (ordering system) filibertos (styrofoam plates & cups-  not Eco-friendly) and street cart food.

I had the fish tacos- not good. The fish did not have a grilled appearance or taste and was a bit mushy.  Super lame pre-shredded cheese at this spot detracts from the quality as well as gross chips & nasty tortillas.

The same day I went here I went to happy hour at crescent ballroom and had amazzzzing fish tacos for $2 each that had flaky seasoned real grilled fish not this limp frozen mush.  I didn't realized how gross it was until 5 hours later at happy hour.  I must have ordered the same thing twice in 1 day because of how forgettable my lunch was.

Side of guacamole is super small!  This stingy cheap restaurant will not see me return.
