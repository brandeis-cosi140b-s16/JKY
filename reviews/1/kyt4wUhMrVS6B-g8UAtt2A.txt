This place is terrible, I do not know how I ended up here. The server had no knowledge about the drinks, and all those girls seemed really rude. When my mom payed the bill, they had the nerve to ask if we were going to tip her which obviously we were, but I find it very unprofessional for them to be asking people to tip them.
