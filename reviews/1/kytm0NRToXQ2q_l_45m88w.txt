I have never been so angry to pay my bill before my lovely experience at the Garcias's in Arizona Mills.

I love mexican food, so it was no question that when my boyfriend and I were browsing through our selections at the Mall, we decided on Garcia's. 

Upon entrance, the staff was very unwelcoming and standard. We were seated and immediately asked our drink orders. Within minutes the chips and salsa... and bean dip were delivered-which was the best part of the meal.

Our waitress took way too long to take our orders and when we finally received our food (I had chicken enchiladas with rice and beans and my boy had a chimi) we weren't impressed.

Our meal lacked flavor. I know that Garcia's isn't AUTHENTIC mexican-super yummy, hole in the wall-mom and pop shop-sorta authentic, but STILL, I expected something better than the bland, flavorless garbage that was steaming in front of me. It was crap, and overpriced.

The bean dip was the best part of my meal... even the salsa tasted like it came out of a pace bottle.

crapalicious.
