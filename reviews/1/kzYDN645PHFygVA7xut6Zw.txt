Food was good, bugs were not.

We sat our whole meal eating, then when my friend picked up her purse, a handful of bugs scattered out from under it!  There were food crumbs stuck down in the cracks of the seat, seemed to be where the bugs were.  Then we looked more closely and there were more on the windowsill/back of the booth.  All we got was an apology.  Just your typical diner with a big menu, so just go to a different one.
