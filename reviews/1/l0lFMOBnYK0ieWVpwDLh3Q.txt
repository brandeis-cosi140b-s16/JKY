Just moved here from New Mexico and I'm in Mexican food hell!  Help!!!  Although more edible than the last place that was recommend, no Clamato? No bloody Mary's?  No eggs?  Horrible chips and salsa.  Always a sticking point with me, as I could seriously live off chips and salsa.  That had me worried right off the bat, so I figured a chimichanga would be safe.  Hell they are good even from the frozen aisle right?  Most uncrispy chimi ever.  And the rice, well, I'll just quit there.

Really is a shame because the restaurant itself is very well decorated and prices seemed pretty reasonable, but it makes me scared to try what else is out there.
