This place was creepy and horrible!!! The fountain out front splashed on everyone as they walked by in the front of the restaurant.   Then when we walked in all three waitors were all standing in a circle by the bar talking and laughing with eachother.   We were seated in a booth with broken down seats.  The salsa had too much pepper and the chips were all broken crumbs.  I ordered pollo fundito, when i actually got my food after an hour wait it was gross with plain creamcheese and actually square peices of kraft american cheese slices. My boyfriends order was messed up as well.  The waiter was an authentic mexican that didnt understand english and there was only one other couple eating at that dump.  Never will i go to this place again....gross!
