This place is a joke. Serious!!! The atmosphere is ok. I went there for happy hour with 4 co-workers. The margaritas are watered down. 5 drinks in and a shot later I was charged a $7 gratuity. Didn't notice it till I looked at my receipt and like an idiot I still dropped a tip. I can see if it was a party of 8. I got robbed and the drinks were as cheap as the decor. Plus service was not attentive to my table, had to flag down service. Will never go to this place again AND I recommend going somewhere else if you're trying to get your happy on for happy hour. SMH get it together! I should have went to RA.
