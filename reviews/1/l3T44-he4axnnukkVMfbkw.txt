I used to really like this place. I reminded me of a place from college, but has taken a dramatic turn for the worse. The last 3 times I've dined here before my flight it has simply been terrible. I, and you, should not go here. Previously would enjoy friendly service in getting a chimichanga.  Prior two visits, oil must had been too cool and it was nasty greasy with no crisp. Last time got a chicken burrito.  I was assured it had the extra guacamole and sour cream.  It did not. When politely asking for it, I was given a cup of totally old grey green goo and two serving of diva attitude that was not ordered. Bland and not fresh. So many better options at the airport.
