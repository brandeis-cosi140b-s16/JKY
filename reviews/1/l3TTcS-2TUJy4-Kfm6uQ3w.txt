Wow, I rarely feel compelled to give a restaurant such a bad review but Rio Rico earned it tonight.  We came for Cinco de Mayo which we expected to be busy so we showed up around 5 pm.  There weren't many people waiting but those that were had to figure out for that they had to sign themselves in to be seated (no greeter on Cinco de Mayo??).  The wait wasn't bad but once we sat it took nearly 10 minutes for a server to show up and ask if we had ordered drinks.  At that point we hadn't even met our server, received water, chips, salsa, menus...etc., so no, we hadn't ordered drinks.  Ordering was a total debacle.  Our server appeared to have never taken an order before.   We finally got through that ordeal only to wait nearly 45 minutes for our food.  To make matters worse, the tables near us, all of which were seated well after we were, had received their fajitas long before we did.  The server noticed that ours still hadn't arrived and assured us that they'd be right out...and they were, completely uncooked. The peppers and onions couldn't have been more raw.  They clearly forgot our order and then tried to rush it.  Whatever, we just wanted to eat and get the heck out.  Then the bill came and surprise!  We were charged full price for the happy hour drinks and of course no from the server or on the receipt that our night was a total disaster.  The food was sub par, the service was horrible and the staff seemed completely oblivious to the fact that we were being ignored.  We definitely will not be back and i would highly recommend that any prospective diners spend their time and money elsewhere.
