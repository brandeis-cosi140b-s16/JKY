I've been here 2 times. First time the food was bland, cold, and my tortillas were soggy. The service was ok. The second time was just terrible. Service was horrid. Our server didn't check on us at all, our drinks were never refilled, she dropped our check off and picked it up without saying anything. The food was unforgivable. Greasy, overcooked, and tasted like water this place has never heard of salt. I had to season my food and add citrus to my fish tacos. My side of rice and beans were cold, undercooked, and had no seasoning. The corn salsa was served with cold ships and once again no seasoning. I usually never leave bad reviews being that I work as a server in a restaurant in uptown and also as a cook/kitchen manager in another restaurant in uptown. But this was just shameful to everyone in the restaurant industry....
