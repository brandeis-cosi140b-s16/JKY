I've been to Se√±or Taco twice: drive through once and came into the restaurant once. When I used the drive through I waited about 20 minutes in the car and got home to find someone else's order. I called the restaurant to resolve the confusion to no avail.

My visit to the restaurant settled any ideas I had about this place, I walked into a dirty dining room which had most tables empty but dirty and a mop and mop bucket sitting by the door. The restaurant had a strong sewage odor and for some reason the bathroom door was propped open. I didn't order food.
