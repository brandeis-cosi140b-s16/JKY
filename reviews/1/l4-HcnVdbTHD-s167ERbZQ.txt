The food here has always been mediocre, but the service has taken a serious nosedive.  Two friends and I stopped in to enjoy 1/2 priced margaritas, and were told we had to order $5 of food per person.  After choosing from the very uninspired list of appetizers, my friend was given a clear plastic cup to sip her margarita from.  Like a Solo cup!  When asked if she could have a big girl cup like the rest of us, the waiter informed us that Frida is "switching to plastic".  How environmentally informed of them.  Did I mention we weren't given any chips and salsa?  The atmospheric highlights included the flies swarming around our food, and the frat boys in their JC Penney ties shouting and gesticulating from the loft.  This place is also horrible at dealing with groups.  I went for a friend's bday, and they wouldn't split the check from 20 people to groups of five or even ten.  Half-priced margs or not, I will not be returning to Frida.
