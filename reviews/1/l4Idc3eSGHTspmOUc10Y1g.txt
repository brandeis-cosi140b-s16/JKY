Any establishment that has been closed not once, not twice but three times by the health department for demerits...uh I think not!  I used to eat here alot being as we would be across the street at the silver saddle and then shimmy over for some tacos, but they have been in the RJ so many times now they have a reserved column, think twice before going there!
