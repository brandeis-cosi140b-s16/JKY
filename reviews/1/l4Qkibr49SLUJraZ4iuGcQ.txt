The Asian cashier was very rude (I believe her name was Michelle). She was not professional at all, and this will be the first and last time that I come here. I first noticed that she had an attitude since I was waiting in line. I was hoping that I had the other cashier help me, but I was unfortunate enough to end up with the grumpy lady! I hope this does not ruin the rest of my day.
