i know what you will think - he gives a two star review and eat there again! What's wrong with that guy? - Well I wonder myself. I was very unhappy with my second visit there. They only have terrible beers on tap, and they don't have a list of decent beer bottles. How hard is it to carry some decent brews, fgs. We're not in the 1980s anymore. the food (Tacos) was mediocre too. so, beat me if I go back.
