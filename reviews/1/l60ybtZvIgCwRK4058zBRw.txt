Horrible , 1) The prices for there food are too much for the quantity your getting. 2) last time me and my fianc√© went , they were out of chips from the time we got there to the time we left the lady's kept telling us 5 more minutes there cooking , yet nothing . 3) they had got my order messed up with another family's and we were quit upset especially the time period it took for our food to get out to us . Never returning horrible . Ponchos Mexican restaurant on central is our new joint ! Great food , & they always have fresh chips lol
