Worst food I've EVER encountered in a restaurant in my entire life! The chips were stale and smelled like old oil! I immediately had a stomach ache and had to run to a drugstore for tums! We brought it to the attention of the waiter- they brought out more chips but same problem- they were frying the chips in very old oil! They reeked! All entrees were stale and not fresh. Plates were sooo unappetizing looking- not even plated nicely or with any garnish. My daughter and I had stomach aches for 3 days after. I would NEVER eat here again!
