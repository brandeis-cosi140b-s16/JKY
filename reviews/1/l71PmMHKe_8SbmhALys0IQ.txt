seen this cafe on my way from work for 9 yrs never stopped,  well this is what I think, it was very small, no where to stand and wait to be seated, once we got seated there was hardly any room to move and the waitress kept bumping into us, it was awful and uncomfortable,  order an arizona burrito dinner and some type of dinner salad that was not worth 12.00. Then 12.00 for guacamole? Just to cut and chop and mix salt,tomatoes,cilantro and lime? 12.00? No way no how, menu is expensive and over rated and very small portions. Would never go back.  Staff was nice.
