We were in Las Vegas for a week and ate at Hussong's Cantina one night for dinner.  The yelp reviews were on the OK side, and since we were craving Mexican food we decided to go there because it was within walking distance to our hotel.

The GOOD- The only good thing about this place is the location- right in the middle of the Shops at Mandalay Bay.

The OK- I ordered the chicken enchilada suizas.  They were ok.  Nothing special, and I've definitely had better.  My boyfriend ordered the Cuatro tacos with carnitas and carne asada. He didn't like them at all! They were dry and the meat did not taste good.  Neither of us finished our meals, I think I ate one enchilada and he ate 2 of his 4 tacos. The chips and salsa they give you is not that good either.  We were starving so we ate some of the chips they gave us, but overall the food was not that good.  The service was ok, but I did have to ask a few times to get a straw.

The BAD- The mariachi music was so LOUD!  My boyfriend and I were sitting right across the table from each other and had to yell to even hear what the other person was saying.  Also, $60 for a pitcher of margaritas, and $18 for one margarita!!!  That is INSANE to charge that much!  I get it's Las Vegas and everything there is expensive, but c'mon, that is absolutely ridiculous!  

Overall, when we are in Vegas again next year, we will be seeking Mexican food elsewhere at other establishments...
