I'd hoped this restaurant was similar to a taco truck I'd so loved to go to in California. 
     Unfortunately, this resturant didn't hold up to my standards. I felt the food was of low caliber and due to the unclean bathroom, I suspected poor sanitation. 
     The amount of uncalled-for grease was just amazing and the characteristic rice and beans were simply unappealing and lacked flavor. 
     The high price just didn't seem to match the quality of the food, nor of the quality of the establishment.
