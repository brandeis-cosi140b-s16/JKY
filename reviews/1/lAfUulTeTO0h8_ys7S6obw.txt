I almost went here.

Me and my group sat here for 20 minutes or so and didn't even get a glance from a waiter.

We were drawn by the lure of $1 rita's and tacos but that deal doesn't start til midnight.

We were there at 1130p and decided to bail after we had a near miss
with a member of the wait staff who cruised by our table, smiled and walked on by.
