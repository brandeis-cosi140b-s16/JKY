Do you like waiting over an hour for service?  Bland chicken in your tacos. And a super noisy environment with a wait staff that barely comes to your table?  Well my friends you have come across just the place to waste your money. Honestly take the trip to rosaritas beach taco shop on horizon ridge this place sucks. Two times I have given it a shot both times same results. But I suppose the veiw is worth taking a date here for drinks, other than that stay away from this restaurant.
