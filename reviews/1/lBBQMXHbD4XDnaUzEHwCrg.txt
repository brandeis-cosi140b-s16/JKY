I recommended this place to my daughter and her friends when they were in visiting us from Chicago.  I am sorry i did.   4 young working professionals (age 27-38)  walked into the Spotted Donkey.  They waited for someone to acknowledge them and 10 minutes passed and no one did.   The place had only 2 table occupied with elderly couples.   Finally a woman seated us and then took many minutes to return ...we ordered the nachos, which were horrible.  Tasteless, she returned and we asked for the check...she was so rude to the young ladies thatthey and we will never return there.  We certainly will not recommend to any of our visiting friends.
