First experience at barrio queen... A texmex spot that is trying to be a Mexican restaurants but is definitely not. There are flys every where to almost to the point I felt like I was at the zoo near the area where the animals shit. The food is bland and the guac is tasteless. If you are someone that likes bland food because you have IBS ( irritable bowel syndrome) this place is for you but if you want real tasty Mexican food don't ever go here.
