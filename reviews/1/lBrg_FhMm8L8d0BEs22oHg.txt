ABSOUTLEY DUSGUSTING! Ordered a bean and cheese burrito , it was super cold inside , the cheese was super hard and not melted. The beans were definitely old and stale. I completely lost my appetite and to be honest that was my last trip to Filibertos.  I would have gone up and asked for another burrito but was afraid they would have spit in my food from the last experience I had here. I came one night around 10:30 pm and there was two chairs blocking the drive thru which was really strange, this filibertos is supposed to be a 24/7 drive thru. I decided to go in considering the open sign was on, but the doors were locked, I look inside the cooks and employees are eating and jamming out to music. I banged on the doors a couple times trying to get there attention, they looked right at me and completely ignored me, I was waving at them and asking through the door are you guys open, and no answer they just kept dancing and laughed right at us.  Will never go here again
