First impression was a table that was sticky and a filthy pair of children's menus. It was downhill from there. Our waiter's visits were few and far between, sodas had far too little syrup, and my enchiladas were cool to cold on the ends and warm in the middle. But that's not the most egregious offense. To cap everything off, after almost finishing the meal, my son noticed an ant crawling across his plate. When asking for the check, I mentioned this to the waiter, who's response was something to the effect that, "...these things happen." A brief apology, too much paid for dinner, and we were out the door...never to return.
