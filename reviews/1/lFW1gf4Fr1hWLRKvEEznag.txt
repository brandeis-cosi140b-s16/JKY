Still sucks! Owners please stop running all over the place and monitor kitchen and waitstaff.  Did you tell them all to run everywhere?
Hubby's beef tacos good.   Chicken taco tasted like cardboard. Don't even want to order,DECIDED A CHEESE CASA DIA WOULD BE SAFE. My husband can come back on his own. Me? This is the third strike! There are too many Mexican food restaurants that have great staff and good food. This is not one of them.
