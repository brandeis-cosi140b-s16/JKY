I LOVE zabas but I absolutely HATE their manager. I have never dealt with a more rude and unprofessional "manager". I was so happy I have a zabas by my house, but I rather drive to 215 and flamingo just so I don't have to deal with him. If you want to have someone roll their eyes at you and be extremely rude this location is perfect to go to. I will never go to this location again!!!!!!! I wouldn't be surprised if the employees feel the same way, he was good at ordering them around.
