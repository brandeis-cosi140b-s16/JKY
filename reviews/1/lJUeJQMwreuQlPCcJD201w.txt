I was there last week, ordered the chicken tacos; 2 tacos for $2.99 (total cost). The tacos are topped with chicken, lettuce, tomato, guacamole and a sauce. I asked that they add sour cream to them. I was not advised that this would be an extra cost although I figured it would be. What I did not realize was that I would be charged 95 cents PER TACO to add sour cream. So 2 tacos = $2.99, adding sour cream to said tacos is an additional $1.90?? How does that make sense. When I contacted the cashier about it, he said that it was their policy to charge per item and there was nothing he could do about it. I get charging per order...What a complete scam. I have been eating at Rubios in various states and locations for years. But after this I won't be back. What a bunch of greedy idiots..I mean really $1.90 for sour cream (less than a teaspoon per taco) when you get two fully loaded tacos for $2.99?!?!?! Such a rip off!!!!!
