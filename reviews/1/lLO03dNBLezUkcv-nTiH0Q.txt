Been eating here a few months now and usually get the shredded beef tacos. The tacos are amazing if you pay a little extra for extra cheese and lettuce. But every time I get something else it gets messed up or its just terrible. The last few times were the worst and that's why I decided to write a review. A few weeks ago I ordered a breakfast burrito with just veggies and my eggs has a big piece of what looked like bacon fat back or piece of ham fat. Whatever it was it was disgusting. Then i tried some Nachos, with the "carne asada" on it. Pretty sure it wasn't beef. In fact I went back another time and ordered nachos with "no beef"  and the woman on the intercom actually corrected me to call it meat, not beef. And those particular nachos were just as bad without the "meat". The cook just globbed sour cream and guacamole all over the chips so you can't pick them up. I asked for diced tomatoes and got two half tomatoes with cuts in them. Oh they forgot to put cheese on the chips.. THEY FORGOT CHEESE ON NACHOS! They garnished with cheese, on the cold ingredients so no melted cheese. So all I got was a nasty cold pile of sour cream, about two cups amount, and guacamole, about another cup, on about a handful of tortilla chips. Thank God they opened up a Juliobertos up the street so there's no reason to eat here anymore. The only reason I would is I would get off work very late and they were the only thing open. Avoid this place of you can!
