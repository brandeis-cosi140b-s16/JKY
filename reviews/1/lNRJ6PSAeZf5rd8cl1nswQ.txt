Terrible food and even worse prices. Plus why ask me for my name when I'm your only patron? 

The steak and bacon tacos were barely edible. I wanted to try something different since we don't have this chain in the Windy City but I was not impressed. The food was so terrible I got McDonald's to make up for it!
