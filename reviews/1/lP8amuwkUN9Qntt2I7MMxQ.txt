Food is less than favorable, staff was not helpful and would not honor print-out that clearly stated "no coupon necessary to redeem" Buy one, get one. Dining room was empty for a reason. No manager available to discuss issue, contacted corporate with a promise return call and assistance with adjusting issue but of course no return call. This is the second occasion with a similiar issue we have experienced with this company. We will definitely not be returning to any Qdoba at any time and for any reason.
