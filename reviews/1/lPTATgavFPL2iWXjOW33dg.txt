4 eggrolls, thick as a chap stick and twice as long = $12
Plate of romaine lettuce w/ 4 oz of beef = $12
the food here is overpriced.  the food itself is pretty bland.  we tried 3 types of noodles, eggrolls, fried rice, "mongolian beef", tacos.  the "best" was the fried rice, but fried rice is hard to mess up.  the tacos i tried were oversauced and a little undercooked.  i would honestly eat at panda express or del taco before i eat at this place again.
