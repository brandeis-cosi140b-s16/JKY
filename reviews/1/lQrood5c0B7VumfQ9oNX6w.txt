I had been wanting to try Cuzamil for a while, considering I live right up the road. My husband and I went there during the week, and the place was pretty much empty. When we FINALLY got served I could see why. This was the first "mexican" restaurant I have been to that charges you for additional chips and salsa. I ordered a taco sampler, and was extremely excited to see tongue as a option. 2 out of the 3 tacos were bland, and the tongue taco was extremely chewy, meaning it hadn't been cooked properly. We both ordered margaritas and were given what tasted like a glass of margarita mix that someone forgot to add tequila to. I can understand how any restaurant can have a bad night, but i think Robert Irvine should be called in to redo this place or another restaurant should take the space. Will not be going back because there is much better mexican in Pittsburgh than this place.
