Generally I won't write reviews for meh meals, and Cabo Wabo certainly qualified.  However they just added a new policy that earns them 1 yelp star, hidden pricing, yea deception.  They charge you a hidden "CNF" fee, which is nothing but bull.  If you want to charge more for you food, fine, go ahead and post it on the menu, don't try and hide it with some lame hidden fee.  Cabo Wabo deserves a full boycot for this sleezy tactic.  I will never patronize any establishment that uses hidden fees, and tell others to do the same.  Makes no sense, this is nothing but a another management fail.
