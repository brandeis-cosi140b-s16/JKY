My husband and I went for lunch, and promptly left after an appetizer and a glass of wine. We initially wanted to sit on the outside patio and decided to go inside as the music was so loud we found that we were shouting at each other. So we go inside which was still quite loud but we were able to have a conversation. Took a while for a server to notice we were there even though there was just one other table seated inside at the time. We  ordered the spinach dip which cold and runny, worst spinach dip ever!! Server was not very attentive so we decided that was about enough and we would much rather spend our money where we felt we were welcome. Do yourself a favor when choosing where to spend money and a nice lunch out and definitely choose another more inviting restaurant.
