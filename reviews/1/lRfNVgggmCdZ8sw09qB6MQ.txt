What the HELL is wrong with you Yelpers who like this place?!  

A rare Yelp miss, but an almost unforgivable miss.  I am tempted to write a letter to Yelp to audit the accounts who posted positive reviews for this place!  You're either tastebud deficient or a friend of the owner.

First of all, we should have walked out when we saw that two employees were just sort of lazily hangin' about and chatting it up in a booth in the back of the joint.  Both looked unkempt and disinterested; thought they for sure were just a couple of hungover college kids.

At first I thought they must be on break, but nope they were both involved in us getting our food.  Whoever is managing this place needs to get it under control.  Employees like that will kill your business!

The chips and salsa are a joke.  They are just sitting out there under a heat lamp with a sign that says, basically, please don't take too much so we can save money.  Uh,.. never seen something so remarkably cheap in my life.  Even the sign looked cheap, printed on some old paper, off center, and filthy.  The chips were hard and seemed to have been sitting out for a while and likely not fresh.  The salsa was below average and didn't taste fresh.  I am convinced the tomatoes were out of a can.

I tried their "specialty," if you dare call this piece of shit special, the Green Chili Pork Burrito.  Again, no way in hell was this fresh. Also bland and boring.  The rice was room temperature and the beans watery.

My wife thought hers was just boring and the kids barely ate it.  Stay away!!!
