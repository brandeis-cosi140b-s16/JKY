When we walked in we were greeted with an overflowing trash can right by the door. As we stood in line ordering our toppings the food prep and serving area was very messy. The person making the burritos didn't ask my son what else he wanted on the burrito, he added beans and rice and sealed it up. They refilled half empty lettuce bins with their hands and tongs, right in front of me. They put fresh produce on top of old. I should have walked out right then. The clerk didn't even know how to count change properly. Nothing about this place impressed me and with their poor health code standards, I won't be back.
