My experience was very different from the other reviews. After giving the cashier my order, I sat by a window. I calmly watched person after person park their cars, walk into the store and give their orders and receive them right away. I simply ordered nachos. After several minutes of this, I decided to ask for a refund. The manager apologized and said he will have someone make it right now. I asked" was anyone trying to fill my order before I came up?" Apparently not!!! So I wasted my entire lunch hour waiting for a dish that was never going to come. I refused the offer to "make it now" as I didn't have any time left. I had to leave hungry and pissed.
