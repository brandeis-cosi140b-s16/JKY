My girlfriend and I were very excited to try this place out. Never making the mistake of eating here again! We walked in,  place seemed okay,  then  we stood in line with one person in  front of us for about five minutes. When it was finally our turn to order the lady was very pleasant. I wish I knew her name,  she was the only thing about the place that wasn't terrible. As we move on down the line adding to our tacos and burrito the staff behind the counter seemed very disgruntled and was very rude to not just myself but the customer in front of us. When it was time to pay,  we waited about another 5 minutes for my girlfriends burrito to be ready. She ordered a shrimp burrito which for some reason takes extra long to make. $20.35 later and I was left with cold tacos,  stale chips,  and a burrito where the shrimp tasted off. As if overpaying for crap food wasn't bad enough,  the dining area was filthy. Food trays and wrappers left all over the place,  food crumbs and mess littered table tops as well as seats. We found the only place that wasn't filthy. While eating we saw four employees take a break almost at the same time. One kid who worked there walked around and picked up trays,  then went outside never to be seen again. Food crumbs still everywhere. One employee sat fairly close to us,  kicking back,  on break I assume. So it wasn't a mystery to staff that this place looked like a train wreck. Bottom line,  I will never come here again,  and I will be sure to tell all of my friends in this area to never come here.
