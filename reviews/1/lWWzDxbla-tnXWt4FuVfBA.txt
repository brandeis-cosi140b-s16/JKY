Food came out cold and when we told hostess she got the manager right  away. Unfortunately he was useless. Watched our waitress take our food back and wasn't going to speak to us even to apologize. I had to ask him if he was the manager. When I restated the fact that our food was cold, his response was "do you want me to reheat it for you". I was so disgusted by his unprofessional and lack of care attitude. Worse customer service. I will never support this restaurant.
