This place just recently use to be a great family owned tacos shop in North Las Vegas. $1 tacos!!! But unfortunately it seems to have a new name and possibly new owners. $2 tacos now!!! So now my normal order of $10 is now $20. No thank you they lost a loyal customer. And I live literally 2 mins away. Don't waste your time.
