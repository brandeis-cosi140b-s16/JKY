I really been wanting to try this place for a while but unfortunately my experience was a sad one :(. The good stuff i saw: a good variety of beers and drinks, extensive menu  and online ordering available.

I got 3 tacos and 1 arepa, the food was really good but I don't think I'll be waiting another 45 minutes for some tacos, especially when the concept of the restaurant is fast food. 

The tables were really dirty and no one was checking this aspect of the place after people were leaving their tables. I think that it has great potential if it's properly staffed and some training is involved for customer service.

Having so many fantastic establishments in Charlotte, I won't be wasting my patience here again :(
