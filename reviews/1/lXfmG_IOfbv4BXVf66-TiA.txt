If I could give zero stars I would.

I was a huge fan of agave, the restaurant that was here previously, me and my family would come pretty regularly, that all changed tonight! 

By far the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant, after a nice long wait for a table we were greeted by a sour attitude waitress, waited ten min for water, and another 30 min to order food. With crapy wanna be salsa and something that they tried to pass as guacamole to keep us company I felt this dinner quickly going down the drain 

The menu selection is extremely poor, I'm not sure how they can call it Mexican food..  

To what seemed like an hour wait and I'm sure it was close to that since it took us from 7 pm till 9:45 to finally leave.. we got our sad pitiful over priced sorry excuse for mex food. the food was cold and way to spicy for something on the menu that wasn't supposed to be. It took 3 times to ask for a side of sour cream, They brought out rice and beans for table share and when it was set on the table I laughed !! Think one bite wonder for something that was supposed to feed 6 people

When I said something to a manager about how I was extremely disappointed with everything she looked at me confused and just asked if we wanted dessert I declined and just wanted the bill ( no apology and deff nothing was done about the check either) 

So we will never be going back, and sorry to say I don't see a successful business happing there

Come back agave !!!
