I have passed this little place by a million times on random trips to the grocery store. Today my husband and I finally popped in for a quick, cheap lunch. While we weren't expecting Frontera Grill, we were appalled with the MOLDY breading on the fish tacos. We brought it to the attention of the gal taking orders, and were offered a replacement (pass) but no refund. We won't be back.
