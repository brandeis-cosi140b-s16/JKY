So I went to check out the container area in Downtown Vegas and love the vibe they have going on. I had heard of pinches tacos and thought great let me check it out. I saw them preparing some burritos and first thing I thought was that the burritos were small and saw that there was not enough meat on them. The cook saw me make a face and he added more meat to them. Its obvious he did this just so I would order.  At this point I should have left but my family was already seated so I ordered just a few items.I ordered two asada burritos, 1 chicken taco and 1large orchata. The burritos are small mainly rice and beans. The rice didnt have a good taste to it, it tasted watered down. Beans didnt impress either.The meat although I thought was good quality meat it didnt have much flavoring to it, more like tasteless.   Did I mention I ordered an asada burrito for 9.95 ? Could have fooled me I thought I ordered a rice and bean burrito there was hardly any meat on there. The plate came with a few chips and some tasteless days old salsa ...again disappointed. My daughter had the chicken taco for 2.70.... two tortillas would have been nice but it comes with one. Now the orchata  was good but 3.00 for the large and that was the smallest large container I have seen. I get that they are the clear nicer cups but the price should be less.  While I was  there I noticed the corn on the cob that looked delicious and was reasonably priced but after the disappointing meal I wanted to just leave.  I dont know if all pinches tacos are as stingy with the meat like this location is but beware.  Will never come back to this restaurant again.
