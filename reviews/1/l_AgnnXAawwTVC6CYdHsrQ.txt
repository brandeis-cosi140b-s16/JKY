I'm surprised this KFC/Taco Bell has no reviews. Nevertheless, this location, in my opinion, is the worst ever. I used to use the drive-thru, but after an incorrect order almost every time, I've found it easier to just go inside. But then, even when ordering inside, orders are still wrong. The food is the same as all the other KFCs and Taco Bells, but the staff is what brings this place down. Tonight they were out of chicken. Out of chicken! Well, out of Extra Crispy. And even what they did have was not enough to fill an 8-piece meal without mixing Original & Extra Crispy. That's fine, okay, I'll take it. But then I observed as the employee preparing my order grabbed a bunch of individual sized containers of cole slaw and dumped them into a larger container for my order. What? Oh well, it's still yummy. It just seems like this spot needs to be organized and trained a little more. Why do I return? Because it is convenient and the closest KFC to home.
