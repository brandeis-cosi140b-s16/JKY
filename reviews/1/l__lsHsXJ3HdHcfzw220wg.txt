Horrible service. I mean HORRIBLE. 

Went during a non-peak time. Pretty quiet in there, not a lot going on. Three employees who were sitting around chatting watched me and my my disabled, elderly friend stand and wait for long, endless minutes without doing anything. I finally went over to the bartender - also hanging out and chatting and watching us stand there - to ask if a hostess was available. Her response? "Oh, I can seat you."

Really? Then why did I have to ask you to!?

Then, the young male waiter assigned to our table just laughed when my companion asked where the restrooms are. WTF?

Look, guys, that would be crummy service to anyone, but to treat an elderly person with a disability like that is just unconscionable. 

We left and won't be back.
