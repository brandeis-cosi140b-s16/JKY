I will not be back at all! The last time I went was the final straw. It took an hour for the two of us to get food and there where only about 5 tables with people at them. There was a table of 4 sat after we where that got their food, eaten and left before our food even arrived at the table. The server never came back for drink refills and when I asked to talk to the manager she claimed that they where really busy and that she was sorry it had taken so long. If the food had been good then it wouldn't have been as big of a problem but it looked like someone threw up on my plate. SO NASTY!
