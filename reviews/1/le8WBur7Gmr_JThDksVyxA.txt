All i can review is the service because i never had a chance to try the food. Went there first thing when they opened to avoid a lunch rush.  On arrival they asked if we wanted a booth or half table/half booth.  We decided on the half booth table.  They said because we wanted the half booth/table it would be a five minute wait.  Which is not bad.  So we sat and waited to be seated.  

After about five minutes a big table arrived that needed tables put together out something to accommodate them.  The wait staff promptly addressed their seating needs and sat them.  While the greeter was occupied a couple more small tables came in and were promptly seated.  We noticed that they were seating all these people ahead of us.  We were just a party of two.  We immediately told the greeter that we would take any table that would get us seated.  

I think she realized she had been seating people and forgot about us.  Instead of addressing the problem she advised us that regardless of table or the half option we would still have to wait about five minutes. 

Since we had already been sitting a while and saw multiple tables seated we decided that we would go next door to Mimi's.

I will not be back.  The greeter clearly lacked the ability to prioritize and work front of house.
