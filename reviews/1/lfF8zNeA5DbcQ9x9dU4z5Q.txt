My wife and I were really looking forward to eating at Popos. Our chiropractor  said he really enjoyed Popos. The Yelp reviews were positive. 
   We had a 20 minute  wait before we were seated. 
We were served chips and salsa. The salsa was really really good. We were seated next to a  birthday party with maybe 25-30 people. We ordered the jalape√±o poppers which took almost 1/2 an hour to arrive. For our meal we ordered two taco platters.  It was over an hour before two fish tacos and one carne asada  taco to finally arrive. My wife and I had ordered the same thing something we seldom do. We usually order lots of variety  and split everything. 
The rice and beans looked ok. The tacos not so much. They were each wrapped in two cold tortillas. It's as if they took them right out of a package without any preparation. The tacos looked weird in those tortillas,very unappealing. I grabbed the tortillas and put them to the side.and started to taste the insides of a fish taco. The flavor and the quality was horrible. My wife was having the same experience. Neither one of us had tried the Carne 
asada taco. At this point we told the waiter of our displeasure. He asked if we wanted to get something else. After waiting so long we said no thank you.
