These people don't even try!
I have never complained about food from a restaurant and I don't make special requests. I have tried to eat here 7 times and they have Never got my order right. The salsa is always old. I just ordered a burro and when I got home the receipt in the bag said it was 4 beef tacos, two didn't even have meat on them, none what so ever.  You could be the only person there and it will always take forever. I have always been burned by this place. Save your time and money. Good food takes time. So spend the time to drive else where.  It's a real bummer because the next taco stand is miles away.  Wait till they go under and some other taco shop opens in the same location.
