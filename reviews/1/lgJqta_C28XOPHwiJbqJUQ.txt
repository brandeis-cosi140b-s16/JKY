I came to the Las Vegas ASD Trade show and stopped by this Chipotle location at the fashion show mall around 8pm on 8/02/15 to get a "healthy meal" before I went to bed early. I ordered a burrito bowl and about 4-5 hours later I got severe food poisoning. I was throwing up all night and ended up having to go to the emergency room. The doctor at the urgent care assured me it was food poisoning. Because of your food, I ended up missing the first day of the trade show that I have been prepping for, for almost 2 months and spent thousands of dollars setting up. That is NOT ACCEPTABLE, and I can't even calculate how much potential business I lost. The next three days of the show I was also feeling very sick but forced myself to get up and get to work while being extremely sick. 

After going to the chipotle website and speaking with Jessica, all she had to say was "well I have good news, it wasn't chipotle according to my investigation"... I think maybe she feels that a doctor who went to school for 10 years is wrong. The only thing I had to eat that day was chipotle besides my normal protein shakes that I always have. And the only thing I was throwing up was chipotle, then after I threw up the chipotle, every time I drank water I was throwing that up too. I would like to say that I have never in my life had food poisoning until this incident, and I have not been sick for the past 6 years of my life. My medical history will prove that. I believe I have a pretty strong immune system as I stay healthy and workout regularly.

I'm completely appalled by not only the restaurants food, but also the customer service provided by Jessica. She had told me she would continue her investigation and get back to me, but I haven't heard back from her since.
