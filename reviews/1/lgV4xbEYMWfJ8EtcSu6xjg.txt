Chose the restaurant because it was a beautiful day and we wanted to sit outside. Got a seat on the patio, which was nice. Good food but abysmal service. Didn't see a staff member for the first 12 minutes and received our lunch salads 25 min after that. No drink refills. Had to stand up to get attention so that we could pay our bill. It'll probably do okay since it's in a tourist shopping center, but I won't be going back.
