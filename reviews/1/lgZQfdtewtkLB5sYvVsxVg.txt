Food was ok. But for two not worth $17. Lady seemed like he was in a bad mood and ordered wahoo bowl because of the mango salsa. Got my food did not have mango salsa. Asked for extra because they forgot and she said actually were out. Tell your customers before they pay! Not after you gave them their food!
