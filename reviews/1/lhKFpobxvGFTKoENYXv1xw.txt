My wife drove up today and no one was attending the drive through. She finally went in and everyone was in the back of the restaurant and she had to get their attention. She ordered the two taco meal. There was hardly a teaspoon's worth of meat in both of them. I think there's new management or extreme lack thereof. See the pic to believe.
