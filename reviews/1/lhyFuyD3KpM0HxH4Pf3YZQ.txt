This is just another mediocre at best Mexican hole in the wall attempting to make good food with cheap ingredients.  According to the picture menu on the wall I had a chile relleno & enchilada with refried beans and rice & a side of chips and guacamole.   The rice served at my elementary school cafeteria had more taste.  Refried beans tasted like it came from a can out of a discount dollar store.  Before today, I didn't know it was possible to mess up guacamole... reminded me of watered down Nicolodeon slime.  I have to stop writing about the food because even thinking about it is tying my stomach into knots. 

Customer service... if you call a kid giving you a blank empty stare that has the character of a piece of broken off pencil lead customer service, then yeah it was great.  Person in front of me asked for some lemon for his soda, after the 45 second blankness lifted from his face the cashier managed to compute what was being requested of him... he disappeared for a couple minutes and came back and handed the customer a small paper bag.  The customer sat back down at his table and opens the bag to find one whole uncut lime.  WTF?! Haha... nope, I absolutely have nooooooo reason to come back.  I can't imagine this place staying open very long.
