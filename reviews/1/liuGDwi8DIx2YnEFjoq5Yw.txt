I have been here 5 or 6 times and the food has always been pretty good.  The one consistent thing about this place has always the service, or lack there of.  Employees are less than friendly and it feels as if I'm inconveniencing them by asking questions about the menu.

This morning I stopped in at 10:33a to purchase a couple of breakfast burritos and was shocked to hear they were done serving breakfast at 10:30.  Really, like making a couple of green chili burritos at 10:30 in the am is inconceivable. They looked at me like I was crazy.

Won't be coming back.
