My family and I were looking for somewhere inexpensive and were craving Mexican when we decided to try this place out.  We found them in our Entertainment book and decided to give it a try.  We were disappointed when we got there as they would not honor the coupon but we chose to stay anyway. Big mistake!! My food was atrocious and almost inedible. I ordered their beef tacos and what I got was beef jerky in almost burnt shells. My fianc√©'s burrito was dry and had no flavor.  The best thing we had was the chips and salsa which unfortunately was lacking in quantity.  Won't be returning :(
