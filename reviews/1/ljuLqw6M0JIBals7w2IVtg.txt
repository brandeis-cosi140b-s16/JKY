Saturday night. I was excited to give it a shot, and as it turned out the food was pretty good. I'm actually eating my leftover fried rice as I write this. 

We ordered nachos for an appetizer, two rolls(pretty tasty, too much sauce on the kamikaze), two small fried rice sides(solid portion size). The food was good. No problems there. 

But the service. Man. I can't think of a worse experience. Only one server on the floor, and he should have been a bus boy at best. Managers nowhere to be seen. It took an hour to get the second roll after about 45 minutes to get the first. The waiter "forgot to write it down" and when he took our order the first time. They sent 2 of the same rolls out that we had ordered to "his sisters table" after he re-entered our order, even though we watched them come in at least half an hour after us. It was comically poor service. 

I hope management reads the reviews. The service was just so bad I don't really know what to say. You won't last much longer if that's how you run your business.
