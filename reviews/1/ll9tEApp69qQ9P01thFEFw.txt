High hopes but sadly disappointed. Not expensive but added up quickly. Girls seemed like they'd rather be anywhere but there with a splash of conceitedness. We asked if the habanero guacamole was really spicy or just had a hint of the flavor and the employee said it wasn't spicy at all. So for $6.00 we got it and the portion was ridiculously small. Robertos gives more food than that and actually would have rather gone there . The portions were way smaller than expected especially bc the heavier set girl said they were big enough to share. WRONG.
