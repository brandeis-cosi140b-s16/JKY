Very poor service when we went in. It wasn't very busy but we waited after being seated,  and waited  patiently, until my hubby got up and went to the restroom and saw three servers and a manager just standing around and came back to the table to find  a server STILL hadn't come by we decided to leave  When a server waited on a table near us and left without saying a word to us, it's pretty bad.  There's a story for each side,  but I don't know what theirs would be cause they were slow enough to have people stand around.  We went down the road to Macayos. Much much better experience.
