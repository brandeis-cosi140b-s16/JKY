My sister and I LOVE Chipotle. She comes to this location a lot. I go to many locations and have never had such a bad experience. We counted 15 people working...15!!  There was ONE employee who came to the counter and took our order. Everyone else appeared to be doing 'something' or just chatting it up laughing and trying not to make eye contact with all the customers waiting. The line grew longer and no one else came to help her out. Needless to say...if there was an option to give negative stars this would be one of those occasions.
