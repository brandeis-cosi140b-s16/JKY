Service at night was VERY VERY slow. I was charged for the wrong items, never got 1 refill and never was asked if my food was OK.  The server seemed new at her job because she had to ask others questions about orders etc. Perhaps she should have had help! Well, food was not very good and I left her a nice big $0.00 tip for the worst service I have had in awhile.
