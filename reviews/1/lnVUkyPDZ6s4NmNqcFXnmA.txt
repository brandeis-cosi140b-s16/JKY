Wow.  And this is by no means a good wow.  Went there with the boyfriend today and have to say Cuzamil did do something extraordinary.  It won the award for the absolute worst "Mexican" food I have ever put in my mouth.  

We went on a lazy Sunday afternoon, around 1:30, and we saw that they had some lunch specials.  I told my boyfriend that I wanted to try Mexican food in Pittsburgh because since I've been here...I haven't seen any.  The standard chips and salsa was blah.  The tortilla chips seemed (days?) old and were really cold.  The salsa was decent.  

My boyfriend ordered the pork carnita tacos and I am a huge fan of chili rellenos, and so I wanted to test them out here.  Big effin mistake.  A chili relleno (although there are variations of the rule) is a pablano pepper, with an egg battered crust, stuffed with cheese and meat.  This was an abomination of a chili relleno...a defected, ugly step-brother, if you will.  Instead, what I got was a thin slice of a GREEN BELL PEPPER, with a greasy, yellow mound of ground beef, and a 3 inch hunk of melted white cheese on top.  It was sitting, along with my rice and canned re-re-refried bean, on a pool of yellow grease.

Don't go there.  I beg of you.  My boyfriend and I made jokes after we left about how our stomachs were really mad at us and just wanted to be left alone for a while.

*Note - When paying the check I asked the waitress if the owner was Mexican.  She happily explained that he was and so was the kitchen staff. This pretty much says that they indeed know how to make proper food, but don't.  Probably because they know people won't notice or complain.  Or because the guy is really, really cheap.  Blah.
