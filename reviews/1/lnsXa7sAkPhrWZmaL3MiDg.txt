I've never really had buyer's remorse for something as simple & inexpensive as a burrito...until today.  Shelled out $9+ for their Badger burrito. The meat was cooked decently which is the only good thing about it (and the burrito was substantial.) the mix of beef, rice, guac & pico made for a weird flavor with some random sweet/smokey undertones that were horrible. This burrito had fries in it but they seemed almost raw, looking white. Cheese?  Hardly. The soupy mess made the tortilla break and by half way thru I couldn't stand the flavor anymore and I quit. First time I've ever quit on a burrito. For $9 I learned it's possible to hate a burrito, I have gooey brown liquid on my shirt & I donated at least a half pound of food to a landfill.

With all those bad tastes I'll never go back as one of those will cross into whatever I eat.
