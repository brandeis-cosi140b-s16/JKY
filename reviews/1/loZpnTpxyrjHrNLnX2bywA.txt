I love Chipotle and will continue to be a fan. However, this particular location is terrible. Shame on me for subjecting myself to it multiple times, but I guess I just wanted to believe they would do better. It has never once been consistent. Overly salty rice, over cooked meat, burnt tortillas and irregular portion sizes. Continual disappointment spooned onto every tortilla and into every bowl down the line. I like avacados, but when I ask for guacamole I expect to be given guacamole and not the whole avocado. Step up your game Dana Park Chipotle.
