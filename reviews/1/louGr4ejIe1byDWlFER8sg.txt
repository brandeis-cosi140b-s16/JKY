Went here last night waited at the entrance to be seated as the sign said. Waited about 5 minutes before being acknowledged should have been a sign to leave. When someone came to help was told it was open seating. Sat outside again waited a long time for service.  Lack of interest from all staff. Toilets weren't clean and no paper in any of the 5 restrooms. Asked to speak to a manager and told he wasn't on site. Been here a few times. Seems the place is going downhill fast. Food tends to be cold regularly
