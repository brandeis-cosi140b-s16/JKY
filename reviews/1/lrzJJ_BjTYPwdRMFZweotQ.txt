I live close to El Gordito super market, I go there NOT so often, there are flys EVERYWHERE! The hot and ready food that is out to serve is always left open. The food gets dried, they still serve it that way! Dried food + flys = NASTY! I Bought a Torta and when I tried it, the meat was ROTTEN. Tasted Disgusting! Also, You can see Flys in the glass display, where the Bread is in! Gross!
