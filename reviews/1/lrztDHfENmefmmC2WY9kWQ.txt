Recently moving from Las Cruces, NM where the only other Si Señor restaurant is (and absolutely loved going there (at least once a week)), I was extremely disappointed when I came to this location. I was really hoping I would be able to come here and enjoy some good New Mexican food that would remind me of home. First off, the overall ambience of the restaurant seemed dull and unauthentic. My girlfriend and I both ordered margaritas to start off. We were extremely unsatisfied with the size as well as the taste (it seemed as if they were made with cheap margarita mix had only a drop of tequila in them). The ones in Las Cruces were delicious and served in large, cold glass whereas these seemed to come in something equivalent to a sippy cup-sized plastic cup. Did I mention that it tasted like cheap margarita mix and no alcohol? They were rubbish. We also received the chips and salsa (which was mine and also my grandma's favorite part of coming to Si Señor), and my anticipation was totally shot down by the stale chips and tasteless assortment of salsas and dips. My grandma would be horrified if she had been there. She may be Filipino, but she knows what real Mexican food tastes like. Then there was the food. Bland, boring, room temperature and did not remind me of home. If Chef Ramsey was there, I can almost guarantee he would be extremely unsatisfied and then make a scene. We also received sopapillas at the end of our meal and those were as well bland and room temperature and also stale. In conclusion, I was very unsatisfied with my visit to this Si Señor location. If I'm not mistaken, a husband and wife own this chain, so my message to the manager of this restaurant, you've been away from New Mexico for too long and have no bloody idea what you're doing. Step it up and provide the citizens of Maricopa county with some delicious, warm and enjoyable New Mexican Cuisine. 
P.S. Your margaritas are pathetic and you need to step those up as well.
