My co-workers and I went to Barrio Cafe to celebrate our boss' birthday.  We were very dissappointed.  Thought the food was ok, the service was HORRIBLE.  From the beginning, the waiter appeared as if though we were bothering him and wished we werent there.  I have never eaten at a location where the waiter only gives water to the guests and never bothers to take a drink order.  The food order took a ridiculous amount of time.  ALL of the tables that were around us that were seated AFTER we had ordered, were finised with their meal before we were even served ours.  When we asked the waiter about our order, he very rudely informed us that our food would be served when it was done.  WOW, that is some amazing customer service.  We asked to speak to the manager but that did not do anything.  When our food was being served, the waiter informed us that our food took exactly 23 minutes, though it had been 1 hour since we had ordered.  Nice to know that the waiter waited 40 minutes to put in our order and no, we did not order any appetizers.  Needless to say, I will never return to this restaurant.  I would much rather eat at the local Ranch Market than return to Barrio Cafe.  It is unfortunate because I really wanted to like this place.  

The food was OK but not anything that WOWed me enough to return after such horrible service.  We all honestly thought we were in one of those hidden camera shows like "Boiling Points" because he was sure pushing it.  

It would have also been nice to have been informed of the $1 per person plate charge for our cake that we brought in.  He could have at least cut and served the cake for that price.  All he did was bring us plates but did not provide us with a knife or anything.  I would NOT recommend Barrio Cafe to anyone, much less a group of more than 2.
