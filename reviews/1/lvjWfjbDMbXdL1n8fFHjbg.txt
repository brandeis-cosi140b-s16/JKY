Arizona is one of the few states that does Mexican food right. This place apparently did not get the memo. The experience wasn't all bad. The margarita's were good, and the chips were good as well. That's about as good as it got. The salsa was flavorful, but lacked any sort of spice. I did get a side of "hot sauce" but it tasted like tomato sauce mixed with chili seasoning (not spicy at all). 

I ordered the mini chimi's, chili con queso, and a cup of tortilla soup for my daughter and I to split. 

The tortilla soup was terrible! It lacked any sort of flavor, and had more tortilla strips and cheese than anything. Very few vegetables (no avocado?!?), and hardly any chicken. I've had better soup from a can to be perfectly honest. 

The chili con queso dip was average, but nothing special. Pretty sure it was the Velveeta with Rotel chili recipe. 

The mini chimi's were greasy! Upon taking my first bite, grease literally came out the other side and ran down my hand.  GROSS!

The service was decent, but not memorable. 

All in all, I wouldn't recommend Popo's to anyone who had high expectations for their Mexican craving.
