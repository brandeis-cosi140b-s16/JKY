I gave this place a shot even after reading all the negative feedbacks. Wanted to see it for myself & not to believe everything I read...BOY WAS I WRONG! should of stayed home.  

Serrano's food is disgusting.... completely over price & they rip you off on the portions. The servers are condescending, lazy & rude.

Would never dine here again....I will dam make sure my friends, neighbors & co-workers would never either. A big compliant was made but was not taken seriously. Customers should be top priority...we're the reason why they have jobs. 

The word will get out & eventually they will go out of business. It's a big surprise they're still in business with all the negative feedbacks they have already. 
Val Vista & Guadalupe location is absolutely the worst location to visit.
