I decided to walk in versus using the drive thru to insure my order wasn't screwed up.  Upon entering, I was greeted in some foreign language I don't understand and was called out by the lady at the counter for not speaking in her native tongue.  Surely not a warm greeting to this 1st time customer.  I tried to order several items on the menu, but was limited on my selections as they were out of chicken & ground beef.  

I ordered 2 shredded beef enchiladas with verde (green) sauce, 1 bean & cheese burrito and 2 carne asada tacos.  The lady told me they didn't have verde sauce so I went ahead with the red.  After ordering, she questioned me again about why I didn't speak Spanish and asked if it bothered me that I didn't.  After waiting a few short minutes, they had my food boxed up and bagged ready to go.

When I got home, I was not at all shocked to see they fucked up on 2 of the 3 items ordered.  The bean & cheese burrito was rice and hardly any cheese and the shredded beef enchiladas were just cheese with no shredded beef...again, hardly any cheese.  Pretty much rolled tortillas drowning in red sauce.  The carne asada meat was half inedible gristle which I gave to my dogs.  ALL the food was cold...I live less than 3 minutes from this joint.

I should've bolted when the lady at the counter started to comment to her coworker that I didn't speak Spanish.  Also, there were no other customers...another red flag.  Well, she can't use the excuse of the language barrier as the reason they screwed up as I was charged for what I ordered on my receipt.

My gut to avoid this place for the last few years was spot on.  Now unfortunately, my gut is gurgling pretty loud.  Skip this place where incompetence runs rampant.  Roberto's is right down the road a few blocks away.
