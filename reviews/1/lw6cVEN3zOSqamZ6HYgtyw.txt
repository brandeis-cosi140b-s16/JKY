Sadly, Macayo is no longer on my Faves list.  I have put up with the non existent customer service at each restaurant through the years, always moving on to another location.  But, today, alas, was the last time I will go to Macayo.  The issues are restaurant wide, so this is not necessarily just about the Ahwatukee restaurant.  I have frequented, on a regular basis, the stores in Mesa, the Depot Cantina, Prescott, Central, Tucson (both), Glendale, Scottsdale and Thunderbird.  

1.  Today I went for a late lunch, and arrived at 2:40 pm (lunch menu ends at 3 pm) Had to track down a hostess to seat us;  Was told that lunch was over even though it was still before 3 pm.  When I inquired, "sorry..."
2.  Was seated and sat and sat and sat...one of the other guests actually mentioned that they too had waited and waited for service.  There were other guests in the restaurant, but the employees seemed to be missing.

We left after waiting15 minutes to be acknowledged.  

Now these issues don't seem bad enough to give up my weekly trek to Macayo's, but after having a Manager regularly park in the " take out" spot because "I'm the manager;" being given the check when we never received our food after a very long wait for our order to be taken; being served beef that was definitely bad and then being told that I must be new to the Valley, since that's how it 'always' tastes; receiving someone else's to-go order, after checking the order, I was told that I must be incorrect about the order that I placed and so on and on and on.

Believe me, I tried to share some of these things with the management, but they were patronizing and had lots and lots of excuses.

The food has slowly declined, the service (obviously) is not what it should be, the seasoned staff seem tired.  

I wonder what Woody would say???  There is so much competition out there, I hope they are reading these types of reviews and making changes.
