This review is about the customer service I received from the manager. I am extremely disappointed with Viva Mercado's policy regarding large parties. I wanted to have my day's 60th birthday here. To hold a reservation for 20-25, I had to leave my credit card number. I totally understand this...HOWEVER, I was told that I would have to pay $15 for every person that did not come. In addition, I was told that they would not accommodate separate checks for parties of 3-4, even with gratuity added. After asking for separate tables near each other, I was told they could not guarantee that. Obviously, I decided not to have my father's party here and instead moved it to Bonito Michoacan. Bonito Michoacan was more than accommodating with all of my requests. Their menu was less expensive and the food was equally as good. I have decided to take my business elsewhere and will not return to Viva Mercados. My experience with them has left me with a bitter taste, and I feel my money would be better spent at a restaurant that still remembers to put the customer first.
