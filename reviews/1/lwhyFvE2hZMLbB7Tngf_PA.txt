It took me over an hour to get my lunch today.  We had reservations for lunch.  They knew that there was a conference going on and it didn't matter.  I left the restaurant 1:40 minutes after I arrived.  There were no refills on water or ice tea.  I had to ask for a spoon for my coffee. We asked to be plated seperately just to get some food.  We asked for chips because some of us were very hungry.  It's not a surprise to see that the Scottsdale location is closed if this is how they treat a table of 11.  We did speak with the manager but she blamed it on the full kitchen.  Horrible way to treat people.
