I stopped in here on Tuesday afternoon since I was craving some Mexican food. 

Sadly the food was semi cold and there was no taste to their food. I was very disappointed and would never go back here again even if the food was free. 

I ordered the nachos and it was just nacho cheese sauce, a little bit of meat, tomatoes, and some sour cream. Nothing special I did not even like the seasoning for their meat.
