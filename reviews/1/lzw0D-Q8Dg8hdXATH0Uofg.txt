October of 2009, this restaurant gives a $100 gift certificate with no expiration date to a Catholic preschool for a charity auction. June 2010, we gather a group of people and try to use it. The owner says he will not honor it because he now gives out gift cards, not paper certificates so he does't consider it valid any longer and the only thing he will do is give a discount depending upon how much and what is ordered (something about the fact that they have higher margins on some menu items). No matter what logical arguments we made (i.e. no expiration date, it was donated as a charity auction item that someone paid money for, we had a big group that is now extremely upset with his restaurant, etc.), they wouldn't honor it. I really can't understand their business practices and question their values, ethics, etc. Will NEVER eat at this restaurant again and would suggest others do the same out of principle.
