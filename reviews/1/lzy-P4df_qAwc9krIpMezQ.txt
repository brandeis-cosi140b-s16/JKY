The salsa had no taste, it was just ridiculously hot. If you enjoy sweating while you eat, maybe thumping your chest & proclaiming how tough you are, it might be just what you're looking for. 

The food was bland & literally covered in thick skin of cheese that was also tasteless. Or who knows, maybe my taste buds were just shot after the salsa! 

The margaritas were OK, but not good enough to make me want to go back. 

The waitress was very nice & they had lively decor & music.
