This is my first Yelp review, and so it should say something that I'm taking the time to write 1.) a negative one, and 2.) one on a relatively obscure business. We were visiting family in Casa Grande, and they recommended this place after having some reasonable food there previously. Unfortunately, we enjoyed only average fare compounded by "mixed" service (the younger hostess was extremely nice, the older waitress extremely rude) and at least a 30-minute wait for our entrees. This seems to be a common theme with many of the recent reviews. In sum, I'd skip this place, as there has to be better alternatives in the area.
