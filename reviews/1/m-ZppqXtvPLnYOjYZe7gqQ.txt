Not a soul in the place at lunchtime - but I had read raving Yelp reviews so I went in anyway. Big mistake. I asked the waitress what everyone loves and tried her recommendation. Well it was terrible dried out chicken.Couldn't chew it. When I politely took it back up to the counter, the owner/cook? tried to explain that they fry the chicken on the grill and that's how it's suppose to look. I have no idea what others are raving about.
