I gave it 1 start because I couldn't rate it less then that! I went there today and order 1 chicken burrito and 2 tostadas. The burrito was very small, like a taco and very bland! The tostadas was swimming in clear liquid, and the tostadas was soggy and yucky looking. I asked the waiter could I have 2 fresh tostadas without all the liquid in the plate, he then brought me out 2 plane tostadas (just the hard shell) that wasn't even warm. I explained to him I wanted a whole new plate and he wasn't willing to make me one so I didn't eat any of it. I just left out! I was HIGHLY disappointed and upset because I passed a few of my favorite Mexican restaurants to give them a try and the food and service was HORRIBLE!!! My phone was dead so I could not take any pictures which I really regret!!
