2nd review for what used to be one of our favorites... used to be.
Came here today-
We finished our basket of chips before the drinks came out. There were three tables in the restaurant so not sure what took so long, but we were well beyond thirsty.
Husband ordered his carne asada burrito with guac and sour cream on the side, so naturally it came out with it on top. 
I had the huevos rancheros and asked for a corn instead of a flour tortilla- you guessed it, I got the flour.

Our waitress took so long to check on us we just decided to deal with it and eat anyway since we were hungry. Halfway done with the food before we were asked how it all was. Just responded with a shrug.

Sat there for 10 minutes after we finished eating. Where is she? Where is our tab? Nowhere to be seen. Finally my husband got up and found her socializing behind the scenes. He asked her to bring the check.

Okay so get this. 
Each diet Pepsi (which were flat) cost $2.50. No refills were offered.
Carne burrito served enchilada style A LA CARTE came out to be around $14... Lol! What?!
My huevos was around $10.
The food was ok. The service was negligent and deplorable. 

This experience cost $31.50... seems high for Rositas, especially given there were a few booths that looked pretty dilapidated and there was a hole in the wall in front of one. 
1 star... for the food today, and fond memories in visits past. But we won't be back.
