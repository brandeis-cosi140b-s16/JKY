The worst Roberto's I've ever been too! It's so close to me and I keep trying it out hoping it will be better but it is always terrible! Beans like mud, cheese is never melted and corn tortillas are cold and nasty! I couldn't even eat my meal tonight. Lesson learned. I'll be driving to Rancho & Craig from now on.
