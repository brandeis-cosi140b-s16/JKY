Five months ago, I ordered a "carne Asada" that sent me straight to the hospital, Possible food poisoning. Yesterday, and against my better judgment, my wife convinced me to try the restaurant again. Huge mistake. In the menu they have the "Ocho Locos Tacos", being 3       chicken tacos or 3 beef tacos, I requested to have 2 beef tacos and one chicken taco. The server refused to take the order. So I talked to the manager and he treated me like I was a nuisance and explained that the plates are pre-prepared and they cannot alter the way they are presented. Obviously the food is really processed someplace else. Ughh! So, I ordered the Chicken tortilla soup and some tacos. The soup arrived VERY COLD. I complained to the server and she looked at me like I had just arrived from Mars. So I asked for the bill for the 2 beers we ordered and told her that I would not pay for the COLD SOUP or the other plate.
The manager came to the table and offered a tepid apology.
Needless to say, this was our very last visit to this place. I promise!
Management does not understand the value of client sensitivity and customer service. I promise.
