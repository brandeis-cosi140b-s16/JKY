This location changed their prices without notice, $1 tacos are now $1.29 and they don't take the Ballantyne Corporate card anymore for a discount on regular priced entrees.  When asked the cashier didn't have a good answer, basically just deal with it.

With these changes the price for value ratio is way off, this is my last visit.
