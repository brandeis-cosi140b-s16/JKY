The staff here is never welcoming, rather they just stand there, say nothing, and don't greet you when you walk in. That should have been my first clue. My first couple times here were alright, no noticeable problems other than the fact that you have to yell to even be heard over the sneeze guard, and the cooks almost constantly get the order wrong and it has to be remade before it hits the end of the line.

My most recent time here has caused me to never want to return again. I went there when it wasn't that busy at all, so I figured it wouldn't be too bad. I usually order steak tacos for my boyfriend and a chicken salad for myself, pretty simple order with minimal alterations. When I went up to order and told them I wanted the steak tacos, the kid that was taking my order made a face at me and was silent (okay...wtf). I of course inquired why he was making the face and he finally answered that they were out of steak and in the process of making the next batch. Could have just said that from the start...awkward! Anyways, I end up waiting about 10 minutes for the steak to be ready. All the while the restaurant ends up emptying out until I am literally the only customer there. By the time they yell for me to inform me that the steak is ready and they are making my tacos, I go up to the register and my salad is already made. Weird, because I never told them what I wanted in there in the first place. So they rushed through making it for literally NO REASON. Hmm. I had it remade and to no surprise, as many other reviewers on here have noted, there was a chicken bone in my salad and the middle of the lettuce (which usually should never be in a quality salad) was in there and it literally looked like someone crapped out a salad and decided to sell it. Will never ever be coming back here again!
