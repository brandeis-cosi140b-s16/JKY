I'm not sure what all the fuss is about. We came in and ordered 6 different tacos in order to get an appropriate idea of the restaurants flavor. Shrimp taco was fishy. Pork was flavorless. Beef taco actually had a piece of melted plastic. A joke. The manager was amazing and actually comped our whole meal but I still am giving one star because the food was not even worth that.
