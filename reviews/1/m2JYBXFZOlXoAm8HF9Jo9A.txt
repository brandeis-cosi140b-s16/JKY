If you wanna have honestly the WORST wannabe Mexican food in sin city , well go to Diablos !!! Taco Bell food is gourmet compared to this crap ...  I went during happy hour & there's no happy hour food just horrible tasting non discounted margaritas . I ordered a pitcher of mango margaritas & from where I was sitting I saw it being prepared from canned kerns nectar & house tequila instead of the premium tequila from the menu . The nachos were sooo soggy I thought I was eating 2 hour left over nachos from a gas station and the taco platter I orders were beyond tasteless .... I would so not recommend this to anyone unless u don't care but to get drunk on cheap liquor , bad food & HORRIBLE customer service
