Nothing about the food was authentic or pallet pleasing. Chips were low end, flavorless, bordering on stale. Salsa was canned diced tomatoes with Tabasco mixed in to make it hot. Grilled chicken - dry and flavorless. Guacamole - soggy prefab mess with too many jalape√±os, thus not edible. Tortillas used for enchiladas thick and rubbery. Quesadilla  - a running cheesy mess.
Service was good! Very friendly - but took a long time for food to be delivered.
Better off at Taco Bell....just sayin'
