grossssssss. carne asada fries ($9.15) does not compare to roberto's or fausto's or amigo's tacos! we ordered carne asada fries. it was soggy french fries, the sour cream was clumpy, and it has refried beans and onions in the salsa. me no likey. and in addition, we came late, at like 1am. only 1 table was cleaned off, and the only person that was working their at that time, didn't speak to us AT ALL! she didn't greet us hello. and literally nodded everything. what kinda service is that? anywayyyys, want your carne asada fries fix, go somewhere else...
