When we walked up the lady was leaning on the counter with gloves on. She took our order and our money still wearing the gloves. Then she took the order an money of the guy behind us. Then without washing her hands or changing the gloves made both orders. When my husband told her he saw this, she got an attitude and said she washed her hands. That's funny, because we watched the entire time. We asked for the manager, he said he would have her remake it, but never told her to wash her hands or change the gloves se was still wearing. We got out money back from the snooty old bag and went to chipotle in the parking lot. Will NEVER return to viva salsa.
