I guess everyone was fed up with the owners nasty attitude. Too bad. The chef was terrific and if I could find out where he went, I would surely go there!  The restaurant is still set up like they plan on returning (even the bottles of liquor are on the shelves) so maybe she got locked out. Who knows? At least I got a few ideas to make some of my own taco's. Goodbye Yo Rita -  Good riddance rude Owner/Hostess!
