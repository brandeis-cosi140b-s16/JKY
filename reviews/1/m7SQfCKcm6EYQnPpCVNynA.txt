I would NOT recommend this place at all!! I tired the Al pastor and asada sopes. 

The asada was pale looking, no color and dry. I spit out half the meat because it was fat I was chewing on.

The Al pastor was mushy and overly seasoned.

The sopes portion was burnt and had chunks of corn it in which made it taste sweet.. not a fan at all.

The toppings on the sopes consisted of the fake prepackaged shredded cheese. Tasted like I had watered down American sour cream. The beans did not taste fresh and out of a rosarita can. 

To drink I had the horchata.. tasted watered down and not homemade. Def came from a package.

This place was worse than Robertos. And if you've ate there you know it is just as far from authentic as taco bell.
