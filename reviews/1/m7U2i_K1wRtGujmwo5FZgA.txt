Was here on 7/8/14 and 3 of us ended up with food poisoning. Margarita was weak and food pretty bland. The service was kind of slow. If I could give this a zero star I would. I'd prefer to eat at Aqui cal-mex back in Cailfornia. At least their food was amazing, organic, and the best industrial strength margaritas around. The margaritas are so strong they suggest only 2 but will cut you off at 3.
