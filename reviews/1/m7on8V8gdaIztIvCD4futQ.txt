Proof you can't always trust reviews!!!  this place sucks!

On our way back from New Mexico....where we had AWESOME New Mexican - style food, we saw this place in the AAA tour book..... "family owed, since 1978,"..... hmmm sounds good.  

The first sign we were in trouble was the dingy dirty look.....  then we realized the clientel made the place look like a senior center in Maine.....

I always get concerned when when I go to an "ethnic" restaurant, and the people of that ethnicity ARE NOT THERE! Ever go into a Chinese restaurant, and it is full of Chinese people?  The food is usually FANTASTIC.  Same with Mexican, Korean, Japanese....etc.  Most Mexicans do NOT eat at Taco Bell© or Del Taco©... enuf said.........  

But this place, L & B Inn, seems to cater to the Canadian and new England retirees that do not know anything about Mexican food.

We knew we were in trouble when m wife's "crispy tacos" came in pre-fab, boxed "taco shells!" The rice was obviously Uncle Ben's parboiled rice ... again from a box.  My "enchilada style" burrito had what tasted like canned tomato sauce.  Finally the beans tasted like they were....canned.

The ONLY saving grace was the "home made" Horchata..... It really was good.  on a scale of 1 to 10....  this place was a  1/2
