I think the wheels have come off at this one. I walked out of a Chipotle for the first time ever - heartbreaking. Big carnitas guy and sign said No Carnitas. Ok. I'll go another route. Line was 8 deep. It took 16 minutes to get up to the front. I was in a hurry so I was watching the time. The guy in front of me ordered a burrito. The server gave him a little more than a teaspoon of rice. Fair serving of beans. When he asked for chicken, she scraped and scraped an essentially empty pan and gave him an embarrassing amount. That was the tipping point and I walked out. Come on Chipotle. I need you.
