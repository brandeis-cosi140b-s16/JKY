If your looking for a clean restaurant do not come here. My husband and I have gone several times thinking maybe the last time was just an exception. Unfortunately that's not the case. The tables are ALWAYS gross. I have to wave the millions of flys away from my food! The service in the bar area is always bad. Even the "manager" just stands around chatting with the staff instead of following up with customers. They clearly do not have a cleaning schedule where the customers sit I can only imagine what the cook area looks like!! Very disappointing!
