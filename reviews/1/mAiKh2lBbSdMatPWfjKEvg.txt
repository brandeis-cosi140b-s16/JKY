Never again!  I wish I had checked my Yelp app before I sat down at the bar - then I would have known how bad this place was. Terrible service and when the bartender finally took my order after ignoring me multiple times for 10 minutes the "Ultimate Margarita" was anything but ultimate! More like "Sour and Weak". Complained to the bartender that this was the wrong drink but he assured me it was right. Also ordered a Shrimp appetizer and after waiting 20 minutes and still no food I paid for my drink and left hungry.
