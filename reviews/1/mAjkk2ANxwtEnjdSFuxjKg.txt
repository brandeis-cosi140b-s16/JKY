Waited in line for 20 minutes for an overpriced taco combo meal. When I ordered I was told by the server they don't do combos despite their sign advertising this. After explaining that they do in fact do I eventually got my food, and received a tiny beef taco and my drink for the grand price of $12.52. Had to then ask for the side which they forgot to include. Pretty ordinary, overpriced airport food and employees who don't even know what their menu items are. Give this one a miss.
