Have been going here for YEARS with no problem..... Tonight was a nightmare!    There were only two cars ahead of me in the drive-through. It took me 10 minutes to get to the speaker where I could order. Then an additional 8 minutes to get to the first window to pay.  When I mentioned this to the cashier she corrected me and said no it was only 7 minutes since I had ordered.   She said that they were training a new person..... At 6 PM on a Sunday night?????  There were 4 or 5 cars behind me, by the way.   OK that was all the good part of this visit. 

Now onto the problem!  When I got to the window, the clerked SNAPPED at me, "Hot or mild!?"  I told her and I verified, "Two combo tostadas?"  She snapped again and yelled back to cook, "Ugh, you wanted COMBO tostadas?"  The cook confirmed.  She looked over at the girl at the first window and ROLLED HER EYES!  I'm still in shock.
I've read through other reviews and found them to be similar.  Apparently corporate doesn't read Yelp, so I'm calling them tomorrow!
