This place sucks.   I've been screwed too many times here not to say something.   I order the green chili burrito at most of the -berto named places.  This location fills the tortilla with 80% rice and 20% green chili to save on their costs. I've complained time and again but suddenly they don't understand English well enough to help.  Rip-off!  I order a bean burrito with cheese and am charged $1.20 extra for a sprinkling of orange cheese. Ridiculous. The place is dirty, run-down and is very slow.  I won't be back to this sh*t-hole.
