I went to this Filiberto's this morning. I ordered a breakfast burrito with ham, eggs, cheese, onions and potatoes. Everything seemed okay until I was halfway through the burrito and found myself chewing on pieces of eggshells. I continued eating, avoiding the general area where I had found the eggshells, but found a little more a couple minutes later. I couldn't finish the rest. Also, the eggs weren't that good. I won't be coming back to this Filiberto's.
