This resturant needs to take a good look at its self,  for a newly opened resturant the walls were dirty, the glasses had water spots, we waited almost five minutes standing for someone to acknowledge us and one of the table must not had been level so they placed a piece of cardboard under the leg to level it. We should have left at that point but wanted to give this new local business a chance. The food took forever to come out, our waiter did keep us updated on its status and kept saying he was sorry it was taking so long and for the wait.  The food when it did arrive almost 50 minutes after we arrived and ordered was terrible.  The order came out wrong,  the red sauce was so hot I had to scrape it off so I could eat my burrito, the beans and rice had no taste at all.  We asked for the manager who advised us this was NEW MEXICAN style food and was suppose to be hot and spicy. He also advised they had a mild sauce they used on kids meals,  and offered to make us another burrito with that sauce. Now lets face it  I did eat my orginial order so why would I want another one?  We tried to explain that if the style of food was suppose to be that hot and spicy then they should let people know about the option of the "kids sauce"  but he didnt want ot hear it and keep saying it was New Mexcian Style cooking.   There was another group of people (8) sitting across from us  who sent their food back because it was too hot and one person from their group not only didnt finish his meal but it took to long he had to leave.
My recommendation is not to eat at this resturant unless you really like very spice no flavor food, have all day to wait for it, and spend alot for crappy food.
The one star is for the waiter who truely felt bad about the food and our experience.
