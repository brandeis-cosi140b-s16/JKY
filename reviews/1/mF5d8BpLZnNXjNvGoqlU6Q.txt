First of all you can't give no stars or I would have definitely not given them a one star, it was that BAD! The service was terrible, our "server" seemed like she didn't want to be there, and overall didn't come check on us once our order was taken. Gross factor was we were brought "salsa" and chips with a side of soap still in the salsa bowl. The chips were stale as well. Now to our main meal which was literally rancid. I got a carne asada burrito, which I was excited for because I haven't eaten meat in a very long time and it sounded good. Well not so much the meat tasted and smelled rancid, so I didn't eat more than one bit. My friends cheese crisp was adequate at best. When it came to paying I had to hunt down our server as she didn't come back to check on us and guess what at another table on the restaurant she was eating lunch with two other employees. After getting her attention and our check she split our bill and apparently simple math is a second language to her as she charged me $6 more on my $10 tab. I pointed out her mistake and she acted like I was an extremely rude for not wanting to pay more money on a meal I didn't eat and was still willing to pay for. Overall unless you want crap service and unbearable food don't go to this establishment. In Maricopa there are few options for visitor's like myself but taco bell is a clear winner over this option of "Mexican" food.
