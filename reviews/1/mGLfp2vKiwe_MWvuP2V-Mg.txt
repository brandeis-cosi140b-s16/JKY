I usually love Filibertos, but this was my first visit to this particular location and I won't be going back. I went to the drive through and ordered my usual, a chile relleno burrito. There was only one car in front of me. When I pulled up to the window I was asked what my order was again which I found weird since it was rather simple. I gave them my money and waited, and waited. They obviously just started making the meal when I got up to the window since they didn't even know what I ordered. I received my order and drove 2 minutes back home. I started to eat the burrito and realized it was barely even warm, and some parts were still cold. I continued to eat and then had to pick out big chunks of what I am assuming was the cheese, about 4 of them. Solid, somewhat squishy chunks of cheese. I have never had this happen before, and it grossed me out. Usually the chile relleno burritos are delicious (that's why I always get them), but this one was disgusting and a waste of money. It has been about an hour since I ate it and my stomach doesn't feel too well. I work in the food industry so I understand things happen, but I am disappointed that they didn't communicate to me what the problem was and that they obviously rushed my meal and skipped out on the quality of it. I would have much rather waited a few more minutes to receive a quality product than the crap I received today. There is nothing I hate more than wasting my money and I will not be going back.
