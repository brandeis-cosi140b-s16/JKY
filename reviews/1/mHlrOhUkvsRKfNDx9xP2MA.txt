last night I went to the Glendale location with a group of 12 girls before going to the movies. some girls were there an hour prior to my arrival there. when I got there it was 6:43pm. I knew the happy hour was over at 7pm so was wanting to get an order in. after sitting for 10min the server (Joaquin) comes over at 6:53pm. we still had no water, chips or salsa at this time. we say we would like to order for happy hour and he rudely says "well you have about 2 minutes" in a way like telling us to hurry up. we simply said we had been here for 10minutes and were trying to order when he snapped back "ive been coming around the table and you weren't here". which wasn't true at all. I understand that it was busy but that was no excuse to snap back rudely at us and blame us. throughout our time there he was not very present. never had our waters refilled. then when paying my cousin and I asked if he could split our check on 2 cards. the total + tip was $30.74. when he ran our cards and returned them we were each charged $20.12 + $3.28 for tip. we then had to talk to the manager for being wrongly charged. during this 7 people from our group went to the bar to take a shot. they stood for 13 minutes never being acknowledged or served at all so ended up walking away without any drinks. the service was overall terrible and would keep me from wanting to return to a place I once enjoyed going to.
