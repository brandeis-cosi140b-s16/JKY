We've been here many times and have always been satisfied. Last night we tried the shrimp fajitas and were very disappointed! No sizzling hot skillet here! Just a bland cold plate with tiny shrimps, some not cleaned. The place wasn't crowded at 4pm yet we received poor service from a female server who obviously didn't want to be there. They should either do the fajitas right or take them off the menu! :-/
