Let's make this short and simple... I walked in and the young man at the door said no dine ins due to a big party that was coming. He said take out only... We agreed  this other rude man said to order on the counter but the way he said it and went about it was so demanding. He reminded me of a C.O in prison... We didn't even sit down and eat because customer service was so horrible. With that said.... Screw Komex fusion and all it's rudeass employees!
