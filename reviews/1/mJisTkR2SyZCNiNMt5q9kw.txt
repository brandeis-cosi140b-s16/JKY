Disappointing.  The hot red sauce is good, but that's it.  Margarita was the worst I ever had.  Ordered a chicken dish and got a mystery meat. Sent it back and told them I didn't want anything else. They said they'd credit my bill like they were doing me a favor. Got the bill and they tried to charge me for a side of rice and beans...which came with the meal...and I didn't eat either!  My husband had some kind if beef burrito that had grizzle throughout.  We won't be back.
