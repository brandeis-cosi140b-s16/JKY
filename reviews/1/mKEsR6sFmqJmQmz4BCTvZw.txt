Food is bleh but I can live with that.   What I can't live with is an epic failure in customer service.   From a server who can't remember to bring napkins to a bartender calling a nearly 50 year old woman "honey".  We ordered margaritas in the special pink Cha Cha mugs.  We were brought yellow mugs with the excuse that they had to search for the pink.  Ok then, we get to keep the yellows too?  Oh no, don't forget to leave  those behind... we'll wrap the pink for you.  Ok.  Next,  bar ran out of happy hour sized glasses, so the rest of our party got 1/2 filled regular sized glasses.  Seriously?   Complaint to manager who came to us and asked how we were doing fell on deaf ears.  At end of meal server brought our wrapped mugs and reminded us to leave behind used mugs.  Kind of rude.  Just not a pleasant experience.  Won't be back.
