Customer service makes or breaks a business!  I cant help but create a yelp account because of the service we received tonight.  Our server (short blonde lady) treated us like we never exusted.  Took our order...i ordered a diet coke and burrito with no beans...she gave me regular coke and my burrito was floating in beans.  I was dying of thirst but no one ever came to ask if i needed a refill.  She didnt come back to our table until she probably saw we were done with our food!  By then, you can barely appreciate the food youre eating and ruins your impression of this place rated at 4.5 stars. Place is pretty pricey for burritos and enchiladas...i dont mind the price...willing to pay for more if the service and if pehaps the food was to my taste...we still gave her 20% tip but please, fire that lady.  I just wrote a review on tripadvisor and read obe other comment where customer also complained about nothing else but the service!
