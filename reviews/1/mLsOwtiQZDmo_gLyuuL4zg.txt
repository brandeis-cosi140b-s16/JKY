Nothing better than late night Taco Bell!! Except when they fuck shit up. BACON CLUB CHULPA. I can tell by the picture on the menu what it comes with. The CHULPA shell, BACON, CHICKEN, SOUR CREAM, LETTUCE & TOMATOS. I get home and it's missing half the fucking ingredients. NO BACON NO SOUR CREAM and two pieces of chicken. And these fucks want 15 a hour? No.
