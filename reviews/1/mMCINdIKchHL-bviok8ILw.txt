Food was pretty nondescript, but it was the arrogant and rude service that is the catalyst for this rating. My friend ordered a Manhattan Red Apple Martini, even providing  the breakdown of ingredients. The bartender did not get it right, as evidenced by the color of the drink. Since one of the three ingredients was equal part cranberry juice, the drink's color should have been red to reflect it's name. It was not. When  asked to correct, the bartender argued and insisted he was right. His manager simply shrugged, with no comment, after being told about the unsatisfactory response from the bartender. Needless to say, this soured our visit, which was the first. It's a shame this restaurant precluded any future business, including word of mouth, because the adage "the customer is always right" wasn't adhered. Oh well......adios.
