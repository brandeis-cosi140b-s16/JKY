To start with the positive, this place has amazing atmosphere. This is the only reason. I can imagine for the high star reviews. The one star is for the environment,  the food is waaaay back on the negative scale. I had the pollo fundido. It was baaad. I felt ill before even leaving the place and I am really hoping it doesn't get worse.
