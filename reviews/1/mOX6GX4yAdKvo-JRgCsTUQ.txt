I work next-door to this restaurant. Everyone I work with has discouraged me from going there and I just didn't understand why.  When I walk in the place --even though it's a pretty decent size it only has about seven tables. All tables were full or dirty. I stood at the door for several minutes before I was approached. Although the person who approached me was very nice, it still took a couple of minutes or more to get the table cleaned off. Then I sat down and still wasn't even given a menu. I waited five minutes and then I decided to leave. Everything was taking way too long person on a  strict lunch hour, Now I guess I know why no one from my office goes there for lunch. I'm disappointed I didn't get to try their food.
