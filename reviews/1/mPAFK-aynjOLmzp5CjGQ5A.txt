If I could give 0 stars I would...I asked for salsa and got none. I ordered a family meal and they forgot half my order. The rice was extremely hard and had no flavor. The chicken tasted rushed and mushy. This place needs to be reformed because the people they have running it now have no clue. I will not be back!!!
