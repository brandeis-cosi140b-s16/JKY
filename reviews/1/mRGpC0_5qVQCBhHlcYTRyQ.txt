I was so upset with this restaurant and I will never be back...a group of us volunteered our time at the food bank and decided to go eat afterwards and was shocked at the service we received. There was only one server and got bombarded by people in for lunch. We were in for lunch and already sat down when more people came in. The server proceeded to  serve the regulars and it took over an hour for them to take our order..:I actually left without even ordering because I wasn't going to wait. The manager or owner sat in the corner with her spouse and never even got up to help her server. After our group tried to hang in there and just pay for the drinks we got and they were being very disrespectful to us.  I would leave a zero star review if possible but it made me pick a star.
