Let's start with the service from Antonio....not good. He was disinterested and when we asked him to recommend something he have us a blank state.

Food wasn't good. Neither of ate all of it or even half and didn't want to take it with us. Both of us got chicken, enchiladas with mole for me and tacos for my husband. The chicken was soooooooo dry I couldn't even chew it. We got table side guacamole made with ONE avocado but was $8.50.
