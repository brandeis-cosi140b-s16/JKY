Asked for a California burrito with adobada instead of carne asada, they said okay. Check my food to see its not adobada, so I ask and then they tell me no it is. Literally unwrap the whole burrito and show it to them and then they tell me, "oh sorry no adobada and no fries, tomorrow okay." What the fuck dude. Instead of getting what I asked for, they gave me a carne asada burrito and tried to lie to me about it.
