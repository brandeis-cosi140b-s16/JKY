I got to the Chipotle on 16th St and Camelback twice a week and today I had very bad service. There was a customer in front of me that wanted every piece of meat that had black on it picked out of his food, after several minutes of my food getting cold I asked the young lady if she could just put meat on mine and pass him she then asked the girl at the register she said "he can wait"! I then said I would like to speak to a manager his name was Richard. Richard was just a rude and flippant with me as the girl at the register! I will be going to Cafe Rio from now on, foods better anyways! Poor customer service is one thing I hate!
