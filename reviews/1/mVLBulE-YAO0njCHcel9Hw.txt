I began going to La Fonda after I found it on lists of celiac-friendly restaurants in Tempe. I was assured by the wait staff that the corn tortillas were free of wheat. Every time we ordered, we made it clear that the wheat thing was a health issue, not a preference, and we were always assured that my meals would be safe. So we ate there every week or two for a few months. 

A few weeks ago, we made a take-out order and went through the whole "wheat-free" spiel. This time, though, the employee told us that the corn tortillas are made in-house and contain wheat flour. She said she has worked there for several years and it has always been the case.

I am disappointed to learn that eating at La Fonda isn't safe for me, and that they were not honest with me about it.
