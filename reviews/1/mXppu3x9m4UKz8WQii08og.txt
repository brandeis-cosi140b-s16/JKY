Qdoba's food seems to be well received by many. They have a website that lists nutritional info. They aren't bad price wise. Those three things were a definite plus. I really wanted to like Qdoba. It seemed like a place I could get into... until I tried it. 

The Qdoba on E. Town Blvd had just opened and I had never had Qdoba before. I thought it would be a good idea to check it out. 

When I walked in, no one was there. It was about an hour and a half before closing, but still... this should have been my first warning. Nevertheless, I found myself standing in front of a smorgasbord of food ordering a Grilled Veggie Burrito. I watched as the veggies and rice made their way into a huge sticky tortilla, then promptly balled up into a "burrito". I say "burrito" because this thing literally looked balled up, not wrapped... it was weird. 

I sat down to eat this ball-ritto and the first thing I noticed about it  was the smell. I haven't a clue on how describe the smell, all I can say is that it didn't smell like something that should be put in my mouth. This is the second warning that should have clued me in. But no. I grabbed a fork and proceeded to cut a good size chunk out of the ball-ritto and took a bite. 

I have no idea how you can make rice taste bad, but congratulations Qdoba, you did it. You have successfully created the worst tasting rice... actually, the worst tasting "food", I've ever had in my entire life. 

I actually took about 4 more bites of hellacious thing before throwing it away. This is coming from someone who will have less than 1/4 cup of Cheerios left in the box and will not throw it away. I hate throwing perfectly good food away. However, I had no qualms doing so in this instance. This was not perfect, nor good, or really even food for that matter.

Never again, Qdoba. Never again.
