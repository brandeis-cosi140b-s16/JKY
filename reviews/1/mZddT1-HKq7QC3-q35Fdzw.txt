Although Valle Luna used to rank high on our list, my last visit there has caused me to boycott this restuarant.  I will summarize the story, as I don't like to draw out details.  I am a very forgiving and patient person but this incident was truly an example of extremely poor customer service.  

After my mother passed away, my friend gave me a Valle Luna Gift card.  Eventaully, because it was emotional, I used it with my family.  After I tried to pay using the gift card, the waitress returned to tell me that the card was not activated.  I asked to speak to the manager and she advised that she would look into it on Monday.  2 weeks passed and I decided to follow up on it.  The manager than had conflicting comments, but bottom line, she cannot do anything to help me unless I have the receipt.  I explained, as I did the night we dined there, that I did not feel comfortable asking my friend after 3 months of receiving the gift since the chances were very low that she would still have the receipt.  Also, it made me very uncomfortable that if she didn't that she would then feel bad.  In short, the manager advised that if they honored everyone's gift cards that were not activated then they would be out of business.  She basically was accusing me of trying to use a stolen gift card.   I asked her to please check with the owners to make sure they agree with her decision to do nothing.  She did email the response saying that there is nothing that can be done and oh, very sorry for your loss.  (talk about salt in a wound).

A little more background:  We have been a very loyal and regular patron of Valle Luna for as long I can remember, well over 10 years.   On average we spent $1200/year there.  So, we have spent at least $12,000 over the past 10 years.

Value of the gift card:  $30

Interesting business model employed.  And this coming from a restuarant that has buy one get one meal coupons abundantly.
