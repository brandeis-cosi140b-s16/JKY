There are many good inexpensive places to to eat but this isn't one of them. I'll admit the food was slightly above average but if this place is going to make it the girl behind the counter needs to go elsewhere. She acts as if she could careless if helps you or not. She has a very arrogant attitude. We will not be returning, low quality and bad service.
