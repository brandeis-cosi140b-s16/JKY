I can't even give this place 1 star but Yelp requires at least 1 ton posy. Having recently moved here from OC, it's very difficult to find decent Mexican food at a sit-down restaurant and we were hoping to find a favorite cantina we could count on.

At first glance, the aesthetics held a lot of promise. Typical, familiar and nice restaurant layout.

We sat down and opened our menus- way pricey for typical cantina-style restaurant. 10.99 single taco with rice and beans anyone? The chips came... Cold and all broken pieces. Salsa was bland. Had to ask them to bring something hotter with flavor.

I ordered a chimichanga with chicken; hubby had carne asada tacos ($15-ish each dish!) Food was terrible. Cut into my chimichanga and a ton of watery chicken (canned?) came leaking out. Rice was bland.  Carne asada tacos were tough and not well seasoned. The waiter asked how we liked it since my burrito was virtually uneaten. Offered to bring another type of dish out but I was over it. They should have offered to remove it off the bill but they didn't.

To top it off, we were subject to the LOUDEST trio of women (not drunk) behind us that drew dirty looks from everyone in the room. You couldn't hear anything except for their conversation and giddy laughter from taking selfie after selfie. Will NEVER go back to this place.
