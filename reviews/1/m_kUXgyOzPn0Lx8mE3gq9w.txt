This was my first time visiting Filiberto's. The cashier was very unhelpful and extremely rude. She was informed that I'm new to the area from New York. I also let her know that I was unfamiliar with the menu. Her listening skills were horrendous, making me repeat myself over and over again. This young woman was talking at me the whole time as if I was bothering her. Completely disgusted by this experience. If this is the kind of representation Filiberto's has, I want no parts of it. I would give zero stars if I could!
