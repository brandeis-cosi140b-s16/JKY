I'll start with the most positive statement I can make: the food was decent. I ordered a chicken chimichanga, chips and salsa and a drink and the total was $15. Price is fair. The food was OK - as I've mentioned in other reviews, I'm from New Mexico, so my standard for Mexican food are high. The chimichanga was alright - the red sauce wasn't hot at all. The salsa was very, very bland. Beans and rice were decent.

Ok, on the customer service. It was initially friendly, when I asked for an itemized receipt, things took a turn for the worse. I am business traveler and my company reimburses me for my expenses while traveling. This place only takes cash or personal check. I paid my tab in cash and ask for a receipt. Angelica hands me a small tear tab from the bottom of the check that lists the total paid (not even the business name was on the tab). I explain that I need an original itemized receipt for my company. She tells me this isn't possible because they have "to keep the checks in numbered order." Umm, OK, I just paid you in cash, now I need an itemized receipt. She tells me, "Just take a picture of it with your phone." I again (for the third time) explain that I need an itemized, original receipt. She then tells me, "We have a lot of business people eat here and they never need that. There is an app an they just take a picture of it." Last I checked, the IRS does not have an app that allows you take pictures of receipts for tax purposes, but whatever. She eventually goes and hand writes a new tickets...she hands it to me and tells me (verbatim): "In the future, we aren't going to do this for you, so don't ask for it again." No lie. 

Well Angelica, no worries because there won't be a next time. This was my first and last visit here. Business travelers (and others who may need a receipt for your cash purchase) beware, you won't get an itemized receipt, don't even ask for it!
