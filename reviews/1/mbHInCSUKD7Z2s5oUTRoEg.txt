Let me preface with saying that my husband and I have been coming here since 2009 and have always loved it. Tonight made us decide to never go again.  My husband ordered a burrito and when he noticed they gave him the wrong order, we had to tell another waiter because our waiter never bothered to look at us. When he got his burrito, he was almost half way through when he noticed a long black hair in it. When the waiter finally came around and we told him,  he literally said,  "That's odd. No one in the kitchen had hair like that."  He never once apologized.  When we got to the counter,  the lady was really nice and apologized. She asked if the waiter took my husband's order off the bill and was surprised when we said no. My husband even joked when he sent his order back saying how they'd do something to his food.  I guess he was right.  :( Looks like I'll never be going there again. Go to the one downtown instead if you want good service.  It's the original anyways.
