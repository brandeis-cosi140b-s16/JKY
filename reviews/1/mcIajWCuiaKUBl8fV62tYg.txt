My brother and I came into this location and we were the first ones of the day. It started out that they were out of steak which we understand that happens. But then as we sat down we overheard a tall guy behind the counter talking to who we thought was a customer about how bad the employees the night before did. He mentioned them by name and basically continued to bring them down while making himself look good. Come to find out the one he was talking to was the general manager and family sitting down to eat. Regardless of the night before, it is extremely unprofessional to be speaking where everyone can hear...especially the managers. We came in to eat not.to listen to the stores problems and especially not to listen to other employees get bashed by the GM and others. Considering you (and I won't mention your name) was standing behind the counter doing nothing the whole time we were there, you have no room to talk about others. We did however receive excellent customer service from a guy named Michael. Thanks for that! Michael, you get 5 stars! I hope your peers can pull their heads out and knock this kind of behavior off and be more professional. Thanks.
