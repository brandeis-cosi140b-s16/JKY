I had an aweful experience with this location while trying to order for 48 teachers for our school teacher appreciation.  It took me three phone calls to different managers to get an answer on the order to begin(I should have gone to a different restaurant then)after finally getting a response I ordered 48 burritos via a manager.  When my other PTA board member went to pay he confirmed that we had 5 burritos ordered.  Those were the 5 special ones and not the other 43.  They didn't know about a discount they had given us and the tax exempt.  She was told to bring it when I picked up and they would credit her card.  Well I was worried about my order so I showed up 15 minutes early the manager let me know I was early.  I informed her that I knew that.  I also was right in knowing they had my order wrong.  The manager from the night prior never passed my order to them so it was all wrong.  I waited and as I had 48 teachers waiting for dinner they finished late.  I asked if I could speak to a manager and no one would come speak to me.  They denied ever saying we could use our tax exempt form and would not credit us saying that no one ever told us that and told me they were sorry I felt the way I did.  Never and apology never is there anyway I can help NOTHING.  i totally understand human error but they treated me like dirt.  I would never recommend using them for any large party.  I had multiple burritos marked veggie and chicken and scratched out as teachers waited for their food during conferences.  Also when I asked for the area managers card they said they did not have his information!!!!
