Talk about terrible. Goodness. I came here because my co-workers kept raving about it so I finally decided to try it. Well it's extremely hard to order when the person behind the counter doesn't speak English. She understood Carnitas quesadilla, aaaand that was about it. While pointing and using exaggerated words I got the lady to understand "sour cream". Then I tried to tell her "mild salsa". Omg, what a headache. After saying "mild" eight times she then started pointing to the different salsas and I said, "I don't know which one is the mild." Not sure why I said it, she didn't understand it. She then said, "Hot?" I gestured with my fingers and said, "little hot." It was enough to get some salsa into a little to-go cup. Holy hell. This wouldn't have bothered me as much if I were in some hole in the wall Mexican joint where I know the food is amazing because the recipes are being passed down the generations. But that wasn't the case, I was in a mall for crying out loud! 

So I get back to work and open my food. It's dripping, literally, with grease. In fact, it was so greasy that the aluminum paper stuff holding it together tore when I tried to pick it up. I couldn't even stomach eating the last piece. They barely put any Carnitas or cheese in the quesadilla, and they didn't put any of the grilled onions that should have been there either. I paid $7 for this awful Carnitas quesadilla and it didn't come with a drink or sides. 

So overall this was truly terrible. I will not be going back. Take your money to a Chipotle since that's who they're trying to copy, or try a different eatery in Az Mills.
