Los Taquitos changed the menu board above their kitchen/order area about 6 weeks ago and it's so confusing you can't figure it out.  And neither can the order takers or kitchen staff because on both of my recent visits I received the wrong orders. The staff is so befuddled they agree the business is in meltdown mode.  Plus...let me mention the quality of the food has dropped considerably.  

This long-time patron WON'T be coming back!

I've put up with the dirty, worn, decrepit interior for these years because Ahwatukee lacks a quality mexican food place near my home but I won't tolerate a menu that's incomprehensible and food that's worse than Taco Bell.  

To top it all off, the staff has become rude, probably due to frustration over how management has let this business go to ruin.
