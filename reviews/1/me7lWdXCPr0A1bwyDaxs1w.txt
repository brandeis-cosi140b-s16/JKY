I was really glad when this place opened cuz it was really close to home and what makes it more enjoyable to order something and get it home quickly so it's not soggy or becomes lukewarm.

Well all the times I have ordered from this place I have been disappointed.  The only two times I was satisfied .....1-after drinking, 2-my friend ordered a special nacho for me and I was starving.  

What disappoints me about this place (maybe it's just this one on Cactus) is the lack of flavor.  I should not have to add all kinds of sauce or feel like there is something lacking that I cannot put my finger on.  
Specially for the carne asada.  It should have taste that excites the taste buds on your tongue.  But...no.  

I've been to good taqueria and I do miss the one in California called Chavez in Hayward.  

So time to search for a good place, hopefully not too far from home.

My son would rather eat TACO BELL, and me, too.
