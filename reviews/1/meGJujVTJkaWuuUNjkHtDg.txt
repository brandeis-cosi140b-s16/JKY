I went to EPL first long line in the drive thru .. I place my order for a two piece combo, then they tell me they only have chicken legs and thighs nothing else so I order 3 chicken legs and change my order to a 3 piece combo. I order rice and corn as my sides and then they say they are out of all their corn. I then change my choice for a side and order beans and they never acknowledge me. I then proceeded to the window to pay. When I get to the window the girl working the drive thru goes and gets the manager and the manager then tells me they have no chicken at all and there is a ten minute wait after it took for ever to order and for ever to wait in line !!!!  Get your restaurant together you should of informed me you had no chicken when I first pulled into your drive thru.. I Am so annoyed with this location . The only reason I go here is because it's the one closest to my house and when I do go their chicken is always burnt and they forget to put stuff in my bag it never fails!!! I like EPL but this location sucks don't waste your time going there.
