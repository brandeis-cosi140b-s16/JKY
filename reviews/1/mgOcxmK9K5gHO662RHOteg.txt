Ugh I don't know why this place stays open. We came here last year because of a delayed flight. My Bf and I were very disappointed and said, "lets never go back here". Well, here we are in the airport again with some time to spare. Only having a couple hours sleep, we needed some fuel before our long flight home. We decided on a Bacon breakfast burrito with added cheese (extra .75 charge) and salsa and we also got a side of beans. WORST burrito I've ever had. It was completely flavorless, the cheese was Cold and so processed that it didn't even melt. The salsa was watery and horrible, which made my whole burrito cold and soupy. I would never suggest this place to  anybody and was tempted to tell people to not go here.
