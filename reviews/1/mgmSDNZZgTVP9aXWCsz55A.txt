We used to go here all of the time.  Then one day the waiter refused my substitution of a flour tortilla for corn on my enchilada, despite having requested and received this modification on countless occasions before.  It got ugly.  Turns out that they would not satisfy my request because they made all of the enchiladas in the morning and would not make a fresh enchilada for me. I was livid.  This was WAY before I discovered Yelp.  I asked to speak with the manager who was a total jerk.  I vowed never to return.  Three years later...I happened to be in a forgiving mood and we happened to be in the neighborhood so we decided to stop by and try it out again.  Alas, the prices had climbed too high, the food wasn't as good as we remembered, and the service sucked (they got my husband's order wrong) and the rest is history.  I vow once again never to return.
