The customer service is friendly and the portions are pretty reasonable considering how most chipotles are very light handed. The problem here is the awful smell of some chemical lacker of some sort when you walk in the front door. The aroma is awful and very overwhelming. I reported it to the cashier and he just said he couldn't smell anything (great help). I also get very annoyed about how you order salsa and they'll only fill the cups halfway. HELLO, two half cups of salsa costs you more in product cost than a full cup of salsa.
