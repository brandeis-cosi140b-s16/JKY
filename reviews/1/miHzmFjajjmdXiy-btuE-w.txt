I absolutely love Rubios but this location is having some serious issues. The staff isn't very pleasant or efficient at all. Dining in is a mistake because that place is not clean. It is hard to enjoy the food when everywhere you look needs a clean up. I wish management would notice the issues and make the necessary changes. The prices are not cheap so it would be nice to have some more quality in the experience.
