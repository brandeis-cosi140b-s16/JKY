All I can say is wow. So you spend 23.00 dollars at Carlitos mexican grill. It takes 45 minutes to get your food. I ask wheres my rice he says oh sorry were out nothing compensated for it. Then we get this one salsa. Wow my wife asks for more they try to charge .25 cents and finally gives us one more. Oh ok. What a joke two salsas for all our food. That's four tacos and a quesadilla. Thank god for Red Estillo.
