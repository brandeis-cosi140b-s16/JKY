came here to have lunch with my husband.  Granted there is a sign near the cash register that says it's NOT A FAST FOOD place BUT, there was no sign that said ... your wontons, and my husband ordered a plate, it had rice, kim chee, some meat and an egg ... it took them 45 minutes to bring my won tons.  10 minutes later, they brought the rest of the food out and we just had them pack it up.
