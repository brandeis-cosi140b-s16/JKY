Good food, but literally the WORST service I have ever gotten in my life. I'm usually very understanding when I get back service, because I was a waitress. This time there was no exception! We had to ask at least three times for everything we needed. Then they ran out of chips, which she didn't tell us, but proceeded to bring guacamole to the table; then she argued not to take it off the check. Horrible experience, I will NEVER go back.
