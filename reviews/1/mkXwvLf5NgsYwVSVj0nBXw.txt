I wonder where some of these reviews have ate real authentic mexican food. I can tell you one thing it sure is not here. My wife and I ordered the enchilada combos. Mine beef, hers chicken. The beef taste like something out of a can. While there I noticed there was a large can of red  sauce, La Palma or something like that. Have seen it in grocery stores. The tortillas were horrible also. There s nothing authentic about this place except the Spanish speaking employees.
