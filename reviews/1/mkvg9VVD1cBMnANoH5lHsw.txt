If I could give a zero I would. First off. Zero onions means no onions. So they gave me a $7.00 burrito with pico de gallo and the justification was what? When a person say no onion that means no onion. Then when I called and told them they made a mistake they hung up on me. I didn't use foul language or curse at them. I said "no onion means no onion. No onion. So you should say your pico come with onion and put it on side or remove." So now I have a $7 piece of junk I can eat. Great. Yeah. You can say it in English or Spanish. No comprende on both. They will mess up cause they don't care. Good to know. I live around corner but I will never be back.
