Food was ok. Margaritas were good (only because they are cheap on Tuesdays). However, the most absolute ATROCIOUS part of the restaurant is that even if you show up one day later than your birthday, you will NOT get a giant margarita. Extremely false advertisement on their part. I explained that I was unable to come on my actual birthday because 1) It was a Monday and 2) I was a bit ill. I tried again to reason with them on Wednesday and they STILL would not oblige. The service was not understanding or respectful about the situation at all.
