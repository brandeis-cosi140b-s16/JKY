The lady at the counter was rude. She was on her phone when we walked in and finished up her conversation like we weren't even there. Then instead of a greeting she started with "are you ready to order yet?" When our food came up, she was on the phone again so it sat for a couple minutes. We walked up to get it ourselves. The food itself was disgusting. There was practically no chorizo in my CHORIZO burrito and it tasted like they opened up a can of beans and threw it in cold. Will not be going back.
