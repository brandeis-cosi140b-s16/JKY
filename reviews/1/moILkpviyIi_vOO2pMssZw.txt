After a cancellation and 3 delays we had some time on our hands and a thirst for a calming Bloody Mary. This place was the closest to our gate, so in we went. BIG MISTAKE!!!! Completely bland, I'm not even sure there was alcohol in them and with the tip, they were over $30 for 2 of them.  I know airport drinks are never a bargain. But seriously $15 for a friggin Bloody Mary. I only wish I had checked out Yelp before we went. Never again.
