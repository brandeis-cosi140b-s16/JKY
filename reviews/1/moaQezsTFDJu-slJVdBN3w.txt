Wow. It's really all I can say. I don't understand how one single cafe rio of the multiple around can run so poorly. I had high hopes for the second chance, but I'd rather drive 25 minutes to the eastern location. Being the only customer in line, that's how long it took for my steak salad to be made and rung up. The steak was cold, the tortilla was hard, and I stood at the topping section for ten minutes waiting for someone to ask what I wanted on top. Waste of money and time.
