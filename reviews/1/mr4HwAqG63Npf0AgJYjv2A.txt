I will never eat at this location again.  

Yesterday, I ordered a Carne Asada Burrito with no guacamole and 3 rolled tacos - cheese only at the drive through. The person taking the order verified I wanted no guacamole THREE TIMES only to read my order incorrectly at the window prompting me to remind them there was to be no guacamole.  He then had to run and tell the kitchen staff to correct the order and assured me it would be correct. 

When I got home, I found out that burrito had no pico and was full of guacamole and that the rolled tacos were overlooked and so brittle they could have shattered if thrown against a wall.

This experience will ensure that I never go back to this location and quite possibly the chain.  

Because there are two locations listed in yelp, I am copying this to both.
