Been to several Chipotles and was happy this one opened up so close at first.... Been about 5 times and they were decent enough the first couple of times to go back but will never go again! Service is the worst of any I have ever been to. The past 2 times the carnitas was not even cooked all the way and all fat. Service at the counter is pathetic and doesn't even listen, you have to correct them constantly. When you check out, depending on who rings you up, you get a different price every time!!! Do not go here!! Rip off!!!! Manager even stands by as workers screw up and does nothing!!!
