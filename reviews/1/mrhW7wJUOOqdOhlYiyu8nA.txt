Never again! 
Went through the drive through. There was a language barrier between the lady who was taking my order and I. I asked nicely, if there was anyone available that spoke English. Another lady who spoke perfect English took my order. I even asked her to repeat it back to me. However, when I got home, the only thing that I had, that I ordered, was beans and rice. It was so upsetting. 

I don't live close to the restaurant. So, my daughter and I attempted to eat the dinners they gave us. It was terrible. Both meals went into the trash. I really believe they gave us the wrong meals on purpose. I asked for a chicken chimichanga, no sour cream and guacamole. The lady repeated that back. However, what I got was a beef chimichanga drowned in both sour cream and guacamole. My daughter and I had no idea what her meal was even though what she ordered was a chicken quesidilla.
