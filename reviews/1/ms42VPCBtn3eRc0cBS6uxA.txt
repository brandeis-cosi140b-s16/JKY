Customer service needs to be improved. First time being in the place we ordered off the special menu to the right of the counter and the gal didnt ask us if it was off the special menu or the regular menu even tho she seen us over by the special of the day poster.  She puts our order in wrong. Then she gets rude. She could of asked "the number #3 here or over there?" (each no. has two diff meals)Then we were rudely  told  how to order correctly the next time.....very rude on her part. I really cant see the next time happening. Food was good but her customer service was uncalled for.
