Well let's just say never again. Never will I go nor will I recommend this place. Just went to the hostess to get a table, young Asian girl states the bar is open seating but as you can see its full. No problem I say what about a table? On no we have a wait list for that and I can't give you a time....WHAT?
She doesn't know when a table will be available. That's funny there is absolutely no one waiting and she states there is a waiting list. She then says you can go somewhere else if you want too...WHAT you have to be kidding me. I guess customer service is not what it's all about at this establishment. Not good considering I can walk here from my house.
