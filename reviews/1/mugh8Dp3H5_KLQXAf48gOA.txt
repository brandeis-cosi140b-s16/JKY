**BEWARE** Me and my husband tried the pork tamales at an art fair in the Prescott Courthouse Square. We had 2 each (they were on the smaller size) and within 45 minutes, we were RUNNING to the porta-potties!! Then, we had to rush home. We had to stop along the way, as well! This establishment ruined our entire day, as this situation continued throughout the night and the following day. I don't want to assume what happened, but I would never take a chance again with this place! Walk (better yet, RUN) from this food booth!!
