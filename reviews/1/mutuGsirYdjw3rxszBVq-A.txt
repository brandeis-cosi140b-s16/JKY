The service was good however none of the food had any flavor. I would not return the pozole is so bland you had to eat the bland carrots in order to get less bland flavor. Their carrots taste like water. The rice is a little crunchy. The only thing that has flavor the actual vegetables are the radishes and the diet soda.The price is not bad however you would want some flavor with your food.all yeah and they give you medicine instead of having the pozole.
