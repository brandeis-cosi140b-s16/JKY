Never trust a restaurant, especially if it's in an airport, that doesn't list its prices on the menu.  Or server constantly tried to recommend expensive options, but the price was a mystery! For a serving of wet yet burnt nachos and two margaritas, $40...wait, $40?! 

The nachos were so disgusting, we ate two bites and left the rest.  The margaritas were ok, but NOT $14 apiece ok. Beware! Eat at McDonald's...at least you know it's mostly consistent.
