This was my hotel bar.  What a disappointment.  The service was horrible as they were slow and rude.  I really like mexican food and wanted to eat here, but it seemed like too much trouble to ask for a menu or even a recommendation on a dish.  I went about three different times throughout my stay in hopes of having a better experience, but no luck.  Even the atmosphere was annoying: waitresses that have a competition on who can dress the trashiest using red and black, cheesy saying hanging from the bar, etc.  The wheel thing is clever, but not clever enough to make this place worth going to.
