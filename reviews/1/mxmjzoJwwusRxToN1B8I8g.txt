Second time here and equally disappointed as the first time. Food is tasteless, service is so-so, and I find the prices to be excessive. This is really a very touristy place to go in Cave Creek. If you want great Mexican in Scottsdale go to Los Sombreros, a family owned authentic place on Scottsdale Rd.
