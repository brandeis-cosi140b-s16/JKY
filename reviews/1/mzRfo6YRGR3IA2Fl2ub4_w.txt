Do good airport restaurants actually exist? I feel like it's a ruse to have outfittings like this. There is a strange feeling of solice despite it being packed. Every patron is sitting at a two chaired table by themselves and knows they are getting shafted with this meal. Prices are extremely high, service is a joke, and the food quality is meh.

Fast food has managed to figure out airports to an acceptable level. These mini restaurants have advantage of operating in this cage of hungry travelers and managed to create a minimally viable service.
