My son has been raving over the food here....He stopped tonight and got me to go street tacos and bought a bean burrito for my daughter and a shrimp burrito for himself (which was the best of everything...minus the heaping glob of pico).....I was so disappointed! !!!
The meat was super hard, not juicy at at all, was so hard to chew.
