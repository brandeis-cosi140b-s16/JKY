Skip this place.  I have been here several times in the last few years and everytime I come, I regret it.  Today, I had the worst tacos EVER.  Tacos are a basic at a Mexican restaurant.  Really, they were far worse than any taco I have had in the last 15 years. I am not kidding.

The tacos shells looked a funny color, smelled bad and they tasted absolutely DISGUSTING.  There was also barely any chicken in the tacos and the lettuce looked and tasted like it was old.

If you think this is the "best Mexican restaurant," you must be crazy or on drugs.  

Cross this one off the list.  You've been warned!!
