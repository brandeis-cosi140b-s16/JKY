Buyer beware. Jims burritos has terrible service and inferior food. Despite calling and being told their closing time, they refused to serve us 45 min prior to closing. When telling a friend, he indicated we didn't miss anything. He indicated that their food got him sick about a month ago. Rudys in queen creek is stellar and way better. Go there instead to stay healthy and get good service.
