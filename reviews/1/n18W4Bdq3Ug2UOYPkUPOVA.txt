Went to this restaurant on Saturday, January 29, 2011 at 6:45 p.m. Should have known from the moment we walked in this restaurant was a bust. We were the only two people in there, there were 3 servers and who I would guess was the cook sitting at a booth. The waitress came and took our order, we both ordered ice tea to drink, when the ice tea arrived at our table the lime was dry and shriveled up (obviously old) I ordered the Cameron empanizados (Breaded Shrimp) He ordered the seafood cocktail. When the shrimp arrived it was an obviously frozen prepared food that I could have bought at my local market and cooked at home. His seafood cocktail had imitation crab, 2 pieces of octopus, 1 shrimp and assorted cucumbers and a couple of unidentified pieces of veggies, our bill was $43.00. We left leaving full plates of food, what a disappointment. Very Bad Food!
