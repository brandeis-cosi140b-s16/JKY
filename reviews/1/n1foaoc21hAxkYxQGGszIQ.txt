This was me and my husbands favorite Mexican restaurant, until one day...I ordered a steak with cognac, I always order this every time we eat here, but that time they over cooked my steak...or should I say they burn my steak. I didn't noticed it because it was covered with sauce. When I sliced it that's how I noticed my steak was burn and the sauce taste burned! I called my server and told them what happened. They took my plate and When they returned it they gave me the same steak! It seems like they just washed it!!! How do I know? Because I know how it looks like and where I cut my steak! Grosssss....!!! I paid in full didn't eat the food that they gave me. Since then never go back to that place again!
