So I ordered a burrito from this "establishment" and there was plastic wrap cooked INSIDE my food. Luckily it wasn't melted in my food so I just pulled it out. When I notified the DISTRICT MANAGER who happened to be on duty at that time she was peeved that I told her I wasn't going to let her remake my food because obviously their staff does not follow the proper food handling procedures otherwise this little mishap never would have happened. She then grabbed her other manager ERIC and they proceeded to attack me and ask me not to return to Garcia's. This  is completely backwards. Dude, you guys cooked plastic wrap into my food and you're mad at me? Brian the server is horrible and talks to customers unprofessionally. I will not be back to this location. I recommend that you take your business to a cleaner establishment.
