Worst service Ever!!! Always! This place really is a joke, I have no idea how it stays in business. We use to come here all the time but the service is just so terrible not sure why we came again. Servers are rude and the young manager is awful!!! It takes 5 minutes for someone to even come to your table.. Plus if you come in the evening they will practically kick you out because they don't want you sitting around and drinking here. If you sit here too long at night they will shut the parking lot lights off on you! Then you can walk out to your car in the pitch dark!! Great customer service. If you live in Verona everyone knows what awful service this place has, it is too bad because the good is good.
