The food is average and the margarita I got was pretty good.  BUT...  $13 for a margarita at lunch time?  Come on people!  My lunch bill was $49 for a taco and a cheese enchilada plus two margaritas.  The service was not stellar and a 20% gratuity was added automatically because we had a table of 8.

 I have so many choices of Mexican restaurants in Chandler. I will not return here.
