I love chipotle and go at least once a week and usually more. I always get the exact same thing....bowl with brown rice, lettuce and steak or a three point meal they ALWAYS say, as this is a little cheaper than the regular bowl.  Today the girl at the register and I believe the manager were so rude. They told me all the other Chipotle's haven't been charging me enough and basically arguing with me in front of everyone.  I can't believe the service at this place, it was so bad. I will never go back to this Chipotle.
