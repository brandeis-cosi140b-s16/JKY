I'm a Hawaiian native and that was the worst Hawaiian food I have ever had. The restaurant was filthy, the employees were uninformed, the food tasted like it had been sitting there for a couple days, and to top it off there was a huge black HAIR in one of our bowls. We were both so grossed out that we just walked out and left all of our food. Would never even give it a try again.
