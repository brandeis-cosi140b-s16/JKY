Came in on a Saturday night......bad idea! I was just ordering food to go, so it shouldn't have been too bad. I ordered 2 pupusas....just 2! (And a small horchata) 

Guess how long I had to wait....

50 whole minutes! 

FIFTY MINUTES! For 2 little pupusas! 

The lady who took my order would periodically look at me and she didn't speak a word to me. No reassurance that my food was on its way. I thought they forgot about my order. On top of that, after she gave me my food, I had to ask for my horchata. She asked me "what size"? She should have at least upgraded me to a large because of the long wait and for forgetting to give me my drink all together! Plus, I had to wait another 5 minutes to even get my drink! Ridiculous!!! 

The pupusas were ok....not worth waiting that long, especially by myself!
