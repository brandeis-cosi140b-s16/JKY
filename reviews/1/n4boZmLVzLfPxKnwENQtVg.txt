Margaritas were made with store bought margarita mix. The chips were not fresh and they were out of a bag. There was no free chips/salsa refills. I ordered a chicken and cheese quesadilla, and it came out with only cheese and tasted very bland. Service was not only poor, but they were not pleasant. By far he worst "Mexican" restaurant I've ever been to, and I will not return.
