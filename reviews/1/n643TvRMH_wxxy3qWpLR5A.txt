I've been here many times throughout the past 8 years and the service has been OK. Lately though it's been horrible and I actually walked out today . I came in at 1:30 today and there was only one other person in line. The girl behind greeted us politely and walked away. She left another worker confused. The man in front of me had placed an order online and was upset it wasn't ready. Understanding this I watched the confused employee try to make his burrito and it looked like a disaster. He clearly didn't know what he was doing. Employees were coming in and out of the back and not acknowledging us or the line forming behind us. After a few moments of this we have up and left. I don't think I'll be back. Seems the employees need to learn a bit about customer service.
