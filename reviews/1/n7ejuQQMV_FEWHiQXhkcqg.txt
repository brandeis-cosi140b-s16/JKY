Horrid! The lady at the counter was wonderful, but the food made us sick.
I went to their restroom, located inside the storeroom, and saw something that would make a health inspector's hair stand on end. The room was dirty, yes, but that was not the scary part. Standing in the middle of the hot, fly-filled room was a rack stacked with pans filled with food, presumably ready for replacing empty pans out front. It had an assortment of raw meat, rice, beans, etc., none of which was covered or refrigerated. The buzzing flies crawling all over it was the finishing touch for me.
Unfortunately we had already finished eating so now we are all dealing with the consequences of eating spoiled food. Yuck!
