We were really anticipating the opening of this place (it seemed to take a long time to finally open).  It finally opened and it was horrible!!!  Bad food, slow discourteous service, and stupidly expensive!
We were really surprised at how bad the food was.  We had tacos, enchiladas, rice, beans, salsas and a burrito.  There were several of us, so we each got to try a little of each one.  Not a single item was even worth finishing.  I am really old and I have been eating Mexican food all of my life (both home cooked and in restaurants) and I have to tell you this is one of my top three worst ever!
Don't waste your time or your money (as I said they are stupidly expensive!).
The only reason I even gave it one star is that I had to in order to post the review.  Otherwise ZERO Stars!
