My wife and myself been coming here for along time and I have to say I'm gonna give it only one star. Reason being is the bar area. If you sit in the bar be prepared to get ignored by your server and the helper. There were only three different tables with people and only around 8:30 pm  ( they close at 10 ) and the server couldn't even keep up with that!!  We ran out of chips early and boom.....nobody around!  How convenient.  Both server and helper. GONE.  must have been break time.  I always hate when "you" the guest has to ask for something ie: drinks, extra, ect...WTF??!! I did notice even the servers had to wait on this person to make drinks for other tables. I love this place but, better stick to sitting in the regular room..
