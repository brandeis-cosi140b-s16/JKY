First time at this place and I will not recommend this place at all. 
Food is not authentic Mexican, the rice taste like box rice. The food has no flavor. Our food was cold and when asked to reheat and brought back it was extremely hot. 
The one star is for atmosphere, music is awesome and the place is very clean. 
The price is normal we spend $47 with one soda, two enchilada plates and one empanadas appetizer.
