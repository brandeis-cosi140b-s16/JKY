Out of all the Filiberto's this one has always been the one either messing orders up, or food being cold and not fresh. For being always open it hardly is ever full with people inside or with cars in line at the drive thru. Definitely not coming back and not recommending to friends or others. Maybe consider driving to Bethany Home & I-17 or 43rd Ave & Camelback.
