I have never been nickeled and dimed more than I just was...   You should be able to switch out sour cream for guacamole without being charged and to be charged for extra dressing too... Forget it.  Then they forgot to add my taco to the order.  Since I needed everything on one receipt for reimbursement I asked for my receipt to be cancelled out then have the taco added.  There was no one behind me and the cashier refused!  I love Cafe Rio normally - especially the location by my house but this one... Never again!
