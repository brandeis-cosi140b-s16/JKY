If I could give this place zero stars, I would. I wish we would've read the reviews before we went there. 

First off, we couldn't even tell if the place was open. Then we were semi escorted to a unset table. The menu was confusing and the waiter couldn't explain it. We ordered some waters and they were brought out individually. We didn't wait too long for food which was fine, but my friend ordered a burrito and got a taco. She politely stated that and the waiter blamed the kitchen and Said people don't order burritos usually. Isn't this a Mexican food place?!  He then pondered what to do and took her food away. He stated he would just charge her for a taco and not the burrito($5 cheaper). 

The rest of us had our food and starting nibbling on our food and her burrito came out a few minutes later... with our checks?? We just started eating!!! We didn't didn't even ask for it. Then we looked at the check, and he charged us full price for the burrito. We waited until we were done eating to address this. When we asked him about it he acted confused and said maybe he could do something about it. He came back with a new check for my friend and then asked us if we were ready to cash out. He then stood there while we got our credit cards out to pay. I said "this is a strange experience" and he told me I wasn't very nice. I thought I was the paying customer having a terrible experience?!

He came back later with our checks and brought them back individually. He never once asked if we wanted a refill of our drinks and the food was mediocre. We will not be returning. I don't know how this place can stay in business
