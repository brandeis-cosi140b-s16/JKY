Shut down by the Health department on April 5th because of 52 demerits.

"Inspectors found spoiled and contaminated food, food that wasn't properly cooled, food stored at improper temperatures and so much more. Even the thermometers weren't working properly and the restaurant's previous grade cards weren't visible." 

This would make me very worried about any future visits while downtown and very glad that my few previous visits didn't end badly.
