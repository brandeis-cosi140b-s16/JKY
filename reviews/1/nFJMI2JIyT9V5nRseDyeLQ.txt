The big special is two items for $7.99.  That is a discount over the regular $12.00.  That would be fine but the deal is not that great.  2 tacos for $7.99 is just ok.  The problem is that our server was so mean and nasty about making us all pull out a players card to get the deal before she even served any drinks.  She looked out the top of her glasses at us and acted like the special was much better than it is.  Most places ask to see one card per couple, including the buffet which offers good discounts for players card holders.  But this lady demanded my mother and father, who were tired on their trip, each go through their items and pull out a card each and acted like a cop rather than a food server.
The chips and salsas they served were adequate and we each had a drink before we decided we were not willing to be abused by this mean spirited server any longer and we did not order the 2 item special in spite of the server insisting it was such a good deal.  We got a better deal down the way at TGIF for better food and they did not act like we were criminals.  Never going back here again.
