I wouldn't even give it the one star :( I wish I had checked Yelp before I bought my Living Social deal...total waste of money. My boyfriend a native of AZ raved that Bitz-ee Mama's had great Mexican food so I took part in the Living Social deal. We finally got around to going this weekend and what a mistake. We walked in and I was put off by the "hole in the wall" atmosphere but I know that most "dive" restaurants have good food so I decided to put snobbery aside for the moment. We waited a lenghty amount of time for a table as it is preferred over a booth but were ok with that fact. We were plopped down in the middle of a mixed group of individuals dressed in Halloween costumes participating in Karaoke :( This situation was less than ideal but I was going along trying to be a good sport. The menu had a few mexican selections and a lot of diner type of food and my mood got worse...still trying to be a good sport but knew this wasn't going to end well. Our waitress rolled around several minutes later with chips and salsa and took our drink order. The salsa was visually un-appealing and I couldn't force myself to try it but my boyfriend said it was great....it should be noted that he will eat most anything :/ About 8 minutes later no drinks and he said let's bail. The waitress walked past us several times clearing other tables and we were right next to the bar so we weren't quite sure what the delay was??? 

Sad to say that this restaurant lacks the charm that we were looking for. Luckily there are a lot of other great local business in the area and we will stick to visting them :)
