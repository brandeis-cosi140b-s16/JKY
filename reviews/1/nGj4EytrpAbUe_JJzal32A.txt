The service was friendly and helpful. It was colorful and we enjoyed the live music on Sunday night. However, of the 7 people dining with us, 6 have been violently ill with food poisoning since then.  The only person in our party that did not get sick was our picky son who opted for a hamburger instead. It is probably the last place I will want to see again in this lifetime.
