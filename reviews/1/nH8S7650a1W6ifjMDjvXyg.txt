Tried this place:  carne asada plate and a three item combo for two of us.  Probably won't return.  I hate to make decisions not to return based on one visit, but the only thing we liked out of the two plates was the soft relleno, that's why I say probably won't return.  I trust the early reviews of this place, more than recent ones.  They do have good, attentive service, but the food, generally, is overpriced and not very good.
