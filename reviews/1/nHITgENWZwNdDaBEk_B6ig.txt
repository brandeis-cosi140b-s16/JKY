We haven't even received our food yet and have been told that they are out of the following:
1. Kids cups
2. Guacamole (!)
3. Avocado fries 
4. Quinoa and cilantro soup
5. Red chorizo
6. Red salsa (one of the two salsa options)

When our facial expressions clearly registered disbelief, the explanation given was, "We had a busy night last night so we ran out." So this means they don't make fresh food for lunch when they run out of things?! We aren't here at an odd time either - it's Saturday at noon!

In this era of instant online reviews, one would think that a restaurant (especially in prime real estate) would make more of an effort.

Update: The food is not redeeming. Hard rice, salty beans, and lukewarm entrees (clearly just barely defrosted). They forgot to bring out the chips we ordered. It was awful all-around.
