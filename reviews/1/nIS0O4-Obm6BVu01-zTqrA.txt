Let's start with the drinks. The margaritas are in no way authentic tasting. They taste as if they are premixed and purchased at your local grocery store. The sangria was not a sangria, but rather a wine put on ice with a few diced apples added. 

Moving on to the service, the host had zero personality and mumbled everything. Our server was pretty good, but the food took at least 20 minutes to get out. For Mexican food, that is far too long.  The salsa with the chips and salsa tasted store bought. The only redeeming quality was the chips. They were good. 

The entrees were pretty bad. If you are looking for authentic Mexican food, drive far away from this place. If you are looking for sub par Mexican food, then this is the place for you.  The tortas tasted like Greek gyros. The tacos were ok, the carnitas was seasoned well, the shrimp was masked by globs of guacamole, and the carne asada was dry and tasteless. The fajitas were good, but they provided way too few tortillas and too small of tortillas, then had the audacity to charge for extra. 

Will not return to this place.
