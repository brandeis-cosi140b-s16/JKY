Went there a few days ago hoping for good food. Well they missed the mark. Server said  Mexican pizza was great and it was not. We told her that, them tells us her mom said the same thing. Why did you recommend? Chimis were pretty good. Waitress was clueless, did not even try to up sell us at all. Not that we would have bought anything. 

Other Mexican places in area are better.
