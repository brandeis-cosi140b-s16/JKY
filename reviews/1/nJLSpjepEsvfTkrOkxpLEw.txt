I tried this place with my family on X-mas day for diner since it was one of the few places open. We didn't expect much, just food and drinks, but we didn't even get a menu or water at all.
After waiting for more than 15 minutes and seeing other tables get served before us, even calling the waiters and bouncer and nothing, we had to leave.
I don't know if it was because we're not the type of usual clientele or what, because the places wasn't even half full and they were at least 4 people ignoring us.
I rarely walk out from a place, but this was very upsetting.
