This restaurant isn't what I expected. I read the most recent reviews on Yelp before going so I thought "yay, some good food." It wasn't good at all. I ordered the chicken enchiladas. The chicken was dry, the sauce most likely came out of a cheap can, the rice was tasteless and dry, the cheese on the beans was questionable. Overall the only thing I did enjoy was their lemonade. I could've made my entire meal in my kitchen and it would've came  out a whole lot better.
