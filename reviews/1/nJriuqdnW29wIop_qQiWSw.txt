First trip to El Tataki.  Atmosphere is trendy and nicely laid but, but feels unfinished and somewhat confused.  For example, white linens, polished concrete floors and walls,  great mix of music at a great volume for conversation, but 5 TVs playing football.  Are you trendy and a bit upscale or a sports bar?  Also, a giant heater laying on the floor and a neon open sign hanging from a nail in the ceiling with an extension cord running down the window make it feel like it is just unfinished.  
The food looks a bit messy.  My wife ordered shrimp tacos.  They were supposed to be just shrimp and pico  de gallo.  The tacos were a mess of chopped shrimp and sauteed pico de gallo.  Pico should not be cooked and shrimp should not be chopped in a taco.  The tacos were served with fried rice which was crunchy salty yet lacking any real flavor.
I ordered a California roll, spicy tuna roll, and BSCR roll (a California roll with baked scallops on top).  I ate on piece of the california roll and stopped.  The rice was not sushi rice, the filling was pasty and tasted of mayonase.  The paper was tough and old as though the roll had been made the prior day.  If they can't get a california roll correct, I'm not gonna try the tuna.
Overall, we left our meal unfinished and will not be back.  Very disappointing as the concept is very cool and the menu looks like it should be good.  Oh well.  Maybe they will make some changes and improvements to the quality and presentation of the food and we'll try again in the future.
