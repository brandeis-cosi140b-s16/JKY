I went there yesterday 1/6/2013 about 2:30.  I waited over 5 min to even get a menu. I placed my order and waited over 30 min. I ate the salsa and chips and was getting sick. I could not find my waitress. I finally got up and left. Still sick the next day stomach will not settle down. This is the third time I have had bad service. I will not go back again. Once I get sick from something I ate will not return. BTW it was not that crowded to were the service was bad. Manager was cleaning the tables.
