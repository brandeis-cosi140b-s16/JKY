I used to like this place but the past few months the service and food have spiraled downward. Food is average and the past 4 times they have messed up either my order or the order of someone in my party. Staff is unapologetic and occasionally rude. Sometimes success leads to complacency, and I think that is what happened to America's. Needless to say I won't be returning.
