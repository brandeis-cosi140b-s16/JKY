Mediocre Mexican food and they take forever!  This is a really small shack on Main Street.  A couple of friends insisted that we go there for lunch and it took over two hours.  Everything took way too long - it took them an inordinately long time to take the order, get the food and even get us the bill so we could leave.  Once we got the food - about an hour after we got there - the food was completely bland.  About the same quality as your average Mexican chain.  Avoid at all costs.
