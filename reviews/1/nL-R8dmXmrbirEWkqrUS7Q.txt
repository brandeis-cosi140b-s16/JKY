Do not eat here.  The only cooking device I saw used was a microwave.  The foam plate was slightly melted by it.  The burrito had a tough tortilla indicating it was old or microwaved into submission.   I asked for and got a refund.   The food may have tasted good before it was nuked but afterwards was horrible.  Go down the street to and spend .50 more for a meal that is cooked (read not microwaved) and still has flavor.
