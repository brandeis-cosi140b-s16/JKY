I ate here an hour ago. Extremely sick. Called the restaurant to let them know and the manager did not care. I am still so sick and in so much pain. Asked to speak to the owner and the manager said no. Don't eat here.  I noticed some of the food was cold but didn't want to make a big deal i
Of it since I was there for business. Terrible!
