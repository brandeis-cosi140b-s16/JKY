As a bonafide half mexican-american hahaa..I want 4 things from my carne asada 1.grilled charred taste  2.tenderness  3.a hint of citrus  4.proper accompaniments

America's carne asada is NOT the best carne asada in Phoenix, not even today, on National Taco Day.  

No need for anyone to suffer the same disapponting let down, not to mention the total rip-off, that occurred tonight.  Spent $3.50 on a bottle of mexican Coke and $1.50 on a can of Coke.  $5.00 on drinks at a freaking taco shop is ridiculous.  I will say America's carne is tender and has the charred grilled taste, but that is where it ends, INCOMPLETE.  On a good tortilla, they serve their carne tacos with a stingy 1oz of salsa (not hot), grilled onions (wtf), guac, and lettuce (again wtf).  You have to douse it youself by squeezing the entire life out of your lime half, and even then it doesn't have enough flavor.  The meat is lacking its perfect marriage to sharper onion flavor,cilantro,hotter salsa.

That being said, don't go to America's, please.  Let the weirdos who think this place is the greatest support America's.  Oh and they also let people smoke on their patio...MMM smoke and weak carne in my mouth was tasty..nooot.  Trek about 7 miles north and you will find the best carne asada in Phoenix.  Funny how the restaurants that actually have the best carne asada in Phoenix are on the same street, yet are way out of the imaginary ballpark, of great carne asada that America thinks she is in.  Go to 7th Street & Mountain View.  Mountain View is just south of Peoria Ave.

Best carne asada street tacos = Tacos Jalisco (nw corner)

Best carne asada burrito = Vaqueros (sw corner behind CircleK)
PERIOD
