Went here for the first time and left a not coming back impression. I had ordered the Mexican Cobb Salad no cheese. This salad consisted of : lettuce greens , bacon, avocado , grilled chicken , roasted corn, jicama and tomatoes. After waiting for about 20 minutes we finally received the salad,  oh and really with cheese. So I sent it back and they made me another great it came about 10min later and all that was on it this time was some chicken roasted corn lettuce tomato.  The food server asked if it was good this time.  I politely let them know that it was missing a few things like, avocado, jicama and bacons his time so back it went. It's just a simple salad. So it came back again , all almost there. It was missing this time chicken , and roasted corn but, they put all these big carrot slices that was not supposed to be on this salad. They brought the chicken no corn. So finally 
Came the corn not roasted but cold out of a can. What a lasting impression. a manager came over apologized and offered a Dessert. The whole thing was not a good experience and doesn't even deserve the one star but the waitress kept apologizing about the whole ordeal. It was a first, last , NEVER again.
