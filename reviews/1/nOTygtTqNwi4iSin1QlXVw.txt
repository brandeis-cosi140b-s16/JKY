Went based on a nbrs high rave review.  
Worst.food.ever.  
Everyone had leftovers, no one thought it was good enough to take back home.
I generally don't take leftovers home anyways because no one really eats it...but my husband ALWAYS wants to take left overs home...even if no one eats it later.  
He had to leave in the middle of our meal and DID NOT ask to take the leftovers home.  
WOW.

Best part:  the free chips and trio dipping selection (beans, salsa, and green dip)
They brought this out first, we thought wow!  We're in for a treat!  if this is THIS GOOD, that neighbor must have been right when he said we're in for a treat at this place.  
we were so wrong.  It goes to show everyone had different taste buds, and his and ours are incompatible.
