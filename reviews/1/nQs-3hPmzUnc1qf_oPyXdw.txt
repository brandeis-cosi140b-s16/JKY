Okay... So I used to like this place. I ordered the carne asada fries no guacamole because I'm allergic sadly. The drive thru lady had an attitude problem and rolled her eyes at me when I'm pretty damn nice. Rude as hell... Then my food looks like crap fries are soggy yet somehow burnt, sour cream looks gross, barely any cheese at all... Tastes like cardboard I just wasted like 7-8 dollars on this. Only came here because Los favoritos was closed. Never again....
