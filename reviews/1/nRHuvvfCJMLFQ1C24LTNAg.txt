Went there around 8pm last Saturday night. We should have taken the hint it wasn't going to be very good given the fact the place was almost empty. Service was extremely slow. My husband and I each ordered a margarita. I got hibiscus & he got an original. After waiting forever for the drinks to arrive, the waiter proceeds to tell us they did not have a bartender. My drink was fine but my husbands had a foul taste to it. He told a waitress and she stated that he shouldn't have ordered it if he didn't like it. After asking to speak to a manager, he then tells my husband it's his problem and maybe he just isn't in the mood for a margarita. They never offered to remake the drink or anything, just said it was my husband. They were very rude. We cancelled our food order. We ended up paying for my margarita which was left sitting on the table. Should have been complimentary. The only food we tried were the chips & salsa. The chips tasted old & the salsa was overpowered with cilantro. Will never waste our time here again.
