The food quality at the San Tan location is not up to par with the Chandler shop.  They started off okay when they first opened, but they have grown complacent.  We always order breakfast burritos, which are tasteless and smaller and not as full as their other locations.  You would be hard pressed to find a piece of potato in the burrito, and they only put a few strands of cheese inside of each one.  It's like eating a rolled up tortilla with a tablespoon of egg, 1 small piece of chorizo.  I've given them 3 opportunities to change, but after paying almost $5 for a dried out burrito, we will never eat there again.  The breakfast burritos at Taco Bell are better.
