Not often that I order food, take two bites, and walk out...

First off let me start by saying that this is no New Mexican Grill.   This restaurant back filled their own location and is not nearly as good.

Carne asada in burrito was cold.  My wife's beef burrito was chewy.  Salsa bar looked like it hadn't been refreshed in 5 days. Tortillas tasted stale.  And the tortilla to filling ratio was WAY off.

Thought I would try this new place because it is a little closer to my house than the other New Mexican grill location.  My mistake.  Won't be coming back.
