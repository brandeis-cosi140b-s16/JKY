It is just astonishing to think that a town which was once part of México can't manage to come up with any decent Mexican food. Los Olivos is all about "Sonoran style" which is heavy and greasy, but that aside, there is nothing inventive about anything on the menu. I ordered a shredded beef tostada and they did not bother to drained the boiled meat before assembling the thing. My tostada was basically soup with overcooked beef, tasteless vegetables and a very soggy tortilla and to top it off, it was stone cold when it arrived with grease congealing. I sent it back. A replacement never arrived. The margaritas were seriously overpriced and tasted like Kool-Aid with something really bitter added to it but for me, that was my dinner that night. Fortunately there is a Sonic drive-in not too far away which saved my evening. 

Even the chips were greasy and encrusted with so much salt that we had to use our fingers to rake it off. The salsa is just average. The decor is interesting and Dalí-esque but I can get enough of a look by driving by and next time I will keep going. How this place manages to stay open is a mystery, but to be fair, Scottsdale does not set the bar very high for Mexican food. It's as if all of the owners get together monthly to review their crappiness scores to make sure nobody is doing it right and making the others look bad. Honestly, Taco Bell is a better choice. 

Ugh!
