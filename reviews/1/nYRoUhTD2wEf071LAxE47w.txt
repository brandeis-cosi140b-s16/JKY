Went there tonight, Monday night. Ordered 3 orders of rolled tacos which are $1.19 for an order of three on Mondays. Asked for guacamole on them expecting to pay extra. When I got to the window, they had charged me $1.49 per order for the guacamole. Last Monday it was $.60 an order which is what the difference on the posted menu is. I asked the guy about it, but got nothing. So let them keep there tacos, and I will not spend anymore money with them.
