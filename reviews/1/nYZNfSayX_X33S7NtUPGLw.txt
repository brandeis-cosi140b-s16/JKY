I used to work at the diner next door, so I've been to this bar a few times. Here are my thoughts: 

It's really small compared to a lot of bars around. I'm not a fan of the pretentious atmosphere. It's part of the hotel, if that says anything. 

The music is nothing great. You can find better at lounges near by. Mill is literally down the street with much better options, even for food!!

And last but not least, the management sucks. The manager of Tapacubo (Tolan Farris) is one of the worst most arrogant people I've met. I mostly say this due to the fact that I've heard him say some awful things about customers for no reason. He's unprofessional and inappropriate. 

Honestly, don't spend your money there, especially with the current management. There are so many better options in the area! Explore and find businesses that will treat you with respect and not bad mouth you behind your back.
