Cold uncooked cheese enchiladas. Literally cold tortillas filled with cold shredded cheese and lukewarm extremely salty sauce on top. SO Gross. Not exactly cheap either. Brought them back to the window and asked to have it microwaved, was told they "don't have a microwave".. what?! The solution apparently was to drown my "enchiladas" in more awful lukewarm sauce. Which obviously did not help. Judging by the other reviews, this isn't an isolated incident. Screw this place. I wish we had gone to roberto's.
