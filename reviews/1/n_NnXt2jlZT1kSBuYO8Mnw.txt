Went in this place at 1:20 this afternoon. Have been to the Stephanie locations a few times. This place was a nightmare. First problem is the amount of parking. Why build these places if you are not going to put in ample parking. 
Second problem is this place is filthy. The tables are covered with a black grease that fills the cracks and crevices on the tables. The floors look filthy. This place was disgusting. The quality of food doesn't even come close to the Stephanie location. Stay away from this place. Don't know how the health dept allows it to stay open.
