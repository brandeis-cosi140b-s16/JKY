I've been to other locations and ALWAYS had a decent experience.  I went to this location three times and all three were terrible.  I finally contacted someone at the company and got the scoop.  This place WAS a franchise but was so poorly run with so many complaints that it was taken over by the mothership.  If you go, note the business cards as you check out.  Both are from parent company executives.  There's a reason.  They are STILL not getting it right.  Employees and management there are more concerned with getting you through the line quickly (even when they are not busy) than in listening to what you want or don't want on your order, or making sure you have a good experience.  Food was excessively greasy, salty and lacking in other flavor.  Very disappointed all three visits and won't be going back to this location.
