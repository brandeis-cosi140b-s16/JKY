I have been to the La Unica Restaurant in Harrisburg, Indian Trail, and Huntersville and those were all fantastic with great service. However, when I came to this one it did not compare to the other three. The waiter was rude and the food was not as good as the other three restaurants. I will not be visiting again, and I recommend that you don't either.

If you are thinking of going to this La Unica on Central Ave I would say to you to consider going to a different location even though it may be a little further. Go to the one in Indian Trail, Huntersville or Harrisburg. They will offer you better food and service. Guaranteed.
