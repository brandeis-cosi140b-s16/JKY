A star a star at all ONLY because the place has a nice outdoor seating area right on the strip. If, and thats a BIG IF, you can get someone to wait on you, it would be an OK spot for a drink on a nice day.

Food is mediocre, mass produced Mex, at way higher price than it deserves. I could have overlooked that, quite frankly,  because its the strip in Vegas, what do you expect? BUT the ridiculously horrible service was inexcusable. 

Stay AWAY.

Tip- If you want good Mexican food, go off strip, to Lindo Michoacan on Desert Inn Road. Yum.
