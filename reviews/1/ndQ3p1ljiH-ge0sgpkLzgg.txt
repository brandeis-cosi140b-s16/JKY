I usually go to la Canasta Capitolio but yesterday my friend suggest we should try the other Canasta on 7th Ave. Bad idea, we got there first time ok, we did not know if you order at front it was only to go, if you want to eat there you have to seat. We order at the front and walk to the dinning area and then the manager comes all agited and mad at us because we order to go not to dine in if we really wanted to dine in we will have to pay him $3.00 at the moment, after all that we finally got our food Green Chili Chimichangas. Food taste ok but when we were almost done my friend found a RUBERBAND on her food.YUCK that was the end of it. We had to talk to the Manager again. Honestly if you can avoid that place better.
