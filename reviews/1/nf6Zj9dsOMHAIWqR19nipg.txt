I didn't like the food or atmosphere here.  It seemed kind of dirty which I unwisely ignored initially...but then I got my burrito which tasted kind of dirty if that makes sense.  Best word to describe this place is sloppy.  The food isn't fresh nor are the salsas...overall a big dissapointment b/c I saw this place all over Vegas for weeks and I was like hmmm i gotta try that before I leave it MUST be good..unfortunately NOT...oh yeah and it made my bf sick so we def won't be back...  :(
