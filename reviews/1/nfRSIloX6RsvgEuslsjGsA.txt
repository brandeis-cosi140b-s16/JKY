The food here is terrible! I should have known that this place wasn't authentic right at the moment when I had to ASK if they sell soft tacos. We tried alot: the tacos, burrito, the taco salad. They all taste like they were made with a sprinkle of depression on top. I should have followed my gut feeling. Btw, the refried beans here are straight sad and the tacos at Jack in the Box taste better!
