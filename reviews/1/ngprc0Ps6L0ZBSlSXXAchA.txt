had a business casual lunch planned at the stir fry which was next door to Carambas (was as the stir fry is now closed)  We decided to go to Carambas and it was disgusting. I had two carne asada tacos and a side of rice. The meat tasted spoiled and the rice was sick.  If this was not bad enough there was a fly that kept buzzing both of us- most likely could not resist the bad meat that sat on my plate. Stay away from this place and save your money.
