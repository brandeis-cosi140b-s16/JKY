Absolutely awful. Service is awful. Food is awful. Worst Pollo Loco EVER. I've never had an order not messed up. The quality of the food is AWFUL. You wait in line and for your food for no less than 30 minutes, ever. Chicken is rubbery. I usually get salads which comes complete with wilted lettuce and old pico de gallo, warm salad dressing/salsa and cold entrees. I can't express how awful this location is. I am an avid supporter of El Pollo Loco and have never had the awful experiences that I've had at this location. I absolutely refuse to go to this location any more. Don't go if you don't want to waste the decent chunk of change and your time for a piss poor meal.
