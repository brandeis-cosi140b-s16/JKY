My nieces love Chipotle. I've tried it 2 times and have been dissatisfied both times. This time there: The chicken was slimy and everything was cold. The kid at the front said they were out of rice but never even checked on a new batch, just looked down, realized there was none in the pan and said they were out. I chose brown rice, took 2 steps forward and someone brought rice over to him. I asked for a side of that rice and they gave me a side of fresh rice no problem...but it was sticky and cold. There's probably 10 teenagers working there with no actual adult in sight at their busiest time.
