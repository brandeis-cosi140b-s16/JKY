Service is slow. Management and staff seemed confused and if they had any personalities, they were hiding them from their guests. I had to ask three times from another round of drinks. The food came out after 35 minutes (some of the orders anyway). One was cold, one was fine, and the other order came out 10 minutes later after we asked about it twice. So I have to put this place in the "won't be back unless I have to" category. Also, the food is overpriced ... after all,  it's just mexican.
