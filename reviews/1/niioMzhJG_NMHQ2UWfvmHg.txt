Nope not good at all. They'll up sale you even if you want beans instead of meat in your burro. Burros are the size of taco bell. Waitress not nice.  It's too bad too because when they first opened their portions were good,  service was good. We won't be coming back.  At Popos at least toy get what you pay for.
