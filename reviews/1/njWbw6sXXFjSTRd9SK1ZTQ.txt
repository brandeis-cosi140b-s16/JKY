Don't bother - go to Chipotle down the street instead.

Went to the drive thru and ordered 2 chicken tacos. It's Taco Bell, not rocket science, so I drove off without checking the order I was given. Got home with 2 beef tacos that went straight in the trash. Employees seem friendly but trust that you won't get an accurate order here no matter how fast they greet you.
