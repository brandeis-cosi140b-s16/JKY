Texas has a chain of gas stations that sells Mexican food - kind of like a crappy version of Sheetz. It's called Stripes. You can get corn tortillas overflowing with a variety of dry, tasteless meats, all either grilled or stewed. And there is always a condiment bar, full of salsas, cilantro, tomatoes and onion. Imagine my surprise to stumble upon such shitty Mexican food on Atwood Street! Dry, chewy, tasteless meats have those Pittsburgh college students all a-flutter. Next time you kids Spring Break in South Padre make sure to gas up at Stripes. You might be the only one dining there (the Mexicans are at Chipotle eating inauthentic College Station burritos) but you're be sure to enjoy it!
