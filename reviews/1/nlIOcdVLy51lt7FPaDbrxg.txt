I have to say. I was let down thinking it was Gallo blanco. But once the waiter said they changed. We gave it a shot. In short
-No Happy Hour 
-Not the the same food. Carne asada burrito was tiny and unflavored, very over priced.
-The tacos are double what they should be. But they are decent
-Service is poor, beers came out late and flat as if they been sitting?
