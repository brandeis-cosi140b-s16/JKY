Possibly one of the worst restaurants I have ever eaten at. This place is clearly there just to pick up customers from the music factory and comedy zone. The food was terrible. We ordered the tacos which came out cold, and greasy. It made both of us sick and we couldn't even finish the meal. Even the drinks were bad, we got a margarita and a mojito; the margarita was middle of the road for way too much money, and the mojito was sweet to the point of being undrinkable. Do not waste your money or time here.
