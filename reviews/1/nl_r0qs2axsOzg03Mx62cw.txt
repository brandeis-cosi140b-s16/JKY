Sorry - this is my first one star review.  I very seldom do not find something I like about a place - but the only thing I could find I liked at this place was a Dos-Equis Amber draft.  

I had a two hour wait until my plane was schedule to depart, and decided to have a beer and watch one of the baseball playoff games.  I really didn't expect much - I had already eaten, and simply wanted to kill time for a couple of hours. 

Service - No stars!! The bartender was surly, not just to me but to all of his customers.  I never saw him smile, talk, or express any emotion other than slapping drinks in front of his customers, and acting like he was angry at the world.

Food - No stars!! The people next to me ordered nachos, chips, and some kind of chicken dish.  They were served with plastic cups of hot sauce, guacamole, and in plastic baskets. The food appearance was unappetizing, and ridiculous for the price.  How do I know they were bad? The people left the food uneaten after several tastes, and went next door to another eatery. 

Beer - One star!!  You can't ruin Dos Equis, so I will give them one star. If I could take that one away, I would - just for the surliness of the bartender.

So if you are going to stop here before your plane takes off - do not sit at the bar, and do not order food. You may be lucky and get a friendly waitress - but there were none in sight when I was there.
