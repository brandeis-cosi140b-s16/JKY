The worst Mexican food I've ever had in my life!!! I don't even think it was beef in my beef tacos. It was weird, hard and stringy. The smell and flavor was horrible. My husband had a quesadilla with chicken and the chicken was inedible.  The beens and rice had an off taste too.  We live in Southern California and our used to eating street tacos with better quality and flavor.  Never going back.
