Cashier was confused as to how to do her job. Ask her a question you won't get an answer. Someone from the kitchen will bring your food out with gloves and continue to use those gloves to cook someone else's order. The drive thru window speaker was so loud o could hear it outside. Both the orderer and the person taking the order. Food was OK. As expected from taco bell.
