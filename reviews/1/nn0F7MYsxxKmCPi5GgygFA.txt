We were in the area (Pork Shop, Queen Creek Olive Mill) and had a gift certificate (restaurants.com) so decided to stop by and see what someone on AZCentral was going on about. Well that person was loony as Mel Gibson at a traffic stop. This place was just horrible! If it weren't for our friends ( MJ "split-personality" K.'s) and good conversation this would have been a complete loss. The chips were incredibly greasy and the salsa was just alright, super runny tho. Cheese crisp was very yummy (the one star) but the rest, oooof, just nasty! Chicken Torta was dry and horribly bland.. Carne Asado Burrito, chewy fatty meat, no pico and no guacamole! Service was slow and awkward. Our friends ordered fish tacos.. they were certainly from a plastic bag with a man in a yellow rain suit on it! 

Just cause there are Mexican making the food there, doesn't mean it's any good.
