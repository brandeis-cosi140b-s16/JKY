On Saturday mornings, we like to hit up the Old Town Farmer's Market and then get some breakfast.  Our usual joint was booked and we thought we would try something new.  From the outside, David's Hamburgers looked like a good place to try.  Stepping inside, was quite different, but not in a bad way.  They feature an authentic Yodeler from Branson, MO, and have her posters everywhere, along with a 50's style theme.  It works for what it is, a hamburger joint, right?
Our problems started from the moment we walked in the door. The restaurant had one other patron, sitting at the counter, and there were 7 of us, four adults and three kids. My mom, daughter and I arrived first, ordered our coffee and OJ and waited for the others.  They strolled in about 10 minutes later.  We didn't see a server for at least 20 minutes.  At this point, there are more guests walking through the door, looking to fill their hungry bellies.  Our server finally notices we have added to our group and we give her our entire order, as we didn't know when she might come back.  I could see she did not have a lot of help, so I gave her a break, understanding her being flustered.  We found entertainment with the Yodeler, and the kids weren't losing it...yet.
An hour and fifteen minutes after we showed up, the food arrived in two orders, 10 minutes apart. It was cold and not very good.  My pancakes had turned rubbery and the sausage was overcooked to almost burnt, but my eggs were undercooked.  It was the same around the table.  Complaining, once I grabbed a manager, did no good.  He took my mom's plate of biscuits and  gravy back and microwaved it, as if it was normal. He never offered to take the food I clearly couldn't eat off of my bill. If this is the type of service they are offering, I'm not buying...ever again.
I was surprised to see such disregard for customer service and in Old Town Scottsdale?
