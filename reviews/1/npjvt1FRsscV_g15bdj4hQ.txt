Decided to give this place a try (FIRST HORRIBLE IDEA), drove 25 miles to get there.  It's right next to Arrogant Butcher which is OK food with most of the choices being MEH.  Well did NOT even get to try Vitamin T because once we got there We attempted to order anything with pork in it... guess what NO PORK. Then tried to order tortas de Milanesa (Basically a fried chicken Torta) and guess what?  NO CHICKEN...  What the F*CK seriously? Tried to order 3 taco combo but, guess what? They were out of certain ingredients to complete a F*CKIN TACO.
How do you not  have the ingredients to make tacos at a over priced taco stand?  It's like a chinese place running out of eggrolls or Mc Donalds running out of "Mc", the manager in charge of stocking the joint should be fired!

We finally said, NO WAY are we going to even be able to get anything to eat here so we left, PISSED OFF!  Walked outside and saw a sign for Breakfast Club upstair, went in guess what?  THEY HAD FOOD that they could actually serve, imagine that a restraunt that serves fod.  What a F*CKING concept right? 

TWO huge thumbs DOWN for Vitamin T, will never go again and will recommend to everyone we ever meet interested in eating to NEVER GO TO VITAMIN T!
