Terrible service even when place is nearly empty!  Truly awful margaritas, how is this possible at a Mexican restaurant that is as expensive as this one?  This is the most awful restaurant in Las Vegas I have visited, truly awful management!  The last straw was charging me for two when I ordered for one fajitas, they charged me $32 for this one item!  I pointed out to server and she refused to correct bill.  Never will I enter this place again!
