Ate lunch at this location 10/15/14. Ordered the same thing I ALWAYS get at Roberto's. Number 2 combo....no lettuce. Cashier girl took my order but never made eye contact the whole time. Acted weird. Then slides my card and receipt back to me without a word and just looks away. No "here ya go" or "thank you" or "your order will be right up." They weren't very busy but order took probably 20 min to come out. They set it on the counter and....lettuce. Everywhere. I tell the girl, I'm sorry. I ordered no lettuce. She just stares. Then, after an awkward 30 seconds, she says..."No, you just ordered #2, you never said no lettuce." No offer to fix it...nothing. She just waits for me to take my food. WORST SERVICE EVER.
