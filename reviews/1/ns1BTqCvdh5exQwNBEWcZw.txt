I am sick and tired of the same girl forgetting something from our orders. My boyfriend and I both work down here in Henderson and we've gone here numerous times to pick up some food after work at both the drive thru and inside. At first, we understood that this girl was new when she forgot our bean burrito and rice. The second time, she forgot our guacamole and beans. And last night was the last straw with this location. I ordered a carne asada fries and she freaking forgot them. We live 40 mins away from this location and we were tired and just anxious to get home and grub.I was just so livid. She ALWAYS forgets something! We have wasted so much money here ever since she got hired. She is very nice (she's the one who works nights and is petite) but she has been there for months already now, and still forgets to put everything in our bag. I have wasted around $14 at this place 'cause I expected my order to be all there. They do not answer their phones too often either, AND she forgot to give me my reciept last night for the food +the carne asada fries I never got. Go to a different location if you want all the food that you paid for or come here in the morning (the food really is bomb) when the employees are on top of their game.
