This has to be some of the worst food in all of Phoenix. I've been here twice and I love the bartender who gave us the history of some of the tequilas and even let us sample some. He deserves a 5 star for his patience to work here; his margaritas are huge and very good too. The bar music is funk from the 70's and 80's though, that could be updated. The dining experience, is a big, giant fail. The place is disorganized from room to room and crowded. The last time, I swear our waitress hated us or her job or maybe just her life? My daughter asked a simple question about the heat of the chiles and she snapped at her with , 'sometimes they are hot and sometimes they aren't ; you get what you get. You want it or not?' We took a little longer to mull it over and she huffed and walked off. She returned about 10 minutes later to ask if we were 'ready to order this time?' When our order finally arrived, mine was wrong and I told her so; here comes that huff again and she stormed off again, when she returned she slammed the meal down and never checked on us after that. Needless to say my return factor is not even a 5%. It's Phoenix and there are about 150 other great Mexican places where the service, food, salsa and Margs are outstanding. Poor nice bartender.
