After a raid of Hyatt's Regency Lounge hor'devers and business call, a group of us headed over to nearby Garduno's to try the local scene with the expectation of having a light dinner. The only option of "light" at Garduno's was to make something of the appetizers.... if we only had stuck with our trusty SWB's restaurant at the Hyatt (amazing!)

The unananimous consensus was that the food sucked. I mean really sucked. The attempt at making fresh guac' was pitiful. Heck, one of our compatriates was trying to add salsa to it to add a little more flavor to it. The quesadilla's were aweful too. The bowl of queso - not worth it one bit. And the nachos were dismal. I would venture to say that if you pulled around the back, you'd probably see a Kraft truck dropping some Velveeta! Actually - that would be a step up for these cats.

As for the drinks - we all tried it out and were dissapointed with them too. One thing - they do make their drinks strong. But that's not all to a good margarita.

Venture at your own risk..... actually, just stay away.
