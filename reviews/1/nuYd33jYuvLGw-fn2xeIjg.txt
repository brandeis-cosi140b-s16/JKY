So so disappointed... The music was big band, the menu seemed to have changed, one of our orders was wrong and the sauce tasted too strong, and my sons kids meal hamburger was burnt and half of the bun was rock hard. They did offer me another meal and I declined and they brought my son out a bean and cheese burrito. 
Just so sad because we really used to love this place! The menu is so expensive for what you get and the food isn't even good. 
They did try to make it right but just wasn't good. And it makes us sad cuz usually the food is good and reasonably priced.
I think I'd rather go to Lindo Michoacan.
