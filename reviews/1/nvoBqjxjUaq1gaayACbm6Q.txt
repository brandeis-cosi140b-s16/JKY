I took my boyfriend to this restaurant for his birthday. I thought it would be a treat because we often would drive by the restaurant and see the parking lot full every time. That was a good indication the food must be good, right?
BIG mistake. The food was horrendous. The free bowl of chips tasted stale and we had to ask for another.
I ordered carnitas. It was bland as were the refried beans. My boyfriend ordered a spicy pork dish and his first complaint was the small portion. He wasn't impressed with his dish and he is a fan of Mexican cooking.
The wait was long for both ordering and getting our dinners. There was only one waitress working even though the tables were filled with customers on a Wednesday night. We should have taken a clue when we came in and there were no Hispanic diners. All the Anglo diners had drinks. Apparently the establishment is a place to hangout for drinks rather than for the food.

The ambience was lacking and seating area dingy. The acoustics was horrible, way too noisy.
To top it off both my boyfriend and I ended up with food poisoning. If you really want good Mexican food with layers of flavors at good prices and portions, to boot,  try Comedor Guadalajara at 1830 S Central Ave.
