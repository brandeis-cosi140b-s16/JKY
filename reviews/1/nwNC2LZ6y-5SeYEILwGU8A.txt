First time reviewer but felt compelled to dismiss the myth of fabulous food at this place:  Upon recommnedation, we went to Tradiciones where we expected a good Mexican meal downtown.  Wev'e lived in AZ for almost 30 years and I'll quote my wife... "This was pobably the worst Mexican meal I've ever had".  Heres my summary -- the grilled chicken I had was griilled at some point earlier in the day then microwaved to warm it up so the skin was soggy; my wifes cheese enchillada was cold in the middle and was clearly a reheated frozen mess; my wifes chile rellenos was flat, tasteless and cold as well and I think it too, was microwaved.  I dont know what that stuff was they put on top...some sort of salsa...but it too was tasteless.  The flour tortilla i was served was sitting under a heat lamp for so long and become so tough, I could not tear it apart; it crackled when I bit into it.  The chips were good.  We'll never go back.  With so many other great mexican restaraunts in the valley so dont waste your time here.
