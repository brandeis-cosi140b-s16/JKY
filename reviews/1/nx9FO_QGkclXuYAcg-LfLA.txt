This place is an effing joke...especially at night. I can't comment on the food but the bar service and drinks are horrible. First off, if you want a drink, get in line sister...cause you got about a 20 minute wait ahead of you. Their margaritas taste like too much cheap sugary margarita mix and not enough tequila...the beers are served in either hot glasses or tiny plastic cups, and other drinks like whiskey sours are heavy on the sour, barely any whiskey. Wtf? Oh, and I recall ordering a red bull (straight) it was given to me in a tiny cup (redbull is what? 8 ounces maybe?) I didn't even get the full can, but yet handed the guy a $10 and got back like $3...wtf? How does that work?
Do yourself a favor, put yourself on their VIP list, get your five free drinks by doing so, then bail and take your drinking money elsewhere...
