Went there for lunch and had the hamburger chimichanga.  The first bite tasted a little weird but i ate it anyways :) It was the only thing I had eaten all day.  I came down with food poisening the next morning.  I thought the manager would want to know but instead of offering good customer service she insinuated that it was not their food. No appology and very rude.  Bad food...bad customer service.
