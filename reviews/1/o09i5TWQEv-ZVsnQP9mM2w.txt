Authentic Rural Mexican Restrooms

The food was excellent, and I would have given the restaurant five stars for that and for the clean kitchen which is part of the dining area.  However, a dirty and foul-smelling restroom detracted seriously.  Worse, sewer gas dominated the dining area.  The shame of it is that both of these problems are easy to avoid, the restroom by obvious means and the sewer gas problem by making a vent to the outside so the cooking ventilator does not cause undue low pressure in the facility.  OR the gas problem may be solved by simply making sure the floor drain gas traps are filled with water. 

It's a shame and maybe an unusual event.  We'll try it again.
