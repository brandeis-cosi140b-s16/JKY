I am very disappointed to be writing this review. I love Chipotle! 
However, this one in Surprise Arizona, is the worst one that I have been to, and I have been to a lot! I have been to this one at least 8 times to give them a fair shake.

There has not been one good experience from this Chipotle. May it be from me ordering a Chicken bowl online, then to get home and there is no Chicken. Or I order a Chicken bowl and the Chicken is burnt to a crisp, not just seared or chard but burnt. 

Then there was the time that rice was still kinda wet, so it was more of a burrito soup bowl.  Or when the bowl makers glare at you when you ask for fajita veggies. That was a good one! 

The worst part is, when I go to this Chipotle, my bowl is always only about half full when they are done building it. I eat it all in one meal, and am still hungry. 

When I order a bowl at Chipotle in Peoria, Prescott, Salem Or, Covallis Or... etc... It is always, and I stress always two meals. 

This Chipotle is so bad, I will drive to Peoria all the way down Bell Rd to get Chipotle vs. Going to the one in Surprise, the customer service is always rude, rushing, don't smile, and don't conduct business how they should.
