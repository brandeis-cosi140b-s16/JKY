I have been to cien agaves many times. Last night was extremely disappointing to me. My boyfriend pulled a long black hair out of his fajita, which, our waitress had her hair down, and had long black hair. We informed her about the hair, she said, I will be right back. Only to go see, that she put her hair up before speaking with her manager about it. He comes up to the table. Is completely rude to us. Asks us to show the hair after my boyfriend had flinged it to ground in disgust. Needless to say, after how rude they were about it, I will never be going again
