I came here hoping to get a healthy fajita plate, I specifically asked them not to put any rice on my plate because I am highly allergic to rice, so they offered me an extra side of beans, again I told her I am allergic to rice. They cooked my plate and opens it to show me what it looked like from above the plate looked to be exactly as I asked and when I went back to work to eat it, I moved around to mix the fajitas and fish and there was rice, they tried to scrape it back out. The staff cares about no one and service was rude, associates name was Violetta proving that customer service can't be taught and direction can't be taken
