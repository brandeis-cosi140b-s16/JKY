Shame on me for going to a chain Mexican restaurant in Arizona. 

I must hang my head and sigh. 

My defense? I was in the Ahwatukee area, I was SO SO hungry, and my friend really wanted a margarita. Then, she ended up not even ordering a margarita! Oh well.

I ordered the cheese and onion enchiladas (I was craving a grilled cheese sandwich, so cheese enchiladas sort of fit the bill). They were not very good. It tasted as if they pulled a corn tortilla from a package, put the cheese and onions inside, poured room temperature sauce on top, and put it in the microwave for a minute. 

I hate paying for food at a restaurant when I could have made it better at home.

Don't go here. 

Really.
