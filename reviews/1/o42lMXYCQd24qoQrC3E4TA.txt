For my 1st experience here, it was not good.  

I will start with the positives, the staff is friendly.  

Now the rest:  Reading the reviews, there seems to be a common experience of not knowing what to do when you walk in the door.  This is the 1st mistake of many made by Tijuana Flats.

The next mistake is the ordering process, the burrito comes with nothing and you need to pick your toppings, the issue is they do not list all of the toppings.  You have to ask if you can get guacamole or rice or vegetables.  

The worse of the issues is the taste of the food, everything tastes canned and not fresh.  For example, there is a lack of salt and lime in the salsa.  

All this being said, TF is overpriced for canned food.  If you are on E Blvd and are craving Mexican, go to Cantina 1511.  

Most places that have moved into this location have not survived, as of now, looks like TF will be another one that does not stack up to the competition on the same road.
