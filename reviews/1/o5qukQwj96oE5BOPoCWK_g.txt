bad bad bad bad bad.....no don't eat here! i don't  know how this place stays open. you cant just throw some beans, rice and salsa on a plate and call it mexican. staff is really nice  i feel bad they have to serve that stuff on a plate. do yourself a favor and go some place else, any place will be better! run run away from this eatery!
