They always get the order wrong. No matter how much I stress the particulars of my order. Just say a number and don't deviate from the menu. The food is bland.The place is a hot mess. Been there three times and always disappointed. I loved this place back in Sacramento. Here in Las Vegas...they are just slapping beans on a plate.
