I ordered a chicken chimichanga to go. When I got home I had two beef taquitos. I called and the lady very rudely said "well just bring it back", so I did. The lady behind the counter asked "what's the problem"? I proceeded to tell her and she actually argued with me and tried to convince me that I had a beef chimichanga. She admitted they had gotten it wrong with meat. I asked for a refund and she said how much was it? I told her they had a copy of the receipt, but she said, yeah its over there, pointing to the right side of the register. She finally got the receipt and gave me $10.79 cash back. I WILL NEVER GO BACK INTO THIS ESTABLISHMENT AGAIN. THE FOOD WAS ALSO ALL MUSHED TOGETHER - IT LOOKED HIDEOUS. I AM ASHAMED OF CN2 promoting this place. It's awful.
