Went here on a Sunday afternoon.  Waitress took order and brought drinks.  Did not offer refills (or really come back to our table) until the bill was presented.  Ordered a burrito that was $1 worth of meat and cheese, a greasy tortilla, and some black beans.  If you ask for salsa, they will charge you a buck for it (but not tell you until you get the bill).  The food is waaay overpriced, and I would avoid it like the sickness that you will most likley get in the form of food poisoning (which most of our party did.. since we did not have anything else that day to eat or drink except our meal here).  AVOID THIS PLACE!!!
