I'm a big fan of chipotle and enjoy there food often. I've lived in many areas of the country all with a chipotle 15 mins or closer. Never did I have a bad time til I started eating at this one. I asked for no beans and extra rice to compensate and got very little. Next was the meat and I asked for half steak half Barbacoa which is allowed and not extra. Got almost nothing... There was literally 1 small chunk of Barbacoa and a little steak. I proceed to ask for extra steak and received about 6 pieces and that was it. I not only the host, Ashley...who is very slow and should not be working a register, said there was nothing she could do and had to charge
Me. Just pure crap service
