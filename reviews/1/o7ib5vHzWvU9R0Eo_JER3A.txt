My experience was not so great.

I ordered a Carne Asada burrito to go, and it was bad.
Smelled like old (rancid) grease from a grill that hadn't been cleaned in years.  Threw half away.  Minor bathroom problems the next day.

I think I will skip this one next time.
Need to do some serious cleaning.
