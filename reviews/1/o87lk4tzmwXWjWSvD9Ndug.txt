The company was great had a few laughs but from the moment we got there we knew it was going to be bad service... We came in expecting to drop a few big bills on happy hour and our waitress was completely MIA the whole time we were there. And when we would finally get to order our drinks it took another 20 mins to get them. Worst part was it wasn't even packed. So within the 1 1/2 hour we were there  we decided to move on to Bar Louie.. What a difference and better ambiance! And service
