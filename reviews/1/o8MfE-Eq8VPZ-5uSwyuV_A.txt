While at work we sometimes order from here and they deliver to us.  A couple of co workers have complained that after eating the food they have experienced upset stomachs.  Ive ordered from here several times and never had a problem up until recently.  I ordered the shredded beef taquitos and a tamale.  The taquitos were really good,  the tamale was a little dry.  Unfortunately that night, and through the wee hours of the next morning I threw up.  I felt the effects of that lunch for two days. Needless to say i won't be ordering from here again.  Its a shame because the food tasted pretty good and they were close to my work.
