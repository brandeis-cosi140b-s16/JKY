Yeah...I think we are finally done with this place. Got a taco that had meat in it that was literally dried and completely hardened like it had been sitting out for days or something. I'm not sure how ignorant you have to be to serve that to someone, but I don't want to eat food prepared by someone who would think that's OK ever again. 

The inconsistency is ridiculous. There isn't much choice in this area of Phoenix unfortunately, but they just got crossed off my list forever.
