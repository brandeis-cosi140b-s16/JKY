Beware of the chubby cashier.  She has a passive/aggressive attitude problem and she will deliberately mess up your order every time.  She seems to have a problem keeping the sauce stocked, which she knows is annoying when you have to stand there and wait for her to go look for after your order is complete (this happened twice in a row).  So today I asked her to look for the red sauce in advance while waiting for order and she spaced that out.  So the bimbo gave me green sauce instead, even after asking me if I wanted red sauce.  She did it deliberately.  I think she hates Gringos and this is her way of taking out her racist hatred on innocent bystanders.  The food is good, but this piece of work needs to go!
