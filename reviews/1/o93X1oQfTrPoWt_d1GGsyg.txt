Do not waste your time, this place is terrible. They did not have much of a selection and our burritos were filled with sour cream and had no taste. When we were seated we were told they were out of fajitas which was not possible because they came with the topping and meat that were in our burritos. If I could give negative stars I would, there are so many better Mexican restaurants in Madison.
