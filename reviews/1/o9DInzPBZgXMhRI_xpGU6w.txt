Absolutely hands-down one of the worst Mexican meals I've had in my entire life the pork was so salty you could hardly eat it "I did not eat it" there was some burnt black crusty things in it..the chicken was a four out of 10 the salsa tasted like it was out of a jar with a little added cilantro , the chips obviously came from a bag (cold) .. First and last visit !
