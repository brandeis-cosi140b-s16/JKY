I know it seems like I'm snarking, but I'm not.  It's expected by most that a business stays open for its posted hours.  I went by tonight at 11:45pm.  Guess what?  Closed to the point of even the outside lights being off.  It was a black hole in the parking lot.  According to Taco Bell's website, they should have been open.  I wonder if the franchise owner is aware their employees are shutting down before their closing time.

Call me crazy, but I expect a business to be open when it claims it will be open.
