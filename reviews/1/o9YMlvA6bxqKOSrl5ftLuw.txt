When we walked into the restaurant and saw Grandma sitting out in the kitchen, we were excited, thinking that her recipes and good old-fashioned Mexican cooking were awaiting us.  Little did we know.  We started off by ordering a couple of margaritas.  Not good; watery and what flavor there was barely resembled anything like a margarita.  Next, seeing chicken mole on the menu, I asked the waitress if they made their own mole; she assured me they did and that it was very good.  When it arrived, the plate contained shredded chicken bits in a watery brownish-reddish sauce accompanied by shriveled-up, mealy rice.  Now, if they consider this to be mole, it is unlike any mole I have ever had before in my life, and I consider myself a mole afficianado.  It had a vague watered-down flavor of some kind of red enchilada sauce and, truly, it was not good.  But that was nothing compared to the disaster that my daughter encountered on her plate.  She ordered the chicken fajitas.  The chicken platter arrived with raw onions and raw green peppers and thought that was a bit unusual.  However, she assembled her tortilla with these items and took a bite.  Strange flavor.  She thought maybe she'd try another bite and then realized how offensive it really was.  She smelled it, then gave me a piece to smell.  It had the putrid stench of unidentifiable chemicals.  I called the waitress over and told her we had a problem and tried to give her a piece of the chicken to smell for herself.  She refused to smell it and said they prepared the chicken every morning but that if I said it wasn't good, she would bring us something else.  I urged her again to smell the meat but she again refused.  I told her we did not want to get sick and would not be ordering anything else.  This place needs a thorough inspection from the health department.  Human beings should not risk endangering their health by eating at this establishment.
