I went to Ajo Als Arrowhead with my children on 1/13/13 evening after a very long weekend and looking forward to a great meal. After waiting behind several other patrons for at least 3 minutes for someone to notice that there was no host/hostess we were seated. Our waiter was Travis. Travis took our order and after serving the food never returned to check on us. I had the green enchiladas, one child had the red enchiladas and the other had a hamburger. My food literally tasted like nothing. My sons hamburger was dry. After not being approached by the waiter, I begrudgingly ate half of an enchilada. When he delivered the check I told him it was not good. He said "so you dont want a to-go box?" I went to the front desk to speak to the manager or get a business card, however no one was there (waited again about 3 min). Today I called to obtain the managers email address (Jose Nava) but Travis answered the phone and stated I needed to call back after 4. I do not have time to take up this cause, but when budgets are tight and dinner out is an occasional family treat, it is imperative that we expect great food and excellent customer service. 
Try Mixteca down the street. Not the best, but much better and cheaper.
