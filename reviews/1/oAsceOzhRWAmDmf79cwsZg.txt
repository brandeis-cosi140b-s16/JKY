No stars. They didn't give us our burrito and we showed them the receipt and had to argue in order to get the burrito that WE PAID FOR! Finally got the burrito and then noticed that there was no guac on the carne asada fries. Went back and asked for guac because they forgot it and they refused. Tried to charge me $1.29. GUAC COMES ON CARNE ASADA FRIES!!! Rip off. Never going back ever.
