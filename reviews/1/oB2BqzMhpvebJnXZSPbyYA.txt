Awful!  I was there 4 or 5 years ago and thought it was good, but today was awful.  My dining partner couldn't even eat her taco salad.  When we asked for a PARTIAL refund we were told no since she ate some of it...How do you know if you don't like it if you don't eat it?  Salad was wilted and the beef was way too salty.  After we complained service pretty much stopped after we complained.  We had to ask for more water but you could tell they were a little put out by our request.  I am very disappointed for I liked this place and it has some charm.  Not sure what is going on but it sure has changed.  Also noticed not as many customers as before.
