Was expecting a lot better product from a restaurant that was featured in Guy Fiore's "Diners, Drive-ins and Dives". Over cooked shredded roast beef for the green chili, so much cheese it masked any type of flavor and the staff was rude and acted like it was annoying to even have a customer. The only enjoyable edible experience I had was the salsa. I definitely won't be back!!
