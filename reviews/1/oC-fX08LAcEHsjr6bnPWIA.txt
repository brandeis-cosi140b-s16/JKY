I went here because I saw some good reviews on yelp! I seriously think these people need to try some real, good, legitimate Mexican food. Anyways. The food was mediocre. But the customer service was awful. I obviously look Polynesian but I grew up in the Spanish ghetto in Santa Ana, Ca. I can carry a decent conversation in spanish. I do not appreciate being spoken about in another language. Especially one I can fully comprehend. I was only polite because I didn't want them to spit or do something to my food. The ladies were rude, and your food is as fake as you are. Please save your money and try another place. Also the menudo was put together last minute. They charge you extra for little sides. Never going there again.
