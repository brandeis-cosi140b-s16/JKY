Ripoff x 2 - Total cashier claimed was "$23.00 even". Gave her my credit card and asked if I wanted copy of receipt. I said yes, but didn't even look at it until later. Surprised I wasn't asked to sign sales slipped either. Check bank statement next day and see card ran for $33.00, not $23. Dug out receipt to discover bill should have been for $22.92. Now dealing with trying to get refund - may have to file chargeback with credit card company. Also got home to discover part of order missing.
