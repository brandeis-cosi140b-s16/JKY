Had high hopes that this restaurant would be a great spot for dinner before shows at the Mesa Arts Center.  We had been to all the previous incarnations with the same hopes but have always been disappointed by the horrible service.

Last night, we took my parents out for their 63rd anniversary.  We wanted a nice dinner and to see a Shakespeare play.  We were seated at 6:20 or so.  When a waitress finally stopped by at 6:30 we asked to order and she said, "Just a minute" and walked away.  I told her the next time she stopped the we had a play starting at 7:30 so would need to get our order in.  She again said, "Just a minute" and walked away.  

Finally, she took our order and we had the hopes that was the end of our disappointment.  Oh no, at 7:15 we looked at each other and said, "we aren't going to make it".  At just that moment, our food arrived.  My friend Trish told them to box it up, which they did and my sweetie took it to our car so we could go to the show.

To top everything else off, in my haste, I left without my leather blazer.  I love that coat, it was a hand me down from my mother that I have taken care of and loved for over a decade.  When I realized that I had left it, we went back to the restaurant and it was taken.  Really?

De Garza family, another loser restaurant.
