This is a review for the small take out area. 

Overall: Terrible, overpriced. I will NEVER go back here and can not recommend to anyone. 

Food: one veggie burrito, only refried beans available, no salsa. I could have probably made a better burrito with dollar store ingredients. This food was not good.

Service: good. 

Price: Awful! $16 for a veggie burrito w/ chips and salsa....what a rip off! Seriously, how do they get away with this?

Please save your money and palate and go elsewhere. I will be when I am in this airport again.
