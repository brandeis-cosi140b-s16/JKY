The words "world famous" grace the entrance of Rock Taco Cantina in Chandler...what they're famous for would be worth knowing. 

A friend of mine met there for lunch a few days ago and were totally unimpressed. We were seated quickly, probably because there were so few people there. Drinks came pretty quick but were refilled only once after we sat with empty drinks for 5 minutes. 

The food was okay...I've MADE better. It took forever for the waiter to bring us our food. I had a shrimp/steak taco and 2 carne asada street tacos. Flavor was okay, but the beef was dry. The shrimp were pretty plain, nothing special. 

I really wanted to like this place. It looked pretty disorganized though, as we were at the bar and I could see communication (or lack of) between the cooks and what looked like management. The cooks look frustrated...pretty sure that frustration went right into my food.
