They were out of cheese?!? What Mexican food restaurant is out of cheese? The guy that was in the process of making our burritos prepped our food up until we noticed they were out of cheese!! So he casually walks back to "look" for some cheese but came back and said they were out? To be quite honest their customer service recently has gone down hill. It just seems like whenever you ask them to make something other than a burrito they give you attitude? We won't be going back to this particular chipotle, they have lost some dedicated customers for life.
