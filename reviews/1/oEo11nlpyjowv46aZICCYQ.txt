There are much better, and not hard to find.  

Where to start... Salsa tasted like it was out of a jar, then chips were littered with crumbs like they were poured out of the bottom of a bag...  So far right on par with Taco Bell... 

Next came the entree's (we skipped the apps literally after tasting the store bought salsa..).  We tried a sampler platter which was mostly inedible... although I have to say the sauce for the tamale was pretty tasty... (that was it)

The salad was a pretty large, with a decent amount of ingredients... chicken literally tasted like it was thawed then thrown on the top, it was completely flavorless. The dressing was some chipotle mayonnaise mix...   Taste was a 2/10 at best.. left more than half on my plate, and had no interest in taking the rest home... 

I should mention there was live music when we were there, but don't expect upbeat, it was a dreary mix of Neil Young and Simon and Garfunkel and alike.   

The service was quite good, they were both attentive and well mannered, and the best thing going for the restaurant.

I live less than 2 or 3 miles away and can never see returning for sure.  I was happy we used a Local Dines certificate, it made the visit marginally less painful.
