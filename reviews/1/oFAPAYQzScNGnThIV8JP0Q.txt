DO NOT RECCOMEND!!

Chimichangas were hard as a rock.
Chips & Salsa was free. 
Service is eh & the decor is dreadful.
Also they have a DJ posted by the window?
Why? Not sure, I guess they want me to suffer through pit bull songs while I complain about my crap tacos. Downtown has some good spot, this is NOT one of them.
