Tried this place at life is beautiful and since I'm vegetarian I got the vegetarian nachos and they were the worst I've ever had! All the ingredients were dry I had to eat the chips separate and the dried ingredients would keep falling off the chips. I mean at least melt the cheese or get some real salsa. And for $10! What a ripoff.
