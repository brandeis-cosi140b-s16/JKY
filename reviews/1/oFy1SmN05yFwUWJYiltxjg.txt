Mexican food is  my favorite cuisine. I acquired this nom preference after living in Chicago and visiting California for many years. 
Since moving to Wisconsin, I have had a hard time finding food that is satisfying. I work in Cross plains and have passed La Tolteca many times.

Today I was interested in a burrito. Simple enough, si?

 No. I ordered a bean burrito with Jalapeño Fresco y Aquate. I was presented with a large tortilla filled with lettuce, slightly burned beans, cheese, and aging avocado. The tortilla was slightly folded over on each side making a tube like structure. 
There was no way to pick the burrito up without slop seeping out. I had to use a fork and knife. :-(

I must say that receiving fresh jalapeños when ordered was amazing!  (this is usually very difficult) But this was not what I had in mind. I want to satisfy my hunger with a large bean burrito packed full of veggies that I can pick up with my hands. 

One last mention: The table we were seated at was pretty dirty. 

Where can I find amazing mexican food?
