I give this no stars as it is nothing more then a yuppie fast food fresh out of a can,the green chilies are caned ,the rice tasted like instant , the salasa was caned tomatoes with old celontro an wow last weeks onions, the service was terrible I came in wated 5 mins, a couple came in behind me an the Hostest walked past me giving them a table for two,I had to wait 10 more mins to be asked if I would like to sit at the bar, if I wanted to sit at a bar I would have gone to a bar, upon paying the cashier made me water till she finished going threw her things, then graced me with a $14.00 bill not worth $2.00 I rate this as less then taco bell an taco johns' at least there up front with what they are,an now I must give this  less then taco bell service a star or I can not post this,I read reviews saying great it was an so sorry I went there an will never go there again
