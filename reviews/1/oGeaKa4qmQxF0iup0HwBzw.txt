F A I L ...  Yelp - can you give me a "zero stars" option?

Last minute decision - my sushi place across the street was closed (grrrr) ... promptly seated.  10 minute wait for water.  10 minutes - and I had to go ask for a server.  The guy who shows up finally says "this isn't my area but I'll take your order" ... we should have just left... but - hunger overruled .... so sorry we did not leave.  Chips were hard and flavorless as was the salsa... our meals - not good.  My chile verde was "ok" - but nothing special.  My dining companion ordered the Carne Asada.  No flavor - tough.  So bad - he couldn't eat it.  But funny thing - NOBODY stopped by to ask and check in - until I had to track down the check.  He offered to make something else - but by then - we were over it.  At least he took that meal off the check.  FAIL.
