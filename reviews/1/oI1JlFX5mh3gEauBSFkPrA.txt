Well I think we're done with Caf√© Rio. We've had issues before with them before, completely messing up orders, unprofessional staff, etc...Tonight I drove back after I had gotten home to realize the chips and salsa we had ordered and paid for weren't in the bag. Fine, an oversight, and I drove back, to get them. The cashier who helped me both times didn't even apologize once, nothing other than "Oh". If this was a simple error one time  it wouldn't have be an issue. But when it seems to happen often, when not even appearing busy. And to add to it, not even acknowledging the error and offer an apology? No thanks, we'll be taking our business elsewhere.
