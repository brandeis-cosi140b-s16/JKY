Craft beers are entirely excluded on the regular Happy Hour.  Young girl working bar didn't understand why we declined to drink something else and left.  What a joke to have a somewhat diverse taplist and then completely omit an entire segment of the customer base on regular, daily happy hours.  Our group will drink elsewhere at Desert Ridge for happy hour.  So many choices.
