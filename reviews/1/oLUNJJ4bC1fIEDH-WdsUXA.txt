Honestly, I am at a loss.

"Hot Dogs" are in the name of this little Restaurant and being a "Hot Dog Aficionado" I had to try when I was close.

Maybe NOT the biggest disappointment I have had, but certainly ranks right up there. The hot dogs are "Sonoran Style" wrapped in Bacon and with all of the necessary "fixings" (beans, jalapenos, tomatoes, mayonnaise). From the bun bordering on stale, to the total lack of taste this was not only a disappointment but a significant waste of time. Somehow, even with bacon, there was just no taste whatsoever. Fortunately at $3.00 not big waste of money.

They could take some lessons from other "Hot Dog Joints" in Phoenix that manage to get it right! 

Obviously, based on previous Reviews, I am in the minority here.
