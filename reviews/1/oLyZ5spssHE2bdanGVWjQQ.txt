Went there 3x, first time was opening week and food was ok...second time, went with a friend because she wanted to try it out and she was buying.  Third and last time, went with my family...we ordered the fajitas, when we got the food it smelled funny...when we asked for them to check it out and possibly redo it they came back with a bigger portion.  Sounds awesome right?!

Answer is....dead wrong.  My wife and I both got incredibly sick...diarrhea and vomiting.  I am almost positive that the cooks put something in the food to make us sick.  Our 2 yr old was severely dehydrated for days

Never never ever going back...I hope the owners wise up to what their cooks do when they are confronted with bad quality
