Frida's is over priced, under inspired "Mexican" food.  The cuisine is neither authentic or unique. (or even tasty)  While I love salsa night as much as the next girl, I really would never go here to eat again. (Not when Casa de Lara is within walking distance, and El Pastor is within driving distance.  Seriously no matter what interpretation of Mexican food you prefer you can always do better than Frida's.) 

As for those seeking employment, I urge you to avoid this place. (I've never worked here, but I've had close friends who have. Check out Shawn S.'s review for a brief illustration of what I mean.)
