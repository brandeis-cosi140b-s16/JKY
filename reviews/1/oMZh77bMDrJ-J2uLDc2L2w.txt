Everything about our experience was horrible. The first thing to be bad was why do they put the plastic cheap Denny's water cups lip down on the nasty table cloth? My mouth is supposed to drink out of that cup? I can't imagine the bacteria. Gross. 

We had to ask twice for a refill on chips and our water glasses sat empty (which BTW we drank with straws that we requested). 

When the bill came, it was on an iPad rather that a hard paper bill. I can appreciate going digital, however at least let me see what I am paying for. It was awkward for the waiter to tell us how much we owe without showing us what we were paying for - and point out how to leave a tip when it was subpar service.
