Went with my family to have dinner, stood by the register for 10 min and nobody even said hi. Who happened to be the manager, was standing infront of us gave us a dirty face, turned around without even greeting us. If that who the manager was, what are we suppose to expect from the other employees. Worst experience ive had, my family and i go often to this restaurant and never had an experience like this.
