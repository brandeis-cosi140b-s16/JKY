Awful! My Mom and I decided to stop in and each have a taco with an iced tea. I ordered lemon with my tea. My tea was served with a lemon as requested but it had a long dark hair wrapped around the lemon. I told the server and he had the nerve to bring me another one, also with a lemon (it should have at least been on the side after that!). After that, our tacos were not so appetizing! The kicker? Our server still charged us for my beverage! We went to pay our bill and had to actually get the manager to take off the tea from our bill. The manager offered no apologies and seemed to smirking about it. All's he said was "These guys no better than that"! Too bad because my boyfriend loves this place. Accidents happen but it is how it was handled......never again!
