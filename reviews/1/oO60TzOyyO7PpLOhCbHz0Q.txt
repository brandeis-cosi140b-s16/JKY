I've had better......

There was a reason this place was not busy on 7pm on a Friday evening....

For the price you pay, you get very minimal seafood, and too many fillers. For instance we ordered a plate for 1, the special combination with, snail, octopus, squid. It had tiny pieces of each item mixed in with lots of onions and tomatoes and yellow peppers - this plate was small and cost a whopping $22.00 !!!!!!!!  I could not believe it! Then we ordered a ceviche dish, there was non existent seafood, very little shrimp very little fish, however loaded with tomatoes and fillers.  I Will NOT Be Back!

I have been to many Mexican Cantina Seafood Saloons from Baja Mexico to the best in the Southwest US regions. This place does not even compare. It was a waste money over 50 Dollars spent on veggies with very tiny pieces of seafood. A Total Rip OFF!!! 

 I do NOT recommend this place, San Diego Bay Restaurant, A waste of Time and Money!!!
