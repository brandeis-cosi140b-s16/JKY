I would give them a zero if I could based strictly on the customer service quality. We were a group of six who went in with a BOGO coupon created by Coasta Cantina expressly for our convention at the nearby Orleans Arena.  After a lot of needless debate (the coupon was really straightforward, but he tried to make it sound ambiguous), the manager refused to honor the coupon. He also didn't want to push two tables together to allow us to be more comfortable, and opted instead to have 6 of us sit at a small round table. Weird, but we complied with that. This was at 9 PM on a weeknight, so the place was pretty much empty.

There are too many details to include them all in this review, so I'll just sum up with this feedback for management/owners:  own your mistake while we are still at the table, and not after we've already walked out the door. Seat us where we are most comfortable, and not what's most convenient for you (especially when the restaurant is practically empty).
