Blah I am so tired of not finding a good mexican food restaurant.  I took the word from one of my cousins that this place by my house was good.  This place was full. Nicely decorated.  Service was good. The chips and salsa were okay.  Salsa was not at all spicey.  I asked for a hotter salsa they said the other one is a smooth one from bottle... I dont know if im just so used to homemade salsas or what.  I ordered a chili Relleno plate with a flauta. Flauta was good, but no salsa for it :(. The chili relleno was horrible.  It felt like I was eating an omlette.  The egg was wrapped around the chili and chedder cheese was all over it. Chili Rellenos are dipped in the well beaten egg whites... my husband ordered his fajitas. But he took those home cause he wasnt feeling good from work.
