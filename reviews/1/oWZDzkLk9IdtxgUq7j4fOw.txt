I have been eating here for over a year. The last time I ate there I had a small baby roach crawl on my table near the napkin dispenser right after my co-worker and I received our orders. I will not be going back to this roach motel of a restaurant! I then wanted to wash my hands before we left and in the bathroom near the sink I counted 4-5 more baby roaches. this place was reported to the Maricopa County Health Department. roaches in plain view on my table! Super nasty!! I would not eat here unless you like cucarachas.
