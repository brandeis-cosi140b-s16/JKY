I wish I would have read the reviews about this El Pollo Loco location being very dirty prior to eating 2 crunchy tacos! Immediately after eating them I felt a little strange. Then the abdominal pain started. Needless to say, I am so sick right now!  I am thrilled to be running in and out of the restroom at 3:30 am! Thank you EPL Anthem for the food poisoning.
