I love TACO TUESDAYS....but I will be eating my tacos from a different place. I went there last night ordered 4 tacos and chip n salsa. I have been to this location before and have had no problems...but when I opened the container of chips n salsa I discovered they had put the SALSA on top of the CHIPS!! WHY??? Now they are SOGGY chips. I have ordered chips n salsa from other places they have never done this so I would have never thought to ask them to not do it.

The tacos were lacking chicken on both ends of the shell. So the first bite and last bite are shell only....well at least something was CRUNCHY!!

I called them when I got home and because it was late there was no manager and the two ladies I spoke to were UNABLE to understand me. I don't speak Spanish!!
