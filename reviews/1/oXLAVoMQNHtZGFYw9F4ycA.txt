Worst chipotle experience I've ever had, which sucked, because I love chipotle. Poor / lethargic / disinterested customer service. No chips or fajita veggies. Skimped portions served. Wish I had a better experience because I inevitably feel guilty for being so harsh, but maybe it'll kickstart a more enthusiastic team?
