Terrible. Flavorless. Disappointing. 

These are the words that come to mind when I think of our "meal" at Taco Maker. We stopped after walking the strip during the craziness of March Madness weekend and just wanted a temporary reprieve -- an easy meal and some peace and quiet. We stopped by the Fashion Show Mall - which looked pretty fancy - and saw the food court. Even though there was hardly anyone in the food court, we wondered, how bad can it be?

The answer: really bad. 

We picked out poison: Taco Maker. It looked promising. We got veggie nachos and a veggie burrito. The person making it nachos barely put any cheese on it (and they first wanted to go cheese sauce on me) and thus it was disgustingly bland. The veggie burrito looked promising, but it had no taste (especially of course for the plentiful taste of salt). 0 for 2. We left the mall feeling disappointed, unsatisfied, and, of course, extremely gassy. They really should rename Taco Maker to Fart Maker. Steer clear.
