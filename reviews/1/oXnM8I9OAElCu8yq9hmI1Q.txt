Okay, so at one point in time I would have been happy to say Garcia's was a good place to eat. Not anymore. It is probably the worst place, ever. Let me tell you of my experience and their horrible service at this place...

We were at Arizona Mills and were starving.  We passed up Rainforest Caf√© as the wait was long and Garcia's was no waiting.  Now I know why..

We were seated almost immediately. Now keep in mind I have eaten at Garcia's in the past (years ago) and was pleased.  The first thing I notice is our waiter looks like a McDonalds reject- his grammar is horrid and he mumbles almost constantly.  There is nothing pleasant about this guy. I order a beer and fish tacos.  

After over 20 minutes, my beer shows up, and is sloshed all over the table.  Okay- no big deal. I wait, and wait, and wait... Finally, my fish tacos show up- or, wait- what is this? He gives me the plate of food and leaves.  I sit, staring in amazement wondering why my fish tacos look so funny. I look at my plate, wave to get his attention and when he finally has time for me he comes over.  I tell him "Hey, I don't know what this is, but I ordered fish tacos!" His reply? Get ready- I've never, ever in my life heard this one. My waiter, the guy who is supposed to make my eating experience here WONDERFUL says "The guy who got your tacos isn't complaining", of course I chuckle thinking he is joking when indeed I realize he is NOT.  He points across the room to the guy who received my tacos and seemed to have no issue with it. I tell him I do not want the mess in front of me, but the fish tacos. I am surprised he didn't go get the half eaten ones from the other guy.

I get my fish tacos, they were disgusting. Poor quality, poor taste, poor everything.  I get the ticket, to see not only was I charged for the Steak and enchilada sauce (or whatever it was) but for the TWO plates of fish tacos! WOW! All I got from this restaurant, was a very bitter taste in my mouth!
