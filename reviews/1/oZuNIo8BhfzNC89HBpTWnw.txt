Literally the worst service I have ever received. The blonde and brunette behind the bar on Friday and Saturday night act like you are an inconvenience to them when you order a drink. Hello you are a bar tender it's your job!!!!!!! It's takes them forever and any mix drink you get sucks and taste only like the mix. It's a shame because I really love the street tacos and all the games they have.
