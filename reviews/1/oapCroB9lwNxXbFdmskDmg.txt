5 of us ate lunch there yesterday.  3 had burritos.  2 didn't.  The the three that had the burritos have been so sick all day today!!!  Vomiting, diarrhea, chills, aches.  Unreal.  My husband is a doctor and he reported this to the health department but they said they have to wait until more people report a problem!  We called the restaurant and they didn't seem to care.  My two sons and daughter in law are all still sick.  
They didn't eat anything but ice cream after the lunch and one son didn't even eat that.  So it had to be Frank & Lupe's.  I am so upset.  We drove home to CA with one son who was so sick in the car.  The sick ones are young healthy people.  Sure hope no children or old people eat there until they solve this problem!!!!!!
