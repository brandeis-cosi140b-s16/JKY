Roach alert:(
I tried this place for the first time.  The food was pretty good and very well priced.  I was excited to know that I had found a decent Mexican restaurant close to me. 
 While enjoying my taco plate with rice and beans, I forked a roach out of my rice.
We immediately stopped eating and called the waiter to our table.  She tried to offer me something else, but I couldn't stand the thought of my rice cooking and steaming with a roach.  We walked out and will never be back again.  
Things happen, the place didn't look dirty.  I know roaches can be a pesky problem, but people shouldn't be finding roaches in their food.  I feel bad posting this, I mean no harm, but as someone who relies on these reviews when I decided on where to eat, I would want to know if I were you.  Anytime something like this happens, I feel obligated to let people know.  
Hopefully they can resolve their roach issue, either way, I can't go back.
