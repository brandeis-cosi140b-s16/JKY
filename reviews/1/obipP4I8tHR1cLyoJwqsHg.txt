I'm not quite sure if I ate at the same place as the reviewers giving 3 & 4 stars. If you think this is fresh and authentic I wonder where else you've been eating Mexican food. A microwave in the kitchen doesn't scream "fresh" to me. We were first put off by an odor when we first walked in and should have left then.   We were also the only customers on a Friday night. But I'd read so many good reviews that we ordered anyway. I ordered a combo with beef enchiladas with red sauce, rice and beans. It was terrible. The red sauce tasted more like tomato sauce than enchilada sauce.  My sister had a shredded beef tostada. The shredded beef was dry and not well seasoned.  Taco Bell is better and a lot cheaper.
