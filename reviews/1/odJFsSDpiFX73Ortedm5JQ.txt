Literally discussing, coming from California I know good Mexican food and this was anything but authentic. Their barbacoa is way to sweet with a teriyaki taste and their hot sauce literally tastes like tostitos brand chip salsa. Don't order the guacamole it taste like power mix guac. Honestly run for the hills I rather eat tacobell.
