Did not charge us for chips and salsa (which was 2 flavors of watered down green/smokey liquid).  Couldn't find anything on menu to order, strange combinations, etc. Finally chose the cheese enchiladas which were dry and tasteless -- the dish (bowl) contained mostly beans, rice, potatoes and carrots for $14.95!  The other entree, chicken enchiladas with mole, had a few shreds of chicken only, tortillas were dry and tough in both entrees.  Prices way too steep for the quantity and quality of food.  Mediocre/despacio service.  $3.95 for light domestic beer.  Spent $56.00 including tip and crossed it off our list. Not impressed.
