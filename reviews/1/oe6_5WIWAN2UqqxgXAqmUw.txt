If I could give zero or negative stars I would. First they couldn't repeat the order back to me correctly through the drive thru, repeated three times we needed 2 #14 all beans no rice. Drive up to pay she only entered for one, she finally gets the order right. We drive home unpack the car and settle down to eat. No beans all rice. Call up to complain, told them repeatedly I no longer had the receipt, she said no manager in the store, but that they'd remake the meals. I get into the car and drive back over. The twit in the drive thru demands the wrong meals back which I didn't grab as I flew out the door. She refuses to do anything, I then demand my money back as we now need to get dinner elsewhere as we can't eat rice. She demands the receipt which I'd already explained ad nauseum that I no longer had. She's treating me like I'm in the wrong when it was their no English comprehending illegal who screwed up. We'd eaten there several times in the past but will no longer give them business.
