We have been going to  Filibertos for many years. This location in A.J. used to be good but has been going downhill in the last year or so, but so bad now we will never go back. They are incredibly chincy with their portion sizes in fact their bean burritos have gotten  down to the size of a Twinkie. They don't like to give out more than a couple small containers of sauce and their tacos hardly have any meat in them mostly lettuce.
