Inattentive service.

Food was so squalid that I literally wrote a narrative on the back of the receipt to give to chef about food preparation.

Drinks are OK but terribly overpriced.

Certainly a place to go on a friday night if you're looking to party, but I would HEAVILY suggest against eating here, especially if you like Mexican food.  

Terrible food.  Would be considered bland even if you were a Iowan from some small two-horse town and had never had Mexican food before.

Terrible service.  Waited 15 minutes on a slow night for service and had t o walk inside and ask the bartender to sent a waitress out.  And even then, completely indifferent.

Overall impression.   Someone needs a tax writeoff.  It's almost as if "The Producer's" Max Bialystock opened a Mexican restaurant:  "So we can make MORE money if the restaurant fails?  BRILLIANT!"
