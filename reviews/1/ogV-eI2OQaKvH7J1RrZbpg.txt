Let me say one positive thing before I launch into my tirade:  the wait staff are very friendly and attentive.  BUT...this is OMG-really-bad food.  I should have paid attention to the sinking feeling I felt when, upon walking in during what SHOULD have been the middle of the lunch rush, I realized that NOBODY else was there.  Oddly, though, it took a really long time to get our food.  The chips and salsa were just barely okay.  My tortilla soup was bland, with not much chicken but plenty of overcooked vegetables.  The BF ordered a combination plate with a taco, enchilada, and chile relleno.  The taco was nothing special.  The coating on the chile relleno was a disgusting mass of soggy crust, cheese, and grease.  He pushed on it, and a river of grease streamed out onto his plate.  The enchilada was...interesting.  The filling consisted of a mix of meat, refried beans, and rice.  It was virtually tasteless, except for a funny wang of...wait for it...BREAKFAST SAUSAGE.  "Mexican" food does not get any more gross than this.    I'd go to Taco Bell before revisiting Cancun.

In the quest for good Mexican food in the Madison area, there IS a bright side, though: Taqueria Guadalajara is re-opening--TOMORROW.
