Extremely disappointing service and inconsistent quality compared to other locations.  I ordered several meals online including one gluten free and arrived at the time it was supposed to be ready. I was told three of my meals were ready but that they wait for the person picking up a GF order to arrive before preparing it. Then I was told that  they are working on it "now." Even though their excuse made no sense, I believed it wouldn't be long since it wasn't a complicated order and tried to be understanding. I waited. Then was told "Sorry for the wait.  Have a free drink while you wait". I didn't want the drink. Then I was told again that they were working on it "now" and offered a free drink. A supervisor type complimented the crew saying "good job for getting through all those orders with only a GF order" left to do, as if keeping a GF order waiting is preferred. And the food quality was inconsistent with other locations.
