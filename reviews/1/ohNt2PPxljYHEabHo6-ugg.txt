Ok.  The tacos came to the table  with cold meat. Isn't the restaurant called Hot Taco?  Seem to have temperature issue with all sides and  other food except with my husband steak fajitas.  That came out super hot.  Waiter was good and attentive. 

Atmosphere seems more bar like in evening and parking is hard to find. They have parking lot attendant charging too on weekend when we came.
