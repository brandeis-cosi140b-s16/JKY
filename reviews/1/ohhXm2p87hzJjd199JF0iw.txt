I just ordered this take out tonite and thinking it was going to be amazing i was highly disappointed. The only reason i am giving one star is because the mini chimis were pretty good everything else tasted horrible. The beans tasted like they were from a can and not fresh. The guacamole was bland and also tasted like the chili in it was from a can. I would think it is suppose to be fresh veggies not instant garbage. Wasnt worth the money i spent. I will not be going back anytime soon.
