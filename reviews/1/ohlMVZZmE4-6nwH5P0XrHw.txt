I went there because I ordered it online they messed up my order. The girl kept claiming I didn't order when I did. She didn't have the receipt in her hand even though I had a copy saying that I paid and what I wanted. The order was suppose to be for three I showed up ten minutes early and the worker kept telling me to look at the clock and it's not 3 o clock. Bad people working there and very rude to customers.
