I'm very upset at the way my parents were treated here this weekend.  If you want to be racial discriminated and treated poorly this is your place to go. It's embarrassing to have them visit (from out of state) our home here in Phoenix  and be treated as though they're not good enough to get quality and timely service. You would think in this day and age that a black man and white woman would get the same respect as anyone else. To make matters worse no one bothered to apologize or even at least comp their meal. I cannot believe that my daughter will have to be prepared to face this kind of behavior. I will NEVER eat here in the future and hope no one else supports them either.
