The language barrier is a real problem. I highly suggest going inside and ordering and not using the drive thru. Almost every time they mess up my order. Food is ok but service is worse. Inside has ripped booths and is a real dump so we order to go. Green chili burros are good and pretty consistent. Tacos are chewy.
