Long lines,no gauc. No pico, very slow new working employees, what happened to all the previous employees? People in line were complaining about how slow it has gotten. Waited in line for 40 minutes and ordered hot sauce on the side when I got home no sauce was ever given to me. One burrito was also smashed and the meat and everything  came out on one side, which I don't know how that happened since they fold them pretty snug to the tin foil?...
