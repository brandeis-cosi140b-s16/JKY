We hadn't been to Macayo's for awhile and I remember them being better than last night. Both of our foods, bean burro and chimi, were completely tasteless. Probably the worst burro or burrito I've ever had. Although, our server was great and the tortilla soup was good.  We usually have Mexican food 2-3 times a month and with how many mexican restaurants there are, we have many to choose from and Macayo's will not be one we return to.
