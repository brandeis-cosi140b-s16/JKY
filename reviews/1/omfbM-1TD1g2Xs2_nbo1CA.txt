I  ordered  1  spicy  potato  taco and  gave  my  debit  card  to the  clerk.  I  don't  know  what  she  did   with  it.   The  receipt  showed  that  she  charged  me  $  0.98   but  when  I  went  home  and  looked  up  my  account  online  I  saw  3  charges:   1  was  from   "Taco Bell #20899"   for  $ 1.73   and  the  other  two  from  "Sand  Taco in  Apache  Junction"  for  $ 0.98  and  $ 1.09      I  feel  that  what  they  do  is  fraud.   You  can't  even  swipe  the  card  yourself.  When you  give  them  your  card  you  don't  even  know  what  you  are  authorizing,  you  don't  see the  amount  which  they  charge  and  you  don't  sign  anything  like  at  other  businesses.     I  guess  she  swiped  it  three  times  and the  receipt  showed  only  the  first  swipe.
