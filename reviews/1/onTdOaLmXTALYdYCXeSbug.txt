People who rate this place over 2 stars are either "on the books" or suffered from a frontal lobotomy. 

Here are 6.5 reasons not to go here:

1) El Zocalo had a 2.5hr wait last night, so we walked across the street to Serranos and was immediately seated

2) Ordered Don Julio Margaritas, received 4 small wine glasses with Sweet & Sour (waitress acknowledged they were made with too little alcohol)

3) Terrible Ambiance (drop tile-ceiling, commercial pressboard restaurant tables)

4) Waitress couldn't remember what anyone ordered numerous times (forgot sour cream, forgot corn tortillas)

5) Rather than coming by to fill up the water, they leave pitchers on the table

6) the food was doused in salt; heck, even this morning I had to move my watch band out a notch

6.5) There's an adult video store next door...
