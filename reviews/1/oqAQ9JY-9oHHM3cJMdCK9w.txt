First time here, loved it, came back for the second visit not so great, tried them again last night, HUGE MISTAKE!!!! This was for take out - They got my order wrong, didn't even get my entire order and when I called to speak to a manager I was told there was not one there. When I started to voice my complaint the girl who answered the phone was very defensive, she said I took the order it was not wrong. When I asked where the rest of my order was she hung up on me. I called back and she refused to answer the phone, I blocked my # she picked up and needless to say we had words. However, I have never in my life been told by a business that I was a customer of F*#k you and hung up on. Stay away they would rather be right than stay in business! WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE AWARD EVER!!!
The owner should be ashamed to employ people like this.
