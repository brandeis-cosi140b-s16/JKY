I had a terrible experience at this restaurant. I walked in and they took about 10 min to bring us the menu, I was then waiting for another 15 min and no one came to get our order so we had to walk away. There were only  about four tables and plenty of staff to take care of us. 
menu: large menu 
services: Terrible!! 
prep time:  unknown (I'm sure they take forever 2)
atmosphere:  old looking decorations, thumbs down
Best Thing:  Free chips and salsa
other comments: During the weekend they play Latin music, so If you feel like shaking your hips you can check this place out!
