The food was ok, it was the service that brought down the rating so much. First off, our server must have been new so, being a fellow service industry worker,  I definitely tried to be patient and understanding. 

She took our orders and was quick to bring us our chips and salsa, but when our dinners came immediately we realized that she had forgotten to sans the black olives and onions from my boyfriends order, not a big problem, he just picked them off and gave them to me. After a couple bites of my sides, I dug into my burrito which I realized was definitely not a chicken burrito like I had ordered. I got the waitresses attention and she asked if I still wanted to eat it or if she should bring it back. I asked to have my original order and she took my plate away apologetically. Still not a big deal. She brought back my burrito minus my sides. I was a little disappointed, I wanted the sides that came with my meal. I motioned her back to the table and asked if I could have my sides of rice and beans. A couple minutes later she returned. Not with warm new sides...but with my old plate of now cold, picked at, rice and beans minus the burrito. It was as if she pulled it out of the sink off of a stack of dishes to be washed to bring back to me because, god forbid, they mess up an order and refresh a customers side of rice and beans...

I was baffled by this. Completely and utterly baffled.
