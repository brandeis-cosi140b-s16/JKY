The first time I went here, I had 2 tacos and thought they were delicious

The second time I went here, I had the wonton soup and 2 tacos and thought dog doo would taste better.

I thought about why the difference in opinions from both experiences and finally figured it out.  The first time someone paid for it, and the second time I paid for it!

The second time, I spent $18 on the wonton soup, and $9 on 2 tacos (street taco size).  Nothing gourmet about this crap at all other than the fancy name "By Jose Andres" attached to it.  I later asked for a coke and the server happily gave me one, and asked for $6.50.  $6.50 for a coke...really?

I forgot i was eating at a Jose Andres establishment.  Next time I'll just take my money and throw it on the floor, spit on it, and walk away.  Probably more satisfaction from that then eating here.
