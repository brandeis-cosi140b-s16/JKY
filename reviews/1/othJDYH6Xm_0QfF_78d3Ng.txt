Sad just sad.  First red flag the drink prices were not on the menu. Second you could see the store bought taco shells stacked up on top of the freezer (are you a restaurant or a drive thru?). The menu is full of rules i.g. extra charge for this, no duplicates on the combo meals (really?  Why?). it is not like you are putting in any real cooking effort.

Wait staff seemed indifferent. Everything was a bother to them.
