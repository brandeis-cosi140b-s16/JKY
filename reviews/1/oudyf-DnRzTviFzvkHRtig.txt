It's sad to see how far downhill Garcia's has gone down over the years. I grew up near the original family's restaurant in Scottsdale. I was disappointed when they were sold to the chain, but it was at least decent for a while. We went there last night after not having been to Garcia's for quite some time, and it was very disappointing. The service was indifferent at best. The salsa and chips were not only not very flavorful, but slightly sweet--as were our entrees. Looking around I noticed almost all the clientele were senior citizens. It appears they have adjusted their recipes to suit this much older crowd, cutting the spices and adding sugar. It was almost like those who work there know that Garcia's is not real Mexican food anymore, and that their heyday has long gone.
