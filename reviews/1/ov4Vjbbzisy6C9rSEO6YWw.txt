If I could give this place no stars, I would. I've only been to this place twice, but the last time made the final decision to never return. I went in on a Tuesday for lunch since they have the taco specials. I ordered 2 chicken tacos and 1 steak taco. Never once did I hear my number be called. It was busy in there so I continued to wait. After about 20 min of waiting, I decided to go to the counter. The lady then informed me that someone else took my food! ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME?! That didn't sit too well with me especially since they check the numbers before handing out the food. So I had to wait an additional 5 min for the cook to prepare my food again. I only get half an hour for my lunch so I was furious! There was no apologies from anyone. I didn't even want the food by then. Once I actually ate the food, the tacos were hard (almost stale like) and the chicken was way too chared. I defintiely won't be returning and I will NOT recommend anyone to this place.
