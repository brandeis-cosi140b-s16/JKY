Kudos to the food but customer service sucks. We ordered through the phone and the lady that was getting our order was BEYOND rude, I wasn't even done ordering and she told me to remind her about my drinks cuz she's busy and hung up. My friends and I go there to pick up our food and there wasn't any barely people! To top it off super bad attitude when I asked a question. I'd rather go to Don Tortaco right next door, food is great and customer service is amazing!
