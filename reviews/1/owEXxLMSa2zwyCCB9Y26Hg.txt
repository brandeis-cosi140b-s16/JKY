I was going to give this place a good review. The service was good, the food came out fast (we went through the drive thru), and the price isn't too bad. But half way through the meal my wife found a wire mesh (like the ones on the faucet in a bathroom sink) in her tostada salad. Not only is this level of neglect dangerous, it is just gross. What if that had been in a child's food? I don't think we will ever be eating there again.

Update: I talked to the manager and he offered a full meal replacement. My wife and I went into get the meal and they gave us a very hard time about it. We decided to dine in this time, and sadly more than half of the tables are dirty, both trash cans are overflowing, and the salsa bar is half empty. On top of all that they messed up my wife's meal replacement and gave her the wrong thing. The worst part about this is that they aren't even busy. This is a case of pure laziness. Very disappointing.
