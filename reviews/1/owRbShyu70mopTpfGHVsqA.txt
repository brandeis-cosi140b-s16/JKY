It is seldom that I feel like I will never return to a restaurant under any circumstances and this is one of them.  The restaurant was expensive and the food was terrible.  The salsas were bordering on tasteless, the entr√©es huge.  I had the regular chili rellenos.  They were swimming in a tasteless sauce, with very little chili taste.  I managed to get one of the huge rellenos down.  My side was refried beans.  They were good.  We took the remaining relleno home for my husband's lunch the next day.  He ate the beans but he also could not eat the Relleno, and it hit the garbage can.  I seldom write reviews but I feel that this is one that needs to be written.  Please read the other other reviews.  I found them to be true even down to the chip in the salsa bowl.
