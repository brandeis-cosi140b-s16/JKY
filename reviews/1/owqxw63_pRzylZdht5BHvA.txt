I took my Dad for his birthday here thinking it would be a nice place to have dinner. I couldn't be more wrong. The food was okay but the portions were very small. I ordered the steak and shrimp and it was a joke. I got to Small shrimps and a small thin piece of meat. Everyone was upset with the portions very small. 

The service was probably the worst service I've ever had a restaurant and my wife and I go out a lot. The waiter Matt forgot everything we ordered and waited a long time to refill our drinks. He also charged my card 3X for the horrible experience. I later called them and they told me he messed up and that it was unfortunate for me and that I had to wait til they release my funds on my bank statement. I find it amazing how they can just say sorry, we charged your account 3x and we aren't going to do anything about it. I feel I deserved some compensation for the headache of dealing with this horrible service and their mistake. 

Our bill was approximately $300.00 and I had a restaurant.com discount of $100. I was charged $200.00, my brother was charged $200.00, and my brother-in-law was charged $200.00 and now we are pending at the bank because they don't know how to pay attension. I hate that in the fine print it states we have to tip 18% because he deserved 5% tops. 

Hopefully you read this and you don't go to this place because they are just awful. I recommend Los Olivos in Scottsdale if your looking for good food and great service.
