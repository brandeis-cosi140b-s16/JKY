I went to this place with my friend was waste a money and time ,first restaurant experience the  both doors of the bunisses was close in bunisses hours with costumes inside the place,we had to get the atention of the server that was on the patio with the patio door close inside to to open the door for us than we went to buy our food the ladie on the cashier offered a terrible customer service, we said ok let's sit down and wait  for the food .The food did not taste good and was grease we couldn't eat that .We did ate the chips and the guacamole was ok.While we were eating chips and guacamole  a man did clean 4 tables with the same smelling dirty rag.So we decide to leave the place and again the both doors inside and patio was close again.What a disaster.I'm sorry for the bad review it is honest and truthful I know this place just open I hope them can fix the issues plus the doors for the safety of the customers and workers.
