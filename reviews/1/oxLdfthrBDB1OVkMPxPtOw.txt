I was here with friends for drinks and dinner last Thursday evening, and I have to say that nothing about this restaurant was acceptable for any of us.

First, we didn't have reservations and were greeted with slightly rude service by the host.  However, I think she noticed that we were a little taken aback by the attitude, and quickly changed her mood.

In the downstairs bar, we ordered drinks while we waited for a table to open up for us.  The bartender made a mistake while preparing my friend's Bloody Mary, accidentally dumping an enormous amount of tabasco in her drink.  However instead of simply making a new one, he served it to her anyway (admitting his mistake while setting it down in front of her) and told her to let him know if she didn't like it and wanted a new one.  Of course she tried it, couldn't drink it and had to ask for a new one.

After we got to our table upstairs and ordered our appetizers and meals, things got worse.  It took well over half an hour to get our appetizers, and when we did they were cold.  We were not sure that our oysters were supposed to be as cold as they were, but the fact that they had congealed melted cheese seemed to indicate that they should haver at least been warm.

After we finally got our salads (about 45 minutes after ordering), we were rushed through them before getting our meals just a couple minutes later.  None of us enjoyed our meals, as we found them either burnt or bland.

Even though we made a few complaints about our meal to the server, when our check came we found that we had been charged for everything and were only offered a very pallid apology for the obvious problems with our meal.

this was not an inexpensive meal, either, so we will likely not be back!
