If you're looking for the typical BIG filibertos burrito, you won't find it here. Theirs are half the size of what you expect of a fili b's burrito, but more expensive. They shouldn't be allowed to call themselves filibertos. Also, we were the only people in the drive thru and our order took about 20 minutes. Not worth the time or money. This was the 2nd time I went here and both times it was exactly the same. Never going back.
