I dreaded having to do this someday, but I feel it's my duty to warn others that the food here is pretty disappointing. Won't go into detail about my subjective opinion of the quality, just avoid it. If the owners read this, I'd be happy to give fair, honest feedback on how they missed the mark.
I give 5 stars to the style/color and the addition of a deck.
Speaking Spanish was helpful when ordering and helping convey that my brother is allergic to dairy. The waiter appreciated it and my brother initially felt at ease.

I'll probably go back for margs and modelo on tap cuz they do have pretty good prices on them.
