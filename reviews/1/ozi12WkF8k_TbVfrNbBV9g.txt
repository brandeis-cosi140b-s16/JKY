If I could give half a star I would, this place is ALL HYPE. I came here on a recommendation from someone else, I'm Mexican just so you know... The food isn't even authentic, they're making a killing because it's busy and it's super and I mean SUPER OVERRATED. The carne asada is the worse meat I've ever had, dry like beef jerky and zero flavor. The salsas blow too, no heat or flavor and you can't even self serve the chili, oh did I mention you have to wait in separate lines to order depending on what meat you want ? Save your money.
