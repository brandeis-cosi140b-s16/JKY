Ok so last Sunday I called around 8 to ask what time they closed. They told me they close at 9, I asked them "if I get there a couple minutes before 9 can we still get served? We are coming from very far away and we really like the food that's why we travel so far" the lady on the phone, one of the waitresses asked me what I would be ordering and I told her, she said ok that's fine we will see you here. I arrived there at 8:55 pm, before 9 obviously, I tried to open the door and in was locked, at first I thought I was just not pulling hard enough so I kept pulling then I realized it was closed. I had my daughter in my arms she's only 14 months, and the wind was crazy, I grabbed my phone and I called them, yes I am still standing in front of the door, the employees are staring at me as well as the owner and I tell them " hey I called earlier and I was told if I came before 9 you'll still serve me, I even already told the lady what we wanted" she said oh no we're already closed. " but i cálled and i was told it was ok" she then told me "the owner( la señora) said were already closed and she clicked on me. While I'm standing right outside the door. No hey I'm sorry we're closed already, they literally just ignored a client that drove more than 30 min to get there. The owner of this place is a joke, I can  assure you this business won't succeed. CUSTOMER SERVICE IS NUMBER ONE PRIORITY. If you don't treat your customers with respect, they won't come back! And you can be sure no one from my 55 + members in my family will be coming here anymore, and I will make sure to tell everyone I know of the terrible owner and staff! Si quiere negoció que lo atienda!
