In an area of failing and closing restaurants El Gran Taquito is another fail. We had high hopes walking in yesterday as the place was packed with cops and they often know what's a good hole in the wall. 

I had the combo #1- both the pork and beef were dried out and well below proper temperature. The rice had zero flavor and the beans were grey. My husband had the chile relleno which he declared greasy but pretty good. I think his standards have already plummeted in the two weeks we have lived in the culinary wasteland that is Laveen.

Within half an hour of returning home, I was suffering digestive distress. It looks like we'll have to start cooking for ourselves again.
