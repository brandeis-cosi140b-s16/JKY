Went here tonight, a Tuesday around 6:30pm, and it was so busy we could only get a seat in the bar. A waitress came to take our drink order after about 10 minutes of waiting. We were sitting in the bar though and figured oh well. We place a drink order and then wait 20 minutes. We never receive our drinks in this time, never saw the server again, and even though we tried to flag other servers down, no one paid attention to us. The bar is fairly small so this should have been an easy task and even though they were busy, 30 minutes and no drinks even is unacceptable. Since we hadn't received anything and couldn't get anyone's attention, we just left. We won't be going back.
