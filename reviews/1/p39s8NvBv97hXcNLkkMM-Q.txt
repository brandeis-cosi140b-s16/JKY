I went here for the first time on 2/16/13.......ordered our food, got our food.....then it got busier and all of the sudden the service went DOWNHILL............we never got a refill, and we had to hunt our waitress down to get our check while she was goofing off. There was nothing about the food to make me come back in the first place!!!!!! I even feel like because my boyfriend is a white boy we seem to get bad service sometimes on top of everything..............I would not go back to this Nightmare of a restaurant
  I should of just gone to a QUIZNOS
