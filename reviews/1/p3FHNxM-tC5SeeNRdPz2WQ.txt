Visited this Rubios last week around 8pm.  The store looked like it was closed as they had chairs on tables and someone mopping the floors - the mopping of floors, taking out trash and putting chairs on tables while open is a no-no in restaurants and against the rules in most restaurants.  The cashier got my order wrong twice and the cooking staff who were all wearing gloves and did not change gloves between orders which they are suppose to do.  They had to make my fiesta salad three times because the first two times they they actually got dirt and grease on the salad and were going to serve it to me if I had not said something.  The food is always good, but you need to watch and make sure they are sanitary which this Rubios was not.
