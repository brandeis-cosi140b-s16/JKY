This restaurant has horrible service, blah food, with high prices. I ordered the shredded beef tacos which was 13.95, they charged me .99 for flour tortillas and 1.50 for shredded beef which was already on menu? Was going to complain to mgmnt, but was in a super hurry to see a show so I just paid these extra charges.. They ruined my nite out .. Stay away!!
