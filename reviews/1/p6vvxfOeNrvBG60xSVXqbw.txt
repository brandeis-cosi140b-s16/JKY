I'm sitting on the throne pissing out of my ass....can you guess how this review is going to play out?

Let's begin...service was awful. Sat outside and was helped by a young girl who between visits to the table was popping zits on her face...had a couple tiny drops of blood leaking of them smh

Food: smfh
Simple enough..carn√© asada burrito with cheese.
Meat was real fatty, guacamole was runny and abundant. Cheese....this cheese was the kind of unnatural cheese that will NEVER melt if you dropped it in a fire pit. Bottom of my burrito was cold, yet the top was warm...hmmm I wonder why...maybe because the plate felt like they just got it out of the refrigerator...

Never saw the server again...probably popping more pimples.

Tired of waiting I went to the window to ask if someone could bring me my check...only to be told oh there is no check you pay at the window. Nice to know.

NEVER will I visit this dump again!
