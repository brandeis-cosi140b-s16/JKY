After coming from the Chipolte in Avondale that had grey/brown guac, we wait in a long line at this location only to get to the front and be told they are out of white rice. The girl originally said it would be ready in 10 min, then 7 min later they came out and said that it would be another 30 min!! It's 6 on a Friday!!!!!! How do you not have things prepared! It's not looking good for the Chipoltes in the this area. We are now driving to the one on Bell rd. hopefully everything goes smoothly there....
