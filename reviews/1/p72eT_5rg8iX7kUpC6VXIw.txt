Decided to give it a shot despite the reviews. Ordered my food, the lady tells me to come to the window without reading back my order or giving me a total. Then I get up to the window and asks me if I still want my food because they're cleaning their grill or something. She was mumbling the last bit. Nevertheless I told her no, since I need to go back to work. Ended up getting Jamba Juice instead, maybe she did me a favor lol. It's a shame cause it's right down the street from my job.
