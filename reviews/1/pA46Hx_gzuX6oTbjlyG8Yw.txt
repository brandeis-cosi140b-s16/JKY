Absolutely horrible.  I went in to this "hole in the wall" place hoping the food would be great after reading some reviews.  However, the food and service were on par with the looks of the place.  The combo plate I received was too hot to touch and the food was on the verge of being burned.  Once it cooled down, I tasted the burro, and it hardly had any meat in it.  My combo plate was tiny for the $10 price.  The Chile relleno sat in a pool of its own grease and seemed like it was fried in oil at too low a tempereature.  It was inedible.  We were charged extra for more chips and the soda was watered down.  There were kids and babies everywhere.  I understand it was supposed to have a family atmosphere, but the owner's children were crawling around the restaurant like it was their personal playground.  In the end, I just felt ripped off. I won't be returning.
