Not happy with our service, food ok. Took forever to get seated. Finally seated (2 adults, 1 2.5 yr old and 11 mth old twins--all well behaved and happy). Once seated, we were given chips, no waters. Took awhile for server to come. Once he came, he got our drink order wrong (brought a beer we did not order and iced tea, still no waters). Sent beer back. When we ordered, our server kept changing our order so we "could save money". ? He said appetizer was free for first time customers. We ordered the cheese crisp. Came back 3 times asking if we really wanted it with guac and beef. Appetizer finally came. It was good. Luckily I brought snacks to keep the kids happy. Meal finally came. We had to eat fast and asked for the check because we had now been there for 1.5 hrs. The server up charged for the so called "free appetizer" and dips and charged us for a beer that we didn't order. We had to leave by then so I did not leave a good tip. Not happy and not coming back. **I usually give pretty good reviews and places a break, but not happy with service here.
