Taste not authentic, at all.  Went with a group and was able to try quite a few dishes and nothing "hit the spot". We tried the skillet nacho, fried cauliflower, chorizo empanadas, chopped salad, Kale salad, Cubano tortas, strawberry haus margarita, sweet empanadas. 

The good: fried cauliflower, flavor and portion was great. Should be an appetizer.  Kale salad, flavor was great. 

The bad: skillet nachos, overly flavored with pickled something. Chorizo empanadas, too bready. Cubano tortas, just taste like a sandwich not a torta or any Spanish flare. 
Haus margarita, watered down. 

The ugly: pipping hot chicken on the chopped salad. It was just a salad, not much chopped about it. 

The eh...sweet empanadas.  Good just like the ones they have at Taco Bell.
