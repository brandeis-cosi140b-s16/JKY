Terrible terrible terrible service. Terrible watery chicken in their quesadilla. $7.75 for water logged chicken and cheese. GROSS!

Wait staff does not seem to appreciate their patrons. At all. 

Tried to give them another chance. They blew that too. The cashier ignored my presence when I tried to simply order a bean burrito to replace the disgusting chicken. 

Do NOT waste your hard earned $ here.
