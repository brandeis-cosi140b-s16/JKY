This place has horrible service . I asked if the tacos contained onions or tomatoes the girl at the register said no . I bit into my taco to right away receive onions and tomatoes. I took back the tacos and told them I didn't want onion or tomatoes and that's why I had asked . The girl went to the back then came back saying the only meat that doesn't have onions was in the rolled taco. So I said ok I'll have those instead .I bite into it and to my surprise onions and tomatoes AGAIN! So I tried eating just my beans and rice , that wasn't very great either not very authentic .
