We used to go to Garcia's on Rural & 60 and really enjoyed their food. Last night we went to Garcia's on Warner and McClinktok (new location) after over 4 years and found that the food was very disappointing. I ordered Tilapia which was overcooked and chewy. My wife ordered veg Quesadilla which was greasy and the oil used for cooking had a strong smell. I don't think we'll be going there any more.
