I ordered chips with guacamole and side of fajita vegetables.  Chips were light and crispy, no complaints here.  Guac was so loaded with onion it was difficult to taste the avocado.  The side of fajita vegetables contained 2 slivers of red bell pepper and the rest was onions.  I would only return here for chips and even that would be questionable given the unpleasant counter service.
