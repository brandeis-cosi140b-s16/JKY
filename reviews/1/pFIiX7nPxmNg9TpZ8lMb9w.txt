I am totally thinking this place must write its own 5 star review. This place was horrible!!!!!!!
Microwaved my nasty beans. Carne asada torta was a big joke. The micro-thin fat riddled "ribeye" steak was 1/8 maybe thick and about 30% smaller than torta bun.  The Barbacoa could have been good if it did not have so much salt. What's really bad is I am a salt hound and it was too salty for me. Lord help some that doe not do salt.  I cannot understand how this place could get such a high rating..NO WAY!!!  Won't be back ever again!
