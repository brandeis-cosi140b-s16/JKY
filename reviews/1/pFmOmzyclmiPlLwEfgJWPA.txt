Usually very pleased with Tee Pee, especially before a DBacks game. But tonight two really disappointing things happened. First, we arrived about 40 min before the game and the main wave of people were already gone. We were alone in the dining room and I mean alone - as in no waitresses for 5 minutes. Beer glasses were warm (they'd just been washed! We were told) and only 2 small bowls of chips for 6 people. Most disappointing, though, was that my grandfather forgot his jacket in the booth when we left for the game. I called 20 min later from inside the ballpark and was told it couldn't be found. After the game my mom scoured the place and it was still MIA. Very sad to think it was taken.
