We came here because we were starving, and looking for mexican food. Well, we really messed up picking this place.

There's a patio area and then the area inside. We decided to eat inside, even though the girl told us there was karaoke going on inside. Big mistake. We stepped into deafening noise. The "DJ" there thought he was the funniest, cutest thing, but he was actually just obnoxious. The only people there doing karaoke were his friends and family. Like, his mom and shit. What was funny is he had a laptop to DJ. And he was shit at it. He would blast a song during every interval, and then act all flustered cause he had "so many people to get through" that night. There were two people besides us that weren't his family. Too loud and too annoying.

Also, the cooks didn't take the wrapper off of my fiance's cheese and put it on his burger. WTF. And the waiter was a jerk. I finished my water and ate my ice, and he brought out 3 more waters, I guess to be funny? I finished it because you didn't bring my drink within 10 minutes. Then he randomly stopped by and left his own personal drink on our table. wtf wtf wtf. Never again.
