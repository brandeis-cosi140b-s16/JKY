This was a one time experience. Restaurant is on the side of a bar. Decor is ok, you get the vague feeling of entering a small village near the ocean...Was seated by a very nice hostess, waiter brought salsa/chips. Salsa is tasty/warm, chips stale. Order very simple combo dinners, tacos/tamales, cheese enchalada/chile rellano. Waiter screwed second order up presented me w/ enchalada/tamale.
He corrected his mistake,but took him 10 min, served me the same rice/beans on the original plate. Tamales not home made, came from a box of tamales, that you could buy at Costco or Sam's. So on that note we decided this was not a place we wanted to eat
