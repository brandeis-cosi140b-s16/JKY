This Taco Bell is trash. The workers are way over the top with customer service, I mean like when they are way to peppy and it's annoying. I ordered my gordito box a certain way as in allergic to certain things like lettuce. It seemed as is they just put extra lettuce on everything. Spend the money somewhere else or go to a different location.
