So many better places at CLT than this overpriced poor attempt at Mexican food. Margarita, no prices on menus, but $16. Burrito, small and lifeless, was $14. I normally don't complain about price but given price and quality Tequileria should be avoided. The one positive was a hard working waiter who did what he could to make it enjoyable.
