I am far from picky, but this place is bad. The food was terrible...so bland. The Bloody Mary was watered down and bitter.. so I tried a strawberry margarita, hoping a Mexican place couldn't mess that up. Wrong. It tasted like they used tequila left over from a college party. The bottom line:don't waste your money here. The food at the Wendy's across from here is probably better.
