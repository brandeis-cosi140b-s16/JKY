Guess I should have read the reviews before coming to this overly priced, tiny portion place..

The vampiro as they call it was 4.50 and was about 3 1/2 inches in diameter tostada, barely anything on it and not so good tasting either. 

What a freakin rip off. STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS PLACE... unless you enjoy throwing your money away..


Negative 5 stars...
