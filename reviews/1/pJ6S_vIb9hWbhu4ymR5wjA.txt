I have been going to Macayo's for years. However, the one in Goodyear is terrible. I will never go there again. My husband and I took some friends there who came in from out of town and were sat down pretty much immediately. It was early on a Wednesday night so they weren't busy, but there was only one waitress working. The busser brought us our salsa and chips immediately and told us our server would get us drinks. Well, it took our server TWENTY MINUTES to even acknowledge our existence. I had to walk up to her and literally ask if we should go somewhere else. The service just went on being AWFUL the whole time we were there. She mixed up our food, didn't bring us water until she brought the food out, and at the end of it all when we spoke to the manager about the fact that it had taken us an hour to get served any kind of drink at all--he proceeded to tell us that the waitress was new. REALLY?? Then why was she the only person working?? To make matters worse our food was cold when we finally got it. This girl only had three tables and they were not large parties. I will NEVER go to this location EVER again.
