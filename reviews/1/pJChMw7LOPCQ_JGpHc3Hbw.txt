I'm 52, I've lived in AZ for 40 years and this was: THE WORST MEXICAN FOOD I'VE EVER EATEN! Prison cafeteria's surely have more sophisticated fare. It appears that everything must be sourced from a North Dakota Presbyterian luncheon. The worst chips, salsa and queso and thinner than water (is that possible? Apparently so! I even gave them back the queso and they offered to give me more and I said no thank you, but they said they'll give me some that was not watered down. Seriously? Who waters down cheese sauce? The three slow, unmotivated, cell-phone using staff made the whole experience just plain crappy. Fire the lot of them, close the place down and start fresh.
