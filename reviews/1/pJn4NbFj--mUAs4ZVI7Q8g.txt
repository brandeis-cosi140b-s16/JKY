Always wanting to support downtown mesa merchants a friend and I stopped for dinner before a Mesa Arts Center performance. I called ahead to check their happy hour offerings. They said $3 margaritas and 50% off certain appetizers. The margarita which turned out to be $3.50 was probably one of the worst I've ever had! It was almost clear and the only taste it had was odd ! There were only two apps to choose from a quesadilla and nachos! We chose the quesadilla and at our servers suggestion ordered a side of guacamole to share. The small serving of guac was piled high with poco de gallo that you had to dig through to find the guacamole and  sure to disguise the small amount of guac which was just ok nothing special as was the quesadilla. On a good note their salsa was good. I noticed on my receipt that the regular price for the quesadilla was $7.25 are they kidding ???  Sorry I won't go back
