Man, Barrio Cafe has a very hard time trying to replicate it's original location. I had some extra time at the airport due to a weather issue and decided to charge my iphone for the tenth time at Barrio Cafe. I have given Barrio Queen a chance even though the reviews were iffy at best and found out that Barrio Cafe at the airport could be even further from the original. 

Staff sucked: now this may be because it's tough to get people to work at the airport so I will let that slide. 

Food: Honest to God, I wouldn't serve this to my dog. I ordered the Tacos De Arrachera (Skirt Steak) and I am not kidding when I say this cow must have either been 70 yrs old or the chef has never grilled a skirt steak in his/her life. Unchewable and absolutely flavorless! 

My girlfriend and I are always debating over the Original Barrio Cafe as to whether or not it really is that good. I think one thing they are good at is ambiance. Cool Urban Mexican Art can't make up for a shit show in this kitchen.
