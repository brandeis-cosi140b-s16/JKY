We have been going for over 10 years and since the new "owner" took over they suck! Yup, that is the word I am using SUCKS! I even called them 4x's to inquirer them catering our rehearsal dinner and never once did anyone call me back!! This is our Sunday routine no longer!! We will be going to jack n the box for now on! That is how bad this place is!!  Service is pitiful, I have never seen any form of management in there. DONE !! I do not recommend wasting your time with this place!
