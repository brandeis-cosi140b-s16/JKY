I've been going to various Tia Rosa's locations for over ten years and have given good reviews to several but this location is the worst. It's another taqueria style place where you place your order, take a number and they bring out the food (eventually). After ordering our food, seafood tacos, we tried to find a table that wasn't being blown away by the many ceiling fans. After a twenty minute wait, and seeing other customers who came in later get their food, we asked about our order. They did bring out one dish, which was cold, and said the other would be coming out soon. After another five minuets, the second dish was served but it was cold also. When asked about the delay, the server said they forgot the food and it didn't come out. Next time I'm going to Rubio's.
