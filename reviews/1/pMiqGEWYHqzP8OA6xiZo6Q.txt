Oh man what happened??? This place used to be awesome. Now it has all changed and it is terrible! I will never return unless it changes back. No more complimentary chips and salsa? No fountain soda? No dining service?! It was wonderful as an actual restaurant. Now it is unorganized, confusing, and honestly unappetizing. Change back Don Juan and my family and I will return.
