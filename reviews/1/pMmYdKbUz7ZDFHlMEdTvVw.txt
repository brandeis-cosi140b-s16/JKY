Went thru the drive-thru. placed my order, it was repeated back to me correctly, and told the amount. Pulled forward and paid the amount asked for, and waited for my order. Received my order bagged up, and drove off. Got home and found they had only given me 1/3 of my order. Called and asked to speak to the manager, and was told they were too busy and would call me back. Only to find out the manager wasn't even there at 4PM. Was told I could get in my car and drive the 3 miles back to the store and get the rest of my order. They said they would give me some store coupons, which they give out anyway, for the inconvenience. So I could spend more money with them and give them another opportunity to screw-up another order. I now understand why there was no other customers there.
