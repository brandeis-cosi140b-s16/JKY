Do not be fooled by the location.  This is easily the worst "Mexican food" I have tasted in my life. The only thing Mexican about the food might be the description on the menu. I ordered the Tequila Lime Tacos and they honestly tasted like cardboard.  The staff is attentive and quick and the venue is somewhat welcoming but the food is simply unacceptable.  If the food was edible I might have given this place two stars to recognize the staff and their speed, but my disgust for the food prevails.
