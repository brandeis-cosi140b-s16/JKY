this is the worst service I have ever experienced in my entire life. I get to the restaurant for the first time this week. When I walked inside the owner just got done helping someone he knew by name. My eye caught the special for the day. Never been there before I asked the guy about the special and what it consisted of. no in any way interested and irritated with my questions he finally halfa**ed my order. Right after while I am in the end of my order, this guy decides to seat others  without finishing me. so 2 minutes pass and I finally said "do you want me to pay or sit down?" He replies saying "you will pay with I tell you to." By this time I am infuriated by the remark and the treatment I been receiving. He decides to come back 3 minutes later giving me a price for $14 when the special was only $6. Knowing well what I was trying to order I told him to make my order how I wanted it. Long story short he tries to walk me out, and cussed me out along the way. I HAVE NEVER BEEN TREATED LIKE THAT BEFORE IN MY LIFE.  I will never go there again and wont recommend anyone.
