Overpriced! We ordered tacos, my husband had the chicken and I had the fish. You get three size of your palm tacos.  The fish was pretty good but my husband really didn't like the chicken. Definitely don't care for corn tortillas. They should give options corn or flour. Rice wasn't good at all. Maybe it's some people's taste but we didn't care to spend that much money on something that wasn't very good and very tiny amount.  We won't be back. If you like to throw your money away then you can try it and see if it's your style.
