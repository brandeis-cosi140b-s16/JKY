Thank you, thank you..... Um........for proving my point. 

Fusion places are a bad idea.... Add the fact that its a chain to that and wow = disaster.....

We had a party of thirteen. Great service, considering the size of the table, the server was awesome... Meaning nice, and attentive.

The food however, and I use the term "food" loosely, was horrible. Why do they feel the need to mix, Mexican, southwest, southern, and Chinese!! 

Really what is that?

Can't you just do one thing amazing and not twenty things just mediocre?

Anyways...13 people and not a one finished their meal. Not a one had the same thing, not a one, took anything to go, and not a one liked what they ordered..... Ehhhhh 

Food is just weird, prepared weird, looks weird and tastes like an expensive chili's

Okay, okay.... I am done. Sad but true, such a waste of an amazing local community location...... :-( 

P.s. don't ever tell someone from the south that you serve the best cornbread in the country........well, unless its actually true. Okay thanks.
