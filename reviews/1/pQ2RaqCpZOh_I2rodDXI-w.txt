Overpriced mediocre food.  After hearing about the truck and reading the reviews I was excited to finally get a chance to patronize them at Food Truck Friday. The young man taking the orders at the window seemed to be annoyed when I asked ONE question about the menu.  I ordered the Bang Bang Shrimp Tacos.  I got three tacos full of iceberg lettuce covered in some type of sauce; with about 4 small shrimp per taco for $9.00!!!   I am not a fan!  :-(
