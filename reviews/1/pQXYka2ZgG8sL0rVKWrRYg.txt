We were loyal customers of this restaurant until we found out that the owner ( the short chubby lady )was pouring cheap ass tequila in a Patron bottle, and my neighbor told me that she asked for a grand Marnier and as well was not the real liquor,  actually we called the liquor department to go there and they actually did, hope they did something to fix that, another thing, the owner, her name is Manuela is employing illegal immigrants to underpay them, that against the law, and my husband and I are seriously thinking to call ICE, so they can investigate, sorry it is not because of illegal immigrants but i don't like people as Manuela that like to take advantage of others. Hope you guys make sure to get what you pay for. Good luck
