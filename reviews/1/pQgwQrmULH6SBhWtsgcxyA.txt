Only because I can't give it zero stars

My wife and I have visited twice with friends and both times the food was really bad!  Surprisingly bad actually.  Shrimp tacos had two small shrimp in each. Pork tacos had less than a tablespoon of pork in each. My wife combined her shrimp to get one good taco off the plate!  

Even the margaritas are bad -- watery and overpriced. It's not even passable as bad drunk food.  It feels like that is all the new owners care about - patrons too drunk to care about the food or prices.  Save your money and go to Tavern or Phat Burrito.
