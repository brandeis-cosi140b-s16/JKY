Don't believe the hype. This place is a dump. The service  is horrible. No refills on the small glasses of water...warm beer..small plate of chips...waitress answered her own phone when serving us the plates. Mushy pre- made tacos...rice was 3 days old. Prices are fine but you get a better meal at taco bell. Not kidding. Trust me you will be dissapointed. It's terrible. No quality Mexican places in tempe....
