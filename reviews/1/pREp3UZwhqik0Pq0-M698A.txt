Spoiled and contaminated food poisoning at this location, beware! 
13752 W. Waddell Road, Surprise, AZ 85379

My husband and I stopped at this Taco Bell location last night 2/17/15 for dinner.  We ordered 2 chicken burritos and 2 Doritos Supreme Fire Tacos.  The burritos hardly have any chicken in it, mostly lettuce and sour cream and a few very small little pieces of chicken in it. 
My husband became violently ill this morning for eating food here at this location, he hadn't throw up in his last 26 years but he woke up in the middle of the night threw up follow with diarrhea after eating here at this Taco Bell location.  He felt extremely weak almost dying after laying awake last night to make multiple trips to the bathroom on toilet and throwing up!  
I was observing employees at this location last night while waiting for our food, they wore gloves in preparing food but they touch other dirty things then they went right back in preparing food again without changing gloves.  I thought .... I was hoping my food wasn't prepared by that person who I happened to witness doing that while I was waiting.  
We will never come here at this location ever again!
