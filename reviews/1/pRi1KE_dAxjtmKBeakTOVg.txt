This was the WORST experience ever. I purchased a Groupon for a lunch special and the waitress refused to honor it.  She told me that I was required to have 2 people present in order to redeem the voucher---this was not true.  The voucher said that I needed to order 2 entrees.  It said nothing about needing 2 people.  She was stubborn, ignorant of the Groupon deal, and unwilling to serve me.  I reported the restaurant to Groupon, and they said that they have reported the incident internally.  A review may be underway if other Groupon customers have additional unsavory experiences.  I obviously can't tell you about the food, but the service was really awful! Buyers beware!
