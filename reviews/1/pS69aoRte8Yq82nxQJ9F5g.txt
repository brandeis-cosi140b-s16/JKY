My husband and I were originally going to go out to breakfast on a Sunday afternoon but everywhere was too busy. So that's how we ended up here.

They greeted us quickly and we only had to wait 15 minutes for a table. The waiter was nice, however, he only refilled our drinks like once. Maybe he had too many tables? Because another table near us also had empty cups in front of them. Actually, most of the tables in the dining area we were in had empty glasses.

There is a guy that walks around and fills chips only. He's pretty efficient with that. But can't he refill drinks too? Or help get to go boxes? It seemed like the waiter could have used more help than just filling bowls of chips.

I ordered the chimichanga dinner with machaca beef. That's my favorite type of meat but this restaurant must not know how to make it. It was completely bland, boring and unappetizing. The beans and rice were pretty much the same! Yuck

I'm pretty sure I won't be returning because the food was terrible and then overpriced to boot! Boo
