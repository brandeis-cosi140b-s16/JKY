I emailed Chipotle Corporate HQ in Denver as once again this location fubared my order. I got rushed through the line and didn't get my entire order the first time so I went back again. The 2nd time I asked for a kids quesadilla meal for my 2 year old. After repeating it 2x quite clearly they make a regular sized quesadilla, then when I ask about the sides for the kids meal they're like did you ask us for a kids meal? And this was from the same clueless woman who just repeated my order TWICE and acknowledged she was making a kids cheese quesadilla! And to polish it all off the manager's shoulder shrug and I don't give a damn attitude pushed me to the point I fired up my verbal cannons and unloaded. I told her I am done with having my food screwed up every time I walk into this location. DONE! I promised her I would be contacting Chipotle corporate, and I have kept my word. This Yelp review is just sending another virtual cannonball downrange to follow the fusillade of protests I've already fired off. 

Let's hope Chipotle Corporate HQ can inform the Henderson location that the priority is the customers and not cranking people through there like it's a dang cattle call. I'll gladly pay for your food, listen to me so you can sell me the stuff I want and make $30 instead of $22! Unless you're not in the business of making a profit, I would think this should be pretty important. 

1 pathetic star for 1 pathetic Chipotle outpost that has to be the worst location I've stepped foot into in 5 states. It's the best I can give and barely what they deserve.
