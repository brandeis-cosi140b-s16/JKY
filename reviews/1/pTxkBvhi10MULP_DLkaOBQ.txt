I've been to two other Senor Frog's in Mexico. This one is a sad imitator of the others. The staff puts on a cheery face when it's time to celebrate a birthday, but does not appear to enjoy their job otherwise. The restaurant isn't helped by $13 for substandard sliders and $15 for a taco salad that is better at Taco Bell for a third of the price. If you want drinks, skip the $6 drafts and $12 cocktails here. Instead, go play video poker at the bar inside the casino and get them for free.
