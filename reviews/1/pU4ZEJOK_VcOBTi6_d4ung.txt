I went to this Qdoba a few times. No matter what I ordered, it was always bland. No amount of almost empty bottles of Cholula hot sauce could make up for it. They also have no idea of portion control when it comes to guac. Which means if you're getting some, prepare for two small avocado's worth.

Although this place seems to have a reputation for bad customer service, my service has been pretty okay overall. Their pricing can be a bit weird at times though. They are not very consistent with what they do and don't change more for.
