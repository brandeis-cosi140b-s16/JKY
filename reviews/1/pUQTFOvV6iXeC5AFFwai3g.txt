Been coming to this place for about 3 years and it seems every time we return it gets worse. Today walking into the place the tables were dirty and there was a smell in the place that said " i need a good cleaning".
I ordered a Carne Asada burrito and when I opened it to add green sauce all I saw was a tablespoon of Carne meat. I took it up and showed the cashier girl. Her response was of bewilderment when she pointed with her pen at the tablespoon of Carne meat. I then explained to her that in a Carne Asada burrito the Carne is the main ingredient not the beans and salsa. They remedied the situation by adding more meat but I should have to go up and show them proper portioning. Another person in the party got nachos with beef. To me nachos mean the chips topped with lots of cheese and whatever else you add as a topping. Well needless to say the nacho chips barely had a tablespoon of cheese on them. Inconsistent food, dirty environment, rude staff and not a positive experience. Many a time I vowed not to return but this was my last visit. Too many places in the area that care about quality of food and customer service. I also worked in the industry so I'm familiar with what a customer wants and expects when they walk into a food esyablishment.
