A friend of mine and I decided to have happy hour at OTB at the Concord Mills location.  I was kind of disappointed when we walked in and had to wait for a hostess to come to the front to greet and seat us considering it was not very busy.  But it's really not a big deal and we sat in the bar area for our food and drinks.  Things were going well until I found a bug - still alive and crawling - in my food.  I didn't want to create a scene so when our waiter came by, I let him know I found a "buddy" in my food.  He says "oh no, that's not good" and simply asks if I want a new plate.  Hmm.. No thanks, I think I will pass on whatever else comes out of that kitchen.  I get my check to find he had comped me $1 for that... No manager came by to check or apologize for the bug.  I completely lost my appetite and I don't think I will be returning for a long time.  Thanks for the added protein in my food but I'll pass and I was disgusted by the whole experience and reaction from the staff. :/
