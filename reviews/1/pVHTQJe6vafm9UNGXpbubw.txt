This place has gone from five stars to one star in my opinion in less than six months.  I took an eight and nine year old to Qdoba last night and they wanted really simple burritos - just rice, beans and cheese, with chicken on the side for both.  One wanted pico and one wanted guac, but rather than in the burrito, they wanted them on the side for dipping.  The pans that the ingredients were in were running out, and so rather than refill them, the guy who worked there made two of the smallest burritos I've seen (even the girls commented on their size once they saw them).  The chicken was mostly the little charred pieces that had fallen off the bigger pieces of chicken so that what they had in their cups was mostly little charred pieces of meat and not much else.  He then also said he'd have to charge me for the guac since it wasn't inside the burrito (while signs in the restaurant said "Free Guac with entree" and "Order with Abandon").  All this to top off a roughly 30% price increase a few months ago.  I used to go to Qdoba about three times a week. Now I go about once every three weeks, and if I can get my daughter to go to Chipotle more, it will be even less.  I'd expect this chain to close its doors before the end of 2015.  Too sad - I really used to like this place.
