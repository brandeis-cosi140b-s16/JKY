Let me start off by saying that I love Taco Bell! This particular one, however, is at the bottom of my list. I've been back a few times, but it's always bad. The order is always wrong, usually due to the person taking the order.  This last time I got sooo sick after being the only one in my family to eat the chicken. This was my only meal of the day and about 5 hours later, I was stuck in the bathroom for 4 hours. I have no doubts it was Taco Bell as I hadn't eaten anything else that day... I won't be back for sure.
