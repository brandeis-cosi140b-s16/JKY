Worst customer service ever! I called to place a pick up order, I was put on hold, after 8 min on hold I decided to drive there. When I got there I told them I had been on hold for over 13 min. They tell me that no, I'm not on hold. So I show her my phone and say, so you're telling me that this is not your number. She then looks at the other two girls and asks did you put her on hold, they both say it wasn't them. So I tell them that I don't care who put me on hold anymore, all I want is someone to take my order. She then explains that the calls are placed on hold until they are done helping the person in front of then. I tell her, i highly doubt that its taken him (I point at guy at register) 14 plus minutes to order. So again, i ask that my order be taken. She then tells me that I have to wait until she's done helping the people in line. So I get in the back of the line wait till its my turn. Then when the cashier is taking my order the phone rings. She picks it up and takes a phone order. After that first call ended the phone ringe again, and she takes ANOTHER phone order before she finishes with mine. What the fuck! Not once did anyone apologize. The food wasn't for me, or I would of taken my money elsewhere.
