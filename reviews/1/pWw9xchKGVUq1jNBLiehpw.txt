My wife just left the restaurant with 4 meals. All meals had no rice because they ran out. Called to complain and the manager was rude and told me that there was a sign stating no rice available. Wrong! There was no sign! Manager would not offer any free meal just chips and salsa. I will never give them.my business again! I'll patronize Wahoos right down the  street from now on!

Don't come into our neighborhood and be all full of yourself and expect our business!
