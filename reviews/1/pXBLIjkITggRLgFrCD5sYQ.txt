Everyone tells me all the time that this is the best Mexican food in town and I have to try it because it's delicious and all the above. So, I did. Everything just went wrong from the moment I walked in. It started off with my beverage. It took forever to come. Ordering our entree was long. So i ordered a vegetarian burrito. Not what I ordered. I'm a vegetarian, And it had MEAT in it. I was really upset. Good thing I pick the hell out of it. And the girl told me that it was happy hour and she suggested the margarita on the rocks. And I did. She said it was cheaper and bigger. Of course you pick that right? But of course it wasn't. She didn't seem like she wanted to work there. 
So much for the hype that people were talking about!
