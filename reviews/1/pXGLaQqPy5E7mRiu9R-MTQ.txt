Love chipotle but this location is awful employes always in a hurry an very rude they don't take your request into accountability if you ask for extra meat they say it's a extra charge that's not the problem  it's that they do it with a attitude like your bothering them. Sorry if you don't like your job don't work there no need to be rude to the customers!
