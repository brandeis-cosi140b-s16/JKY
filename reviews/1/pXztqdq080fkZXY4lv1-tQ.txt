I gave this place a try two times. Both times I've been very disappointed  on the quality if the food and their extremely slow service. The food made my tummy ache all day after I returned back to the office. 
Unfortunately I will no longer return. Sorry la Paloma, I really wanted this to be my near neighborhood Mexican spot
