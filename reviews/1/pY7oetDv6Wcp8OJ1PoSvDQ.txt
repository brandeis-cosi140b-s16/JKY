If you want to surround yourself with a bunch of douchebags wearing Ed Hardy-esque clothing, enough hair gel to set the place on fire, and too much cologne, then El Hefe is the place to be!  That, however, is not my taste.  I can't comment on the food because, after spending one Saturday night drinking there, I have never wanted to go back.  Plus, I can't imagine trying to eat while inhaling all of the aforementioned cologne.  I'll stick to DJ's, my "dive bar" down the street, thank you.
