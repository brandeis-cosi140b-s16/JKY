FOOD POISONING - DON'T EAT HERE!

I should've know better not to eat here, since the other times I did their food didn't taste that good, but it was last minute and they're close to my house. I got a carne asada burrito with steak and rice only and I currently have one of the worst cases of food poisoning I've ever had. I've been throwing up for the last 24 hours and have the worst case of diarrhea ever. I can't even keep yogurt or crackers down.

Unless you want to lose 12 lbs in 24 hours, Please don't eat here! I'd be willing to bet their health inspection ratings are very low.
