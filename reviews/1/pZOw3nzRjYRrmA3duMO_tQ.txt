The shredded chicken is horrible. Arrow Con Pollo is disgusting. The put cheap, poorly cooked rice on the plate, topped with frozen cheap shredded chicken, and shredded american cheese on top. A meal at taco bell would've been cheaper and better. 

My boyfriend got the chimichangas. They were made with the same shredded chicken, but it was more edible because you could just eat the fried dough with the melted cheese, which tasted better than the shredded cheese on the ACP. 

Just don't go. Penn Station is next door. Go there instead.
