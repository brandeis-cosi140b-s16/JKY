I had heard rave reviews about this spot, so thought I'd surprise my hubby with a new place. Got there a little earlier than their 11:00 opening time, and so we walked around the little shops until just a few minutes before 11:00. As we were standing at the front door, I looked again at the open times sign, and there was a tiny (german) cockroach actually crawling between the glass and the sign INSIDE! Needless to say, we high tailed it without going in.. If there is a cockroach that usually hides from the light in full sight on the door, I can only imagine what's inside!
