ZERO STARS!!!
Employees are entering the PS4 codes that are printed on the $5 boxes.
SUCH BS!
WTF! I made the manager give me 4 different boxes and ALL the codes "were already used".
I'm calling corporate today to complain.  Not because the 40 year old AA guy was eating food on the prep line, NO....but because this location has employees that are unethical.
The WHOLE PS4 marketing campaign is destroyed.
This makes me not want to give them anymore of my money.
