The service was horrible. The service guy taking the order serving the food used a scale that was previously dirty and used the chicken I asked for to measure the chicken. I approached him and I said. Are you going to wash that scale ? He replied do you want me to. Of course, so he rinsed the scale and dumped the cold chicken. His approach was that he was too busy. I replied, it's a health safety hazard. This place should have their restaurant grade re-evaluated. Talk about contamination.
Horrible food and service
