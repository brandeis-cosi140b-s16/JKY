Walked in to a full house so I wasn't expecting super quick service. I noticed the waitress on our side was all by herself, but it took 15 minutes for her to take our drink order. And then she told us we could get the drinks ourselves, that it would be quicker. She came back 10 minutes later to take our order and I ordered biscuits and gravy and my wife ordered tortillas and eggs. 45 minutes later she came back to our table and told us they were out of biscuits and gravy but the rest of the breakfast was about to be started. 45 minutes was too long so we left.
