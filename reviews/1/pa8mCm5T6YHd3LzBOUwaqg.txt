Very disappointing. I was here once before for lunch and the place was packed and we were all happy with our food. this time the place was almost empty, but since it was raining, I figured, don't worry. I should have gone with my instincts. A previous reviewer recommended the Lamb Barbacoa, but I was not impressed with it. It was greasy and bland. Served with a huge piece of gristle about 5-6 inches long. The rice was boring and the beans thick and gluey. My husband had a quesadilla, but it also was only ok, and very bland. the best part of the meal was the $2.50 dos equis which was ice cold and very refreshing.
