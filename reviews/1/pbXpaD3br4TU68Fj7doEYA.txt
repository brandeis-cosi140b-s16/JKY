Worst service ever!!!! We sat at the bar. Horrible choice. We ordered drinks and then watched the bartender make about 10 drinks for others before we got ours. While eating our tacos, which were fairly good, the couple next to us started fighting- including the woman yelling and storming out twice only to return to keep fighting- and the bartenders did NOTHING!!! Totally ruined our experience. We'll never go back!!!
