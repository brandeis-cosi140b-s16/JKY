I have eaten at the sit down Julio G's on a number of occasions.  We have friends who really like their food, frankly it is good, but not top tier.  Decent, but nothing worth driving past other restaurants though the service has always been good.

Today my wife and I had the misfortune  of stopping  by Julio's Too.  We figured, only a wall separates them, likely the same food.  Not so much.  While the taco's were good, we made two mistakes, ordering the green chili pork chimichanga and engaging the young lady who was working the cash register.  

Let's say the chimichanga was not like any other chimichanga I have had before and not in a good way.  It did not have a nice crisp, golden exterior, largely it was a grey ball of tortilla was swimming in beans and rice.  When I asked the young lady working the cash register she said, "oh that is what our Chimichanga's are like".  Doughy balls of uncooked tortilla?  She grudgingly agreed to cook a new one for us.  

Amazingly, the next chimichanga she brought was a lovely golden color, like every other chimichanga I have eaten.  Though even after bringing it, she said the first one had been deep fried.   Let it go, bring my new chimichanga and go away.  Please.

Tip when ordering at Julio's Too,  the taco's are okay, but pass on the green chili chimichanga with a side of attitude from the employees.
