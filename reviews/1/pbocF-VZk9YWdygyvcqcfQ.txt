Worst customer service. I could swear that the employee that took our order through the drive thru had just woken up to take our order on a Sunday at 9:30 am. We pulled up to the window, waited three minutes at the window without being greeted or acknowledged so we just drove off and tried  Tamales Guadalajara for the first time (it was so yummy!) Definitely won't be coming to this location again.
