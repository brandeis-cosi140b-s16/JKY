worst service ever! the first time I went there I ordered a breakfast burrito, I went to the drive thru and the service was average; nothing amazing or bad. When I got home to eat the burrito it was super salty. I ate about half of it and couldn't eat another bite. A few weeks later I thought I would give it another shot. I went to pick up a big order for my husband and his friends who were working. I went through the drive thru again but this time the girl at the drive through was not very good. She didn't let me finish placing my order so when I pulled up to the window I told her I wasn't done and that I needed to order something else. She acted annoyed. when they finally brought me my food I asked if everything was in there and they assured me it was. when I finally got home not only had every burrito been labeled incorrectly but they had not included my whole order. I had to drive back and went inside, when I told them what had happened she didn't say anything to me except hold on. The girl then went to the back ( I could see her and the cook) she told them what happened and they started laughing. Needless to say I won't ever be going back there again.
