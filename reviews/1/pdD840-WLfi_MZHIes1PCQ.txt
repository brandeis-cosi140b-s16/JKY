I was so disappointed! I used to love the old Elvira's. It looked old and rickety and was just as charming as anything could be and the food was fan-freaking-tastic! I was glad to hear that someone had bought it and rehired some of the old staff. I wasn't excited to hear that it was completely remodled but I have to admit that the health department was probably going to mandate it at some point. I was disappointed somewhat in the trite fiesta style they'd chosen for the decor but much more so in the food. It wasn't nearly as good as it used to be. I suppose they've tried to make it a little more "classy", it came out somewhat more american and just wasn't very good. The green enchilada sauce, which used to be wonderful there, was very sour, almost inedibly so, the shredded beef was a tad chewy as if it were a poor cut of meat or poorly prepared. The beans were terribly underseasoned and were helped by the hot sauce. The rice was actually very tastey but it had that dry, broken quality of minute rice. Still, it was far and away the best thing on my plate. 

The manager walked around asking how everything was but clearly didn't really want to know because when we hesitated she supplied "delicious?" and hurried away. Had she looked at our plates she'd have noticed that our forks were down and two of the four plates on the table had only a couple of bites out of them. 

We don't expect much in the way of service at Elvira's since it's really the food that used to attract us but that seems to have gone down somewhat as well. If a server can't remember which patron the beverage glasses belong to when they're returning them from refilling, it's important that they NOT take them away! They're going to have to start refilling with a pitcher. Just because someone is seated with you doesn't mean that you would be willing to drink from their glass. 

That was our last trip to Elvira's.
