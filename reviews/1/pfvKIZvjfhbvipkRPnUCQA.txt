Maybe its someones favorito but it definitely is not my favorito, that's for sure. Stopped in here today to grab a quick bite as it was nearing 3 PM and I had been out on the road working and did not pack a lunch (my bad). GPS informed me of a taco place here so I stopped in.  Perused  menu and contemplated fish tacos. Now from previous experiences out here in the PHX area, I have learned to ask about the fish being used. So, I mosey up to the counter and ask the cashier what kind of fish they uses. "Cod" was the answer. I knew where this was going.  "Is it breaded?"  I asked?  Yes, was the response. That means that you are serving me a damn chopped up FISH STICK. I know, because several other places had done the same thing and had the nerve to serve it to me.  I'm not one of those "Oh, it's so much better in ______ where I'm from" guys but let me tell you this...if someone served you a damn fish stick and had the nerve to call it a "Fish Taco" in LA, you would have your tongue handed to you after it was cut from your throat.  No joke. And don't give me any of this "This is Arizona, where you gonna get fish from?" crap like the "guy" at Mangos in Mesa told me when they did the same thing.  (Yes, he really said that.) Ever heard of a market? They got all kinds of fish. Yes, even in Arizona, ain't refrigeration great?

So with that out of the way, I passed on the "Fish" and order Carne Asada and an Adobada taco. The Carne was ill but the Adobada was OK taste wise. Unfortunately, they use piss poor quality meat so the Carne almost appeared like clumpy ground beef instead of steak. Not even a salsa bar to cover the taste of the "Carne".   Sad, just sad. Not even trying.  I hate places that don't even try.  Don't bother wasting your time.  I'm not a big chain fan, but I would head to Rubios or Baja Fresh any day over this miss. And that oughta tell you something.
