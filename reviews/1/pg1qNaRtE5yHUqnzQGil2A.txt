The service was very friendly, offered samples which was nice but the finished product not so happy with. We had the burrito with puleho steak. There was more vegetable than meat. The vegetables were largely sliced. Burrito fell apart with the second bite. Had to eat the rest with a fork. And the kahlua pork as a burrito with beans and cheese and all the makings of a burrito??? I don't think so. Never had kahlua like that. Didn't enjoy it for the price we paid.
