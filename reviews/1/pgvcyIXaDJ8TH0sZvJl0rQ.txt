Get a Burrito.  It has meat and guac and salsa.  I ask to add Beans and Rice to it.  Looked at me like I was crazy and then demanded it was $1 more.  Really......$1 for a spoon full of rice and beans?  It doesn't get any cheaper than rice and beans folks.....

I ask for no tomatoes but only onions.  They don't have that.  Onions and tomatoes come together as Pico de Gallo.  Yea, I'm aware what Pico de Gallo is thanks.  I just wanted Onions and was told they don't have any.  A Mexican Restaurant without onions?

Rude, slow and then they started talking about me in Spanish.  Just because I'm white, blond and blue eyed, doesn't mean I can't speak Spanish. 

Understood every word.
