Let me start off with the most important part of the review,the food. My wife and I ordered an array of tacos, The ribeye taco, Kung pow shrimp taco, barbacoa taco,& The chicken taco. Ribeye taco was dry this is their version of carne asada. We also had the mango habanero guacamole. The flavor had no hints of mango taste like regular guacamole. The rest of the tacos were greasy overpriced and had little seasoning. The restaurant is known for inventing the original margarita, so I thought I'd give it a try. They definitely want to charge you for the history and a margarita was quite underwhelming. Now onto the service. Number one, the manager never checked to see if our food was any good and asked us if this was our first time, Which replied yes it was. The order taker thinks speed equates to service my wife and I could not understand a thing that was coming out of her mouth. The food expediter didn't explain one taco and placed my wife's napkin in the guacamole and just walked off. Please do not waste your time with this restaurant.
