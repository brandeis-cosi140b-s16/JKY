I don't have a lot of positive comments but no hate either.  I just think it's a tourist trap that has been here for years and gone down hill. It is over priced, and the food is not that great.  The salsa was ok.  I am not super fussy when it comes to Mexican food but I do know good Mexican food.  It sure can be hard to find great Mexican food in Phoenix (of all places).  Explain that to me.
The service we had was great, nice young man.  I do not know if because the property surrounding the restaurant has changed hands so frequently, that has had something to do with the quality of food at this place but I remember 20 yrs ago the food was much better. 
I would not recommend this place to any friends or out of town guests. 
We will not be returning.  The food is boring.
