I tried this place after reading reviews and was super disappointed!! Adobada tacos hardly had any meat the carne asada nachos had red colored meat looked more like pastor! The horchata taste fake has a weird after taste! Frijoles has the best tacos in my opinion! I'd even choose Roberto's over this place
