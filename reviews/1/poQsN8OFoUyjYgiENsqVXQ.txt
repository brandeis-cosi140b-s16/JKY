I love Roberto's but this one had a stale, unwelcoming and not too mention my bean and cheese burrito took a long time.  I ain't picky but when you see a dirty dining area, filthy is more accurate, and your food takes a long time and there is unease in the place someone is responsible for sharing.  That's me.  Sorry Roberto's, I am not abandoning you but this was disappointing.
