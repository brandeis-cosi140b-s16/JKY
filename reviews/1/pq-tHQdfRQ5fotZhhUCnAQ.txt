Officially done with Taco Bell. Drove out of my way because yelp says open til 2:30. Get there at 1:30am on a Tuesday late night after I close my restaurant and cars driving through and out telling me while I pull in their closed and those drivers were pissed. Change your yelps hours or figure this location out. The reviews are so bad for this one. I give a one star because I like the brand but seriously I hope someone that cares reads these reviews and fixes the issues. The hard choices need to be made fur the good of the business....so make them
