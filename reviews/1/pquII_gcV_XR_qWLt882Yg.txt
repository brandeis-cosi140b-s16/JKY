They have really great food but I am sick and tired of their rude employees!  They never smile, never say thank you, never say bye on the phone and don't get me started on how they treat you if you ask for flour tortillas over corn or no guacamole, etc!  Only order exactly how they offer it or get ready to be treated like absolute garbage.  The food can be amazing but if their employees are rude, then I am happy to take my business to Caramba's and drive the extra 10 miles.  No matter how nice and apologetic I am when they get irritated at me for making them do a little extra work to make it without their disgusting guacamole or something else, they still can't be nice.  I give up.  The last owner sold it and the new owner finally got the food to taste good but the help is still junk!!!  Hire people that actually care to get a paycheck!  There's plenty of people out there jobless that would love their job!  So start appreciating the customers or you will no longer have a paycheck when the place goes out of business!!!!!!!!  Absolutely ridiculous!
