I think this is the worst service I have ever had at a restaurant. We were with a group of about 30 on the patio and the server never came back to take orders, I ended up going to the bar. Dirty dishes and glasses piled up so bad there was no room on any of the tables. Requested to have stuff cleaned up a couple of times, nothing happened. I will never come back.
