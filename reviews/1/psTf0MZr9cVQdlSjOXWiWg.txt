My first time at this location. The staff was backed up. I believe there was a mix up from a previous order and it threw  all other orders out of whack. The staff was not that friendly (stress from falling behind perhaps). Either way my food sat on the preparation counter for at least 5-7 min before the next person in line was able to add my toppings.  I inquired if my meat and beans would be hot, he wanted to talk about salsa.  I finally got him on the same page as me and was assured my meal would be satisfactory.  Fast forward,  i sit down (I've used about 20 min of my lunch hour by now) and noticed my food is drowning in juice (picture attached) and my hot food items were room temperature. This will be the first and last time I come to this location.
