You'd think with In N Out across the street, they'd try harder! I got in the drive through and I was told to wait. I watched the cars at In N Out moving, and there I was, waiting to place an order. Finally, I decided to go across the street, where a young girl was outside taking orders, and these idiots never returned to the speaker. So I drove forward, to get out, there was ONE car (not 100) in front of the window. Luckily I was able to back out, as there was no one behind me. The ONLY reason I ever go to them is when I'm in a hurry and don't want to wait at In N Out. Now I won't even try them then!
