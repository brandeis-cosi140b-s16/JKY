"Eek! Methinks not" is an understatement. I wouldn't recommend this place if La Paz offered to pay me. Honestly, I can say that this was by far the worst Mexican food/experience I've ever had. Save your $$ and go to another mom-and-pop restaurant for food that's 10000000x better. I'm mad at myself for wasting $32 on lunch and eating crummy food.

Terrible service here ... I went after the "lunch rush" was over ... there was only 4 tables in the whole place. They were out of chips and salsa ... apparently the "lunch rush" wiped them out. We were told they were making more but during the entire hour we were there we never got any. What kind of Mexican place runs out of chips & salsa?!?!?!?

Our food was served without us even having silverware on the table ... and it took the server almost 5 minutes to come back with any for us. So we just sat there, watching our food get cold. After we were finally able to try the food, I almost wished I hadn't. It seemed like it had sat under the heat lamp far too long because the rice on the top was extremely dry/crispy. The steak in one of my enchiladas tasted like it was mass-produced days before and was reused ... super chewy and dry. My other enchilada was supposed to be spinach and goat cheese .. all it had was spinach and tomato.  

STAY AWAY!
