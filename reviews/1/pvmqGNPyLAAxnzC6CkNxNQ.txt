I went to this place because I had a restaurant.com certificate but they did not honor saying that the owner did not authorize it...which is fine i can get a refund. Anyway i love seafood...we ordered and it took a while to start getting our food. I got the coctel de camaron which was ok. Then my husband got his botana de camaron con pulpo...it was so small for the price i couldnt believe it! It tasted good though...my biggest dissappointment though was the ceviche de camaron...the moment i saw it i knew i was not going to eat that...it was so raw...like completely raw...i returned it and was told its because it takes a day to cook ot completely with the lemon...youre telling me? Ive been eating this all my life i know jow to make ceviche and it takes an hr or a little more...but its a restaurant it shouldve been ready for customer. People were nice...but wont be returning...at least to this location. Ill stick to Mariscos Playa Hermosa or Islas de Capitan both in Phoenix.
