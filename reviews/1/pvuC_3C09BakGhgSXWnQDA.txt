Tried the breakfast for the first time at this place... the girls making the food kept asking questions like they didn't know their own menu.  I ordered the Country Grilled Burrito.  I got a sausage egg and cheese burrito.  I ordered the jalepeno honey chicken biscuit.  The chicken was rubbery, and the honey was ice cold from the refrigerator in a cup in my bag.  Very disappointed.
