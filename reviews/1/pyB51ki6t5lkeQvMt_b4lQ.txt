was good in the past, not so much anymore.  Today was the last straw for me after being a once a week customer.  The grill was broke so no chicken.  Steak was full of grizzle and had to keep spiting it out.  Slasa looked like it has been run through a blender.  Food was cold.  Overall a bad meal on many levels, and they raised the prices a while back.  Now almost $8 for a crumby lunch.  Zabas and Caf√© Rio is much better.  Red salsa is still good.
