Everytime I walk into this place and see the guy with the with the glasses & a condescending  look on his face I want to walk OUT! I've given him 5 chances to be a decent human being and just take my order and keep his complaining, cocky remarks to himself.  EVERY time he fails. He acts like I'm inconveniencing him and gives me an IDGAF attitude. Get this waste of space away from your customers Pancheros or you're gonna lose business! P.s FOOD IS GREAT!
