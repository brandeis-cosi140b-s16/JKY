Clean restaurant but very tasteless food. I'm surprised that Mexican food can be so bland!  I had the crunchy carne Asada tacos. The meat was chewy and bland with more lettuce than flavor. My husband had a carne Asada burrito which didn't have any rice or beans in them - just meat, guac and salsa. So disappointing! We won't be back as there is amazing Mexican food out there. This just wasn't one of those places. The empty restaurant should have been an indicator.
