Awful customer service. I placed my order over the phone today Sept. 21, 2015 at 3pm. I went to their drive thru to pick up the fries carne asada at 3:11 pm and the young lady at the window told me that I called/ordered in their other branch by Shea instead at Fountain Hills Blvd. Then I said "I'm sorry about that, can you please call them and cancel it? Then I'll order here". We are running late we have to go to other direction to pick up my son in the other school". She said, they cannot make me another fries carne asada coz they have the same owner, it's a company policy. I was shocked... I asked her again, "so we cannot order here and pay?" She said NO, because the other Se√±or Taco branch will throw the food so they cannot do that. WOW! Unbelievable... So, oh well. I'm not going to drive on Shea. There's no consideration. They just lost one of their loyal local customer and even a revenue. The owner should train each and individual of his/her staff. I've never heard in hospitality industry, in any store or such restaurant in U.S. that you are not allowed to re-order their food/item. Of course I'm willing to pay for it. But it's just so stupid.
