Since I cant find the one on Pecos and Sunset I will post my review here:

I originally was on my way to Subway for lunch when I seen the Roberto's Taco Shop sign and said "what the hell" let's give it a shot. (Even though I was told to stay away)

Sunset & Pecos I ordered a Taco de "Carne Asada" and a burrito, first of the meat used is not of the "Ranchera Flap steak" which is the true "Carne Asada" Second the meat is not seasoned properly its more of a "stew" cooked (not grilled) meat which is horrible. If I wanted soup I would have ordered it. Third the meat it self was tasteless bland and chewy like stew meat. Lastly, the price... my bill for both items came close to $8.00 NOT cheap! 

These items at any hole-in-the-wall would have been $6.00- $6.50, even Taco Bell has better tasting tacos, that doesn't say much about Roberto's Taco Shop... Loyal patrons will say: 1."Oh but the portions are GREAT!" 2."The burritos aren't filled with rice & beans, its all meat!" There is NO substitute for quality and taste, Two VERY important things Roberto's is missing.

I won't even bother reporting on the burrito, since I gave it to a co-worker and well, I'm not here to review on her behalf.
