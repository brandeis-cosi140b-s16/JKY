This place is the worse. There is no warmth, just about everyone who works there are rude and don't give a flying you-know-what about their JOBS. Had they cared about their food even, it would not be greasy and tasteless and buried under cheap cheese. The only thing I have been ordering these days are the nachos as that is the only thing I can tolerate, until recently. I ordered it again, with extra guacamole this time. It usually comes with it, but not enough for me. The wretched woman taking my order even asked me a second time about the guac and I acknowledged her. Lo and behold I get home to see that there is no guac at all, not a spec. How do you ask for extra and not get a thing? Simple, the idiots there that work don't give a damn. Its not worth the time or money, do yourself a favor and DONT GO.
