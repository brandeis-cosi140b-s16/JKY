This place is awful for multiple reasons:
1. Food - bland, under cooked, unoriginal. I ordered yucca fried which tasted like freezer burn. They were mushy and undercooked. The tacos were lackluster too. Chicken tinga was dry and portobello mushroom was slimy and not seasoned at all. Totally gross. Not worth any money. This place should honestly shut down based on food alone.

2. Service - how long does it take to bring out water? 15 minutes apparently. It's slow, which is incredibly surprising given how empty the place is. The waitress didn't even ask me if I wanted a second drink. I would've said no bc my first was gross.

This place is worse than a college dining hall. Food is gross, service is slow, I'm never coming back and openly hating on this place via yelp.
