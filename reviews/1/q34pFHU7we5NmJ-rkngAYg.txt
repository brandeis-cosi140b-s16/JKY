I was hoping this would be good but it's not. I went with two others about a week ago for lunch. We sat out on the patio which was very nice. They brought chips and salsa. Those were okay, although the chips seemed unnaturally yellow, like they were dyed. I ordered a taco combo, one shredded beef, one chicken. The chicken one was ok, but the beef tasted off to me. My son had the same reaction to his shredded beef chimi. It tasted like it had been around for a while :(. My husband ordered the spinach enchilada combo and thought the whole plate was just too mushy and gooey. Not a good experience and we won't be back.
