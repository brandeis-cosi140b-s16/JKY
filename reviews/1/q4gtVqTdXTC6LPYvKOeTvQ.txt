Very disappointed  with the service, hostess and managers.  We have been dining here for years and have been treated well.  Last night service was sub par, manager was too busy and didn't care.  Hostess sat us down at a booth that was not allowed a high chair, when we specifically told her 3 and a high chair.  The twelve times before that,  they never cared about a high chair being at a booth, but after last night's event we will boycott this restaurant.   Food was cold and manager was rude and unprofessional. He advised me the rule has always been in place but not all managers follow that rule and he knows that.  There are much better establishments that will be getting our business.
