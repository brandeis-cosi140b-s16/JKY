This is the worst chipotle I have ever been to and as a Chipotle finatic, I have been to a lot so saying it is the worst really means something. I probably get Chipotle for lunch three-four times per week and I drive to the Fort Apache location, even though this location is down the street from my office.

They constantly run out of food and utensils, are not prepared by opening at 11:00 am, are rude, slow, and skimp you on your food. I have ordered a salad to go only to be told by the cashier that they ran out of forks (thanks for letting me know AFTER I ordered a to-go salad) and have been told that they ran out of lettuce and would need 20 minutes to cut it (after I told them I would wait). I have been stuck behind a person that ordered for 15 people (and did not place their order beforehand) and was very frustrated when they did not suggest that I order my one little salad before the other person.

Honestly, stay away from this Chipotle. The Fort Apache location up the street is great, friendly, and gives large portions.
