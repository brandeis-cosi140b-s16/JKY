This Taco Bell used to be pretty good, but their customer service has been in a steady decline and Taco Hell would be a more accurate business name. 

After not receiving part of my order, I called to inform that I wanted to come back later to get it. I also informed that when I was there it seemed very frenetic and hurried which was very unusual. It was then that I was told they lost their store manager, several associates and other various workers because of some 'controversy issue'. Sounds like they have some pretty serious issues, the first being competent help!

The manager I spoke to flat out said it would be several weeks before they got back up and running they way they should as they are trying to get people trained. 

Question - Why stay open? Why not close your doors for a week and get your shit together? Won't you do more damage to the business by serving only half our orders or making them incorrectly or even making us wait for an unreasonable amount of time to even give you our order in the first place?

Perhaps this summer they can work their way back to the friendly, fast service they used to have; although I'm not holding my breath. In the meantime, I suggest going to the store and getting items for homemade tacos.
