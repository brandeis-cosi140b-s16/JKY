The worst Chipolte ever!

I would give negative stars if I could. I walked in to three girls trying to close the store (keep in mind it's only 9:10 at this time, they still have 50 minutes for customers to come in). I was completely ignored, even after making eye contact with all three employees. I had to wait for the manager to come out in order to be helped. The girl who made my burrito did a terrible job. It's a burrito, not rocket science. Not only did she skimp me on my ingredients, she broke the burrito while trying to roll it. Even after breaking the burrito, she continued to wrap it in the foil. How am I supposed to eat a broken burrito? She then proceeded to ask me, with an attitude of course, if I would like to wrap it again. I am just dumbfounded by the disrespect from the employees.
