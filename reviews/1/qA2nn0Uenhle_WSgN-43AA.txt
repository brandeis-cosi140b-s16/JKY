This used to be a great place to grab lunch. I wish they would bring back the mango salsa. Went today and felt dirty being in the restaurant, there was so much dirt on the ac intakes and the ceiling tiles were stained from leaks and you could see where liquid had actually ran down the walls. The management here needs to put the cleaning gloves on and their glasses apparently. The food was not memorable and not worth the money.
