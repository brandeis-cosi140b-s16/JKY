Please do me and yourself a favor go somewhere else . You will be saving your time and money . First off worst customer service I have ever had and horrible over price Mexican food. I would rather go to taco bell then go eat at guedo's again and I come from a small town on the border of Mexico so I know how Mexican food should be .
