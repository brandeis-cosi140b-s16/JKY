DISGUSTING.  I thought it would be a great breakfast burrito, I mean, how can you get that wrong besides letting a half of an egg shell get munched into your food.  DO NOT GO HERE you will get sick!  

When I called, the manager said it happens all the time, just like hairs in the food and it's no big deal to him.  I will never stop there on the way home again.  I should have known not to order from them when I saw the rotten water where the drive thru window was. I hate wasting my money on establishments that should not even be open.  #healthdepartment911!
