Literally the worst Qdoba in Charlotte. They're always running low on things and their burrito makers are the equivalent of kindergarteners trying to draw inside the circle. I've gone there multiple times and had my burrito looking more like a ball than anything resembling a burrito. Half the time I go there, the employees are just standing around which makes it weird that their supplies are ALWAYS low. They try to scrape the bottom of a crusty queso pan instead going to get a fresh one. Just a horrible place to eat. You're better off driving to the one in the Arboretum. THE WORST IN CHARLOTTE!
