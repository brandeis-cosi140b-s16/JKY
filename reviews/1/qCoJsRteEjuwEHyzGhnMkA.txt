Awful service. Indian couple in front Of us treated extremely poorly and talked down to rudely when they asked for vegetarian beans instead of black  beans, When I ordered my food they gave me literal scraps left in the pan, maybe like 7 pieces of dice chicken and half a spoon of rice, the food maybe took up one quarter of a bowl I ordered a chicken bowl, ridiculous. I was also treated poorly the girl rolled her eyes when I asked if I could have more meat and told me she would have to charge me double meat, what a joke, I didn't even get a half a spoonful of meat. I literally walked out, I just couldnt justify paying for such crap and terrible service. Went to earl of sandwich, same price way better food and service. DON'T EAT AT ROCKIN TACO.
