Save your money for the tables/slots.  Seriously.  I feel sorry for the cow that became part of our beef fajitas.  The way they prepared the fajitas didn't do the cow justice.  Not only was there little to non-existent flavor in the chicken tortilla soup, but there was just a few strands of chicken.  

I think I'm just spoiled with Mexi food in Cali.
