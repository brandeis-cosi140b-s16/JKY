I have a vague memory of eating at a Macayo's in downtown Phoenix long ago and it being good. However, now their food is akin to any food service garbage you might eat at a school cafeteria.

Even worse, the service at this location is awful. We have tried it three times. The first time, we had a table of eight and we were left unattended for 10-15 minutes at a time. The second time, it was four of us, including two kids. The waitress was nasty to the kids and kept giving us the stink-eye. Our kids don't make messes and are very polite. The third time, we waited in the entrance for a full 10 minutes without being acknowledged by any staff. The bartender made eye contact with us several times but didn't offer to seat us or get the hostess. We just gave up and left, and won't be returning.
