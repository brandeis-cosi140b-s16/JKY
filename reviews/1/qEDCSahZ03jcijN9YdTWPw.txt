I went here on a week day with my boyfriend because it's usually packed when we drive by, plus the reviews are pretty good.

When we got there, it was pretty empty. There were 3 other tables that had people. The staff was nowhere to be found. We waited a few minutes, and then a guy (I think the owner) ran by us to chat with one of the tables. No hello or we'll be with you in a minute. Finally a woman came by and started cleaning. I asked if they were still open, and she said yes, so she had us sit and got our orders. She seemed nice, but the service turned out to be SLOW.

I ordered the Chili Dog and lemonade.. you can't go wrong with that, it's nearly impossible to screw up. My boyfriend ordered the fish tacos and a beer. It is weird that they said they only serve bottles, a little off-putting. The lemonade was kind of gross, it tasted like it was made from a powder. The fries that came with the chili dog were alright, but I don't think there's a way to make fries taste bad. The chili dog was bland. I ate it all because I was starving, but the chili tasted weird. I thought I was the only one who had a bad experience, because while we were eating, I asked my BF if he liked the food and he didn't respond. When we left though he said it was bad. It took forever to get our check too.

Maybe we were there on an off day/time, but I won't be returning. I thought about leaving when nobody greeted us, but I stupidly stayed, thinking that it'd be at least as good as the other Baja restaurant we go to, only closer.
