If I could choose less than one star I would. Filberto's is worse than methinks not!! Let me describe it another way - the food here is crap!! The prices are expensive and whom ever considers this Mexican food they deserve to get ripped off.

The beans on my plate were like a lump of paste. Wait paste has more flavor and texture. The Taquitos sucked because they were flavorless. The rice tasted like the cardboard box they came from. Very rarely do I throw food away. Normally I would take it with me to eat later but not this stuff. Should I go on - hell no, just don't go here. Go across the street to Taco Bell which really is not real Mexican either but at least it is edible!!
