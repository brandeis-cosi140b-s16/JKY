I don't know where to start. The worst service ever. Waitress spilled salsa all over the table and seats and didn't even bother to clean it we had to. Wish I could say that was the worst thing about the experience but that was just the beginning. Had to send a dish back twice. Had to wait 15 minutes for a spoon! For a bowl of soup! GF started eating it with a fork. Never going back. Expect bad service
