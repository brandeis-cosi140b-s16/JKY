Terrible service, I've been twice and both times gotten left in the dust when it comes to attention at our table. Took 40 minutes to get food and it wasn't busy. 
The food is decent at best, a pitiful attempt at very overpriced Mexican food. The tacos feel like I could have gotten them at a street stand for 30 cents. The chips are good but their salsa is hit or miss, not exactly spicy or sweet and generally too watery. 
The uncertain ambiance doesn't make up for the food or service either, not a place I would recommend.
