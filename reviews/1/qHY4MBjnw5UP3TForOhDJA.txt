I went there with a large group of people (13 in all).  The food was ok, and the service was fair...it was the resulting 72 hours of vicious food poisoning that ALL 13 of us experienced.  It's pretty safe to say that Don Lencho's was the culprit, as half of the group was family that was from out of town, only in for the night and left the next day (yup they got sick while on a road trip home), and we did not eat any other meals together or even stay in the same house.  This may have been a touch of bad luck...but I'm not going to try my luck there again....EVER.
