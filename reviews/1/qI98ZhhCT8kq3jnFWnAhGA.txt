I do not recommend Zaba's at all. It's just another Chipotle (overpriced) Mexican food. I ordered the Steak burrito and steak nachos which totaled to 18.00. The food was decent at best and I actually ended up getting sick from the under cooked meat in my burrito. Will never be coming back here again.
