The Chili Colorado plate special $8,95 is a no no. It's all very very hot sauce and little amounts of fat infested meat. I told the cashier (gum chewing) about this. The cooks made me wait 10 min for a new plate. Once the plate was ready, the cashier said "they did this for me". Who is the customer? Anyway, the dish tasted even hotter. Robertos fliers says they are customer friendly. I did not think so. Never again. On to Taco Bell.
