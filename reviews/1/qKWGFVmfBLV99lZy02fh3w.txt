I was extremely disappointed in this place!!! Tasteless , disgusting food?? If you could call it that! My boyfriend and i got sick! I seriously threw up at the site of his food..no lie, i gagged and got sick! My shredded "beef" was Dry ,had no flavor, was a weird red color .it was strange the beef was dry & leathery beef but bun was soggy ?? My boyfriends carnitas plate was actually carne asada they got his order wrong... A.d the beans were runny and loojed like diverting that belongs in a toilet!!!! Horrible experience! Worst Mexican food ever!!! I wouldn't even give it one star
