Came for the vegan menu. Total bust. Got the tostada salad and the quesadilla. Not exaggerating here- IT WAS GROSS. The lettuce was wilted and brown and soaked in dressig. The quesadilla was supposed to have a bunch of fajita veggies including roasted corn and it was just filled with undercooked onions. 
The waitress was constantly trying to up-sell us. 
The one star is for the chips, which were delicious. 
Other than that, it was a bad and overpriced experience.
