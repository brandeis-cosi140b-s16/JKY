How hard is it to make Mexican Food filled with flavor?  Such simple ingredients shouldn't be so difficult - rice, beans, tortilla shells...but you'd be surprised how bland these ingredients can be in the wrong hands.
I tried the Pittsburgh version of the California burrito and my friend had the fish tacos.  Even though there were supposed to be other ingredients the only thing I tasted was the heavy portion of carne asada and fries...maybe  a little cheese.  No Guac, no salsa to be seen.  I did like the crunch and flavor of the corn chips but the salsa needed about 1/2 bottle of Tapatio to give it some flavor and spice.  The best part of the burrito was the grilled tortilla shell which gave the burrito some crunch.
My friend's fish tacos were also lacking in the flavor department - he decided to also dose it in Tapatio and then cut up the taco and mix it with the side of rice and beans.
So no matter how late or drunk you are - pass by go and do not stop at Los Cabos.
