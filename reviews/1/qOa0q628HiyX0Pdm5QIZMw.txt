How does a taco shop get 4 stars off of 150 reviews in one location and absolutely suck in another???

I was happy to see this taco shop open up close(r) to my office. I had heard the good reviews of the other location and had been looking forward to giving it a try, so when this one opened it was a no-brainer.

I love me some tacos... BOY do I love me some tacos.

BOY does this place make a weak one. I got the sampler with one of each. 1 chicken, 1 carne asada, 1 pastor. I ate them in that order and each was less appetizing than the next.

When I got back to the office I called the 7th street location to see if they were affiliated. Apparently this a franchise with each location owned independently, so don't take this review as a review of the one on 7th.

It is good to note though, that this IS a franchise. Usually not a good sign. I'm not sure what the other location looks like, but this location was a bright and steril looking place like Baja Fresh (who makes much better tacos by the way, but everywhere makes better tacos than this place.). Decades of ruthless taco devouring experience has made me instinctually prefer a seedy looking establishment where English is definitely a second language as a sign that a good taco is about to be served. Some chipper gringo high school girl was at the counter of this establishment.

I've had MUCH better tacos at taco bell and Carl's Jr. Sad sad sad.

Meat was dry, seasonings flopped, dry thick corn tortillas. I still ate them... they were still tacos after all. They were the worst I've had in quite a long time. This is extra nuts because I got there at 11:45 to beat the lunch rush. Usually this means everything is extra hot and fresh. um...nope.

No wonder the place was empty... even when I left at 12:30. Wonder what the next restaurant at this location will be?
