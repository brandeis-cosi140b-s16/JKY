This place is a disaster. The service was bumbling at best and bordered on sheer incompetence.  First was the fact that one person received his taco salad 10 minutes before the rest of the group.  His salad was ordered without tomatoes and they managed to cover every square inch in tomatoes. When it was sent back to be corrected it magically came back as nachos with extra tomatoes. Four people in our group ordered burritos, three with pork and one with beef. All four came out as beef. Given the previous cluster of the taco salad / tomato debacle we decided to not send it back. No idea if the pork would have been as dry and tough as the beef but I guess we'll count that as one of the great mysteries of life.  As my meal arrived the server grabbed my soda to get a refill which was nice because the beverages did not return until after the meal was complete. Nothing goes with tough dry over seasoned spicy food like not having a beverage handy. 

The rest of our group sat without meals for another 30 minutes while the rest of our party ate.   When asked about the delay the manager replied that they were dealing with issues that we "wouldn't want to know about" which always puts one to ease before boarding a flight and wondering when the food poisoning will kick in.  The server simply explained that the restaurant was jacked up and the kitchen was jacked up. I would agree with her assessment. 

All in all this place established a new low in the area of airport restaurants.
