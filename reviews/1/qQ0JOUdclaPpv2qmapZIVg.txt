I have been here twice, once for dinner and once just for drinks. The first visit started out with a botched reservation; I had called to reserve a table a few days earlier and they had no record of it. We got seated relatively easily for a weekend, however, so it wasn't a huge deal. 

I am a big margarita fan, so I started off with a frozen mango. It was one of the only, if not THE only time in my life I have hated a margarita. It was sickly sweet and extremely artificial tasting. I ordered the chipotle beef tacos with pomegranate seeds for dinner, which were good, but unable to be enjoyed through the margartia-induced nausea.

I tried out Steel Cactus again last night hoping for redemption. I ordered a regular marg on the rocks and ended up giving away 2/3 of it. The bartender made it with orange juice (?!) and some other juice out of a bottle and it tasted nothing like any margarita I've ever tasted. Sickly sweet and frothy on top, just like the last one. Bleh. I'm usually very amenable to this kind of food and I adore tequila based drinks, but I'm going to stick to beer here,
