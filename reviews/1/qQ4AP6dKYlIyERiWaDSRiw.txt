Friday night first visit with friends.  Chips are good, both salsa and hot sauce were very average, have to ask for hot sauce.  Cheese crisp good, with good cheese, but waitress did not ask if we wanted any sides like guacamole or sour cream.  Ordered fish tacos which are horrible, dry with only a mango salsa which is terrible, and the fish is done in an extremely salty blackened rub, rendering the fish too salty to eat.  We left it untouched after two bites.  Most of the food here is salty and not handmade, chile rellanos was a dude too.  Black beans and rice are good, but the tortillas are bland store bought almost rubbery, and mine had beans only for nine dollars, a ridiculous price with no ala carte menu.  The service was terrible, waitress was overwhelmed, had no time to take the order and got several things wrong. Worse, she had nothing to say about the food or even thought to make a suggestion or tell us what was good.   No salt on margarita came with salt, asked for onions in burrito got none, when I told the waitress she just said they forgot and that happens, with no effort to correct the mistake.  On the bright side, the margarita was very good, most restaurants serve sickeningly sweet margaritas, where here the mix is perfect and you can taste some tequila.  Pricing was high for what you get, and the dishes came out too cold for Mexican food.  There was not one item to remember here, nothing to bring you back quickly, very average to very bad.  Best to sit at the bar for a margarita, the only really good thing on the menu. We have not heard good things from our neighbors, so hope this gets better.  The decor is nice, if not a bit dark, comfortable surroundings. We will not be going back anytime soon.
