This place just sucks.  We've given them three opportunities and something has gone wrong every single time.  I appreciate the salsas and the interesting drink selection, but it doesn't make up for bland food and weird service.  The last server we had was so rude and off-putting that we got up and left.  I've NEVER done that before.  Oh well - at least El Encanto Dos is close by.
