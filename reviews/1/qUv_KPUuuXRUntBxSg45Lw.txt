You never know until you try. So we tried and now we know. This lonely star goes to the live entertainment. They were great. The only thing that didn't disappoint during our visit. It's a clean enough restaurant, but the service was slow and didn't explain menu items very clearly. 

I had a shrimp burrito. The portion was generous, but if it's not that good that's no consolation. The shrimp was overcooked- rubbery. The rice was a pale bland mess and the only thing I enjoyed was the beans. My husband had a plate of whole shrimp with a red sauce. It looked better than it tasted. 

Overall we paid $50 for 4 Cokes (no refills- it's bottles) and 2 entrees. We tried to give a card to the gent who brought our check and told to wait for our server - but I didn't catch why. We swapped that plan for cash after waiting- we just wanted to leave. The server saw us get up and ran over to ask if we were going to pay- maybe she thought we were making a break for it. We weren't- although the thought did cross my mind ;)
