I came here to check out a New Mexican spot I was seated quickly but it took a while for the server to take my order. I ordered the supreme nacho special and made it vegetarian by taking off the chorizo. I thought it came with refried beans but it came with black beans instead I asked my server kindly if she could put refried beans on top of my nachos she acted like she didn't understand and for what I presumed was the manager I apologized about misreading the menu asked him the same thing he had an un pleasant demeanor the server brought out the refried beans the server never checked back on me during my meal the nachos were good but the service was poor. And on top of all that they rang me up for the wrong price...
