DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!!! My fiance, our friend and I went here because they were hungry. When we returned home, my fiance opened his burrito to put hot sauce in and a cockroach crawled out of it! It was disgusting. 
When we took the food back for a refund, the girl at the counter acted as if it wasnt a surprise at all, like it was normal to have bugs crawl out of their food. No problems with a return, however, but I wouldnt eat here if you paid me!
