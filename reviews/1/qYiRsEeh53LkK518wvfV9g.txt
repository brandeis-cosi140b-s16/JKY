The food is ok but be careful if you order something to go. They messed up our order and when I called to ask them if they could correct it, the manager lectured me that I placed the order incorrectly. I'm not saying "the customer is always right", but it would have been nice for the manager to apologize for the inconvenience. Never going back.
