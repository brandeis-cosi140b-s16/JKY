I took my wife out for dinner here and her food was way too spicy for her to eat, I tried it and it was making me sweat. We told the owner about it and said she could not eat this as it was very spicy and burning her mouth. The owner looked at her and said "It depends on the season for his peppers and he cannot control that" He then just walked away and offered nothing of further service. We told the waitress what he did and that we didn't even get a water refill the whole time we were there. She ran to the owner and told him and he came to our table and told me and my wife to F-OFF!! and we are paying for the meal she did not eat and not to come back. Well I will never go back to this place and had to take the wife somewhere else for dinner.. This place is a joke, avoid at all cost..
