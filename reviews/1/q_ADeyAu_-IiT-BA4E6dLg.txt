I am a big fan of Los and their burritos, but honestly, this location is subpar at best. The woman who works the counter is consistently short and rude to customers; I've never seen her smile or tell someone to have a nice day/enjoy their food, etc., but I've heard her slap down trays of food several times. 

Tonight, I went in at 11:40pm. I understand that this location closes at 11:45 on Sundays and that it's annoying to get last minute customers, but I was appalled at the customer service. She flat out refused to serve the people ahead of me in line, and when I started to order, she told me that they couldn't make anything but tacos because they had already turned off and started cleaning their grills BEFORE CLOSING. "No burritos, no nothing." 
I'm honestly surprised that more people have not complained about this employee or the level of customer service she gives. I will not be returning to this Los Fav's.
