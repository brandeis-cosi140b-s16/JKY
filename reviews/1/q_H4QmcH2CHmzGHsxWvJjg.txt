The service and taste of the food was both bad. At first I thought the waiter / manager was just overwrought from the lunch rush having jut finished. His speech was loud and curt. He moved very quickly, though only one table remained. But after my party of 4 sat down outside, my friend and I realized that he is just ill-mannered. He was rude while we ordered for the two children, insisting twice that we ought to just order them a small cheese crisp and fries. We were not inclined to take his advice which seemed to irritate him. He did refill our drinks without being asked, cleared the plates and fulfilled the basic waiter duties, but he is beyond unfriendly.

I ordered a fish taco plate for my daughter and a carne asada taco plate for myself. The fish tacos smelled bad.The beans and rice were so spicy that my taste buds were numbed. I'm an Arizona girl who has grown up on Mexican food, but this was unpleasant.  I would never return. However my lunch companion recommends the original Fuego Bistro.
