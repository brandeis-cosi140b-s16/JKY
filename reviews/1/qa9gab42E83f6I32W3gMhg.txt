I just had one of the strangest experiences at a restaurant ever. Not busy at all, so we were seated promptly. Christine was our server, and she came over to take our drink order. My daughter asked if she could get a Shirley Temple. Christine didn't hear her, which is fine,  but rather than politely asking her to repeat it, she made a grimacing face and said,  "Huh!" Ok, not that big a deal right? I would not be writing this or leaving 1 star for that. 

She took our order and was not exactly pleasant but not terrible. So, about the time we would have expected to get our food, she came over and said she was sorry but she forgot to put our order in and was going to do that right now but forgot what we ordered. (!?) So we ordered again. (Remember, they were not busy.) This entire time, she talked exclusively to my daughter's mom and ignored me. I don't care that much, but it was just weird how she focused so intently on just one person at the table. 

Our meals came out one at a time (mine last) after several trips. 

The food: my daughter's mom liked hers fine. But she said no less than 5 times (seriously) that she didn't want any tortillas, and Christine brought them anyway. Again, not a big deal, but WTH. My food was fair at best. Nothing special for sure. Some of my daughter's chicken fingers were so overcooked they were too chewy to eat, and her fries were soggy. 

To top it off, when Christine brought the check back, she said, "Thanks, have a good night ladies." I looked right at her, and she just said,  "sorry again for the delay in your food." I'm a 46 year old guy with very short hair and a goatee. Not easily mistaken for a lady.

The mediocre food gets 3 stars, but that server... 1 star at best. Just bizarre - you could even say Loco.
