Wow I wish I would have looked up the reviews before coming. Like others said, the service is TERRIBLE. I sat down with a few other people and it took our waitress 45 minutes before she even came to ask us for our drinks or food. We waited in line thirty minutes  to get in so we were parched. Everyone around us was getting food and drinks, even people that came in way after us. 

Anyways, we told 3 different people that we would like to notify our waitress that we would like to order. She still didn't show till 45 minutes of sitting there. Then one worker guy came by and said in a condescending tone (like we were bothering him) that we can order our food and drinks at the bar. Are you KIDDING me? The reason we got a table is to watch the UFC fight which was on TV, not walk across the room and miss half of the fight because our waitress sucks and we have to order at the bar.

Anyways finally she came, and she gave us attitude like she was super busy with too many tables when we were some of the first people to sit down. She barely refilled our drinks or checked on us after that.

The cherry on top was how she gave us our bills and a 18% gratuity was automatically included (party of 3). So basically she is allowed to give us crappy service and will get 18% tip no matter what. 

The food was decent but overpriced (it's Vegas though). 3.5 stars.
