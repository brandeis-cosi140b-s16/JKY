Love mexican food. The good things here were few waitress was great. Great attitude  and helpful. Chips and salsa very good. The rest not so much. The greeter had attitude. One of the worst chimis ever. Wife had arroz con pollo. Our dog seemed to like it. For the prices seems they could afford to put a filling in tortillas. Won't go back.
