This place is serving third rate food. Fish tacos tasted old and definitely not fresh. Covered in foil I think they premake and reheat. The chicken fajitas were nothing but tenders without the chewy vein removed. What a turn off! What are the odds you find yourself eating grisly chicken. I mentioned it to the server and got the look. I should have sent back the meal and walked out. 
If you like cheesy microwave reheated food and hurried service this is the place for you. It sucks!
