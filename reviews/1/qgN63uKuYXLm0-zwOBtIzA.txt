We decided to try this place over our usual Valle Luna, regrettably. All of their meats are pre-cooked in onions and tomatoes, which HELLO not everyone is a fan of. Unfortunatley, we had purchased a living social offer and had already paid prior to coming. The margaritas were extremely weak and the food was just bland. I would not reccomend this to anyone or ever come here again. Also the staff was not very helpful or friendly and the place BADLY needs a makeover those dim lights are not kidding anyone. HUGE THUMBS DOWN.
