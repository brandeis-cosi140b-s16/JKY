This place has bad customer service. The one lady that do the orders is very rude. The food it's okay, but the serving size and portions of food is very little for the money you pay. They don't have a salsa bar or chips. On the other hand Pulibertos Taco Shop on baseline and hardy has better customer service, atmosphere, salsa bar, chips, and a much more serving size in their orders for a much cheaper price.
