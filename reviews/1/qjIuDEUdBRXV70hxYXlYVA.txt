We went to eat ...
Things that went wrong.. 
1. Guacamole was not fresh it tasted just like the one Costco sells
2. Chips were stale
3. I ordered the jambalaya. It looked very good until I got to the rice.. rice was raw
4. Tomatoe on jambalaya tasted like fr the can
6. Only had like 2 slices of sausage real thin
7. Music to to to loud almost blew my ear drum
8. 45 min to bring warm... not hot food.. just warm

I forgot what my wife order but that was decent
On the jambalaya shrimp and chicken was cooked right

Now you are probably wondering why I did not complain.  At that moment my wife was to hungry and I I also did not want to ruin her vegas trip... 

Will I ever eat there.... nope.. will I recommend this place nope..... vince u have very good music.... time to step up and fix the issues in your restaurant
