Honestly, I have no idea how this place is still open.  Their food is below par and service is as well.  The best thing we ordered was the Lily margarita. The server was extremely pushy, however, he failed to bring us the correct tortillas that we ordered and was not on top of  our regular drinks or chips.  We ordered a super burrito and chicken fajitas.  The food was edible, however, neither item came with sour cream, guacamole or anything of the sorts.  The super burrito did not come with any sides.  The fajitas did not come out sizzling and looked as if it had just been microwaved.  We ordered flour tortillas, however, received corn (which looked old).  Had to ask another server for the correct tortillas, which took awhile to receive.  The atmosphere was completely chaotic...There was no sense of professionalism nor order to the restaurant.  The back wall was not even painted and was just bare drywall.  I would not recommend... go to El Toro.
