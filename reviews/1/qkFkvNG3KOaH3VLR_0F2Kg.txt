I saw they opened a new Roberto's in a new strip mall near me on the southwest corner or Boulder Hwy and Russel Rd. Not sure of the exact address.

I have seen Roberto's elsewhere in the valley so I decided to give them a try. I've tried this place twice now and both times the food has been barely edible.

First time I visited I got the beef taco platter. First thing I disliked is they use shredded beef instead of ground beef. The beef was very tough and stringy. It took forever to chew and eventually swallow. It's like they took the cheapest beef cut available and boiled the hell out of it. The juices coming from it were watery and bland. The refried beans were loose and runny. The only decent part of the meal was the Spanish rice which was OK.

Yesterday I decided to give them a second try figuring maybe I just ordered the wrong thing last time. This time I decided to order chicken instead of the beef. I got the taco and enchilada platter.

I cut into the enchilada and forked out a big chunk of chicken which looked OK, so I popped it in my mouth and it was like trying to chew a wad of wet newspaper. I have no idea how they cooked this chicken to get it to this texture and complete lack of taste. I never had tough stringy white meat chicken before. I was literally picking the chicken fibers out of my teeth for a half hour afterward.

I gave it my best shot- 2 times just out of fairness, but I won't be eating here again. This was just bad!

I see other Roberto's get great reviews and I hear they are franchise operations with different owners and menus sometimes, so maybe this restaurant isn't like the others- let's hope.
