OK, so I go to airport bars pretty regularly.  In fact, recently at Sky Harbor, I've had to go to a couple of those "stand up" bars (where there are only 4 or 5 seats and everyone just stands around).  So, I have come to lower my expectations.  At least at these "stand up" bars, you can be served fairly quickly.  

This is where my beef begins with Blanco Tacos and Tequila (Spelled wrong on Yelp btw, pretty sure there is only one L in Tequila).

I have 20 minutes before my flight and I would like to get a drink.  Not a lot to ask, right?

Though there are open seats at the bar, we are still required to wait in line.  In fact, give our names and then stand awkwardly outside this poor excuse for an airport bar.

This wouldn't be so bad if I didn't see entire groups of people bypassing this rule and sneaking in and taking large tables when the hostess wasn't paying attention.

After 15 minutes, I finally was offered a seat at a crowded and dirty mutual table.  I asked if I could have one of the open seats at the bar, and the hostess, who didn't seem to care at all, just said "fine".

After another few awkward minutes of trying to send smoke signals to one of the three bartenders, I was asked if I wanted a drink.

"What kind of vodka do you have?"

"Well..."

"OK, can I get a Kettle One and soda?"

"Sure..."

And she then proceeds to sneak over to what is obviously a bottle of Skyy vodka and pour my drink.

At this point, there were about 2 minutes before my flight boarded, so I didn't say anything.  I had my credit card waiting on the bar when she got back from her failed trick.

"Is that it?"

"Yes.  Please close me out."

(Reluctantly)...  "OK."

You know that there is only one bar per terminal section, right?

Next time, I will just hike over to another section and fight my way into a stand up bar just to avoid this awful, awful place.
