Was really excited to try this place considering all of the reviews on Yelp. I am an authentic taco aficionado. I grew up in the South, traveled to Texas and Southern California, in addition to dating many Latin folks in my past...I know Latin cuisine and tacos. I tired two of their pastor tacos and was so disgusted that I could not eat my food. The pork was rubbery, with large chunks of cubed fat throughout. Also in the taco (which was unexpected) was sauteed onions. I would say the taco was 40% pork and 60% slimy onions. I requested a spicy salsa with my dish and received a moderately spiced salsa verde...I was disappointed. I noticed that most of the reviews on here mention this place is so great because of portion size, but taste must by taken into consideration and this was so sub par that I'd rather go to taco bell than dine here.
