We went to Pedro's tonight for dinner.  We haven't been there in a couple of years, after having a mediocre dinner last time.  We thought we would give it another try.  BIG BIG BIG Mistake.

The place is filthy.  The entrance is a mess with cigarette butts all over.  The booths are appalling with the fabric frayed to the point that the foam rubber is showing.  There is dirt on every surface.

The food was awful.  The chips were very salty and the salsa is bland and uninspired.
The enchiladas (chicken) had little chicken.  The waiter brought my dinner and a lemon on the platter fell onto the table as he was delivering it.  Instead of taking it and getting another HE PICKED IT UP off of the table and placed it in the middle of my plate.

The restaurant will close sometime soon---no question about it.   There is so much deferred maintenance, the place is filthy, the food disgusting and the wait staff and management a group of amateurs who have no vested interest in providing good service.

I remember the Pedro's of years ago and it bares no resemblance to the disgusting restaurant it has become

If the cleanliness of the public spaces is any indicator I would hate to see what the kitchen looks like. I hope the health department makes a surprise visit sometime soon.

AVOID AT ALL COSTS.
