I really wanted to like it.  The good parts. They were very busy and while seated at the bar we did not wait long for our food. Very tasty Lemon Basil Marg. Hilldale is a handy location. 

Not great parts. The wait staff acted like they couldn't be bothered. My Tamale came and had to have been wrapped in baby corn. When I commented that it was very small my waiter informed me I could order more if one wasn't enough. I tipped like I had just stopped in for a cocktail.  A first for me.
