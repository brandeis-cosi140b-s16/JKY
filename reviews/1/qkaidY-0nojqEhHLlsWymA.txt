Pretty horrible food here. Another place that looks bigger on the outside, but is tiny on the inside. Ordered chips and guac and the somehow despite the chips being very shiny and greasy, they were ice cold to the touch. Lying server said they just came out of the fryer. Tacos were horrible as well. Just ordered two camarones tacos and I believe chef idiot grilled one side of the shrimp and forgot to turn it over, leaving other side very white and dangerous. If should have went back, but I didn't turn all the shrimp over until the second taco. Thankfully they are only three bucks each and date was paying, plus the flavors were horrendous with coconut inside and a salsa that did not work well. (sweet pepper). Her tacos were ok I think, but I'm not reviewing them and the guac was good, but can't overcome those nasty chips. The $5 Blue Moon tasted bad as well and this bar does not have the baseball package as Mohawk bartender thought. Entertainment district needs some better food and deals.
