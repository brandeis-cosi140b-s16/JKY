I went here because I was attending a bachelor and.bachelorette party.Well, the food is bland, but they know how to make drinks. However, halfway through our meal they opened the doors and the cigarette smoke drifted into the restaurant .I didnt finish my meal due to the horrible atmosphere.

If I wanted to stick my head in an ashtray I would do so. This is a horrible way to treat non smokers.
