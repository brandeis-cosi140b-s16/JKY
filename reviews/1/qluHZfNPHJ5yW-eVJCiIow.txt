I just endured the worst Del Taco experience of my life.

My family pulled into the Drive Thru just to order a kids meal.  We ordered a hamburger with ketchup and lettuce, fries and a chocolate shake.  I had to repeat my order 3 times because the complexity of a burger with just ketchup and lettuce on it was just too much.  

I pulled up directly to the window because there was no one else in the drive thru.  I sat for 172 seconds according to the electronic timer before I was greeted with "our shake machine is broken, can you pull you the back?" I said "can I at least have my food?".  She went back and looked and apparently it wasn't ready which she informed me of.

I pulled around back and waited 5 minutes and nothing.  So I went inside.  I could see my shake sitting on the counter, whip cream melting,  there was no one at the counter and 5 girls were working in the back.  One of them asked "can I help you?"  My response was "I am still waiting on my kids meal." She said "oh" confused.  Asked all the girls "where is the kids meal?"  They all had a dumbfounded look.  After a few minutes she handed me a kids meal.  The receipt inside was to a red burrito.  I checked the burger and all it had on it was cheese.  I told her it was wrong.  After she explained it to the cook several times, I finally received my burger correctly.  

I then noticed my shake was not stirred and you could still see the chocolate  syrup separate from the ice cream.  I decided to stir it myself.  At the end of the 20 minute ordeal, my kid got her food and she said it was good.

I was never offered an "I'm sorry" or any sort of apology.  Just looks of irritation like they did not expect to have customers who actually wanted food.  Also when I  was standing at the counter a female patron had to return her tacos because they were incorrect.  

This is the worst Del Taco and the worst set of employees I have ever seen.  I will never be back.
