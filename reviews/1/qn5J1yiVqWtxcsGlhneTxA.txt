Burritos are getting smaller and smaller. So sad because we've been going to los favs around town the past few years. One of the tackiest things now is they limit the hot sauce to 3 per burrito.  How cheap can you guys be? Wife and I laughed so hard that you are trying to limit the sauces. Its simply the cost of doing business.  If people abuse then make it a limit of 8 per item so u don't have to dump a bunch for no reason. Next thing you will do is take all the spoons napkins and salt/pepper and place them behind the counter....can I have some napkins?  Umm no sir those are 20cents each....next thing will be 75 cents for each debit card transaction.....our family will not return.  Thanks so much!
