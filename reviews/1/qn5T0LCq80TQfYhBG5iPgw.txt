I was anxious to try this place because I heard such great things, but boy was I wrong.  I ordered delivery...just a simple hot dog, onion rings, and tacos.  Not only did they take an hour and a half to deliver the food but then I was lectured because I didn't have cash to tip them (you know, because all other delivery places I've ordered from allow to tip on the card you pay with).  She was rude and almost refused to give me the food because I didn't have cash tip.  Then, when I actually tasted the food, I was even more disappointed.  The hot dog was ok but the bun tastes like butter so that's pretty much all you can taste.  The onion rings were disgusting and we didn't even bother trying the tacos.  We went straight to Indulge burgers---better food and better service.  Skip this place for sure!
