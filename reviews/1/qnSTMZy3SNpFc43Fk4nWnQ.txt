Between the bland chicken, horrible tasting condiments, and the FAKE machaca. This has been by far the WORST "Mexican" restaurant. I don't understand what triggered their mind to go into the restauranteur business!?! Machaca is supposed to be a dry beef with egg but this was oozing of water because it was broiled. Good thing I don't live around here, I had found this on Yelp from a Dr. visit.
