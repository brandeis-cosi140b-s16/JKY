Diluted Mexican cuisine.  Nothing "hot" about the hot sauces- either green or red.  The half of a cup of watery salsa was inadequate  to mask the flavor of the greasy if plentiful tortilla chips (for which no plates or napkins were offered).    The chili relleno and frijoles were the blandest I have ever eaten outside of a chain restaurant's drive-through. The television blared a raucous Mexican talk show to an empty dining room.  Loud, tasteless, plastic decor  for easy clean up with none of the authentic and endearing kitsch brought back from the homeland.
