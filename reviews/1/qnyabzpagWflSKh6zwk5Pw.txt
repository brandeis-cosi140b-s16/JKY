We love their food and all the stuff working there are super nice, but sadly we are never coming back again after the rudeness of the owner today. We didn't even mind the drive and the prices, which are are little high. The owner lady was very mean and disrespectful to us, we are long time customers! Loyal and even recommended a lot of ppl to come.... She has the worst customer service ever!  Good job loosing a regular loyal customer! Only giving them one star because I need to just to post a review...
