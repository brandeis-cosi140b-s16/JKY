Decent food, Incompetent staff. Be warned - this location is not like other Chipotle's.  It took 45 minutes to fill a basic 2-person order!! I even pre-ordered online for pick-up. It should have been so simple. The staff acted like it was my fault that their "monitors" (where they see/find online orders) was not operational. The staff made me wait while everyone in line was served first; even though I ordered online for pick-up 90 minutes prior! Thankfully, I had my phone with me and could pull up the confirmation e-mail to show the staff (along with my payment status). The staff tried to short my order multiple times, including downgrading my portion size to "kids." The manager was okay but everyone was looking for a reason to hassle me and prevent this order from being filled. I wouldn't recommend going to this location. You could throw cash into a toilet and watch it float away just as easily, and have the same level of satisfaction and growling stomach.
