This place was once of the worst places I have ever been too !! And I don't say that very often !! I went in there with my family after an event ... And we ordered some tacos and while we were ordering he yells at the cashier no more of those tacos because the guy behind them already ordered them and there is no more Of that meat. The cashier tells him well I'm sorry but she was here first and I'm giving them to her! Once our name was called we had also ordered a torta and they charge $9.00 and they put hardly any meat and 1 piece of lettuce nothing else . I go ahead and bring it up to the cashier and she asks to please have it remade the guy opened the Torta and stuffed it mad and put tons of meat in it and threw back on shelf .. It was so nasty you can tell they made all of our food in a bad manner !! When you are in this business they should welcome all comments good or bad. And they should try and fix the problem and argue with customer . And while we are paying for food that was disgusting the cook is now arguing with another customer over some tacos that were given wrong. I gave the cashier the torta only gave it 2 bites. It was so nasty but even then we paid for it!!! Yes even tho all our food was nasty we still paid for it, why because we were not looking for free food we wanted good food ! And this place is the worst:/
