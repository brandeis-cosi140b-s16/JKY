This place is horrible I ordered a party platter and I go to pick it up and manager throws it on the counter with No Salsa No chips No guacamole I asked him where's the rest of it and he's like is Extra when I usually order a $5 burrito I get chips and Salsa but When I order a $50 Platter he says is Extra so I don't know if he gets Commission on Salsa but is terrible Customer Service this Manager provided... Don't go to Arribas. Macayos treats you better
