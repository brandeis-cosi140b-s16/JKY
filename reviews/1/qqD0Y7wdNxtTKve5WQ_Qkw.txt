I went to Flicka's to see a friend's band play.  There was one server who only appeared to be clearing away empty glasses and plates.  I never saw her taking a drink order.  I went to the bar where there were two very over worked bartenders.  I asked for a drink and was told they don't carry that brand of gin.  I then asked for a Kiltlifter beer...again, they don't carry that beer.  Was finally able to get a beer that I liked and went back to our table.  
Shortly after, the "bouncer" said he had a party of 50 or 60 people coming in and he would have to take our table...
Overall, I did not think that Flicka's had anything to recommend it.
