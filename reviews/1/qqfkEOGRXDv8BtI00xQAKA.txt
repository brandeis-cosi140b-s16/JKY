Our entire family decided on attending this restaurant for Father's Day as we'd heard that the food was really good and that there was mariachi playing on the weekend. This establishment disappointed in every way possible. Indeed, the mariachi (and banda) played while we were there but it was ridiculously loud. I've eaten at plenty of restaurants where a mariachi plays but you are always able to have your meal and even converse unless the band is right at your table. Here, they were playing so loud that even the waitress couldn't make out your order six inches away from you. We could have gotten past the blaring music if the service or food would have made up for it, but lamentably, they both fell very short of an acceptable level. 

Our waitress had an attitude that made it seem as if we were lucky to even receive service. I am Mexican and grew up in this type of establishment so there is no misunderstanding of cultural norms here. The waitress was plain and simply rude and made a point of not demonstrating competence. Once the food was brought to the table almost an hour later 6 out of 10 plates were incorrect, probably due to not being able to hear the order correctly over the music. We let our waitress know of the mistake but chose to keep the plates so as to not have to wait another hour. Her response was that we should have been louder when we ordered. In the end - the food was lackluster and comparable to what you would be able to get at any drive thru Mexican restaurant here in Phoenix.

In summary, I understand that Father's Day is a busy time but as a restaurant owner you have to be able to anticipate this and train your staff on dealing with large numbers of patrons. Additionally, if your own staff can't hear your customer's orders you could easily turn down your sound system. Just seems like common sense. 

Ambiance - Frustrating
Service - Deplorable
Food - Forgettable
