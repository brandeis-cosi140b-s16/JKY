Way overpriced for such sub par food. No seasoning, no proper cooking technique used for the meats, etc. it pretty much tasted like everything was pulled out of a freezer, thrown into a microwave, then tossed into a steam table. I had really high hopes for this place. Do yourself a favor. Walk to the door, stop, look right, and head towards the chipotle you see.
