Wow, I totally knew that I hated this place. Maybe hate is too strong of a word, but I would never eat here if I had a choice. My dad had a craving for tortillas so we ended up here. 

The line was pretty long, but it goes fast. The employees weren't rude, but they weren't overly friendly either. Just enough to get them by. 

So here's why I don't eat here ever...
1. The food gets cold fast. With all the lettuce, salsa or sour cream you pile on your food, no wonder everything you eat is cold after a few bites. 
2. The quality of meat they use was really crappy. The steak was really chewy and you could see the veins. 
3. They are super stingy with portions. I've eaten at this location a few times and have ordered different things. This last visit, the chick put 4 small pieces of steak in my taco. Another time I ordered a bowl and I only got a little scoop of rice even when I didn't have any beans. 
4. The flavors are pretty bland. If you don't drench your food in salsa or cheese or sour cream, you really can't taste much. I don't eat sour cream or cheese since it's extra calories I don't need to be eating. So it looks like I'm stuck with boring food. 
5. Their tortillas suck. They get hard and break so all your meat and stuff fall everywhere and you need a fork to finish eating your tacos. 

Anyway, to everyone that swears by this place, to each his own. But for me, I'll just stay away.
