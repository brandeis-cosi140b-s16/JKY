This place doesn't even deserve a one star. ALL the tables were dirty, there was only 3 people working which made the service extremely slow. Took seriously 20 to get out food and there was only 4 other people in here. I understand that there are people in drive thru but management needs to step it up in their employment,knowing that this is a busy area. Whoever is in charge of this taco bell needs to be replaced
