No matter how good the food is, how you treat your customers is what really distinguishes a great restaurant.  Tonight we came in to dine and were told all they had was outside seating.  This was not told to us beforehand, and if we had known we would have come another evening, as we don't care for outside seating.  Instead of accommodating us, we were left to take it or leave it.  So we left.  We know the food is very good, as we've been to the restaurant many times before--we live in the area, as opposed to the many patrons who are visitors.  So, MIssion, when the economy tanks again or it's summer and you need the local residents to help you make it, good luck.  Not to say we won't be going there again, but we certainly won't be recommending you to our friends and visitors.  And by the way, Los Sombreros was thrilled to welcome us back and the food is just as good, if not better!
