This place is horrendous and the management couldnt care less. Dried old food. depleted cooked ingredients that are only cooked and replenished after someone waits in line for a half hour and orders them. avoid this place like the plague - go to a different zaba's! I gave this one a couple chances but the quality and attitude is too poor to deal with.
