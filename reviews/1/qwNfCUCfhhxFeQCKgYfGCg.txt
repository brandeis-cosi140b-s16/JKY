This place is not good. Tacos el gordo is better, I do better tacos, my lunch lady in Mansfield Mass in 1995 did better tacos. I would really have to order Tacos el Gordo and then take it into this place, make an identical order and really eat slowly , a little bit of each and find out what this place is missing. I'm not even going to read the other reviews on here, cuz I just don't see the 3.5 star rating....don't go here, try Rubalcabas down the road or Tacos El Gordo ! Don't eat here. You'll be fine without this place.
