I have come here for years, right around the corner from my house. Always been a great place to go, in the past couple months this place has gone downhill fast!! It's always filthy! Dirty tables, dirty dishes, dirty restrooms. It's never crowded so I don't know why they wouldn't have time to clean. The past few times I have gone in the girl taking the orders (she always has a flower or weird hat in her hair) messes up the orders and doesn't listen. The service has become horrendous, the food is always cold or not cooked. Sad because this place was a favorite. Take your business somewhere else this restaurant doesn't deserve it!!!
