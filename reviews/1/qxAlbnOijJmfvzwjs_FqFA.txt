Service is always terrible. Employees act like they don't want to be there. I've come to this location twice this week and my rice was hard. They also told me that they couldn't separate only onions from the fajita mix even though they usually do. The lady had an attitude when I told her they usually do and she purposely overlooked my tortillas I ordered on the side. I didn't know how badly they were over cooked until I got home which is 15 mins away. I called to speak to the manager junior who was terrible. Not accommodating in any way telling me hold on so he can go check the rice because he hasn't gotten any other complaints. That has nothing to do with my bowl. If I didn't live 15 min away I taken the food back along with their terrible service. (This was a few weeks ago) UPDATE: I am hear now and someone forgot to peel the outer layer of the onion before making the fajita mix... I remember why I haven't been coming here..:
