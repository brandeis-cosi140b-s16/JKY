I would never visit this location again. 

There meat portions are horrible. It is like they are being paid to skimp on the meat serving. Each time I have gone, you have to order double meat just to get a full scoop. 

I like Chipotle, and this is convenient for me which is why I have gone, but after this most recent visit I will drive to a different location even if it is further for more quality.

Also, they are always backed up with a long line.

I would recommend the Alma School location. They are fast, food is much better portioned, and staff has always been friendly.
