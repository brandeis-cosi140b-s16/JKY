Mediocre at best. Wayyyy too salty. I ordered a chx quesadilla. Probably the easiest thing to make. The chx was dry, barely any cheese. The pico was fresh and good. But the guacamole was already brown. They have the windows painted so you can't see in. That scares me. They gave me one.. ONE! Red sauce. I need at least four for a quesadilla. I'll never eat here again. Oh yeah, and it was super expensive! Which is crazy since the place looks like a giant bucket of dung. I wish there was zero star choice
