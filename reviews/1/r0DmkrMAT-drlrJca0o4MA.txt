I don't even want to give this location 1 star because they don't even deserve that. We walked in and we waited at least 15 minutes and the 3 employees which included the manager Leslie didn't even acknowledge us. They kept talking to each other in Spanish about something else and they even saw us but didn't even tell us "we'll be with you in a second" or anything like that. They just kept making food like we were not even there. After about 15 minutes the manager came up to take our order but by then we were so mad I just asked if she was the manager and walked out. She didn't even care that we walked out. She didn't try to stop me and ask what was wrong or anything. I have never ever waited at any Taco Bell without even being acknowledged for that long. Terrible service. Don't ever go there. That is the worst manager ever.
