WORST CHIPOTLE EVER!! 
The cashier is so rude, they're was no forks and she said they are getting them from the back when I was stating at them through the door After 10 minutes of waiting I asked again do you guys have some forks she said I'm sorry we're getting them from the back... Another five minutes passed I asked can I just go in there and get them I'm staring at them. She finally decided to go get them when there was nobody being helped at the cashier... Then we decide to sit outside and there was this awful noise coming from one of their speakers, I figured we could ignore it but it was getting so loud and static so my sister got up and went in there The girls stared at her and said can I help you in a rude attitude and of course my sister replied yes you can there's a really loud noise outside can you guys turn it down please.. And her response was anything else???

Are u f****ckn kidding me my food went cold waiting for the forks... Oh and we had to wait about 10 mins to get steak... This place needs help or perhaps better management!!
