I went to Moe's in Market Square in Pittsburgh PA on Friday 2-21-2014 as part of a promotional dinner event called The Winter Warm Up. I understand that each place has a set menu for this, but I feel the way I was treated by the manager Robert, was just plain shitty. 

We paid $50 for tickets and there were 9 restaurants, so I assumed $5.50 worth of food at each. They had rice, bean, and chicken bowls for us. That were a little small.

 I asked if I could have one without chicken, as I am a vegetarian and have been for 15 years. I thought with Moe's "make it your way" attitude, that this would be no problem. I was given a flat "No" as an answer. So, then I ask if I can take the chicken out myself and then they can put the other toppings on. "No" I explain that I paid to come here and I do not eat meat and they ignore me, explaining that the bowls are "pre-made." So, I just take one anyways, and throw away the chicken and proceed out of the line. 

At this point, one of the younger staff comes over and asks if I am a vegetarian. When I say yes, he apologizes, and makes me one without chicken, Great!, right???? 

No, Asshole manager Robert comes over and reams the kid for making mine Veg saying that "We ain't got time for this shit!" Well, excuse me?!? First of all, is it really appropriate to 1. talk like this in front of customers, children, and elderly??? 2. talk like this to employees??? 3. be this much of a jerk in general??? Also, there was no one else in line, and everyone in the restaurant had already been served... So what exactly did they not have time for??? 

NO ONE ELSE WAS DOING ANYTHING!?! What a jerk. Seriously!
