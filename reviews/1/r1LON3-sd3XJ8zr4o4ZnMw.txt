So like an idiot I came back after having had rotten food the previous time.  This time, I came because it was Taco Tuesday, and the tacos at Filiberto's were only 99 cents.  The chicken taco was acceptable although I have had better tacos at Del Taco and Taco Bell, which is pretty pathetic.  The beef taco was disgusting, the beef was dried up and greasy.  After one bite, I opened up the taco and saw that there was barely any meat in it.  

NEVER GOING BACK!
