Worst service ever!! On Monday April 27th, the shift leader waited in my daughter and me. She wasn't listening to me as I ordered so I had to repeat myself multiple times. I ordered the carne asada tostada, and she asked if we wanted chicken or beef?!! As if I didn't know what carne asada was! Really?!? There was some discussion about the tostada - it was frustrating as the carne asada was a specific selection on their menu. I also ordered a shrimp bowl, and again she asked if that would be chicken or shrimp. Seriously?!? Finally I had to tell her that nothing in our order contained chicken. After our order was complete, she followed us to the salsa bar, and stood right in the middle, moving back and forth, blocking us from getting to the selections while she wiped here and there and straightened this and that. Couldn't she wait until we were done?!?!! So we had to out wait her. When we were finally able to get some salsa, she sent one of her coworkers over. After a few minutes of generally getting in the way and reaching across us even after being asked if she could just wait a few minutes please, she then went back to her coworker and started whispering in her ear. Are we now in grade school?!?  I seriously doubt I will be going back there, especially to eat in. We got our food to go and left. The food was ok but not enough to overcome the lousy service. I recommend only using the drive through if you must get their food.
