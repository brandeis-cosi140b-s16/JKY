Shity costumer service, no soup, and  couldnt make an order over the phone to avoid standing 30 min in line while staying in the hotel. The food was full of onions and tomatoes our entire room smelled like onion, it was horrible waste of money and time. They're so called burritos and tacos had no Flavor or meat...
