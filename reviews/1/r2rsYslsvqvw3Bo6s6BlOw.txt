Sad to see from other Yelpers that this Taco Bell location has not changed in 2 years.

My wife and I went to this Taco Bell/KFC location for the first and last time today. We ordered six taco supremes and waited forever for our food. As I was waiting a long time for our food, I noticed that the 4 or so employees behind the counter were just standing around, chatting, and not working. The only food that was coming out was for the drive thru, still very slow.

Our tacos order was finally ready. When we got our tacos they were terrible. They looked like they had been thrown together very fast with no thought to the final product. As you can see in the photo, they were very bad.

I went back up to the front counter to be met with the same employee that took our order. He asked if I needed help. I asked to see the manager. He then left the counter. Another very young employee came up. Her name said "Team Member." She asked if she could help me. I asked if she was the manager and she said, "I basically am." I said is there a manager here? She said she was working Taco Bell. I stated that if she was too busy then I wanted the store managers number. She then walked away.

Another girl came walking up. She saw me and walked into the office. Then again popped back out didn't look at me until she was at the counter and asked if she could help me. I said that I used to work at Taco Bell and I know that this is not what a taco supreme looks like. She asked if I wanted other tacos. I didn't want any. I asked if I could get some chicken instead. She said yes.

I ended up getting 4 very hot pieces of chicken instead. Even though the chicken was hot, the chicken was not very good; very, very greasy and also tasted like the oil they are frying the chicken in is old.

Whoever is the manager of this Taco Bell needs to be let go. Very poorly run restaurant. Will never visit again. Terrible customer experience. Stay away!
