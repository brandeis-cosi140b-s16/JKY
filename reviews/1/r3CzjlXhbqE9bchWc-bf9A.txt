How difficult is it to keep the drink machines loaded?????
I took twice as long to finish my meal waiting for the iced tea container to be refilled which never happened. Other drink options were also empty. Then I had to put up with a totally unprofessional , obviously unqualified, manager who was shocked when I asked for a refund. It would have been nice had he at least apologized for his staff's ineptitude . I guess it's just too much to ask!
