The restaurant was very nice looking and clean. My wife had the Arizona Chimi and said it was alright. I ordered the New york Steak and Mas AND IT WAS AWFUL!l! 

I ordered it medium rare. It came out with a suspicious gray color and well done. The server offered to bring out another. When it arrived, it too was gray. Upon cutting it in the center, it was a dull color, yet some of the edges of the steak were deep red and cold.

It was then that I realized that they may put "grill" marks on the steak, they actually cook it in a microwave oven. I've seen that gray color before and the uneven (raw) nature of the cooking confirmed it.

I was polite in declining another "steak" yet the server never apologized and still charged for half the plate.

We finished our dining experience, politely paid the check, and left.

I doubt we will go back. Too many other choices out there and microwaved, cold steak is NOT one of them. This was around 4:30pm on Monday, 8/12/2013
