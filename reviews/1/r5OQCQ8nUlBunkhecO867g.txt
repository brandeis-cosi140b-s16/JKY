I used to come here often and was craving Mexican food and made a trip here instead of Robertos(what a mistake that was).  I got the chile relleno. It was the most disgusting relleno I've ever laid eyes on. It looked like it was made that morning or the day before and then popped in a microwave for 5 minutes. It felt like rubber, and the bottom of it was completely saturated in grease. I can't even put into words how disgusting this meal was. I called the waitress over and showed her, she apologized and acknowledged that it was gross and took it. A different waitress comes back with my food.. Long story short she said it was right and how it's supposed to be and that I'm wrong. And admitted they use a microwave. I don't know what happened to them but that was the worst customer service I've ever experienced. Can't figure out which was worse... the customer service or the overpriced crap microwaved food. Those girls you have in the front are ruining your business.
