I ordered a Fiesta family pack for $29.99 and was up charged $10 for having half shrimp and half chicken instead of all chicken.  Outrageous.  They likely would have charged me $20 for a full substitution of shrimp for chicken, which is probably about $2.00 per tiny shrimp.  The staff had no clue about how to put together a family pack but had no problem adding the upcharge.  The manager on site was less than friendly and more interested in taking my money than providing service.
