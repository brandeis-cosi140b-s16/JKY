The bartender did not seem to like his job. Told us the "truth" about the drinks and not to get the dollar shots when you'd think he would try to sell it to us anyway lol. He just seemed stressed. Not to mention the hour wait due to our bills and orders being mixed up. Tacos weren't great. Ahhhhhh but I did enjoy my margarita. Will I be back? To be continued.....
