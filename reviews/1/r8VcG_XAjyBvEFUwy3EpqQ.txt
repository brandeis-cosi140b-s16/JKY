4/1/15 at about 11:30pm went through the drive thru and ordered the Guacamole fish taco combo and a beef taco and what did I end up with? Two $1 nachos. I was in a rush so didn't found out till I got home. Tried calling and no one answered at all. It's a 24/7 location so people are working. Even the nachos were a mess and very messy put together. I paid $10 and got $3 worth of food that I threw away. Never going there again.
