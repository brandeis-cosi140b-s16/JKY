I hate to do this and I have held off on doing this for so long but I need to share when it comes to complete and utter dismay. 

It  has become that.

This used to be my go to place but when I had to change to asada V/S pastor (pastor is my fav) I continued on and tried other dishes.  Because I loved this place they were my first in Vegas true mexican food place in town.  I use to savor the idea of this place, wait and withhold my diet to come to this place to splurge to have this place then I came to avoid this place.

It started when I ordered a Pastor burrito and it had pineapple in it.  I didn't order a canadian pizza if I wanted pineapple I would have asked for it.  As I said I avoided it for awhile but on the way home from a movie we though what the heck it used to be good food give it another shot!  So the boyfriend got a Pastor and I just couldn't give my full confidence so I got the Asada.  We got home and they both sucked.  No longer the pineapple in the pastor but it was old and mushy the rice was barely rice it was mush, mine was mainly gristle I kept biting and chewing and spitting out, I finally gave up and went to bed hungry.  Ugh

So my favorite went to my least favorite, I wanted it to become my favorite again but, I will never go back it will now be least favorite...

Good luck I won't be back, ever...
