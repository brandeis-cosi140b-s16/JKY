We had the chips and salsa to start, but since they make their chips, I like when places serve them warm. It came with two salsas, which were good.

I got the chicken enchiladas.They were warm in the middle but the sauce was cold. The sauce was good but the enchiladas themselves were tasteless and the chicken was dry. I found two bones in my first enchilada (of three). Couldn't eat anymore after that. It was ok, but for $18 I expected MUCH more.

Also, it was ridiculously bright in the place- they have several kinds of lights and they were all on. It's nicely decorated, but being there after 7 when it was brighter than a sunny day inside was a little awkward.
