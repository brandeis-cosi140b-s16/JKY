Visited on Labor Day. Two waitress in the whole establishment. Very slow! Took forever to get water that was asked for when ordering drinks. Had 5 SMALL bowls of chips while waiting for food. Took at least 45 minutes to get food. My parents order beef fajitas to share. Came with one tortilla. When asked for more was told that they would charge. Asked to speak to manager. When he came to the table he was only able to explain that it was one order and you only get one tortilla. He didn't speak English to explain in detail. The waitress had brought us two more tortillas and the manager was stuck on that fact. There was no way that the tortilla would have held the amount of fajitas that were served. 
I ordered chilie rellano. It was okay. 
We will not return! There was minimal customer service.
