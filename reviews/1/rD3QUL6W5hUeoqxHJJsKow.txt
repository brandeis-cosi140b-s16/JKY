Awful place... First off the wait took forever to get seated around 3pm on a Thursday. The hostess seemed unsimpathetic to our concerns. But we decided to continue on, the margaritas we had were way to heavy with the sweet and sour. The food came out 35 minutes after we ordered, again for the time it should not have been busy. The server didn't even apologize and as well didn't being the additional hot sauce I requested. In short, this place really isn't worth your time.
