After 10-15 minutes of waiting for the server, she started off by telling us that they were short on staff even though there were 10-12 tables and 4 servers. 

As for the food, the presentation was good. Unfortunately, it goes downhill from there, due to the stale potatoes and bland chorizo and eggs. 

The food and service in its restaurant doesn't match the hotel.
