I am probably one of the most consistent chipotle customers over the past 10 years, and I have given this location plenty of chances to prove me that it was just a "bad" day when I went there. But I was wrong. Nope, I've now tried this location 4 total times in the past 2 months and they not only have been out of something such as mild salsa, guacamole, etc, but also have served me with beyond sub-par ingredients and clear new-hires making my burrito which is very frustrating. Tonight for example, the woman making my burrito burn my the tortilla 3 times while also managing to burn some of the plastic casing that the tortillas are packaged in. I cannot stress enough that I will never be returning to this particular location and would not recommend it to anyone. Trust me, it's worth the extra time to find an alternative location.
