Uhg, horrible. I am so sick to my tummy. I knew it was bad when I saw that the guacamole was brown. Now I'm in the urgent care sick with diarrhea and they say it's definitely food poisoning. It was overpriced and I feel like poop.

The staff obviously doesn't care about the food, it's just left out in open faced containers and not fresh at all. The pinto beans looked very old so I got black beans instead, but it didnt matter. Their cheese was also funky on top, needed to be stirred, but it was so old that it had settled or curdled. I don't know, but it was gross. The chicken I had looked old and severely overcooked, the food was just bad. The chips were good, but the every option for meat all looked terrible, so alas, I settled for chicken. Wrong answer. It was all bad. Even the service.

I mentioned it was overpriced and the employee didn't even explain pricing. It's about 10 dollars a meal, and not at all worth any of the money paid for it because the staff obviously doesn't care about the food or the people eating here.

Skip this place if you can avoid it. You're welcome.
