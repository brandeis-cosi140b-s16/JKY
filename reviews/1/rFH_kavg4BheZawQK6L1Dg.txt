Even after a night of drowning my tastebuds in liquor, when I am too drunk to be sure exactly how I got to Burrito Drive, I am still sober enough to realize that I have just been served dog food in a tortilla.

Do not make the mistake of ordering, unless it is 3 AM and you are desperate for a late night taco. Even then, I'm pretty sure Taco Bell is still open.

Will I go back? Sadly, it's too close to Plan B for me to be guarantee that I won't. Curse you late night cravings!
