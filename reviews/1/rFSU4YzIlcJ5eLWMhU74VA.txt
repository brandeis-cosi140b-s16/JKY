There are so many different places in Scottsdale that are better. The food is mediocre and the staff are total jerks. The bartender we dealt with gave us bad service and on top of that other members of the staff were very rude. Someone should remind them that customers drive their business so they shouldn't alienate them. We will not be back and you shouldn't go either.
