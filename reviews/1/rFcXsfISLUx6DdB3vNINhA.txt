Cheap food doesn't make up for quality - especially in this instance. The one saving grace is the customer service. 

Pretty sure chicken comes pre-cubed/ pre packaged; food is otherwise bland and tasteless. Salsa virtually has no flavor - how is that even possible?

I wouldn't recommend this place, although I can see it appearing on TV with Gordon Ramsay.
