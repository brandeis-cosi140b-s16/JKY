Great staff, but extremely overpriced. The three tacos came out to about $12.00, with no sides. The quality of the taco didn't warrant their price-nothing extraordinary or exotic. We Ordered a side of beans and a side of chips with salsa- another $5.00..... The tortillas were not cooked, just warmed, and the tacos themselves were cold. Also, our salsa was freezing! Chilled I assumed. Our chips were room temperature. The atmosphere and staff are great, but I won't be returning.
