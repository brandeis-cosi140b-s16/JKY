Craving a breakfast burrito and we decided we wanted Filibertos for breakfast.  Ordered in the drive thru and the young man's language barrier was so bad that we had to pull up to the window to communicate.  

He repeated our drink order five times. ..not one or twice,  but FIVE times and it was still wrong when we got home.  He didn't understand what root beer was and asked if it was blueberry?  REALLY? We ordered Mt Dew and learned that we got lemonade once we were home.  

Ugh, so frustrating.  I understand is Mexican food,  but at least put someone that can communicate in tyne drive thru window.  Because I'm pissed and im sure he's frustrated or maybe he doesn't give a shit. But you'd think that management would care when their food costs are increased because they have to correct do many mistakes by remaking the food.  

On a positive note,  the inside of the restaurant was very clean when I had to go back in for the wrong item to be corrected.
