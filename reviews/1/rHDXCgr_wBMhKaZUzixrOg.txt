I know, I know...it's Filiberto's but when it takes 30+minutes to get drive thru, it's ridiculous. My mistake assuming that it wouldn't take long given every other location has been speedy. Not only did it take forever but they screwed up my order which o didn't let them fix given the wait time.  I'll never stop by this location ever again.
