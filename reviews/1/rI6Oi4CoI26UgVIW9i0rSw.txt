Went here with my husband on a Friday night.  We won't be back.  Apparently they "were so busy" right before we got there.  We were told that about 5 times during our dinner.  No one offered us drinks or water (they were out of glasses) and when we finally got someone's attention for some chips and salsa, the chips were cold and oily and the salsa was only half filled.  We asked for plates.  They were getting washed also.  My husband got up and snagged some napkins from the busser's station.  Drinks finally came. No straws and no spoon ( I ordered ice tea).  Our meals were both salty and cold (aren't fajitas supposed to come out hot and sizzling ~ thought that was what the cast iron pan was for). We didn't finish even a third of our meals.  Server came and I told her everything was cold.  Her response "Yeah, we were really busy before you got here." ??  She then left our check and walked away. Didn't even offer us a to-go box for our skimpy portions that we had left. Paid and bill and walked out (past all the screaming kids and spilled food that was trailed all over the place).

Never again.
