This was my favorite spot for almost a year. We always take to go. Order the same thing every time. 2 Tortas with extra carney and Americas way. Today they mess my order up and give us pork. We are Jewish and do not eat kosher but we don't eat nothing that have pork or lard. We did take couple of bites to find out that it was taste funny. Very disappointed. Try calling, they phone is off.
