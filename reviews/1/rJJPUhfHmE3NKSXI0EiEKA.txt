Was so excited to finally have a taco shop near my house. So disappointed it's this one. The food isn't bad but the service is horrible and it's freezing inside there. They have made mistakes on my order a couple different times then act like its my fault they screwed up. I know Donald Trump has said done horrible things about Mexicans but I'm not him so don't treat me like a gringo asshole cause I don't speak Spanish. Guess what it's Henderson, there's a lot of us gringo assholes in this neighborhood. In a world where there are choices, customer service is what keeps customers happy and coming back for more.
