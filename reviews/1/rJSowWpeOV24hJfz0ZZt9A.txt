We have gone here for the 3 years we have lived in Maricopa and have even brought numerous friends there including to their Karaoke night.  It has always been hit or miss with service but the food as always been great.  The last couple times we have gone the food quality has gone down and last night was the show stopper for us! 

We called in an order for 3 burritos which is almost $18 and bring it home.  As I pulled them out of the bag I noticed they were flat and less than a half inch high, I thought this was weird.  I opened up my chorizo and egg burrito and it was so thin you could literally see through the tortilla where there was nothing in it in several spots.  My husbands ground beef and green chili was exactly the same.  My daughters deep fried carne asada burrito was the only one that looked like an actually burrito and not a glorified quesadilla.

I called the Taco's n More and spoke with the manager about the burritos, she sounded more than irritated I called to voice my concern.  I told her we have been coming there for years and this was the first time I've seen this she said that it was their new "portion control".  REALLY!!!! You put maybe a half a cup of meat inside a large burrito fold it, cause its too thing to roll like a normal burrito and tell me its still worth $6 you charged me.  She offered no apologies or anyway to make it right.  We have heard from several people it has always been the service that keeps them away from this place, and we have defended it and continued to eat there regardless.  Not anymore!

We will not be back which is sad since we would rather put the money back into the Maricopa economy then into the big business food chains.  Hopefully if you still choose to go you will not be victim to their "portion control" they have recently (as of last night) instituted.   There are plenty of other mom & pop places here that still value the product they put out and the people they serve.
