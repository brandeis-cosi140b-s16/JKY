I tried the shrimp burrito per the review on here. One of the worst I've had...ever. (Salsitas' has a good one, IMO.) It just didn't taste that good...it was spicy, which I like, but the flavor was boring. Hubby and kid had bean burritos and weren't impressed either.

Everything was WAY over salted. And, I know this is TMI, but we all spent hours in the bathroom the next day. :( We will not go back.
