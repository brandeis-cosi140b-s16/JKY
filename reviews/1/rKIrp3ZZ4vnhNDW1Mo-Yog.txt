If I could choose zero stars, I would. The service is horrible. You have to yell or wave to get a servers attention. I only come there because the food is amazing and I work nearby. I rarely tip and if I do it is $1 because I am a nice person and feel bad. If you come here, expect amazing food and shitty service!
