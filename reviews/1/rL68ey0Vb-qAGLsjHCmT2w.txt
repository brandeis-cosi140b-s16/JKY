I went to this place because it had good reviews, but I  was really dosapointed. The Tacos were only  99 cents but they were VERY small. Their tortas are also very small. The only thing I liked about  the restaurant  was the free chips and salsa. Not the worst place but, I will definitely  NOT return.
