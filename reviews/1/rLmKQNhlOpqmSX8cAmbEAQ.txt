This is an accumulative review. Based on 50 years of dining hell at Filiberto's. Not really 50, but with the amount of internal distress and subsequent can time I've put in due to this place it sure feels that way.

My worst experience: Picture if you will; driving to Cali for a fun-filled week at the beach and cool ocean waves. We stopped for gas, and decided that some Fili's would be a good idea. False. My gf does not eat beef or pork. She ordered a Chicken quesadilla. Got an intestine filled quesadilla. She took two bites and had the look of complete and total disgust. She opened the quesadilla, I head an audible stomach turn, and the words, "WHAT.THE.FUCK." come from her mouth. I looked at the quesadilla sitting in her lap, and cringed as I debated whether to tell her what it was, or not. She asks, "What is it?" I said, "You don't want to know." as I removed it from her lap and jettisoned it out of the window driving down the 60 out of Wickenburg. She insisted on knowing, and I told her that it was pig intestine.  

Then it was my turn. I took a bite of my Adobado burrito while she took a bite of the quesadilla. I then opened my burrito and found more pig intestine. Jettisoned the burrito, also. Glad we could help out the coyotes of Arizona. Still craving Mexican, we were forced to wait until Indio. 

Went to the website to leave a review, and it didn't work. Called the office to get an email address and you would think I was trying to contact The President. Told she was "Vacationing in California." ME TOO! They have email, in California, also, FYI. Wrote an email to the owner and no response. 

There really is no "best" experience at Filly's. Just not going to ever happen. Or maybe I'm jaded after that one.
