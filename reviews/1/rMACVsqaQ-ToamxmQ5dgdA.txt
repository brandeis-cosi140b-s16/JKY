I decided to low-roll it my second night in Vegas and save the trips to the nice places for when everyone else hit town. So I found myself in the Inferior Palace looking for food. I'll admit it... I was planning to eat somewhere else until I saw the jiggling rack on a server walking by.

I'm a sucker.

The eye candy factor of hot waitresses in low cut outfits & push up bras is dulled by them spending more time gossiping with each other than checking on your table. The service totally sucked.

The food? Meh. I didn't finish my chicken burrito because they did a lousy job of cleaning the meat off the bones and almost every mouthful left me picking cartilidge out of my mouth. Even if I were totally hammered, I wouldn't eat here again. It was that bad.

And the primary reason for trying to eat at the IP was because I figured it would be cheap. Wrong again. Totally overpriced. Save your money and walk past the dump that is the IP.
