Conveniently located in the lobby of Aria, I decided to wonder downstairs after a late night (come on, it's Vegas!).  This place tries to be a modern Mexican restaurant... but I just don't buy it.  Aside from straying from the typical presentation of rice and beans, they weren't that creative. However, points on their creativity of the prices... $100 for 3 entrees and one appetizer? HAHA!  Good thing it was comped by Aria anyways!  

No Bueno!
