Yikes - How can you screw up fajitas and a margarita.....Ok how about serve the fajitas luke warm with  no rice (that's extra)  you get a plop of refried beans that look like baby diahrea and corn or flower tortillas served in a paper bag that has been heated in a microwave. So the tortillas had crusty hard edges in which we got to put our barley warm chicken.,  Really bad.  Also the margaritas (not frozen) obviously made with a mix sickening sweet no alcohol you needed alcohol to get through this meal.  How can you have a Mexican restaurant and not provide complementary chips and salsa.. This should not be an add on item.  I am local and my husband and I have a date night on the strip every Saturday  Most restaurants in the tourist corridor are good ... sometimes over priced.. but this was the most atrocious dining experience ever,  it was just supposed to be a quick Mexican meal and go home  it was a bummer for sure!.........STAY AWAY.....There are many more dining  options cheaper, better food and better ambience both in the resort corridor and off the strip.  there is not reason to go to this place
