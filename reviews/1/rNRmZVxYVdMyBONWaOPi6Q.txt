Worst burrito wrappers. Ive been going here regularly for last few weeks. Since last week, new employees cant wrap the burrito right so they are dripping all over while im eating them. Quality better be come back to its standard as it was before. Same burrito tasted so bad because it was breaking down. Worst experience ever.
