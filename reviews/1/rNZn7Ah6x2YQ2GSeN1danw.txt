If I was a business owner I would correct everything wrong with this place. Let me start with the following. The hours on Google state 12:00 AM, which is fine if that is the time they close. We get to the location at 10:15ish (give or take) Lets just give them the benefit of a doubt and say 10:45 PM. The cashier stated that we can only order take out and that her credit card machine was not working. I know for a fact that means she closed up shop early and is only excepting cash only. this is every inconvenient. So at this point, all of this is customer service and if I was the owner I would like to know what is going on in my bread and butter (Money/Income/Livelihood) If this is how the front people are treating the customers I cant even imagine how the people handling the food are doing or thinking. I WILL NEVER GO BACK AGAIN FIRST AND LAST.
