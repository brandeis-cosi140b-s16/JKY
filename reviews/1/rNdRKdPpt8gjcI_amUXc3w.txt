So this place is great... if you're trying to conceive with the devil. 
Pros:
 the rice was cooked?
the pico de gallo contained matter of some dimensionality (of which I did not know)
Cons:
you have to burn all leftovers and burry the ashes between a oak tree and a rose bush, at 2:15am on a full moon, with a rabbi present otherwise THEY WILL RESPAWN
