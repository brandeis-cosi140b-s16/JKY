So, we order the chips.. Not a freebies...that's fine , but they were heavily dosed with chili powder. We wiped as much as we could off. I had the best jerk chicken burrito at Hilldale, but this was hyper shredded and then dosed with chili powder. I couldn't taste the jerk. The side rice was overly chili powdered and inedible. If I'm craving Amer\ Mex, I'd go to Hilldale, Monroe street was a big salty, chili powder miss.
