First time visit last weekend for take out and the clerk overcharged me for a bean quesadilla.  When I told her about it she asked, "You want cheese in the quesadilla, right?  That's an additional $2."  What a rip off, it was basically one tortilla with some beans and cheese for $8.99.  I KNOW that quesadillas automatically have cheese in it.  She wouldn't give me the difference.  Don't think I'll be returning.
