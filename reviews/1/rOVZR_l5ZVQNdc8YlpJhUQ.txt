First time visit disappointed
BEWARE
My daughter ordered Huli Huli
Chicken tacos and found a BIG chicken bone in her food.
Waited for other patrons to leave before I said anything.
No sorry no concern no nothing!
Luckily my daughter didn't choke on the 2" chicken bone.
Asked who was responsible for cutting up
Chicken - they need to be more careful !
All FIVE employees - said absolutely nothing.

I'm taking my money elsewhere where they care.



Well it's unfortunate that someone's safety and well being has to be taught to your "young leadership"! As well as their common sense and courtesy to at least acknowledge the issue; then show concern for your patron and at minimum an apology regarding the situation. 

NOT ONE of your staff whom varied in age offered an apology which leaves your patrons "the perception that there is no concern regardless of how long they have been in leadership".
Obviously they learned from you as your lack of sincerity comes through your response.
