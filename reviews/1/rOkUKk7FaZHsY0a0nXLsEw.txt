The food here was bad. Just plain bad. The nachos were soggy. The burger we had was overcooked. The bread on it wasn't fresh. The guac was bland. Random cheese crumbles that had no flavor. One of the worst (if not the worst) Mexican restaurants I've been to.

Well it can't get worse can it? YEP. Service was also horrible. All the waitress did was  once ask us what we wanted and hand us the food. I asked for a refill on my drink and I waited 5 minutes. I motioned at the waitress again, she looks at me and then looked away, then proceeded to go to another table. After another few minutes, I finally get my drink. At that point, I asked her for the bill right away.

This place was empty. I should have known why.
