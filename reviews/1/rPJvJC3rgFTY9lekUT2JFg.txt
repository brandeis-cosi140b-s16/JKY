The food was disgusting - it was like eating leftover food from the garbage disposal - watery. 

Customer Service was just terrible.
They decided to trash talk in Spanish about our party - until I said something - they were kind of surprised I spoke Spanish since I look white. 

Never ever coming here again or any of their other locations.
