Service was slow. 

Burrito consisted of "carnitas" which contained more refried beans than pork, black beans and cheese. No veggies in sight! It was serviced with a large side of "salsa" that was more like ketchup & was loaded with high fructose corn syrup. 

Chips were cold & stale. 

All this for $12!!!  Next time, I'll go to the BBQ place. At least I can get veggie side dishes there...
