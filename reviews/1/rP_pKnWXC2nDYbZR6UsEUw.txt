This place was no bueno. It's in a cute little area called the Linq, which is between the Quad and Flamingo. We were looking for a quick bite to eat and this place looked decent. It's cute, if you're just looking for a drink. But the food is awful. Que horrible. The tortillas used in the tacos were some of the most bland, stiff tortillas I've ever had. The meats - we had both the ribeye and carnitas - were not good either. The ribeye was tough and had this weird sauce rubbed on it. The carnitas didn't have much flavor. The best part of our meal was the mango and watercress salad.

We sat at the bar and one of our friends who was there earlier and ordered before me didn't even get her food. When she asked the server about it, she acted as if the long wait was not a big deal and simply said "the kitchen must be really backed up right now." Seriously?!? WTF. The place, by the way, was not packed at all. It was Sunday, probably around 7:30 pm.

Do not waste your calories here.
