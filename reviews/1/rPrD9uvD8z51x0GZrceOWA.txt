The seating is horrible... The service was even worse.  It feels like they are geared more for Take Out.  There was enough staff but no one seemed to know what to do... aka refill my Tea glass / take my order / and the no silverware thing again.  2 of the 3 things I ordered from their menu, they were out of (Mole and a dessert).  Then the waiter tried to talk me into another dish by saying it was his favorite.  Will never go back!  Sucky experience!
