the WORST mexican food ever...no, the worst food ever.

in phoenix for 2 weeks for work from LA. don't bother coming to this restaurant if you're used to living in a city with plentiful delicious mexican food. taco bell has better tasting beans and rice than rosita's. 

got the sampler platter which was more like a random mash of sauces with unidentifiable food. 

the food was completely BLAND. the salsa, refried beans, tamales, etc were all tasteless. how do you mess up refried beans? the enchiladas were made with what seemed like nacho cheese. even the chips seemed stale.

the only mexican thing about this place was the music. they should import some of the immigrants arizona kicked out and get some people that actually know how to cook, prepare, serve, and host a mexican restaurant.
