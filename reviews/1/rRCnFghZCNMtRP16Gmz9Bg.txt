If this place wasn't in the perfect location it would have already gone under. It's Chipotle, yes, but of the three in the area (the others are on Baum Blvd and Forbes Avenue in Oakland) this one is the worst. You could go to a nice restaurant and finish your meal by the time you are served at this Chipotle. No one is sitting in the restaurant eating other than employees who are on break because it takes so long to serve each customer.
