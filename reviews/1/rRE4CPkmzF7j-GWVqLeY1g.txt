I'm very disappointed with javiers. I went there for my birthday, it was a party of 10 on a Saturday night. The drinks were great, however it took them over an hour to serve our food after we ordered. I was in the verge of asking them to cancel our order and mind you I'm not a complainer.  By the time the food came some plates were cold, it was such a disappointment and it ruined my birthday dinner. For the price we were expecting exceptional food and amazing service, it was a waste of our money and time.
