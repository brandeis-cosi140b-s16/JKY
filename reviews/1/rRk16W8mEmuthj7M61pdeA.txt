Bad customer service!!  Bad attitude to start with..  We asked for extra green salsa and hot sauce twice but did not see anything when we got home, not even regular salsa.  Basically no sauces, no spoon, no napkin, nothing...  We even asked for it again after the girl gave us the bag of food and she said its all in the bag...  Disappointed!!
