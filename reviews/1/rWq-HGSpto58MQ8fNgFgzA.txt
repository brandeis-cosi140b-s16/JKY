We were staying in Chandler, AZ and saw this restaurant across the street from our hotel.   So, we tried it out for dinner and what a mistake!

First off,  we ordered a pitcher of margaritas which was shared between the two of us.    After drinking the $20 pitcher, we came to the conclusion that there must have been about one shot of tequila in the whole thing. 

I ordered the Steak fajita taco salad.  That was my second mistake- well I guess third mistake if you count walking in the door to the place.  
This Steak fajita taco salad was a disgusting fried shell with a small amount of steak and onions in the bottom, covered by about five inches of old dry lettuce.    
 When it arrived at the table, the bottom portion was just a nasty juicy mess that could barely be eaten. The juice was not any sort of sauce. It must have been the oil that the steak and onions were cooked in.    The part of the shell that was not submerged in this grease even tasted like very old frying oil, and nothing else.  

My girlfriend had the spinach enchilada dinner.  There was no taste of spinach in this enchilada.  All of the taste was some spice that they had went overboard with.  We like spicy things, but this was not a good thing.  
It seems that the Mexican restaurants around here do not re-fry their beans, which is fine.   These beans in particular tasted like absolutely nothing-  which may have been for the better.  The only thing edible on the plate was the rice.

It's a good thing I live in Illinois so I don't have to look at this pace again.    I really feel ripped off.     You can't even count on your $20 worth of margaritas to have enough alcohol to make the food seem good.
