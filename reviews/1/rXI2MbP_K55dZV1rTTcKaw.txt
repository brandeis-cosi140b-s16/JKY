This would have been an easy 4+ star review except for the bar/food server's actions seating people in our seats near the end of the meal while we were in the bathroom.

Saw them on AZ PBS TV show "Check Please" (http://www.azpbs.org/checkplease/segments/restaurant.php?id=3206), looked good so thought we would try it.  Arrived during a busy time at 5:30PM and was told it was over a half an hour wait in the restaurant but the bar was open.  Sat in the bar at the counter and we noticed that several other folks were eating at the Bar so she decided we should do the same.  

The Latino gentleman behind the bar was quick, attentive, organized, fun, and engaging.  Margaritas with Tortilla chips & Salsa came quickly and we were being taken care of well.  We both ordered the Green Chili Chimichanga and mine arrived slightly over toasted but still tasty.   Guacamole was very good.

Near the end of our meal we got up to use the bathroom and I returned first to find that the bar tender had given up our seats, even though our sunglasses, keys and her personal things were still on the bar.  
Would 5 minutes have killed him to let us finish or order dessert?

Total was $43 including tip.  I had to pay from the food server's walk up area as there was no counter space elsewhere and our seats had been taken over.
I've never been thrown out of a bar before, but this sure was a rude ending to an otherwise great meal.
