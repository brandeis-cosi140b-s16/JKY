Ate here twice unfortunately ...... We walked it one of the entrances with no help just blank stares.. Told to wait here server will be right with us.....waiting.....we finally walked over to hostess table and told us she can't sit us down until we finish our Fat Tuesday drink....ummmm isn't it Vegas???? Oh well she was a snot.... Sat down and service TOOK FOREVER..... We ordered the special and now we know why it's discounted..small potions microwaved and placed on a plate..it was pathetic. Came in the next day kicking and screaming but just wanted chips and salsa...those for $4 was a better portion than the $10 special. I refuse to come back. Bad food...even worse service....bravo diablo..
