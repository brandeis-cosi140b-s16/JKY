I wish I could say more, but the only good thing about this place is the patio atmosphere. Food is decent, but far from great. They can't seem to come to agreement on happy hour...1 day it's $2 bottles, next day $2.50, next day $2 again, next day none. Sometimes happy hour is 3-5, sometimes 3-6...btw, WHO has happy hour 3-5? People aren't even off work by 5! STUPID!!!
Now, on to the service....I have been in the service industry for YEARS. THIS IS THE WORST SERVICE I HAVE EVER EVER EXPERIENCED! We sat literally for 20 minutes (no exaggeration) before anybody said a single word to us. 
The ONLY reason we come back, is because it is so close we don't have to drive. Management/owners need to seriously evaluate what they are doing here and take some immediate corrective actions.
