I would not recommend this restaurants for anyone who has Celiac. I explained to the waitress that I had an allergy just not a gluten free lifestyle. She then said the chips are gluten free but made in a facility that processes wheat. I did not eat the chips. I ordered an item she assured me was gluten free and safe for me. It was not. I started having a reaction within about 10 minutes of finishing my meal.  I informed the manager just so no one else had an issues. His response was that they must have used the wrong flour. He didn't seem too upset that I will now be sick for the trade show I am out of town for.
