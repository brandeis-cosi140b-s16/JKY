decent food
But definitely going downhill.

On my most recent visit, I sat at the bar, and was virtually ignored by the waitress, who was obviously entertaining some friends.

It took me over twenty minutes to get a drink and almost 1/2 hour before she took my food order -  even though there were fewer than ten people in the place. 

Just after I got my food, she cashed out, sat down next to me at the bar - with her friends - and commenced chain-smoking - which is, illegal, I believe.

Not going back.
