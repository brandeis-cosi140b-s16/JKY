Second worst Roberto's Taco Shop in town.

I wasn't even able to order because they don't accept credit cards. 

On top of that the locations is very hidden and the inside is very dirty looking and small. 

The staff was just unsure of what to do being that I had already ordered. They charge a crazy fee for debit card transactions. 

Stay away...
