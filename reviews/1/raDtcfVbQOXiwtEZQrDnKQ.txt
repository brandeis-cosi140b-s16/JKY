Pretty much the worst Chipotle that I've ever been to. The food is good and tasty but the cleaning is terrible. When I was in yesterday, pretty much every single table needed to be wiped down. Additionally, the floors were coated in filth.

Also, the cashier was not standing at the cash register when I went to pay for my food (several other people in line with me) and someone had to fetch him. Lots and lots of people standing around and not doing anything. 

Chipotle needs to replace this manager and get the place up to snuff.
