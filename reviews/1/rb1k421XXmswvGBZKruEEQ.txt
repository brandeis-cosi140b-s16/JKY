With the hundreds of Mexican food options in the Valley of the sun, choose any except this one. A breakfast burrito cost me $6.49....nearly twice the cost of any other place. A friend ordered a sausage breakfast burrito...he ended up with hot dogs as sausage. Take it from someone who has had years of burrito experience, dont bother coming here.
