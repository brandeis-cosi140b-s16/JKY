Ewwww!  Fun looking place, but as a first timer I was thoroughly disappointed.  Happy hour on Friday and was shocked at the lackluster drinks.  If you don't want beer, don't come here!!  Margarita was tasteless and so iced/watered down thought it was lemonade.  Ordered a cocktail and 3 times in a row it was not made correctly at all.  Again, weak & watered down... and it was a pure alcohol cocktail, no mixer!!

Food... chips/salsa & some other chip mess... should have went across the street to Costco & got some 3# bag of chips & cheese whiz!
