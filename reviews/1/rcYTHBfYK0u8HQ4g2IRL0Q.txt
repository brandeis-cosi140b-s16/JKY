I ate here twice, chicken tacos with rice and beans. Tasted really good. The second visit, within one hour of eating the food, I had a terrible case of food poisoning. I won't go into the details but after voiding what I had eaten there, I felt weak but better. Now I can't pass that place without remembering how sick I had gotten. Never again.
