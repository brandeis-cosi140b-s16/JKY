Wow... Last time I eat at this location. 
The employees are not only rude to the customers they only talk to each other while they are serving you.  No wonder they have to ask you two and three times what you wanted... they don't listen to you - only to their co-workers. 
Besides having bad employees the food is not very good either and I'm not sure about how safe it is to eat.  I even looked around for the health code rating because I'm sure the meat inside my burrito was below the safe temperature of 135Â°F.  I guess they thought the burnt tortilla would fool me.  
Most of the containers were practically empty so all portions were skimpy. The guy in line behind me even told the employee to restock the lettuce then finish his salad. They only wanted to give him one tong full of lettuce.  At. 6 p.m. on a Saturday night you think they would be well stocked.... and it was not busy at all.  People probably stopped going there because it is so bad.  
I purchased two meals and I had a card with 10 stamps on it so I was suppose to get one meal free.  After I paid for the other meal I asked for another stamp card (to use at the Cedar City, Utah location - which is great by the way) The employee told me that I could not have one. I told him I PAID for one of the meals and I should get one stamp.  He literally rolled his eyes, picked up a card, stamped it, handed it to me, and walked away NOT SAYING A WORD.   What a Jerk !!!! 
I tried to write a review on the Cafe Rio website so the owners would know how bad this location is.....but their "Write a review" is not working.  Maybe they get too many BAD reviews and are tired of reading about them.  
My advise to you... Go to Chipotle - it is in the same shopping center.
