Not so happy with this location right now. I went to get the special of the day (coconut shrimp) only to be "greeted" by an employee I had to speak too first. I walked  and she looked at me as though I had a third eye, so I said "hello" to her. I ordered the shrimp and they are out of the mango salsa that comes with it.. Only the main topping.. No big deal. Then, I decide to treat myself to dessert, key lime pie. They're put of pie. I then inquire the chocolate flan. Guess what? Don't have that either and no other desserts are made yet. It's 3pm. Alright.. Get home and try the rice. HARD and crunchy. They need to get it together! I even asked when they would have desserts for if there is a time of day things that I think should also be made are made. The cashier said anytime, just not now. Awesome. Thank you..
