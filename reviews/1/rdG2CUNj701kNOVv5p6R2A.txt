I want it to be known this review is for this location only! I ordered the baja chimi with my husband & when it came out it had a teaspoonfull of baja sauce & a ton of red sauce I told the waitress oh im sorry I wanted only baja sauce to which she said oh ok it comes this way I said ok well at the 59th & bell location theyve always made it only baja sauce, she argues for a minute to which I say can I please just have it remade with ony baja sauce? ok she says & leaves comes back with A lead server who starts to say the same thing to me maybe ive been ordering the burro for the last 10 years, umm noo the chimi is deep fried the burro is not , then she tells me oh they probably just knew knew how you wanted it cause you went there I said maybe it doesnt really matter to me why at this point I point to the plate the lady has brought back that still has the red sauce on it but now with more baja sauce & say like I told my waitress already I just want it remade with ONLY baja sauce at this point its been a good 35 mins we were there & guess what then the waitress comes out with a manager who begins to tell me that the baja chimichanga comes with the red sauce & baja sauce & I tell him the same thing I just wanted it remade with ONLY baja I get how it comes so he starts telling me about the burro I FINALLY raise my voice over his that had been talking over me for a good 5 minutes & say ya know what just fricking cancel the damn order & bring the check! I will NEVER go here again & thats saying alot since it is OUR family go to spot my husband & I met in a macayos  we had macayos food for our wedding reception  & we celebrate each & every special occasion there before now. The manager did say dont worry about the soda my husband had ordered & we even still gave the waitress a 5 when we left its a job & she did try to have it remade. This location should focus on trying to listen to a customer instead of arguing, I heard them the 10 times plus they said how it was made & everytime said ok I understand that can I just have it remade with no red sauce please.EDIT Oh I forgot to mention by the time that was all done we had to go home & make our own food because the backup places we tried were all closed after the 45 plus minutes not to get our food!
