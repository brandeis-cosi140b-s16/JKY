This place is worse than Taco Bell. Located in the food court of MGM, this wannabe Chipotle had the worst possible food and service. I unfortunately got the carne asada quesedilla which tasted like rubber. The food was beyond bland and had a weird texture to it that I barely even finished my first bite. As for the service, I was dumb enough to stand around at the register while the employees looked like they were running around like chickens with their heads cut off. Even if you were blacked-out drunk looking for something to eat, you would have better luck going to the McDonald's in the food court.
