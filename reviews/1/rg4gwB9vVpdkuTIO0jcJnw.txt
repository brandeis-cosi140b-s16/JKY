We had yo stop going here. We had so many bad experiences. We order their decent tocos that are 4 and 5 bucks and they kept giving us the cleap 99 cent tocos. Not okay.  We have had sour tasting meat, and some foul smelling lettuce. The workers tend to be helpful and very nice. But the food isn't any damn good. We have had them over charge us. Most recently we were double charged and when they had to refund me they short changed me $8 which I had to go back and demand it. The girl who had done it had just got off work and they said her cash drawer was over by $10 and that they would just give me the 10 and call it even. A nice gesture and honestly I wouldn't complain but what bothers me is that this worker was over charging customers and instead of righting the wrong they just "called it even" what about the other person/people who realized they were over charged and it was too late? Haven't been back and unless there's no other alternative we Dont plan to go back. This is not a usual experience for us at Toco Bell, just seems to be the one here in Maricopa.
