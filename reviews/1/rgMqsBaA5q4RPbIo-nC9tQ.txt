I went here because they had good reviews and I won't be going back. I waited 25 minutes for a burrito of which they forgot to make or probably gave away to another customer. They don't have any type of system for giving it orders. Long waits of hungry angry people for a fast casual place they do not have it together. The manager came or several times and did nothing to help. Not a good dining experience and a waste of time if you have a limited time for lunch!
