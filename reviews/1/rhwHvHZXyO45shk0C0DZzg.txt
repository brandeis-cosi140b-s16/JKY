This was the worst dining experience I've encountered in years! The service was less than memorable. The server had zero emotion or accountability. It started with ordering margaritas. We each ordered a different one but both of us found them so tart they were unconsumable. When the waiter found time to check on us and take our order he was oblivious to the fact our second drinks (after sending back the first ones) were barely touched though at least 15 minutes passed. When the food arrived we were informed they were out of the black beans that we both had ordered. Very, matter of fact. The option we were given was pinto beans, mostly broth. When our waters were finally refilled after sitting empty for some time (on a quiet Tuesday night), they were refilled with soda water. We approached the bartender to get tap water and overheard the waiter indicate he gets those confused but an apology never arrived at our table. An oblivious eye was turned to the fact that the re-made margaritas were left completely full (as they were only marginally better but still unconsumable). The bartender actually removed our plates (after we sent our original drinks back) but never uttered a word about our basically untouched beverages but they certainly had no issue charging us for them. A complete failure all around. It was clear that while other customers were still in the restaurant the bartender was focused on the lovely lady seated at the bar while our waiter must have been focused on the clock (though it was barely past 9 when we left.) Do yourself a favor and eat ANYWHERE else. I've never been so insulted or disappointed in a restaurant as I am in this place. I've also never posted a negative review before but it's been earned here. Enter at your own risk.
