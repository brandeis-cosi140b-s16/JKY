First time here and It's not what I was expecting I been to the one in Tucson and it was good so I was exciting coming to this one but I was not happy hotdogs had no flavor grill onions look disgusting I still think BKS is way better in Tucson and here in phoenix I can buy a better Sonoran hotdogs off the street!
