Gross. The margaritas are sub par. As one friend described them, they taste like pinesol bathroom cleaner. I think this place is better known for drinks rather than a place to eat. I ordered a basic Caesar salad which came out drenched in much too salty dressing. I had to send it back. My friend ordered a fajita that was under seasoned. It came with a lot of peppers and hardly any meat. I've been here a couple times for drinks and have never been too impressed. My first time eating there was also the last time.
