Good service and God awful food!!! One star b/c of great service brought it up... And could not go lower. 

OMG the food was horrible and lacked taste at best.  The guac was worse than what comes from a bag!! 

We had a table of 8, service was great! Food weak bland, lacked interest or taste. The only dish that appeared worth ordering was the street tacos. 

The jalape√±o steak fajitas were tough as leather and well tastes the same. 

How does a place like this survive in Phoenix?  Oh must be east coast tourist, well thank goodness for them. 

That is all.
