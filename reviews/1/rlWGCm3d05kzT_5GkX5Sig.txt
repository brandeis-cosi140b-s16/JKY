If i could give a score of zero i would. This location is absolutely horrible. The staff is okay for the most part but the food preparation is the worst I've seen. If you ask for your food to be made special,  good luck. Oh and dont bother complaining, all they do is offer a cash credit on your next order that garenteed to be pure crap too. I will never visit this location again. 

Management is incompetent at best
