I visted this restaurant several months ago after moving here from los angeles. I had heard good things from residents and from online reviews. Also it was conveniently right down the street from my place. 

I expected a lot because of all the hype but was immediately let down as soon as we walked in the restaurant.  It was dirty and run down. You would think with all the publicity this place get its would tidy up but nope, beedln to cleaner looking restaurants in south central la.

Most importantly the food sucked so bad that I actually made yelp account to let people know that its bad. This is not authentic mexican nor is it Chinese food. The was dry the beans were canned, the carnitas were also dry.  So sad that I cant find good food out hete in phoenix.  To be honest if people like this restaurant then they just have never had authentic mexican or Chinese food in there life. Try for your self but be honest. Dont give it a review based on the hype or because you saw it on the food next work. Don't go on a day your are too hungry though, the disappointment will be greater.
