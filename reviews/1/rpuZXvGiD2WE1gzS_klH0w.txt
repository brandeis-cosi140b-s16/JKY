Overpriced, tasteless food. With all the affordable but tasty food in Vegas..why settle? PF Changs next door is miles in comparison...delicious food with a great happy hour lunch special with dunks and food...don't settle! We ended up here, bc it was the first place we saw, and we were all starving after our flight from NY...never again
