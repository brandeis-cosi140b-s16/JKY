I went to dinner here on 10/28/2010. What attracted me was the reputation the restaurant had for it's authentic food and the Mariachi Trio music on Thursday night.  What a disappointment it was!  The steak fajitas came out and they were served as a pile of mostly onions and some green peppers.  There was hardly any steak in the pile and what I did find had very little seasoning and was tough, definitely not top sirloin!
We were also served chips and salsa  which were OK, nothing special.
Since we were still hungry after eating the fajitas, we ordered sopapillas.
They came out and again what a disappointment! Hardly any flavor to them and very little sugar coating on the outside. The honey syrup didn't come in a serving decanter but instead in cheap peel open packages you would find at a fast food restaurant. As I looked around i thought the only people that would eat here are tourists(who will never come back) and people who don't know what authentic mexican food tastes like.
