If I could rate this place as a zero I would. I ordered a peach lemonade (the drink was tasty) and three fish tacos. From all the good reviews from this joint, it makes you wonder if people even have taste buds.

The price was $5 and some change for the tacos, good portion size if you are hungry. But the fish tasted borderline foul, maybe they were trying to get rid of old fish. Don't know, definitely would not recommend. Be sure to bring the vomit bag if you order this dish.

I hate to give a crappy opinion, but I was craving some good fish tacos hoping to find that diamond in the ruff. This is not....
