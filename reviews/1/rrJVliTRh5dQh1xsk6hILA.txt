Been here twice. First time was just OK, average taco shop fare. The staff has a hard time with communication in English, but no big deal. Well the second and LAST time, I had to explain 3 times what I wanted. then when it was served, looked and smelled worse. The girl behind the counter was rude. So into the trash the food went and out the door I went.
