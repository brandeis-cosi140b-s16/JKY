I decided to try this place for lunch today. I frequently go to Vida next door and have always received great service and food. Unfortunately this is not the case for their sister restaurant Vida Vida. I waited for 10 minutes before I was greeted by my server. I gave her my food and drink order at the same time hoping this would expedite the process. After waiting for another 15 minutes, I still had yet to even receive the water or chips and salsa I ordered. I finally just walked up to the server and asked her to cancel my order, to which she responded "ok that's fine" and walked away from me. Needless to say, it will be a while before I'm willing to try this place again. If you want great Mexican food in uptown Charlotte, save yourself 25 minutes of being ignored and just go next door to Vida.
