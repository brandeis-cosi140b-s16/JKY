Being a that this is a new location I have held this review hoping service would get better. Unfortunately it hasn't! This is the fifth time I have come to this location, and each time I have had horrible customer service!!! And the food leaves something to be desired. The last time I ate here, I spoke to the manager who claims his hands are tied because after numerous complaints, corporate will not let him discipline or fire the problem employees. 
This concerns me greatly, if disgruntled employees are allowed to continue serving food, there's a pretty good chance they are doing something disgusting to mine!
I will never be back!

I feel that this town is plagued with entitled people who care little about customer service! hopefully out reviews will change that!
