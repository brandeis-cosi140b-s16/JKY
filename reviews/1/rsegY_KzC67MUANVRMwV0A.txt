Can't really comment on the food since we were never served after sitting at a table for 15 minutes with not a peep of service. It was not that busy, a waitress saw me grabbing menus from another table since nobody gave us any, and the waitresses were all walking around cluelessly as they ignored us. No drinks, no menus, no service = F- We left and ate Italian instead. Save your time and eat somewhere you'll be paid attention to.
