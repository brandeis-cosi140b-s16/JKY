We spent weeks trying to catch this place open. Tonight was the night. Come on folks....this was horrible. I cook Mexican better than this and wish I had and for those of you that think its better than Carolina's...I dont even know what to say. We ordered simple. The beans were tasteless and runny, not in a good way either. We will never go here again, ugh.
