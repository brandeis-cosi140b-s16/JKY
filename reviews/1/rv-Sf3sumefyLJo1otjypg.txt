Worst service I have ever gotten!! For a chained restaurant I would be embarrassed if I owned Gracias!! I walked in the hostess was very rude so I walked into the bar and sat in the bar for 15 minutes before  anyone came to greet me! The manager walked past me twice and didn't say a word plus other employees the poor old bartender you just feel bad for! There was only three other tables in the "cantina" area but he had no help just employees walking around talking to each other and the manager! It was very obvious I was a new customer in the big empty bar area! Never been so disappointed in a place haven't been to Gracias in forever and won't be back two tables sat dirty with dishes for over 30 minutes before someone came to clean them!!! Would not recommend this place to someone I hated! And I would fire the manager or whatever her position is walking around with keys bossing people around but can't make time to greet a customer seating for 15 minutes with no menu, drink, or a decent be with you in a few! never again and if I didn't feel bad for the bartender that is older then my parents I wouldn't have tipped:-( don't come her for the food or service!!!
