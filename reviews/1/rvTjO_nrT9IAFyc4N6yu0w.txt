If I could give no stars it would be more fitting. Ordered fajitas. Usually you get a nice sizzling plate of fajitas. Nope not here looks like they just cooked the fajitas put them on the skillet let them cool completely then brought them out. Not a sizzle or a hint of heat coming off the fajitas.  The beens were dry the rice was over cooked. My son ordered a beef bean and rice. Not a hard order however he got a beef burrito the beans and rice were no where to be found.  We brought this to our waiters attention he apologized and took it back. About two minutes later. He returned with the same half eaten burrito which they had opened up shoved some rice and beans in and attempted to wrap back into its original shape. I honestly almost lost it. Who does this. I've been in costumer service for over 20 years and have never seen this.  Needless to say my son tried to pick it up and it feel apart. I told the waiter he needed a whole new burrito cause this was just ridiculous. 
If they are willing to do this with the food can you imagine what short cuts they are willing to take in the casinos other restaurants and in the hotel rooms. 
Being a local and having come here on several occasions I can promise you this will be my last.
