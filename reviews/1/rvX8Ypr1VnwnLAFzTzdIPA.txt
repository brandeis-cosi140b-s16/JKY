The only highlight of this place is the staff. They do their best to make up for the horrible food, obnoxious music, & extremely lousy drinks. Their pricing is ridiculous, especially for the quality of microwavable food they serve.  Also, their "Free Appetizer" coupons are a joke. You get 6, yes exactly 6, chips with horrible nacho cheese over the top, that looks like it has been sitting for hours. Like I said, the staff is the only good thing about this place, other than that, stay away. For the same price point, you could easily go to a much nicer establishment that cares about what they serve to customers.
