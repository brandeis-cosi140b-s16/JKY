This place totally not a satisfying place. I mean... I've tried it more than once and yet they still keep messing up. Specially the lady at the counter, she is very rude and seems she doesn't enjoy her job. I mean; if this isn't the right job for you, perhaps you should move on and let others be a better employee. The place looks quite clean but the smell just doesn't feel right. You are more than free to try this place out but I warn you.. hold your breath while you are there.
