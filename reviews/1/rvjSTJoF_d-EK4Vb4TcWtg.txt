The refried beans tasted like a bottle of liquid smoke. They weren't very warm and no cheese on top. Gross. The Mexican rice was clumpy and flavorless. The queso tasted like grocery store brand that was microwaved. The chicken street tacos were okay except for the KFC coleslaw on top. The chips and salsa weren't bad, but not great either. The server was distracted and awkward. Not helped by the silence-no music due to the speakers being broken? The place was empty at 5pm on a Saturday. I won't be back.
