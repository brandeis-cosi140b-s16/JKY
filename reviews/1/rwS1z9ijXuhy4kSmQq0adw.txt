I love Taco Bell and go to the location by my house a lot... But I will never go back to this location!!! This place was slow as hell. I ordered in the drive through and it took over 30 mins to get my food. Ok so It must be fresh they had to make it all from scratch... Nope. Not only was my order wrong, but my hard tacos were falling apart cause the juice had saturated the corn to the point it was decomposing. Then when I went in to correct the issue they told me "that's just the way we make our tacos... Most people like when we put extra sauce on their tacos" this entire experience  took an hour and 5 minutes just to get the food I ordered. I will never be back to this location. I don't know how it is still in business.
