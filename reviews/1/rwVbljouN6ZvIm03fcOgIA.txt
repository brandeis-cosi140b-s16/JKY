I dont like to give bad ratings to businesses but this place is deserves a terrible rating! I have been here a 3 times, and everytime they have messed up on my order. Just Recently I stopped here for a quick bite to eat and I was throughly dissapointed in the service I recieved. The lady I dealt with was extremely rude. I would not recommend this place to anyone. This place delivers terrible customer service and below average mexican food. Don't waste your money on this place.
