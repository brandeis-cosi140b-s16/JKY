You're in Arizona what are you doing eating at a national Mexican Food chain. I did awhile back as I was given a gift card. If I were living in Idaho this place might be alright but there are so many far better choices in Arizona. The chips and salsa were ok but the plasti-cheese they use has to go. Does anyone think the ads for the Enchilada's look good?
