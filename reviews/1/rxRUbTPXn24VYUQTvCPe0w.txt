How this place is so loved and popular amongst so many in the Phoenix area astounds me. I love the idea of their food and hours they are open is awesome, but every time I have eaten at this low cost palace for late night cravings, I got real sick.

The food quality is low and the taste is nothing amazing. Either way certain conveniences about this establishment make it the ideal spot for high school and college kids so they will continue to thrive with little effort to providing quality.
