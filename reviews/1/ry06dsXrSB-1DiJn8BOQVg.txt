Worst place ever.  First took forever to take my order then once they took my order it disappeared.   I said i want my money back she's too busy trying to find my food.  I said it a second time she says well what did you order? Really and her attitude was the worst.  I get she didn't understand my English but since where in the US please understand your customers are always right.  I will never eat at that place again.  They need to train ppl basic customer service skills.  Nasty attitude to go along with filthy restaurant.   Should have never stopped.
