I ordered over the phone, lady spoke minimal English, and did not inform me it was cash pay only. I went in at 1:30 in the afternoon and waited in line for over 15 minutes only to get to the front and was told they couldn't take my card, no sign posted at all. Burrito was not hot and mediocre with way too much refrained beans, which I asked for half the amount. Won't be coming here again.
