Yuck. We just stopped here and it's terrible!!! I went several months ago and it was ehhh, ok but decided to give it a second chance and I am so disappointed. I ordered a #19 and it's completely inedible. The enchilada was so smashed I couldn't tell what it was and had a terrible sour after taste. Please avoid this place. Luckily I have a strong stomach but I wouldn't be surprised if someone gets food poisoning soon because the after taste is not natural.
