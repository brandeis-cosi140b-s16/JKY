Here's the deal....

I go to restaurants for two things -- food, and service.

The food at Blue Adobe Grill would get five stars. It was that good. As a former resident of Albuquerque (see, I even know how to spell it) I know what authentic New Mexico style food looks and tastes like, and this is the real deal. I had the Carne Adovado stacked enchiladas and they were delightful.

Sadly, horrific service can destroy a dining experience and the service here easily qualified as horrific. I was with the (prearranged) large group mentioned in a couple of other reviews. Once I was finally able to locate my own menu, and once the server reluctantly (and rudely) agreed to take our order, the food came relatively swiftly. I was disappointed that the fried egg I ordered was left off, but the server said he'd be right back with it. 

I never saw him again. 

The closest I came to getting the egg was on my check, where the cost was added in. Rather than wait for what would probably be another half an hour to get the check corrected, I just chalked it up as a loss and moved on. 

If you want good food and lousy service, come here. If you want both good New Mexico style food AND good service, try Los Dos Molinos in Mesa (very close by) or Carlsbad Taverns in Scottsdale.
