Sucks!!!! Food is tastelessness to the core.... Go to Taco Bell around the corner!! My friend and I stood on a stupid line like a jail cafeteria and the menu was just not clear... I just felt like I was going to be stripped searched... The best part was the drink bar!!! If someone is treating me and insisted on going i would consider going.... But would suggest something else first.... I hope they go out of business and a good restaurant takes its place!!!
