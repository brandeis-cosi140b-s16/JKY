Probably great for snow birds.  Had to wait 25 minutes to be seated.  5 hostesses is a bit much.  Cute outfits though.  Took a long time for server to come to take order.  Ok chips.  Bland and tasteless pureed salsa.  Asked for other salsas.  One was tomatillo and it was spicy but still bland somehow.  Other red one was just a bland.  Had cheese crisp.  It was alright.  Side of beans.  They were just alright.  Companion had carnitas.  VERY BLAND.  Rice was bland.  Service was slow and just alright.  Noticed a huge selection of tequila.  Didn't drink that night.  Did have fresh squeezed oj.  Pretty good.  Glad to have option of fresh squeezed.  Offer grapefruit too.  Looked like an interesting foo-foo drink menu.  Nice ambiance.  Music was annoying jazzy music that went on and on.  No variety.  Overall, the food is so boring and tasteless.  Reminds me of Maria Maria.  Not authentic Mexican food.  Made us think that this place is for snowbirds from midwest who don't know any better and aren't used to spicy or authentic.  They would probably love it.  Price is too much for the boring food.  Thought it was going to be good as you can see the chefs cooking while we waited to be seated.
