On 4/21/14 at around 7:43PM i tried to order two 99 cent burritos and add cheese. The cashier rung up the charge to a total of $7.  :(   The cashier is a moron who can't add math.    I informed him that it is Monday and on Monday there is 99 cent special for bean burritos.   He told me no, we no longer offer that.  Then i said" Just for today or for now on?   He said" Yes, no longer offer that for now on".    I looked at the table nearby and the 99 cent special is still on the coupon.    I walked out before i could start cussing him out.

 Description of cashier: Hispanic man Wearing a apron, hat and reading glasses hanging from his neck. No name tag on his shirt.

  Very bad customer service..  This same Cashier 4 weeks ago overcharged me by $3. i asked for the correct change and he gave me $2 more back.  I was so pissed at this point i just left. 


 I'm calling the manager of this restaurant to complain about this man. The manager should tell the man to change his ways or get fired.  Simple as that.

 As long as that cashier is still working at this restaurant i will not buy anything from them.
