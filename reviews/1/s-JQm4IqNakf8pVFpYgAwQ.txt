SCAM WARNING!!!! THEY WILL SELL YOUR ID!

A few years ago my (then) friend stole my ID since she was underage and I had just turned 21. I found out from mutual friends that she went to Sandbar at Desert Ridge on a Friday night and used my ID. The ID was confiscated because she apparently couldn't recall what the address was. 

When I found out about the incident, I figured Sandbar would do the responsible thing and turn it over to the authorities, contact me or shred it. 

Turns out, the security guard that took the ID had pocketed it and SOLD MY ID to one of their under aged friends!!!!! 

I contacted Sandbar with all the evidence and proof and they gave me the run around. I had been calling the manager daily for almost two weeks. I left voicemails and never received a call back or apology, they never owned up to selling my ID. I even came in with my father one morning 15 minutes before opening and was told the manager was "unavailable" to speak with me. 

I have not been back since and this was 3 years ago. I just want to warn others to stay away from this place. What they have done is ILLEGAL and I don't support UNETHICAL BUSINESS PRACTICES!
