We go to macayos a lot. Tonight was horrible! The chips tasted like old oil and had that dark color also. We had a table of 5 we got one basket of chips. The waiter was not friendly at all. He never smiled, every time I would ask for something or tell him something his response was OK as he was walking away. My food was only luke warm, the enchilada was the size of my pinky. My taco looked like a kids meal taco. My husband bean and cheese burrito was half the normal size. The waiter never even came back to see if everything was good or check on us.  I am not sure we will ever go back. What would be the point.
