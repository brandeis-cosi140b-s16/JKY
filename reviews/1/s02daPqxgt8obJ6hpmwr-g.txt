Not one of the better taco bells around.  It looks so beautiful, but they just fall a little short on food quality and service.  I've been here a few times and both times they put way too much sour cream in my burritos (burritos shouldn't be 1/3 sour cream... ewww), and were a little slow on the assembly times.  The staff just don't really seem to care about their jobs.  The first time I went their they guy making my food had his pants down to his knees, and although his shirt was long, it still didn't get down that far... not the guy I'd want making my food.  The other time, the staff were just smoking right outside the front door, which of course was blowing into the restaurant (you guys here about the smoke-free illinois act?).     

All-in-all, not so great.
