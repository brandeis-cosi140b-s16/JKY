Wowza!! Rock bottom honors. Worst in the universe, I'd rather eat dirt on Mars. One would have to be quite mentally and physically incapacitated to conjure this taco. Bitter black soft-shell, rendered un-ending by loads of cabbage like hay to masticate. Uncooked and unseasoned, hard black beans are paired with beef rendered lifeless as if washed in a laundry and beaten to pulp. Fly away, refuse to pay, someone say something this is an assault to all human sensibilities!!!
