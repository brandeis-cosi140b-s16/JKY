Wow, where to begin...So I show up about 30 minutes before closing.  As I walk in the door, I am greeted with a scowl by this miserable-looking woman working the register.  Her face read, "How rude of this customer to show up when we close in 30 minutes, we're pretty much closed already!" Before I am able to speak, she scowls further (didn't think that was even possible) and yells at the gentleman who ordered before me, "Hey! Don't walk over there it's already been mopped!" So now she turns back to me,  as i'm politely waiting with a smile on my face in hopes to brighten up her day.  My efforts were futile.  "Yea?" she asked (I guess that's her way of asking me what I want?).  I figured i'd go simple so not to cause this woman any further anger, so I politely asked for 2 chicken tacos. "We don't have a deep fryer so no tacos, anything else?" At this point I kindly said thank you, but I will be going elsewhere, have a great night.  I mean COME ON, how do you not have tacos when the name of your establishment is Elmer's TACOS, it's in the name for crying out loud!!!!  No way I will ever return to this place, you couldn't pay me to interact with or even look at that miserable woman again.  I HIGHLY suggest you stay away from this place!!!
