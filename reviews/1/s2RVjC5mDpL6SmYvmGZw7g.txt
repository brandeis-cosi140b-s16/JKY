This place was the worst bar/club I have EVER been to. Worst experience ever. I went on a Friday night and it is way too packed. No room to dance, let alone walk! Everyone was pushing and shoving & it took me 3 tries to get into the bathroom. The line was ridiculously long & on top of that you would have to wait once you got inside too. Some of the people there are just plain rude and tried cutting in front of people multiple times. That was my first time and definitely is my last.
