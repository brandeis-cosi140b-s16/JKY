I was so happy cafe rio was in summerlin. First day I go there with my son and the girls for my order all wrong. Kids quesadilla and a salad but ok first week opening I figured they are new but the one girl who finishes the orders before the cashier has the worst attitude ever!!!!!! I love the food so I come again a few weeks later. Same girl same stink attitude!! Cashier was rude too. So I love the food but I'll never come here again.
