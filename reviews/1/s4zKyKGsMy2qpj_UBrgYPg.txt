this place sucks!! they take forever. i got there and was waiting to be seated when someody finally came and asked how big was the party i said 2 and if u have a booth available (which they did) she said okay let me finish cleaning this one for you. i was on my lunch break and i let her know i went to the restroom when i came back somebody was sitting at my table and i had to wait for a couple more mins. after 15 mins the server finally came to take our drinks and we let him know that we were ready to order he said give me just a second. he took everyone elses order and filled up everybody else's drinks until i called him over and said excuse me ive been sitting here im on my lunch break you just keep walking past me. yet he still made me wait another 5 mins he finally came i had 10 mins of my lunch i told him just put it in a to go box please. another 10 mins and i was late back to work.

oh and can't forget how i only got 2 things out of everything i ordered yet i got charged for everything!! way to go Sylvia's!
