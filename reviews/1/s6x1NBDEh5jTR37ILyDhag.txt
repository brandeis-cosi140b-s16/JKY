Pancho's is great if you like eating dog shit.  This was honestly some of the worst food I have ever eaten, or attempted to eat. All, I MEAN ALL, of the food is frozen and tasteless. The enchiladas were smothered in a sour tasting sauce that undoubtably came from a can. The taquitos were inedible, you would find better ones at the gas station. The tamales were unexplainably bad. To add to the wonderful dining experience at Pancho's, the clientele is fat, morbidly obese, diabetics who shovel mountains of this god awful food from their plate to their mouths. You couldn't pay me to eat here again!
