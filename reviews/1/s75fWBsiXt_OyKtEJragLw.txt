Okay, yes, a decent salsa bar, but everything else was sub-par. First of all, we waited FOREVER for everything and it was so not a peak time or that busy. And the food; ohh boy. Maybe I misread the menu, but where I'm from carne asada enchiladas doesn't mean premade cheese enchiladas with a few overcooked strips of steak on top. It came with a small portion of beans and rice that I gobbled down quickly. The meal followed a super boring, hardly edible salad that I took two bites of and pushed aside. The house dressing was of a watery tomatoey variety. But yeah, the enchiladas were pretty tasteless, especially for $14.99. 

My boyfriend was appalled that his taco shells were soggy and there was like 4 pieces of shredded cheese atop sad pieces of chicken. He commented that we could have made much better tacos at home. Never again. 

The other Mexican restaurant in this casino, the counter service one, is actually good, just a tip! Go there!
