Had a gift certificate here so we decided to try it out - the bean & cheese dip was bland and the cheese was shredded, not even melted.  The waiter was not very helpful and questioned everything we asked for.  For my meal, I ordered the Pollo Fundido, which was sub par with overly dry chicken in the center.  My boyfriend ordered the Mini Many More which consisted of mini chimis, mini tacos, mini tostadas.... The outside was soggy, the meat on the inside was dry, guac was very scary looking... 

For how much food you receive in a order (even for the appetizers) it's such a disappointment to look at how much goes to waste, all because it's so bland & boring... We kept commenting on how disappointed Chef Ramsey would be if he ever came to visit, not to mention our surprise at how X-Tapa's has stayed in business in such a high-end neighborhood.
