I wanted to like this place. I walked in and was excited to see what looked like some amazing tacos and what was clearly an awesome beer selection. But after receiving our food, our tacos were bland and flavorless. They needed salt. Something very basic.

But I was willing to try it again later, because I thought maybe I just didn't order the right thing. But then I tried to buy some beer to take home that night which the guy that originally took our order said would be fine. As I am picking out a beer another guy appears behind me and says "We can't sell that beer." I say "Why not?" "Because it is hard to get and we only have four left." I was understandably confused. "That doesn't make any sense, but alright." I didn't feel like arguing. 

If they want to save that beer for themselves, fine! But don't have it on display in your cooler for customers to see and then deny them when they want to give you money for it.  

I was going to come back and try the food again even though it was disappointing. But after the beer incident I will never go back and I was prompted to write a bad review on Yelp.
