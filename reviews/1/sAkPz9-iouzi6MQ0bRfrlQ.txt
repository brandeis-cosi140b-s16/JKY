Food was pretty bad. Over cooked chicken, and the ingredients did not seem fresh.  The restaurant was  dirty with BUGS crawling all over a wall by the kitchen. I was told that they had recently switched their pest control company. You might not need pest control if your restaurant was clean. I like hole in the wall restaurants, greasy spoon so I am not turned off by a little grit but this places food was bad, and it just felt super dirty  and the Bugs grossed us out. I did not finish my meal. We will not be back.
