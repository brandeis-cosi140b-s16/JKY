This location has really gone downhill. Whoever runs the grill really needs to be retrained by corporate. Last three visits chicken has literally been black. Not just a bit overcooked but completely black and disgusting on both sides. Whenever I bring it back to have it replaced staff acts like I'm being such an inconvenience even rolled their eyes at me once. The last time I complained about it they told me I should check the chicken before I leave to see if it's burnt? Really? I don't feel it's my responsibility to make sure it's not black burnt and disgusting. Mashed potatoes were literally soup. Go to other locations they are much better wish there was another one closer to me.
