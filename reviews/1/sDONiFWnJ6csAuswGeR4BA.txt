I absolutely hate this place.  Don't come here and plan to visit the guests you're with.  It's loud, the bar was sticky, the bartender wasn't friendly.  My $10 Patron marg, was terrible.  Every time someone wants to meet up there, I have to be the b*tch and recommend someplace else.  Like the other reviewer, Melanie, said , it was too disorganized, too loud, sloppy food etc.  It's a meat market no matter your age.
