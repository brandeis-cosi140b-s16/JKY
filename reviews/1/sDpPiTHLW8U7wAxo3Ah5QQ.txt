Shitty burrito served by an angry old hippy.  I asked if the guac had onions, and he answered "yeah, but you can't taste it!" to which I replied "then why's it there" and then he said "for flavor, but you can't taste it"  then said angry old hippy talked smack about me to his coworker while I was still in earshot.  Worst burrito ever made by someone who honestly doesn't dig his job.  He lacked customer service, a sense of humor and the ability to whisper.  Fuck you old hippy & fuck you blue burrito!
