Terribly disappointed that the service has gotten so bad, we will no longer be making this our preferred family night out place. Took a friend here and the kids a few weeks ago to show this friend "our place" we love so much. Waiter was absolutely horrible. No drink refills, sat part of our fajitas in front us of for 15 minutes before he returned with our kids food! Then finally returned with one kids  plate. Had to go back for other. We were still missing toppings and tortillas for fajitas and had to sit there for another 25 minutes with no silverware no tortillas and no toppings just staring at sizzling plate of meat! When the waiter finally returned and I let him know how rude that was, he decided not to return to refill drinks and to let heaping piles of plates stack up and to not even return to give us the bill. So after waiting another 45 minutes we decide we are going to leave and tell the hostess that we will pay the manager. The manager implied that this happens all the time with this guy , gave us our meal for free. And let us know that this guy will be on corrective action, which by the way they're not supposed to tell customers but okay thanks. Fast forward to my husband and I actually taking the kids there again thinking that was just one bad experience, and they sat us in a section right by Mr. wonderful waiter. I made sure to let the hostess know we did not want him serving us again as he was horrible to us last time. So we get to wait for another waiter for about 15 minutes Who suffers from resting b face and acts like it's a task to wait on us. Meanwhile Mr. wonderful waiter And his bus boy friend are walking by and laughing and staring The entire duration of our meal. As were walking by the hostess counter on our way out, mr. wonderful is in a gossip corner with them and actually turns to me and says have a nice day and laughs. We will not be returning and apparently manager did nothing with this guy the first time.
