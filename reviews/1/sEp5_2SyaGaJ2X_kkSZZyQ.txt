The staff was not very friendly or attentive.  The chili relleno was disgusting.  To start, it is the LAZY way to make one.  All it was was an omelet, very thick, with a half of a poblano in it that tasted old frozen.  The taco with it had good meat, but the shell was soggy on the bottom from sitting on top of the other items on the plate and it was "anemic" looking.  This was my first and LAST time there.
