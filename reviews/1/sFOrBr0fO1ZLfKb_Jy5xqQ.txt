AAAHHHH!!!   Don't waste your money here! 

When we went on a Wednesday night the place was empty, no music, no laughing....  the atmosphere was severely lacking. 

I ordered a shredded beef taco, chicken enchilada with green sauce, and rice and beans.  Ugh... the shredded beef was too thick and unseasoned (and left a bad after taste), the chicken enchilada had weird cubed chicken inside (was topped with sour cream, what?!)  and the green sauce lacked in flavor and tasted like it was full of fat.  Even the rice and beans were bland!    

Also, this place is way too pricey for a little hole in the wall mexican food joint.  For 2 people (ordering water and no appetizers) we spent $24!!

Ahhhh!  Honestly, Filiberto's would have been better!!  Yikes!
