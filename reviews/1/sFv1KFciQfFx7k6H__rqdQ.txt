Went here to show them off to family and I was embarrassed at what kind of service they provide. I know that they are a family ran restaurant but they need to seriously rethink how the train their staff. They have the tools (iPad pos systems for the severs) yet they lack the simple service standards that anyone would expect from a restaurant with standards set in place. The server was flustered with 3 tables and forgot that we hadn't ordered yet even though our menus were closed and on the side of the table, this place needs someone who can implement rules and standards that will show their food justice. BOH...keep up the good work, FOH crew please get some more training on how to properly run a floor and serve tables.
