My husband and I walked into this place and the 3 girls that greeted us were trying, like, forever to figure out where to seat us.  I mean "Hello!" the place is totally empty!!  I think a few of their noggins were kind of empty as well but - hey, who am I to judge!??

We finally get seated outside and there is like one other couple in this whole place.  They should rename it Not-soHappy Hour??  We ordered margaritas and they were okay.  Chips and salsa were ok too -- not hot and nothing extraordinary here.  We ordered an appetizer and the food was just really mediocre.

Folks -- save your hard earned money and go somewhere else, heck anywhere else.  The Pink Taco smells like TUNA!!
