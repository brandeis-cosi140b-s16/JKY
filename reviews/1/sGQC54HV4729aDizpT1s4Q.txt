Their food used to be excellent, but now it's awful.  I don't know exactly when it changed, but I would say approx 6 months ago.  Possibly a change in ownership, because I don't see the same people anymore.  The last 2 times I went there, the food was just horrible.  I tried one more time, and the beans they gave me were grey.  Seriously....grey.  It cost over $10 for an enchilada & a grey bean tostada.  I will not be going there again unless I hear that it went back to the way it was.
