My daughter and I ate there for the first time...She had mold on her tortilla.  We quietly brought it to the attention of a server...A manager came and made every excuse in the world of why it was not mold...She never offered to comp the meal or at least the tortilla...She just kept telling us that she did not actually know what mold looked like...Well I am a mom...I have seen a moldy tortilla. I could not finish my meal.  Her lack of care is the reason of such a low rating...accidents occasionally happen...but we will never ever be back.  The Manager had such a lack of training ...We will tell everyone we know of our horrible experience! I do want to ad that our server was really nice and so was the young lady who took our order...I seriously would have fired that manager on the spot!
