Do not go here!! Worst restaurant experience I've ever had!!

My boyfriend and I wanted to go to Earl of Sandwich, but when the line was too long we didn't want to wait so we decided to give Yolos a try. Worst decision EVER! When we got there the restaurant was empty and it was 12:30 which is prime time for restaurants. While that should have been a red flag we decided to give it a try anyway. When we were seated the hostess warned us that the waiter would take a while to get to us which I didn't understand because they weren't busy at all. Turns out she was right and we didn't get any service for a good 10 minutes. We thought about leaving but unfortunately stayed because the lunch special was in our budget.    When we finally ordered, our drinks didn't come out for another 10 minutes. The salsa was alright but not very spicy. I ordered the tamales and my boyfriend ordered the burrito-both on the lunch menu for $9 each. My tamales had barely any chicken and tasted bland, the rice had absolutely no flavor, and the black beans tasted like they were from a can. Not to mention the temperature of the food was scorching hot so I could barely eat it at first. My boyfriend stopped eating midway through his meal because he lost his appetite and he is quite the foodie. His burrito steak tasted like pot roast and there was no spice whatsoever. Burritos are not supposed to taste like pot roast people! GROSS! Our server was very polite but he was busy waiting on the entire restaurant by himself so service was extremely slow. 

The only positive thing I have to say about this place is that the drink menu is illuminated which is pretty cool, and it has a hip vibe but looks can be deceiving! I was born and raised in Texas so I know how good Mexican food tastes like and this food is very far from it.

Bottom line is don't go here unless you want slow service and bland food.
