Terrible service. I arrived for lunch and no one came to greet even though a loud chime sounded. I waited for 8mins and when I asked a waitress for assistance she looked as if I had just asked her to say the alphabet backwards in under 4seconds. If there is an understaffing issue, people need to be prepared to be more attentive to multiple zones.
