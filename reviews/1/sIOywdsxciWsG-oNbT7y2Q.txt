To be fair, the staff was awesome. But as for the food, luckily I had a credit with Groupon, or else I would have been pissed had we paid cash for this place. 

The order (Take out, 11 am 2/22/12):

3 tacos (1 Queso Fundido, 1 Barbacoa, 1 Chicken)
1 Barbacoa Torta

Total - Free (would have been $15.30 if I had not had a Groupon)

Results:

The Queso Fundido taco was pretty good. Full of flavor and something very different than the "usual". 

The remaining two taco's and the torta were soggy (dripping wet is more like it), so much so that the torta's bun, and both the tacos fell apart and stuck to the tin foil it was in. The worst part was that they were very bland, and by bland, I mean no flavor whatsoever. When I think of Mexican (even what is to be considered Mexican-style) food, I think of all of the different flavors and textures, spicy, sweet, crisp, crunchy! There was none of that here. 

Final thoughts:

Sorely disappointing and will NOT be going back here. If you want great Mexican food in the downtown area, I would recommend La Tolteca. If you want decent food, try Chico's Tacos. Heck, I would recommend Taco Bell over this place.
