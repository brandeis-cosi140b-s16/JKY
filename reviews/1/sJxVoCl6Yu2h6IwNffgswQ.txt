I was a staunch supporter of this place the first few years it was open. Even closed it down a few nights with friends and the staff. Over the past year, it's plummeted down hill. I posted a pic of s bug that was in my drink. The server could care less. Not even an apology. I'd like to say this is an isolated incident, but the previous time I was here, I had the same terrible service (from the same server mind you). There's too many choices in Pittsburgh to waste my time coming back. Wish Gran Agave the best of luck in turning things around.
