So good they don't need your business. They must be. I'm afraid I couldn't tell you. I looked them up Sunday evening and called to see when they closed. After being told 9pm, my girlfriend and I drove 8 miles just to walk in and be told they were closed. It was 7:45! Sorry, but that bears repeating. It was 7:45! The open sign was still on and the sign on the door clearly stated that they close at 10pm el Domingo. So unless Domingo has come to mean something other than Sunday since I studied Spanish, their open sign lacks an off switch or the restaurant exists in some Einsteinian time warp, they turned down paying customers hours before closing time. I'll leave it to you to decide which is more likely. I for one, will take my money somewhere it's actually appreciated.
