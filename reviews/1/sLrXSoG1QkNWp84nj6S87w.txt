The food here is pretty good but horrible service. We went for lunch on Monday and stopped in about 11:15. After ordering one person waited 50 minutes for their lunch. The table next to us waited just as long. 

We asked where our food was each time the waitress came by and they said there was a problem. After asking the 4th time and asking to speak to a manager, they said the manager was busy. 

If you don't mind waiting 50 plus minutes for lunch this is the place for you.
