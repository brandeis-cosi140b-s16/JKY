Are you frickin kidding me?  Have a reservation for 9 and they keep us waiting half an hour.  Go to the bar and order 2 margaritas with salt on the rocks - cost? $30.  Ask for an IPA and they bring me a clone of Stella Artois for $14. (And not a good clone at that).  Overpriced, overrated and just OK food.  Save the money, the time, and your effort - go somewhere else. And then we got the food... No problem paying big money for food... But hey - that sucked too.  Just about every Bistec taco from a taco wagon has been better.  Am I bitter?  Heck yeah. Am I wrong? Ummm no.
