Read the reviews and had hopes for this place, which is fairly close. All I can say is "YUCK!" Ordered a cheese enchilada and it was a cold unflavorful lump of cheese in a greasy, stale thick tasteless shell. Are you kidding me? Bland rice and beans. Others in our party ordered chicken tacos and found them to be about the same as my enchilada- substitute gross lump of dry flavorless chicken. The only happy person in our party was a ten year old who had ordered the fish tacos. He liked them, because, he said, they tasted like fortune cookies!
