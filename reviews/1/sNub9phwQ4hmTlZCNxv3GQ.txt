So - I've given this some thought. The food was okay - not spectacular but not awful. The service as well was okay - borderline marginal. The reason for the 1 star review is the waitress took it upon herself to add a 22% tip to my bill. Now, I'll leave a tip - even for marginal service - but I don't appreciate being dictated how much I should leave. A tip is something I give freely - not something the server determines. If the service had been exceptional, I likely would have left a 20% tip - it wasn't so I was going to leave 15%. Needless to say, I won't be going back.
