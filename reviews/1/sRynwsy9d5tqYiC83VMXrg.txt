Came in today for lunch and waited 36 minutes in line. I know specifically how long because I took a phone call when I walked in and when I finally got to the front looked back to see when it was. The staff was not trained properly but no one was on the line directing them, they definitely had enough hands just not using them to their advantage. I.e. 3 people on toppings and 1 setting up tacos/tortillas. The girl would never use the second warmer she would wait for the first tacos to be warm before starting another. This was the biggest reason why it took so long to get through the line. I watched people walk out. After all that wait I wanted a grilled fish taco and had to wait again because it came from the back. The barrier is too high and you had to yell over it and repeat what you wanted so they could hear you. I also ordered a carnitas taco and the carnitas meat was very dry and chewy like it sat on the line for too long. I know they are new so I will try again in a few months but they need to get it together... And quick.
