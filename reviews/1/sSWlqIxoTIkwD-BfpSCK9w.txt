The menu items and prices shown here is old, they raised their prices this month.  All their breakfast burritos are expensive at $4.99 and they're smaller.  The food is very good depending who's cooking in the back.  The owner-manager cooks way better than that older woman who occasionally cooks, she makes the burritos smaller and the beans "runny."  I use to love their egg and cheese burrito but it's expensive too.  I wanted to give them 4 stars but since prices went up I have to be honest.  There are other restaurants who charged higher prices for everything else but not the egg & cheese burrito.  As far as the potato, egg, and cheese burrito, I don't like theirs because they don't peel the skin off of it so I get that burrito elsewhere.  Now I've stopped getting their bean burritos on Mondays because it stopped being good and they're smaller. They're getting greedy like Mixteca and Carolina's and the only entr√©e I like at Mixteca is their fish tacos.  For months since my brother told me about this restaurant how good their burritos and soup are, but they are greedy now.  The photos are exaggerated, they are smaller and too pricey.
