I'm sitting here still waiting on my burrito after 20 minutes. Eggs potatoes and cheese. No one really seems to know what's going on. The bathroom smells horrible. Other people are going up to the counter asking where their orders are. 3 people that came in after me with larger orders ended up getting out of there before me. This was the last time here. My mother inlaw likes to stop in here before we hit the road for Tucson. We have to find another place.
