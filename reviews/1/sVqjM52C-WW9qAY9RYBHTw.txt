This place totally sucked!

When I first walked in, it seemed okay, but when I went to the restroom to wash my hands, there were filthy paper towels all over the place and it was just disturbing. 

I didn't let that get to me because I figured maybe they just didn't clean it after a huge crowd came in or something lame.

So we ordered the taco salad special (which was way overpriced), chips and salsa and the Carnitas plate. The chips were totally saturated with oil, The Carnitas was disturbing with all the grease at the bottom of the plate and it cost way too much.

The chick behind the counter didn't seem interested, even forgot to give us our cup for the soft drink machine. 

Definitely two thumbs down. Save yourself a bunch of money and find a roving taco truck, less heartburn from grease and more bang for your buck.
