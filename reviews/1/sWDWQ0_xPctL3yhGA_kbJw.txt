Pretty awful. Ordered takeout and was not impressed. The hostess answering the phone was rude as well. Went to pick up the order, two out of the three girls were friendly. I'm assuming the bitchy one took the order. I ordered the grease bowl....I mean chicken enchiladas. It was so greasy it looked more like enchilada soup.  My wife ordered some tacos. She wasn't really impressed either. I've had manuel's before it never was this terrible before.  It's a shame this location sucks so bad seeing as though it is so close to me. Looks like Valle Luna from now on.
