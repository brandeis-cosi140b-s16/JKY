All Lindo Michoac√°n's are NOT created equal.  In fact, of the three I've visited recently, this is by far the worst.  We were greeted with burned chips, bitter salsa and tasteless beans.  When I insisted the burned chips be replaced, we got greasy salt free chips.  The two margaritas we ordered had a horrible aftertaste - like rotten limes - undrinkable!  We had no less than six servers come to take our order.  The steak fajita had almost no steak and was $19 for nothing.  The Red Snapper was quite good, but the sauce was as yucky as the salsa, bitter and not very spicy.  There were only four or five cars in the parking lot, which should have been my clue that this place was not up to snuff and it wasn't.  Don't waste you hard earned money at this location.  The other two, DI and Henderson are much better!
