Here we go. Maybe it has been a while for me hanging out in Tempe. But I will start with this... Paper plates? That just doesn't seem right for a Mexican restaurant. Also, I asked the server for a napkin and she brought me a stack of cocktail napkins. And the chips sure seemed like some kind of Doritos to me. The salsa was ok. I asked if they have multiple choices for salsa and nope just one. I ordered the chicken tacos they were ok. But phoenix market has been flooded lately with tacos shops and burger shops and these tacos were nothing to brag about. Service was good . Server was good. Bunch of tv's looked good. Probably wont go back.
