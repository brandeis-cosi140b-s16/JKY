I would give them zero stars if I could!!  64 minutes in the drive through line!!!  When we got to the window and told the girl she said "oh you should have came in we didn't have a line inside at all".  Does she realize how stupid that was, you are a fast food place with a drive through, basically you all don't know how to manage your business and the flow of your customers!!  We won't be back
