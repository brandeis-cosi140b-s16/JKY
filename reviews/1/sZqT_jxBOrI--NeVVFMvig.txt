I haven't been to this restaurant since the 90's and I don't think they have ever cleaned it.  It was completely filthy when we walked in.  You could feel germs everywhere.  I was with a large group so we couldn't leave.  I dediced to order food.  
Being a native from Arizona, this is probably the worst Mexican food ever.  And the Asian thing?  I think the only Asian was teriyaki chicken and the rice.  Surprisingly, the place had a nice crowd.  I honestly don't think these customers really know what Mexican/Asian food is or what it can be.  
This is a complete thumbs down.
