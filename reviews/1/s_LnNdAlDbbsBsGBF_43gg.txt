We were the fifth car in the drive-thru line.  It took 30 minutes for us to get our food.  It was unbelievable.  Even more frustrating is that once we got to the window, we sat there for 10 minutes while we watched them serve three inside guests.  I think this is because once you're in the drive-thru lane, there's no way out.  Since they know you can't leave, they don't give a shit how long it takes to get your food.

It literally became night while we were waiting for our food.  I will never go back to this Taco Bell again.
