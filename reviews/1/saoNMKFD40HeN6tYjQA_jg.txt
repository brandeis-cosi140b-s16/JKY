HORRIBLE!!! We were staying at the LVH (that's another low rating) and went to the "happy hour". I ordered the margarita and I couldn't even drink it! It was so sour! The so called appetizers were half off during the "happy" hour. We ordered the nachos and quesidilla. These were served with plastic plates and plastic forks!! Really? Vince, you should be ashamed to have your name on this place! I could get better nachos at a ball park! The runny canned cheese was watery and the meat was most likely microwaved. The chips were just like the huge cheap bag you get at Costco. I asked for water and was served a small plastic cup of ice water. We ate a few bites of the quesidilla and nachos and had to hunt down the waitress to pay! The waitress was inattentive too. The only reason this is getting a 1 star is for the cool decor! I do not recommend this place or the hotel LVH. This place should be featured on Restaraunt Impossible!
