I ordered a burrito with chorizo, potatoes, cheese and with no egg! I was very specific when I made this order. Being Hispanic I ordered it in Spanish. They still got my order wrong. The burrito came with egg and potatoes only. 

The upsetting part was the ticket was correct. The cook in the back doesn't give a dam about what you want in the food. 

The funny part is that you can add language barrier, but when the orders are made with perfect Spanish there is no excuses. 

Fist and last time I will purchase any food from this place.
