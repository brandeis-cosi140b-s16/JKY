I went to this location the other night and the sprinkler next to the order menu in the drive thru magically started spraying into my window when I pulled up. And the guy at the window just happened to know about it when I pulled up to tell him. Then after I fed my kids the crap they gave me. They have had the runs since. If you don't want to do your job right. Dont. Quit so someone who wants to work can do it. I won't be going there again.
