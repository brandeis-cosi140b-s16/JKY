We were really looking forward to liking this place. We live in the neighborhood and have been meaning to try it out. So tonight I read some Yelp! reviews which sounded promising. The listing said they were open until 10pm. I called Leticia's at 8:30pm to double-check their closing time (this IS Vegas 2011 afterall). "10pm" the lady told me. We arrived at the restaurant at 9:30pm only to find the "closed" sign up and the staff sweeping the floors. I spoke to a lady and reminded her that they had just told me 10pm and she shrugged. So we took our business to nearby Lindo Michoacan who stay open until the hours posted on their sign. We won't be back. What a shame...
