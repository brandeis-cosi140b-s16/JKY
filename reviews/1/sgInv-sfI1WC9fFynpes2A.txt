Doing their best to be the world's slowest Chipotle, and are clearly real contenders for the title.

The line behind us was out the door by the time we left. Of the nine employees I was able to spot, only one was actually waiting on customers. At one quarter speed, stopping to talk with other employees, and at one point, take a phone call. When, after over twenty minutes (din't think to check my watch till we'd already waited a few minutes), he'd only waited on five people (ok, he was starting on number six) we walked out. I'm guessing the folks at the end of the line, outside, will be having breakfast there tomorrow.
