The upstairs patio bar is BEAUTIFUL! However, the atmosphere doesn't mean a thing when the bar is the worst customer service I have ever experienced on the strip. I am a local who has lived in the valley for over 15yrs and of all my experiences on the strip or else where, this is by far the worst. I can respect paying premium prices for cocktails on the strip, but with it I expect great customer service and quality. The bartenders here are the rudest I have ever encountered and I will never return to this bar. Experience it for yourself, you will regret paying extreme prices for horrible and rude service.
