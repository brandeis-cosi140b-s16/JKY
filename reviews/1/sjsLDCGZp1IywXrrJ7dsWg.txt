Bad food, worse service.  Their carne asada looks suspiciously like ground beef, especially since it is mixed with diced peppers and onions.  When I brought this up, the extremely inattentive server, Alicia, told me that's how it comes.  It was also greasy and overcooked.  The guacamole was tasteless and brown....  while it was taken off my bill, at my request,  not even the vaguest sense of concern was offered about my being unhappy enough to send it back.  I would have said something to Alicia about how I was very unhappy about my whole meal, but she never asked.  She hid out in the server station 12 feet away.  30 minutes later, after one reluctant soda refill, no offer of chips or salsa, and a cold plate of food with 3 1/2 bites taken still in front of me, I debated asking to speak with the manager.  I decided against it.  If a server completely fails to notice when someone is very obviously displeased, or even ask, I seriously doubt I would receive much help from the mgmt.  

I will never return to La Fonda.
