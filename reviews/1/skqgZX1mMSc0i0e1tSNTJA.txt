Worst chipotle location ever. 
Rude employees, slow line, ALWAYS out of something you have to wait for and if I have to say "more please" one more time I'll scream. They always under portion the meat and forget to give you the drink you ordered.
The only reason I come here is cause it's literally right across the street from where I live.... :/
