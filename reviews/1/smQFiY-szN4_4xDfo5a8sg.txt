When I came here a couple of weeks ago my experience was terrible. Not everyone gets a hour for lunch. I get 30mins. The cashier was taking so long I walked out because by this time I was 15 mins into my lunch and hadn't even reached the counter. The cashier was leaning all on the counter like time is not of essence for working folk on their lunch break. I could have went to Popeyes and gotten better service than this....and a lot quicker too!!!
