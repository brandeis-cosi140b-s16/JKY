I took my kids to Joyride for dinner last night and ended up with terrible food poisoning. All I ate was the complimentary chips and salsa and then the Sidewalk Surfer Chilaquiles, which was far too saucy. It looked like a big soupy mess on the plate. Almost immediately after I finished, I was hit with excruciating stomach cramps. I could barely pay the bill, and the drive home was agony. I spent the next half hour vomiting. I felt a little better after that, but my stomach is still tender this morning. I will not be going back, 
On a side note, the salsa was extremely spicy (and I like spicy food, but this was insanely hot), and we expressed this to the server, but she didn't offer us a milder alternative. I see from other reviews that other patrons have been offered milder versions, so I don't know why we weren't given the same degree of service.
