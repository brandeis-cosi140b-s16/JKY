We spent 40mins online using the order form going thru one by one each persons order because no one in store is apparently capable of taking an order.

After all that, we pick up the food.

So let me make sure everyone understands this. We spent 40 mins filling out an order form to ensure everyones order is correct.  Not one order out of 14 is correct. 

These people who work here simply do not care for you, your food or service.

Thank you guys for ruining our lunch and making my crew extremely pissed off.
