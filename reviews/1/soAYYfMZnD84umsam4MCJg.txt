Very disappointed won't ever eat here again!  First of all no spicy Mexican food!  I asked if they had some jalape√±os or Serrano Chili's on side as I like Spice.  They don't?  What Mexican restaurant doesn't have fresh Chili's?  Beans tasted like they were half real and half Rosarita!  The rice cooked in oil to fast never puffed and flowered and was cooked with way to much tomato Sauce and not enough consume!    Their menu says on some pages "Para Gringos". Well some gringos that don't know true Mexican food might love it!  This Gringa. Has her own Molcajeta and was very disappointed!  Salsa is made with canned whole tomatoes and was below average!  Won't eat here again!  They did have a help wanted sign on window?  Possibly looking for a cook?
