I got food poisoning last night from eating at this location. Been up all night sick.  A friend of mine got sick from eating at the downtown  at the location. Something is up with those grills.  Sorry, but I feel I need to post for the safety of others. Needles to say I won't be going back. Such a shame. I loved that place. Careful.
