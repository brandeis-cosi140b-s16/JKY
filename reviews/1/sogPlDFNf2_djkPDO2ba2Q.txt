We hadn't been there in a few years. Got 2 seats at the bar for dinner and drinks. I needed to use the ladies room first. Glad I did. Gag much? Filthy is an understatement. If you like to see feces, overflowing toilets (all of them) and wet, nasty, floors and sinks. Ran out of there, told my hubby let's go. It took 15 minutes for him to pay for the overpriced beer. It wasn't busy. Never going back, unless we feel like having a bowl of e-coli or hepatitis. Found a better, clean place after that unpleasant experience. Wonder if the staff washes their hands. Doesn't matter - never going back.
