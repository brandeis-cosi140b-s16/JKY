Poor service!!! It took 45 minutes to get our food, our waitress did not get our orders right and argued with us about it!!! We had to continuously ask for refills. What kind of customer service is that!!! She might of got it right if she wrote our order down. Even after we reodered, my sister's food still wasn't right!!! We were there for over a hour waiting for our correct order. That's ridiculous! When we asked for a manager we were told the manager was on vacation so we talked with the lady in charge who was rude, accused us of trying to get a free meals which was not the case! Very disrespectful people working there. The only time the waitress apologized was when we were paying the check, trying to still get her tip. We will keep calling until we speak to the manager no matter how long it takes! If you don't like your job find something else because this industry does not fit you ladies, I'm not going to name drop although I really want too. Get it together!!!! Make sure you put someone in charge who is respectful when you're on vacation management!
