My wife and I went to this dive shortly after it opened.  We didn't have very high expectations, but we still left disappointed and disgusted.  We have a few simple rules for any restaurant: 1. Reasonably clean, 2. Reasonable prices, 3. Decent portions, 4. Decent service, 5. Decent food.  Is this too much to ask of an establishment that you are giving your hard-earned money to serve you?  It shouldn't be.  Dos Amigos failed ALL of these basic criteria with flying colors.  We will NEVER return here!  The only way you will return here (if you go at all) is if you're a glutton for punishment.  Anyone who gives this place a favorable review has no taste buds and extremely low standards for restaurants, or are very lazy if you live close by (we do).

The decor was barren.  Bare walls.  Mono colored tables & chairs. Floor & walls looked grungy.  Tables & chairs felt grimey.  Dank, dark--abysmal.  Service-slow.  Staff-zombies.

My burrito looked as if it had fallen on the floor and then been scooped up and re-served.  It didn't even smell like Mexican food.  Tasted like bland dirt.  How can beans have NO flavor at all?  Where are the spices, man?  Is this a Mexican place or a British tea house?  My iced tea was more like old dishwater.  My wife's selection fared little better, and her Coke was flat.  Rice not much tastier than the beans.  C'mon people-is this the best you can do?  How do you hope to stay in business?  Do yourself (and your digestion) a favor and SKIP this place.  There are WAY better Mexican places out there, cheaper too.  Simply awful.  Even Taco Bell has this place beat, by a mile!
