Let's face it, this is fast food.  This Taco Bill/KFC location is one of the worst I've been to.  I go 4 - 5 times per year since it's close to work.  Usually find the place a little dirty and the service slow - at least it's consistent.  I think they stopped putting any type of sauce in their Bean Burritos and the chicken soft tacos are lacking enough filling - meat, lettuce, cheese, tomatoes, etc to even come close to filling the shell.  

I've started going to the one near 19th/Deer Valley for a slightly better experience.
