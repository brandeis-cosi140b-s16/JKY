Horrible service!!! 88 degrees inside with fans everywhere. What appeared to be the owner. A fat guy sitting drinking beer, eating and playing videos on his phone. He just sat there staring doing nothing. Very unprofessional. Waitress served me the wrong dish. I didnt complain and ate it anyways. She then billed me for both and wanted to argue that I ate both of them. Never again! Needs to go out of business!
