If I could give negative stars I would. I bought my assistant a gift card yesterday only to find out these employees pulled a switch, and swapped my gift card for a random employee card the manager claims the employee "threw" my live gift card "away", I doubt it. Luckily I kept my receipt and was with my assistant when he came to use the card. These people are shady. Be careful!!!!I'm concerned because their employee was staring at my credit card longer than average. My assistant and I went today and the employees tried to make us leave with out seeing a manager, but I'm persistent. When the manager came she tried to resolve it . I wanna press charges. This location is horrid. Be careful!!!!
