This place is horrible.  Twice now, gave it a second chance and still bad.  The staff couldn't give a damn about anything.  Asked my name and said Joe, they said Chuck.  Ok, I don't care about that so give me some decent food.  Asked for no cheese since I'm lactose intolerant so I get chicken street tacos and beans and rice with cheese.  Happened the first time too.  Gave food back to the guy to fix, a minute later a girl brings my food up but calls it a different name of a guy that just left, told her it was mine, she didn't say anything just took it away.  The guy tells her it's mine so she turns to me with a nasty look and gives it to me.  Freakin strange.  Owners, get a clue and stop using airport employees.  Hire your own people who give a shit and pay them what they deserve.  The tacos were spicy but lack any other flavor, the beans like glue, and the rice beyond flavorless.  Will not eat here again.
