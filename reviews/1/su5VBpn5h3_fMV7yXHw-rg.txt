The only reason this place is getting a star is because I have no choice.. and the kid at the counter was very nice. However.. my tacos were dripping wet and soggy.. the people in the back looked as if they hated life and talked as if one another were stupid. Then.. now call me picky if you may, but when I go to get my food.. nothing. No thank you or have a good day.. just "plop, here's your soggy tacos." I know good customer service.. and that was not. Minus the poor guy at the register.
