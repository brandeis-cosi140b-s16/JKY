Absolutely DISGUSTING.  And I got sick.. Horrible half ass cooked brought me out raw potatoes that were hard, burned ham and burned my pancake. How do you burn a pancake??? Wtf?? Poor owner is gonna end up losing this place due to his cook. Service was good though but horrible cook. Oh and my girls chips were hard and old. Never again will I eat there.
