Went here for lunch today and place is closed.  Like as in closed down no longer open for business, closed. Walked into the little market and where the section for the chicken is empty. Asked the man behind the cash register for the market, said they are all gone. Which is crazy since there are chicken food signs all over the outside of the market and someone just left a review 10 days ago ????
