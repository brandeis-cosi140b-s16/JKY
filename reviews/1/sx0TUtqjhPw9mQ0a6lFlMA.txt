The way they handle the food is unsanitary and gross. First, they don't use gloves or anything. Second, the lady, might be the manager, named Christina I think, was using the thongs for everything. She uses it to throw the chicken around, to open lids, etc. Then as she was walking up to take someone's order (bc they are understaffed), she checks her phone first before taking my order. Phones are so dirty. People take phones in the bathroom. Then after taking my order, she goes back to cut up some chicken without washing her hands. Avoid this place!!! Nasty. I felt sick trying to eat my food. I threw it away.
