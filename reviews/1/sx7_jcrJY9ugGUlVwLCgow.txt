Incompetent staff. Not one single (out of the 7) people behind the bar even acknowledged us. Too busy closing checks I presume. Oh, about the health violations and dirty bar tops? Come on! One thing I hate is seeing bartenders with personal drinks and open containers just sitting out. 
Oh, and I asked for a Compari on the rocks, homeboy circled around twice then told me they didn't carry it; there were two bottles sitting up top.  Get it together holmes. Didn't get to order any food because no one ever came back to ask if we needed anything. Won't ever be back.
