Have eaten here at least 2 times a month for the last few years.  Over this summer all staff is new, menu changed, portions got smaller and prices went up.  Restaurant use to be crowded on Fri & Sat nights but last night it was nearly empty. SERVICE WAS GOOD.  Food was only fair.  Last week was about the same.  Won't be going back.  RIO MURAGE & MACAYOS are nearby so I  will be trying them.
