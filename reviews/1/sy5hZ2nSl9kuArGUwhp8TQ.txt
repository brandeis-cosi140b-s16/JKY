I ordered my food and took it home to find that they messed up my order. I drove back to have it corrected. After I got home and started eating my food I found a hair with a follicle attached. I returned again only to be accused of putting it there myself. I have very long curly hair (I'm bi-racial) and the hair in my food was an inch long, black, and straight. The food wasn't worth the gas that I used to drive there 3 times, only to be accused, very loudly, of sabotaging my food because I wanted it for free. I was so disgusted with the horrible service.
