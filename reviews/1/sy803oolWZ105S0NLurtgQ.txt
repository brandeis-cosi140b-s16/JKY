We were staying at the Flamingo and have been to several CnS before, so we assumed we knew what we were getting into. We were wrong. The waiter (1048 John G) sucked. He was barely ever around and instead of wise ass remarks that we are used to on occasion, he was just rude. The drinks were made very poorly and the cheese dip we ordered came out cold and almost solid. Dont bother going to this place.
