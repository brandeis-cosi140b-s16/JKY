I've been to many chipotles before and I recognize that serving sizes vary, but this was ridiculous!  I had brown rice, they were out of fajita veggies, beans, cheese, corn salsa, medium salsa, and guac.  The problem you might ask?  Each item was scooped up with the ladle and then the ladle was shook until the item was level with the ladle. These are not deep ladles!! So, I spent almost $9 for a drink and a bowl that was LESS than 25% full. There was a lady standing next to the register that seemed to be doing QC and, I can only guess, this must be corporate's idea of a serving. I'm done with chipotle-too many other choices!!
