I was really looking forward to going, but I'm very disappointed. The ingredient quality, especially the meat seems very poor. The service is friendly, but the food is bland, the the serving size isn't a great value. As much as I am not a fan of big chains, I would go to Chipotle before Taco Del Mar any day. There are much better options for Mexican.
