The day before father's day my wife planned a family breakfast at Rokerij.  Unfortunately, I am presently on a diet so I was expecting a lot on my one cheat meal in two months.  I wanted two things a solid Eggs Benedict and an awesome Bloody Mary.  The Eggs Benedict included a hard boiled egg and lacked any flavor.  The Bloody Mary was lame, no spice, no bite at all. Kid's didn't like the dutch pancake, this isn't a negative, just some information.  It tastes like french toast, if you like that then go for it.  Moving on from the food was the service. Service was horrible, the waitress forgot all about us multiple times.  All our glasses were empty most of the time.  I would never recommend this place.   On the plus side my wife recovered with Snooze on father's day.  That place is awesome.  Go their for breakfast.
