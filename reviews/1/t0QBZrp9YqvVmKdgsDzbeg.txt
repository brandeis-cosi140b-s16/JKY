Went in there to check it out being a nacho connoisseur.  I was severely disappointed.  For the price paid the good delivered, it was awful.  You can drive a little down the road, not much to Pepe Taco Villa or the Sun Up and get way better chicken nacho's.  And Sun Up has 5 dollar happy hour all day on Sunday for their drinks and food.
