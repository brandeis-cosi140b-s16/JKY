Before we moved to Las Vegas On the Border was a favorite of my wife's in South Carolina. We have not visited this location that often (maybe three times) since moving to Las Vegas. One reason being that it is very far from our house, and the other that the service is horrendous. The service, sadly, appears to get worse from visit to visit. They also tend to run out of food, this most recent time they had run out of french fries). They also do not carry similar items as other within the brand (no white queso at this location), but sometimes do (1 out of three times they had it. The two times they didn't our server acted like I was stupid for even asking if they offered such an item.The end of this last visit was probably the worst because our waiter practically forgot about us and we had to almost jump up and down and wave our hands to get his attention. When speaking to the gentleman in the table next to us, we found that he had planned to order desert, but because the same server had seemingly forgotten about him as well, he was not going to. It is sad to see a restaurant that used to be a favorite has such poor service. We will probably not be back.
