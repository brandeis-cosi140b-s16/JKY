Took a few out of town guests here and it was awful. My husband and I have been here a handful of times before, but this visit was the worst! There was a hair in our pins colada AND floating in our water! We never had chips and salsa at the same time, my husband asked for ground beef and received chopped beef, my taco salad she'll was burnt and our pitcher of margaritas were watered down! Will not be back! EVER!
