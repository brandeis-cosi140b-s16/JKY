You made me take a taco OUT OF MY BODY. 
THAT IS THE OPPOSITE WAY A TACO IS SUPPOSED TO GO! 

FILTHY. Inedible food. Awful service. 

You wand food poisoning? Cause that's how you get food poisoning. 


The bar is already ridiculously low for an airport taco... But these people can't even make something you can quickly choke down before boarding. 

The barbacoa tacos they gave me (after messing up my order TWICE) were cold in the middle. 

They can't even manage to properly microwave taco meat. 

YOU MADE ME SPIT OUT A TACO. DO YOU KNOW HOW RARE THAT IS FOR ME? Inexcusably awful food. 

HOLY Hell does this ever epitomize awful airport food.
