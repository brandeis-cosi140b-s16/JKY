Horrible food! They reheat their meats by adding oil. The guy at the counter never said hello, thank you or smiled once. After we sat down the guy at the counter and one of the guys in the back started wrestling around on the floor. A la lucha libre. The salsa bar was nasty and dirty.
Super burrito is so much better.
