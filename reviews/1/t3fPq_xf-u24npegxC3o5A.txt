THIS PLACE is nothing but SUCKS!

 I ordered the dry chicken, microwaveable-"Mexican" rice bowl and it was disgusting. The veggies were mushy and over "saut√©ed" almost drowning in oil and the fake, industrial-tasting flour tortillas are so gross. 

To make things worst, I get two Perrier waters and it came to $8 for both! NO THANKS! And when I tried to return them, Ms. Patty who rang me up, gave me so much attitude. I could care less about it, I am not paying $8 for carbonated water. She said "I have to get the manager *rolls eyes, gives me the "you little punk look"*, and I said "i have an hour layover, so I'm not going anywhere"

Horrible experience and I beg you, please just go elsewhere. I ended up getting free water from SBUX, instead of throwing away $8. Hopefully  LAS gets better food and soon.

Just go to the slot machines and make better use of your $$$ there.
