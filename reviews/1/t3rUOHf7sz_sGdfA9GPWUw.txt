Was looking forward to a refreshing Makers Mark and Coke with my meal after a long, hard day but was told that they were out of Makers Mark bourbon.Hey, not every one drinks tequila and it is a full service bar. This was Saturday afternoon, 10/3/15.

I might be able to understand how some small mom and pop operation without professional management might run out of a VERY popular bourbon but now here. Very disappointing, Won't be back for any more disappointments.
