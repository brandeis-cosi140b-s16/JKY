Holy crap was this place awful.  I had read all the horrible reviews and thought to my self, this place can't be that bad can it?  I walked by and saw this colorful little spot and thought I'd check it out but then I realized it was THE Frida.  What a mistake I made, I've had better texmex at Taco Bell and it still gave me the runs.  The food was positively bland and but I'll admit that the waitress was very nice and helpful.  I can't understand why there were so many people eating there the day I went.  Well I guess they were actually all drinking tons of margaritas so at that point is doesnt matter what kind of food you are cutting the alcohol with. Also the fake Frida murals were hella cheesy.  Texmex cheesy.
