This place is a shell of it's former self...Poor food, and even worse management.  Overhead the manager drop the F bomb a few times!  Pretty classy in front of customer.  The food has no flavor, place is exceptionally loud and rundown.  Don't ever order the beef fajitas here!  What a joke!  No flavor and no one uses cheap flavorless round steak for fajitas.  Takes lessons from Fajitas out on I-17, and try again.  I won't be back!!
