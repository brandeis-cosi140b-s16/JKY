I'm shocked at the amount of stars being used to rate this place. I would give it no stars if I could.

My wife, son and I just tried the place, and I was the only one who got any food. After ordering a hamburger for my son, we were brought a cheeseburger - which he cannot eat. When they finally brought out the hamburger some time later, the fries were cold enough to tell me they left the original fries on the plate while they cooked a new hamburger and didn't even bother to keep them under a heat lamp.

My wife never did get her food - as by then I had finished my $11 chimichanga that was microwaved (a fact anyone could determine by the scorching hot outside and still cold inside) tiny little thing in the middle of the plate. Honestly, $11 for something the size of a hot pocket, covered in dried out lettuce is just insulting. Both the refried beans and the rice were bland - completely void of any seasoning at all.

I should have known what we were in for when I saw the grease-soaked chips brought to us when we sat down.
