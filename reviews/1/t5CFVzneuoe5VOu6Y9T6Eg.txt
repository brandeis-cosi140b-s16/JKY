worse than the garbage they call their enchilada sauce.
My husband and I went there this evening, the man who took our order (finally) spoke one word the whole time we were ordering which was "combo?" To my request for the #3. We got home to discover his beef nachos filled with bell pepper and onions. No big deal, maybe we should've asked. We go back, I explain he doesn't eat this and ask to exchange it. The man has to call the manager (while I'm at the car explaining to my husband that ALL their meat choices apparently come with the peppers and onions) I come back and he gives me his phone so the manager can explain that her employee told us there would be peppers and onions in the meat. I asked if she would just refund my money and she very condescendingly said "well just this once". No apology, no customer service  .
I would rather drive the extra 10 minutes to the next closest one than go back.
