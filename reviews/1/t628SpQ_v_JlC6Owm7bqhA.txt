As stated, another Chipotle knockoff. 3 shredded beef tacos with just cheese and a small soda was $11.33. The shredded beef did have good flavor but the portion was ridiculous. The lady divided a half scoop of beef for 3 tacos. Might be lucky to total 1 oz of meet. Ridiculous portions, ridiculous price! If you don't add all of the add-ons, this place is a waste of your time and a waste of money. I'll stick to the plain flavors of Roberto's for half the cost...
