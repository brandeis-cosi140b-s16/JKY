I typically don't write yelp reviews, but after tonight's visit it was necessary. The food was fine, but the staff was so unprofessional it was shocking. When a group of us walked up to the counter to order the entire kitchen staff just looked at us in disgust. Then started whispering to each other while we were up
There! Um hello?! We can see you! My husband and I's order came out in a timely matter, but our friends took 10 minutes after ours and all she got was nachos! Then the lady brought it out and said sorry it took so long we ran out of beans. My friend asked specifically not for beans. The kitchen staff was screaming and laughing in the background while customers were waiting for their orders. All in all, just a bad experience and definitely won't be coming back to this location.
