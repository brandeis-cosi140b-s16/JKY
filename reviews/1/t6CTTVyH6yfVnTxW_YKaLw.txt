When I see a hole in the wall in old Henderson, usually its a safe bet. Not this time. Bad service, bad food. Just all around bad. This place must be selling crack out the back door to keep it open. There was one server, and one cook. Expensive ass prices when they advertised a lunch special for the exact thing I ordered. The only thing worth mentioning was the chips and salsa. And it was just OK. I had the cheese enchiladas  (what I usually order) as a first timer at a mexican restaurant. OMG disgusting. My boyfriend had a steak ranchero dish and the meat literally tasted old like a jerky or something. We stacked our plates, paid the bill and ran for the door. Should have just listened to my girl Shirley B!
