I have never paid more than $80 for Mexican food in my life.  This place was very expensive and the food was decent.  I posted pictures for you to see.  My favorite thing was the Civiche.  They did make strong Margarita's.  The average meal price was $12-18.  My Cheese Enchiladas were $13.00!

The one thing Agave has going for them is their ambiance and patio.  The patio has 4 fire places and the option to sit at the fireplaces (couches) or tables.  The service is less than average.  We waited for a host to show up to seat us for 5 minutes.  The server continually forgot to check on us and we had to ask twice for waters.  And when we asked when he recommends he said "everything."  I wanted to get up and leave right when he said that.

I will not be returning.
