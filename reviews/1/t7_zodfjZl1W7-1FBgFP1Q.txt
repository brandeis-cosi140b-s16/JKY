I really like the food... but the management of the SouthEnd needs some work.  I eat here way too often. About three times out of four there's something not correct: out of a key ingredient (rice, beans, chicken, cheese... something basic) or something weird going on with the staff or management (unprofessional or just weird interactions). It wouldn't take much to make this location a great experience 99% of the time, instead of only 25% of the time.

**Since originally posting a two star review I have stopped eating Chipotle. And this deeply pains me. I can see why they were in the news for food born illnesses. Hygiene is just not a top priority. The foil lids were bring restocked up front, the worker took so many that the top one was braced with her face. Her face was touching the lid. I kept waiting for her to throw away the $.003 lid that was touching her face. I walked out of line when I saw it being used on a customer's order.
