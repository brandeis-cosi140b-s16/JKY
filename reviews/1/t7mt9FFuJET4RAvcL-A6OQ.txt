Horrible. Just horrible. I was so disappointed. Their food taste like crap. I couldn't even finish my meal. I got the chicken plate with enchillada. It just taste bad. The most portion I ate was probably the bean. I don't even eat the bean most time. I eat the rice, but their rice is just bad too. I don't see what the big deal is.
