After the response from the GM, Clay wanting to make things better for me from my original review posted on here a month ago, I still have yet to get a call back from him. I did call him per his request from a facebook message. Unfortunately, I called at a bad time (6pm), and I knew that, so I left my name and number with Clay and expected a call back because he was very busy at the time. I understood, but it has been over 3 weeks now. I was hoping to share with him my bad experience. I was not looking for a free dinner. Just a chance to let him know how was treated and ignored once the hostess realized my party of 3 was waiting for a friend just a few minutes away. However, if you saw my review from less than a month ago she was very rude and never offered to seat us in the cantina area, and I didn't even think of that since my son was just 14. But either way, I'm done with trying to resolve my treatment with Clay and assure you I will not be back for to try and make things better.
