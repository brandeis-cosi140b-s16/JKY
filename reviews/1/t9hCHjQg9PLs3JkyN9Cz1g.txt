Adios America's. 

Not sure what happened here, but I'm guessing they expanded too rapidly and quality control was over looked. 

Picked up some food to-go today. Ordered a carne asada burrito and a "trio" which is chips, guac, and salsa. 

Getting back to the office, after three bites of the burrito I bit down and something rock hard was in the burrito- so that was fun. Several bites later the same thing happened, and as much as I love my dentist- I'm not in a hurry to see him- so I had to throw away my burrito. Now onto the $7.00 side order of chips (which literally were 80% broken into tiny pieces) and salsa with no flavor profile whatsoever. 

I really liked this spot- and hope they can get it together. Quality matters, and that will make or break you. 

Why not have an option of chips and Guac like Chipolte? $2.50 and done, instead of $7.00 for flavorless salsa, broken chips- and decent guac. 

I wish this place the best- and hope they can do better.
