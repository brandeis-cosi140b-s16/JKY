This was one of the worst experiences I have ever had. The gentlemen dropped a marker in our food and got ink on food and bowl. I asked if he could please remake it and got upset and argued with me and finally through the bowl and walked off. Also none of the people could hear a single thing my family was saying. We honestly couldn't even eat after this experience we were so upset. Never again.
