Let me start by saying the hostess and waitress were great. Even the manager came by to see how we were......but.... The food.  Hmmm. Mission flour tortillas chimichanga had no crisp to them at all.  Wings tasted like they were baked from the freezer  I am sure the jalepenos peppers were from a box from Walmart  the beans tasted like a generic can of beans with no flavor the rice well let's say it was probably a  5 pound bag of rice with one 5 oz can of tomato sauce added to it for color.  Absolutely no flavor at all. The hot sauce didn't even do it any justice    The burrito that we ordered was a carne asada. They should have called it the lettuce cilantro and onion burrito. We did order a beer and a drink and those were good.  It was a good thing we had a living social discount or I would have asked to leave without a check.  I will not visit their restaurant to eat again.  They may want to find a new menu or a new cook
