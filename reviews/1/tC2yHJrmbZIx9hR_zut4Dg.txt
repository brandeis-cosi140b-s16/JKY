HORRIBLE place no lie the man is so rude, I mean okay sure he makes good razpados but it doesn't mean you gotta give your loyal customers attitude and his prices have gone up so much he's out of his mind when he opened up his place a small raspado costed like $3 and now they cost $9 for a small!!!!! And $12 for a large their crazy literally it's just water with fruit in a cup I will never return to this place ever again there gonna run out of business anyways :/ I certainly don't recommend this place to anyone
