I can't really write a very detailed description on this because we stayed only for 10 minutes. After walking in and finding that my husband and I were the youngest in there, by like 30 years, we had one round of nasty tasting drinks and left.  

On a plus, the waitress was very nice. The atmosphere not so much. We didn't get a chance to taste the food.
