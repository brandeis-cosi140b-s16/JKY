If I could regurgitate that meal I would! I have passed by this place a million times and thought , 'oh this looks appetizing'. Not only was it not appetizing, but it was the most flavorless food I have tasted since English Pub fare! Mamita's touts itself as authentic Mexican and Cuban Cuisine but it's swill. I chose the Masa de Puerco Fritas and the meat was nothing but fat chunks. There was hardly any meat on my plate and the meat that was there was super dry. The onions were over cooked and they even had the nerve to placed wilted lettuce on my plate. They forgot my black beans and when the waitress finally brought them, I took one bite and spit them out. They had so much cumin in them it was inedible. The waitresses seemed uninterested in doing a good job and it pained my party and I to even leave any kind of tip. After much discussion, we left less than 10% of our bill for every time we had to ask for the same thing over and over, every time we had to spit something inedible back on our plate, and the general disgusting atmosphere of the entire establishment. I decided the only reason this place ever received any good reviews is because the person or persons were intoxicated and didn't know any better. But I was completely sober and as God as my witness, I will not patronize that place again even if I am drunk and that is the last place open!
