I went there the other day, because I wanted mexican food and it was close by to my apartment. Let's just say I will never go back. It was the most horrible experience I had in any restaurant I have ever been to. When I walked in, I took a look at the menu and I saw a guy in the back room that was just staring and didn't even say hi or greet us or anything. Then after 5 mins he came out and just stared at us again and didn't even say anything. When I started ordering he rolled his eyes at everything I said. Then he said my total was 14 dollars. Then I asked him if I could get a side of extra habenero salsa, and he said the nachos already came with salsa and refused to add an extra side of it to the order under any circumstances. Is this a joke? He snapped at me. Then he charged my card and gave me a receipt that said 20 dollars on it when he said my total was 14. I questioned him as to why this was. In the rudest and most hostile manner he proceeded to do some weird made up math that made no sense. I waited to get the receipt and immediately saw mistakes, and he did in fact over charge me and added things I didn't even order. I slapped the receipt down and demanded for a refund. At this point he felt stupid and calmed down his hostility. I got my refund and immediately left. I recommend not to go to this place unless you want terrible hostile service from psycho people. He honestly looked and behaved in a deranged manner. Once again, this was my worse experience in my whole entire life in a restaurant.
