What a disappointment. Starting with the salsa brought with the chips to the actuall meal, the food felt cheap. What do I mean by that? The meat was fatty. The flavors were bland. The presentation was awful. Everything was doused in a very unappealing and very disgusting green sauce.

I'm a huge fan of Mexican food and have had my exact meal at other restaurants. 3 Margaritas just isn't up to par.

The worst part, $37 plus tip for two meals and two kids meals. Save your money and go somewhere else.
