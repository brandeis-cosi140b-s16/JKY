I've eaten at La Perla at least 6 times since my last review. Each time we went I've been so disappointed I'm not sure what is going on on with this restaurant. It is a little older restaurant so it's a little run down but that really hasn't been an issue because the food has always been outstanding. But recently it's taken a turn for the much much worse. The food has been very bland and burnt just very ordinary. The service has been terrible and they don't clean anymore. The rest room smells so bad like urine about made me want to gag. Please La Perla get it together I've been going there for so long it is always been my go to Mexican food restaurant
