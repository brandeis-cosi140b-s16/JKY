I called in a order and they said it would be ready in 10 minutes. When I arrived the restaurant wasn't busy and I ask for my order. They looked around to see where it was and then the cook then proceeded to start cooking my order. The food is ok but the service just sucked. I'm on a tight schedule for lunch that's why I called it in. I hope they can get their act straight with their service.
