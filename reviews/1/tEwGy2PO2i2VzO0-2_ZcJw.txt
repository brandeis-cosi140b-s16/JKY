My husband  and I went in yesterday for some mexican food we both got the chimichunga with rice lunch special. it was alright. we got home and got instantly sick. we go food poisoning from this place i recommend going to aho al's or a different resturant. worst experience ever. Macayos is not as good as i remembered.
