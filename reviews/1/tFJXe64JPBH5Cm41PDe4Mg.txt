So we have been here waiting to be seated since 8:45. We take a seat at the bar and ask for a menu and the server says kitten is closed. Considering we are still on the wait list for a seat. I think that this is poor management. Unfortunately the band was amazing and should receive 5 stars. For it being cinco de mayo they should have planned better for the amount of business that they had, and lost tonight. So many patrons are disappointed that they couldn't be sat. Empty tables for a hour and they tell us the kitchen is backed up 90 minutes. We are now leaving to go get food somewhere else.
