I can't remember the last time I walked out of a restaurant but we walked out of here on Saturday night.  Four of us ordered margaritas, the pomegrante & melon were delish but the Original one tasted AWFUl. We were seated at 8:15 and by 9:30pm still hadnt gotten our entrees. One of the girls in our party went to ask the server if he had forgotten about us. He was very rude so we decided to leave. The poor manager was gracious enough to pick up our drinks and appetizer but this really was the WORST dining experience of my life.
