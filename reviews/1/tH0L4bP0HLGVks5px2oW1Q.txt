What is so great about this place?  I have a couple of friends that talked me into going, not sure why!  I had the steak tacos and my friends had the fajitas.  The service was great and the guy that helped us was very friendly which made up for the crumby food.  I think we would have been better off going to the Salty Senorita.. 
If your looking for a good place for a Margarita and aren't hungry go to this place.
