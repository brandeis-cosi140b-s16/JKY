Terrible customer service. Cashier got order wrong then had to argue with her to change it from regular burrito to giant caramba. She should've just fixed her mistake. Then she charged me 50 cents to get my horchata without ice. It was bad enough that want a quarter for a soda refill. I'm being nickled and dimed and I don't like it. Won't be going back.
