They seem to always do something wrong. I ordered a grande meal, a few nachos and a pinto and cheese. The 3 hard tacos where underneath the 4 bean burritos and the soft tacos.  So of course they where completely squished and broken. There was red sauce all over inside my bag. They handed me food from the order behind and had me hand it back in then check the bags to make sure it was my order and not the next car. Total disaster.
