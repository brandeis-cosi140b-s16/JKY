This place is a rip off!!!! I went there for the first time a couple months ago and had some amazing tacos they were served fast and they were delicious and affordable, so I decided to go tonight after two long softball games, I was hungry!!! So first of all i get there and there's maybe 7 people in line, no big deal i get  directed to park in one of the few spaces they have and couldn't even pull in all the way because of the family of 12 in their lawn chairs like they're in their front yard!! So my wife gets out and waits in line (which took her  15 minutes to get through by the way)
As i sat in our car the six kids,who were with the party that thought it was a camping ground, kept touching leaning and basically treating my car like it was their personal jungle gym!! After three or four times I finally  got fed up and rolled my window down and  yelled at them to get off my car, finally the mother who was feet away the whole time decides to control her offspring. I looked in the rear view mirror just in time to see my wife finally getting our two burritos we ordered, we got our food after the six or seven people who were BEHIND HER in line!!!! Wtf!!! She gets in the car and tells me it was $18 for two carne asada burritos!!! I'm thinking they better be hella good! So we get home and  begin to eat, I bs you not there was maybe a tablespoon of meat!!!!! For 18 freaking dollars!!! Never again it was all beans and rice no meat at all!!
