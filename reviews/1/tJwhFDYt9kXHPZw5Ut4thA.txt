Party of 8 purchased a Living Social deal for $50 which provided unlimited frozen margaritas and an entree for 4 hours. Staff tried to make us walk to the outside bar every time we needed a drink.  Then the only "offer" they had was to move us outside closer to the bar. Waitress was condescending and tried to play interference to try and avoid us talking to management. Don't do it....don't come here!
