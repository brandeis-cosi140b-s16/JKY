Went with my husband to try this place out since it's new with second location. Boy was that a mistake. Husband asked for a agua chiles which if you Hispanic you know what I'm talking about. The shrimp tasted old and smelled funny. So we just left that to the side. We weren't going to say anything but as we were eating the tostadas there was a dead roach in the basket !!! It was disgusting. I told the waitress we didn't wAnt the rest of  the food and to please take the shrimp away and showed her the basket   With the dead roach. She told us it was too late to cancel the order and we would have to pay for everything regardless of there lack of cleanliness and food hygiene.
