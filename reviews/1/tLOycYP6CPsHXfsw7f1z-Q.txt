My family and I have been going to Gordo's for about 18 months off and on.  Always had a very good experience...especially the Surf 'N' Turf burrito.  Historically, it had cuts of steak and generous portions of shrimp cooked in a spicy sauce.  

Just 30  minutes ago, I ordered one and it was not the same at all.  The menu is different, the employees are different and the burrito was not the same at all.  Did they change owners?

Not happy!
