Good: Prices and convenience; which is essentially the definition of "fast food".

Bad: Having been to this location at separate times throughout the years, I can honestly say that I've never had worse food from a fast food chain. I've tried just about everything on the menu, in hopes that not everything can suck. But I was wrong -- very wrong. The meat tastes like taco-meat flavored wet cardboard, the tortillas are stale, and even the chili-cheese fries taste "off".

Other Thoughts: I used to work for Del-Taco in California when I was in high school, and I am saddened to think the food I loved when working there will never be available here. I've sworn off coming here since last year and haven't been back since.
