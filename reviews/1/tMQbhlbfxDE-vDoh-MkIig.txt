My wife and I were excited to eat here as we live around the corner from this place.  Unfortunately we were very disappointed with the food quality.  The chips and salsa were good and the chips served hot.  You get a hot sauce and chunky mild salsa with the chips.  This was the only high point.  Everything else ordered was not fresh tasting.  My wife ordered the fish tacos which tasted like they used frozen fish sticks from trader Joes.  My dish was a combo plate of Green Corn Tamales and Spinach Enchilada.  Both of these items were lame.  The spinach tasting like it came from a frozen bag and the tamale was mushy and bland.  The rice and beans were also bland and lifeless.  Salt and pepper didn't do anything to help.  When the server asked how our food was we told her not good and we would not return.  We got no response from her except the check.  If the food does not improve here it will not last.  Too many good Mexican food restaurants to waste your time and calories here.
