Not a huge surprise that this restaurant has (mercifully, as another reviewer pointed out) closed. It was a train wreck from Day 1. But blaming Tatum Ranch for its failure? Yikes. As a business owner who struggled and survived (barely) the Great Recession, there is only one place to look when a business goes under - at its leadership. It's not your landlord when you can't pay the rent, it's not the crappy customers who don't know good service when they see it, and it's not economy (usually). 

A successful business needs strong leadership, a unwavering commitment to customer service, and a competitive product. Asado seems to have had none of these. 

I will repeat again (maybe someone is listening who is hoping to open a restaurant up in these parts?) what we need in Tatum Ranch and why:

There is MAD CRAZY NEW construction up here! Big new custom homes, huge new developments means customers with cash. Aside from Brisam's (pretty good and always packed, but I can't go there every day!) and Babbo, we have a 10+ minute drive to any other decent restaurants. 

WE NEED a chef-driven, independent type of restaurant that is contemporary American-style, transitional food. Not Italian, not Chinese, not pizza, and PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, no Mexican. Good cocktails, great wine list, family-friendly, nice appetizers, a great bar, good prices, HAPPY HOUR MENU, and continue the outdoor patio! Think Rusconi's, Fox Restaurant concept stuff (Culinary Dropout, etc.) as far as food goes. 

This place used to be a hopping happenin' place when it was the old Cocomo Joes! Granted, the food sucked and the service left something to be desired... but people FLOCKED to that place on the weekends w/ the bands that played. They had a competitive product - the best cougar bar in Maricopa County ;) 

It's a great location and a restaurant is even more desperately needed now that Amaro has also closed next door.
