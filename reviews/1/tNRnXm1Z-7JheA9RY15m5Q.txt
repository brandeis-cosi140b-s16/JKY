DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE UNLESS YOU WANT EVERYTHING TO GO WRONG!

I came here for my birthday on Saturday night and it was absolutely AWFUL!!

There were 8 of us who drove to Scottsdale from San Diego for my birthday. We all love tacos and drinking, so this place should have hit the spot. 

The waiter was super nice, but I don't think he could hear us very well over the loud music. I ordered a margarita when we first sat down and it was REALLY gross. It tasted like pure salt!! I hate complaining but we talked to the bartender and she made me a different drink. It was delicious, although fruity and not very strong. The bartender was very good about it and blamed it on personal preferences, but I suggested she taste how awful the drink was. 

As we complained about the drinks, we were talking to the manager about something unrelated. He was very friendly. Then another man came up that we assumed worked there and handed us all shots! We were like cool, this makes up for all of their poor service! 

We finally got our food. I ordered a taco salad with chicken and pico de gallo and sour cream on the side. Both were on the side and carne asada was on top. That's fine... we later dig in and see that there was nothing but lettuce and carne asada! It was suppose to come with corn, beans, and rice. Did they forget how to make their own food??

We let them know and our waiter brought us the rice and beans on the side. Shot guy comes around and gives us more shots!! Cool.

Well bill time comes and we look and we were CHARGED for not only the shots we took, but also the man that worked there!! We were appalled!! My margarita wasn't taken off the ticket either!! 

Pros: 
the people were nice and good looking

Cons:
Food sucked, drinks sucked. We had an awful experience and we we're expected to pay for it!
