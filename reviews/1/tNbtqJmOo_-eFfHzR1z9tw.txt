I still love the food, but unfortunately there's a bigger problem.  Only pay in cash.  I used my debit one evening recently and when my bank posted the purchase, the attendant at the drive through had added an extra $5 to the purchase.  Receipt was for $13.83 and got debited $18.83.  Can't abide a thief.
