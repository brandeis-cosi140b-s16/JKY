Do not waste your time. I hate to be negative however...horrible service. The waiter did not get our order correct but we could not tell him because he did not come back to our table until we were done eating. When told of the mistake he said, "Oh you ate it." We said yes we did after not seeing you we decided to eat it.  We were looking for $1.50 off for not giving us the steak. That was all. But no apology. No nothing. I've never been to a place where they don't come check on you. 
You cannot beat the location.
The food is average.  Chicken was good though. 
Service terrible.
Decor is a joke.
I really wanted to like this place but it just isn't possible. Go to any other Mexican place in the area but avoid this place.
