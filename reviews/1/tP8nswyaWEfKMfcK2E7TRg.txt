I have come to Scottsdale for several years to see some spring training games, shop and eat a few good meals.  We have made this restaurant a stop because of their excellent chips and guacamole, despite the loud and crowded atmosphere - it is a scene.  

Having said this, we cancelled our 6:15 reservation this year because for the second year in a row they called us to confirm our dining time (no problem there) to also tell us that there is an 8pm reservation for our table afterwards!!! This is tacky and insulting to immediately let us know BEFORE WE HAVE EVEN SET FOOT in the place  that there is a time limit on our meal; and having the pressure of knowing we better not linger already ruined our experience!

I live in San Francisco where dining out is a way of life and no establishment would ever pull this crap on their patrons - basically putting the onus on us to manage their table turnover - ridiculous!!!!  Maybe the Mission should put egg timers in the shape of avocados on each table, and when the alarm goes off, the customer has to spit out the food in his mouth and  immediately hand over his credit card and flee the premises!

There are too many really good restaurants in Scottsdale to spend my money at a place that is so arrogant and treats their customers like robots.

We won't be returning, not even for the great chips and guacamole.
