WORST FOOD EVER. Don't waste a cent at this place. Staff was good and chips and salsa weren't bad but the entree was terrible. First you couldn't even tell what you were eating. Second the price was way to high for the quality of food. Third the food made me and my girlfriend sick all night and the next morning. Also you can eat at much better mexican food places for the same price. Blanco at the Biltmore for example.
