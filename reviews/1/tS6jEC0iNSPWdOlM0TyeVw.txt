I am so disappointed with Mi Patio.

I was so excited to go there tonight, get drunk, eat some great food then call Sunrise cab (see my other reviews) and head over to First Friday. But that is not what happened at all.

I first noticed that it wasn't too busy which to me was great but for a Friday night, kind of weird, especially with $1.75 margaritas. Awesome, right? Or so I thought. 

I started off with the XL because I save 0.25 that way, me figuring I was going to be getting at least two. They were horrible!!!! They actually caused me physical pain, every sip I took it would cause my stomach to wrench up, I tried chasing every sip with water with no avail. There was no tequila in it at all, it tasted like straight up sweet and sour mix, well maybe expired sweet and sour mix that was left out in the sun for 2 or 3 days. When we asked our waiter about it he just said he didn't understand what we were saying, repeated the price and walked away. I'm a very passive person so no big deal to me. We just figured "what did we expect for $3.25". They were huge though so plus for that...??? 

The food was pretty good, that's what the one star is for. We shared the Baja Chicken Burro. I mean it wasn't anything spectacular but it had a good taste. Nothing that would make me come back though.

I'm glad we at least tried it and got it out of our system but we'll keep looking. I think maybe I built it up too much in my head. I would give them a 1.5 but I'm rounding down for the pain that was caused.
