I had very limited choices here in this plaza when my friend wanted to stop at El Pollo Loco (which I won't eat). It was that, Subway or Qdoba. 

Having had good experiences with Qdoba in Seattle/Bellevue, I figured I'd just give it a try. (I'm not much of a fan of Subway either, tbh.) 

I went in, walked up to the counter and waited... and waited more... About 5 minutes passed and I still haven't been served because the annoying employee is having social time with either a friend or obnoxious customer over at the register, babbling on and on about how he's in school and blahblahblah. 'Scuze me? A little service down here?

Of course, after a few minutes I gave the employee the patented Condi Rice "stink-eye", and I'm glad I did, because this place has a big ol' B grade for their health department grade. Ew.

I did an about face and walked right out, wishing the next guy in line luck with actually getting some service. 

I'd give 0 if I could, but +1 stars because the ignorant, incompetent employee's behavior caused me to notice the B grade, and realize that I probably don't want to be eating at this location.
