Ask for no cheese on one thing, no guacamole on another, third person ordered a breakfast burrito with no changes. Girlfriend is lactose intolerant. She asked four times to make sure there was no cheese on her food. We get back and there is cheese on her food and guacamole on mine. She has to drive back and change it out because of her allergy. All three of us feel sick 5 hours later.
