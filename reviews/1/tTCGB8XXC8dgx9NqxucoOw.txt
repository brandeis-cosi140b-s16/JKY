okay so I love Taco Bell but today was the worst customer service ever...I go through the drive thru and order my steak cantina bowl...then I'm asked if I would like to donate and I politely say that I already have...well then I hear in the back ground "she's lying" how rude...thank goodness I had taken a pic of my donation cause I used a silly name...I get to the window and tell the cashier she's very rude for calling me a liar an show her my pic that I donated...she looked at me and said "we'll that wasn't here" seriously does it matter which Taco Bell I donated at? I just smiled said thanks I will just talk to the customer service rep since you obviously don't have good customer service skills an drive off...now I'm hungry an pissed bad combo!!!!
