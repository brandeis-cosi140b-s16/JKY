i travel a lot and when i go to taco bell, i order the double decker.  in bullhead city and kingman  az. they have more stuff in them.  the franchise owner in las vegas will not offer ice tea b ut forces you to drink sugary fountain beverages

last week while in mesquite i went to a del taco and had their chicken burrito and had an ice tea.  it was excellent

so long taco bell until you get your act together and stop ruining a fine nation-wide product.

i called taco bell h q and got lip service 


so try del taco  much better quality and quantity for a buck more
