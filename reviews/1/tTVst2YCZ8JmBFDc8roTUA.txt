Well... it was nourishment. That much can be said.

But it went downhill from there.

To start, we waited 20 minutes for an appetizer and 2 burritos and the place was decidedly not busy. While we were waiting, something went wrong in the kitchen and the dining area filled with smoke. No attempt to clear the air was ever made by the staff. Simply opening the front door would have helped a ton. This never occurred to the girl who took our order.

Second, 20 minutes? For two burritos? OK. Fine. Whatever... then why didn't the appetizer come out BEFORE the entrees? That's what an appetizer is for. We were hungry when we showed up and starving by the time the appetizer came along with the rest of the meal. You might as well not have brought it at all.

Third, I get the impression that the people working here have only read about this cuisine. It isn't that hard to get right. I'd even go so far as to say it is hard to get wrong. But get it wrong they did. The eliotes or, as they called it, "mexican street corn" came out looking like pig slop. Really. It was three cobs of corn thrown on a plate with some shredded cheddar cheese (NOT cotija like the menu says) and bacon tossed around. This is so far off from the real thing that I guess the book they read about all this stuff didn't have pictures. The steak in my burrito wasn't separated. At all. It was chopped up, but no attempt was made to actually separate the meat into separate pieces. So on the first bite about half of the meat of the entire burrito came with it. The salsa (pico de gallo in my case) was incredibly bland. No lime, no cilantro or any other form of seasoning, pretty much just tomato. 

In the end, we did get some nourishment. I suppose. I guess this is the outcome when you let some all-snark-no-skill hipsters run a burrito joint.
