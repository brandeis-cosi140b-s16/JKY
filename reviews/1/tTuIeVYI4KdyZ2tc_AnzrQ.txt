Patio is beautiful but food is not even mediocre. Nothing exciting or unique in menu. Customer service is terrible, my order was not put in,  which I know can happen, but the staff did not apologize at all for mistake or tried to rectify. Asked for more tortillas and they never brought. Almost like server was drunk, he kept dropping request after request and was slurring his words. Strange. Do not recommend which is too bad because we love supporting small local businesses.
