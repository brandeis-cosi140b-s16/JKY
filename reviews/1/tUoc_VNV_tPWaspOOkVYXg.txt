I have been going to this place for years.  However, not in the last year.  Went there last night and the service was dreadful.  The place was very hot and dirty.  The food was similar to what you would get at Taco Bell.  The burro I had was full of dried out chicken and nothing else. The beans taste like they were from a can.  Really disappointed.
