I used to be obsessed with this little hole in the wall of a gem, Espos. They have the best green chili burro I have ever had. 

...that was until one day I picked up an order and was filling my drink waiting for them to bag it up. On the soda fountain you won't believe what I saw...

it was COVERED in cock roaches. Big ones and baby ones. They were crawling all throughout the machine. When I told the lady in the window she said "Oh, I am sorry about that, would you like a bottled beverage?"

UH NO! I would like you to freak out a little bit and sound somewhat shocked and FIX IT!!!!! 

I alerted the better business bureau about that. I am sure it has been fixed but I don't think I'll ever be able to go back without gagging. 

So be on alert for creepy crawlies while you're there..
