Don't bother anymore .. Last couple of years they have gone from good to okay to just plain bad. Ordered a taco with everything and two gorditas to go..

We waited over 30mins.. Because they made the wrong gorditas we wanted chicharon and carnitas.. They made two alpastor.. No sorry no nothing . 

On the way home, the taco was 'naked' no salsa no onion no cilantro .. The gorditas .. Not fresh and not gorditas .. Mostly beans and lettuce and lard no carnitas no chicharon .. Hard and dry. 

So damn disappointed
