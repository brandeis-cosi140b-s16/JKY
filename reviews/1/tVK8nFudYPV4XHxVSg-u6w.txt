Out of Business.  Another one bites the dust.  Went there today at 1115am. for my moms birthday.   No sign but door was still locked, and outside trash cans overflowing.  Phone number isn't any good.
A semi trailer, attempting to make a delivery and all four of our cars left..
We ended up at Lindo Michoacan on DI and Pecos.  
Which made me very happy.

Probably a Godsend as I never liked this place but unfortunately my elderly mom did.
