This was one of the worst burritos I've ever had.  Given that PHX is a short distance from Mexico, this was appalling. 
Their menu is totally bizarre. The two older hispanic gentlemen  behind me, spent a good 5 minutes going back and forth in spanish trying to figure out on earth their discombobulated menu was all about. 
My chicken burrito contained: a cake-like tortilla (not warmed, not grilled), a handful of lettuce, an few measly pieces of chicken and a dallop of sour cream. No beans. No rice. Plastic container of what seemed like Pace Picante salsa on the side.
Total dissapointment.
