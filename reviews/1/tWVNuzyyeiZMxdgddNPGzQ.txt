The worst drive-thru experience ever. It took over thirty minutes to get my order with just 6 cars ahead of me. Then, they forgot my drinks and I had to go back. 45 minutes later, my family got to eat cold fish tacos and cold fries. Yum! The employees could not care any less if they tried. Nobody offered up an apology for the slow service or any show of appreciation for waiting.
