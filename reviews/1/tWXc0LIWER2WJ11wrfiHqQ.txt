We have eaten here quite a bit and usually get the same server.  I took the boys out for a dinner when mom could not come and we got a different server this time.  The mariachi band was extremely loud and never took a rest.  The food was decent but when I received the bill, I was charged $3.50 for a small RAMEKIN of hot salsa!  I wish I had known this before I ate because I had him bring another ramekin of hot salsa with the meal.  $7 for salsa...WHAT A RIP OFF!!  That will likely be the last time we ever eat there!  Free salsa and chips before the meal, but to add a bit of heat they milk you out of $3.50 for 2oz of salsa.  BEWARE
