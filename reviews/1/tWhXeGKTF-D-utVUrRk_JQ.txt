I am not quite sure how you can justify charging $25 for a plate of mediocre tacos, or $29 for a large margarita...

Don't get me wrong, I am a big fan of Ciudad in Los Angeles. I have a special place in my heart for the "Two Hot Tamales." But seriously, the Border Grill in Vegas is highway robbery. In a city where there is so much good food, and cheap food, and good cheap food, it is insane to waste your time and money here.Go elsewhere for some good cheap food and then get a football or the Eiffel tower filled with margaritas for $5
