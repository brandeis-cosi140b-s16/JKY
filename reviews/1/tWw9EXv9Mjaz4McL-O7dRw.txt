What's with the rave about their tortillas? I get it. They're thin, fresh and comes out the foil steaming, but what's so special about them?

The original was tasteless (for obvious reasons). The butter tortilla was just you know...the original slathered in butter.

Most of the food is just carb overload.

The machaca breakfast burrito was pure MUSH.
