Horrible employees... First off let me say that we have been here before and loved the food. This time however we get there at 9:03pm and the doors were unlocked so we still went in. As soon as we get to the line an employee shouted "don't you know we are closed (loud and rude), we are out of tortillas, chicken and everything else... As I'm looking at a stack of tortillas... So we walked out being and went to Roberto's. Who ever is in charge of that place really needs to get control of their employees
