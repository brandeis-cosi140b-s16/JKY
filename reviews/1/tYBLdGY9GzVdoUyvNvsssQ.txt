Zero stars. Ugh. Just don't go. Dirty. Found a hair in my food. Need I go on? Ok... I will. Ordered their signature pork dish. It was literally floating in grease. I've never seen anything like it and I grew up on Georgia! Found a long black curly hair in my rice. Hubby found a hair in his guacamole. After seeing 4 stars on Yelp we figured it was worth trying. Not sure if it used to be cool or what. We will never go back. Totally disgusting.
