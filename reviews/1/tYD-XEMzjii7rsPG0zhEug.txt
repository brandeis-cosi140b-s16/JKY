This place was HORRIBLE!!! The food tasted like lard, no flavor and kind of cold! Needless to say the service was terrible. Our server was the bartender guy at the bar he was really rude and never checked up on us and asked how our food tasted? He gave us attitude when we asked to order. Just horrible! Will never go back nor recommend it.
