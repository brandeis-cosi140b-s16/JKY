Three words: Worst Service Ever. 

Maybe I should have read the Yelp reviews before going here since poor service seems to be a running theme at San Felipe's. 

We saw our waitress twice. Once to take our order, and then to give us the check. We had to flag down the manager for our food status (took 25 minutes to get 3 apps), our refills and extra salsa (we gave up asking for the sugar after the 2nd try, we just took it ourselves from another table). 

This place is way too overpriced to get lousy service. With so many other choices in Tempe- spend your money elsewhere.
