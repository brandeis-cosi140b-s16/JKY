I'm so disappointed in the service we received tonight. We were innthe drive-thru for over 15 minutes and there were only 2 cars in front of us. I ordered 3 fresca style tacos and they completely gave us the wrong type of tacos, which of course I didn't realize until I was all the way home!  Never again!
