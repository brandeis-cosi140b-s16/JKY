I went there for lunch. It seem to be fairly highly priced however, there was only one other table eating at the time. When I asked for my bill I receive the other tables bill which he had already ran my credit card. We asked them to correct that. I found out a couple days later that I not only paid for my meal I was charged also for the other meal for the other person in the restaurant. I went in the following day and I'll talk to a manager and I was approached by a server she asks what the problem was and I showed her the receipt she looked at me like I was weird and went back to her table and started serving again I stayed at the door for another 10 minutes and then just walked out so I have no more time to pursue this so I guess they just double charged me and probably the other table as well so I won't be back
