Food is great the service SUCKS!! 20 minutes for a breakfast burrito?? This happens ALL the time. The owners obviously have no idea how to properly staff this place. They have one guy taking orders and cooking. I'm never coming back. Ill be going to Filibertos on 51st and the 10 from now on.

If the owners want their business to not fail they better fix this. I facebooked about this and got 80 likes in 30 minutes. I also posted on 6 other sites letting people know not to come to this place.
