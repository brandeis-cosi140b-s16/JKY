Awful service! Nasty food! Got a chicken burrito it was very greasy and expensive. They also charge for jalape√±os  $1 ...the cashier was very rude and the place has a sewer smell to it. Do not recommend it at all. However there is a lunch truck a few blocks down 91st and Grand they have great service for $5 !!
