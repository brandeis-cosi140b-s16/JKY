I was disgusted. The booth they sat us in had bugs all over. There was a hole in the middle of the booth that all the bugs were coming out of. We looked closer and there was a full nest of them!! It was also terrible because the staff acted as if they were surprised and didn't do anything to compensate. When we were leaving, they just wiped down the booth and set it up as usual! That's the worst!
