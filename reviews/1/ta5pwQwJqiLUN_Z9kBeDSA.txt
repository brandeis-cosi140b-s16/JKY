I've been going to Cafe Rio restaurants for almost 10 years and this is by far the worst location.  Their service is terrible, employees barely know how to make a burrito, food is constantly old, under portioned, they won't cook grilled chicken 2 hours before closing.  I reported this location to Cafe Rio corporate, hopefully they do something about it.
