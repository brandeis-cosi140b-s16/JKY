Tried to give this Cafe Rio a chance, but its a fail. Consistently no ice for drinks, today there is no avocado and I get charged full price, and the bathroom area by the drink station frequently smells like a sewer. The staff usually displays an indifferent attitude as well. Maybe a management change is in order? I will never come to this location again. Im usually the one not to complain.....but there are improvements that need to be made...like yesterday.
