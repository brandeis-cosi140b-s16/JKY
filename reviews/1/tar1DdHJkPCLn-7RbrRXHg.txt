The worst Roberto's - ordered a #4 which is the 2 taco combo and a carne asada burrito to go. Got home and saw that the tacos barely had meat in it so went back to the restaurant to give them an opportunity to fix the issue, instead the cashier had a poor pissed attitude telling us that that's how they come?!? We've been ordering this for years I mean years and this was the very first time I've seen it poorly executed. A two taco for a buck was way better than that food. I was so livid I was not able to take a photo of the mess. We will never go back to this restaurant. Poor attitude, service, and worst food! I see closure in y'all's future!
