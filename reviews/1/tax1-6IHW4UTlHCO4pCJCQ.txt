While perusing I saw this Chipotle and thought I'd share my experience.  I ate here once many years ago and was underwhelmed and wondered why anyone LOVED Chipotle.  Fast forward to last year and I had never eaten at Chipotle again thinking "gross"...the more is more concept of globbing tons of food into a burrito that was not dispersed properly and had dried out beans and chicken and charged extra for chips and salsa.  Never ate at a Chipotle again.  Then a year or so ago, I had a weekly meeting and always needed dinner and the only place on the road to my meeting was a Chipotle, so I had NO CHOICE but to eat there.  Well, it was delicious!  So delicious in fact that I ate there 4 weeks in a row and couldn't wait to get there.  

So I finally go back to my Chipotle in my neighborhood and think I have been missing out all these years.  Nope, still dried out, bland beans and chicken.  This location needs some management intervention because I am now addicted to Chipotle, but not this location.
