This place used to be great, but it fell terribly downhill. We first walked in and no one greeted us. Second our table was filthy which i understand if it busy. it wasnt. the menus were disgusting and had food in them. i wanted to wash my hands after looking at them. the waitress brought the wrong beer and the water cup was dirty needless to say we walked out and went to bj's
