I work in Arizona mills so my co workers and I often order chips and salsa to go from this location and I must say every time we get our food( which takes about 30 min) the beans are already cold, the male bartender who handles the to go orders is incredibly unfriendly, rude, and overall deplorable in his customer service abilities. Not even a kind smile as I approached the bar to receive my food. He then tried to charge me triple the price I was given over the phone. After finally fetching the "manager" which took some major demanding on my part, he was rude as well and insisted I, the customer, was wrong!! He did me a "favor" by allowing me to purchase my food at the price I was told over the phone pffft!!!! Needless to say I will never never never set foot let alone give money to this establishment ever again. TERRIBLE!!!!!
