After years of enjoying this place, from Camelback road to here, I will never go back.  The waiter took 10 minutes to return our Visa, the place was empty, so we asked the mgr what was the holdup. He lost his temper so badly! "Are you accusing my staff of stealing?" he asked us. We expected him to say, "hold on and I'll go check on it" not to go off on us for a reasonable question.  Our jaws dropped.  He was so nasty and borderline unstable. He invited us to never come back, thought we were on Punked.  God forbid someone actually complain, he might throw them out. Still waited longer for the credit card after that.  We were too stunned to ask to see another mgr, just left in shock.  Bad attitude and average food, skip it. Too many nice business owners to give hard earned money.
