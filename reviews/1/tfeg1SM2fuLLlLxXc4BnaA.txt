This place is just the worst I took my husband and daughter there when it first opened, first off they are not kid friendly at all, no high chairs or booster seats, also we had no idea where to order and not one person was helping us, when we finally sat down and got our food it seemed rather outrageous for the amount of money we paid. the portions are tiny for the pricing let alone you have to order everything separate no combos. this place is basically a food court.
