I went on a Saturday night. It was packed and not looking like a good time was to be had. The only reason I even went was for a Birthday party. I am a biker with no club affiliation and had on carpenter jeans , boots and a motorcycle t shirt. I was told by the little bitch bouncer/fluffer at the door my pants where too baggy??? Really??? I'm actually happy I didn't get in to an over priced dive bar in a high rent zip code. Do yourselves a favor and stay away. Unless you want to hang out with a bunch of suckers that think Scottsdale is so cool.
