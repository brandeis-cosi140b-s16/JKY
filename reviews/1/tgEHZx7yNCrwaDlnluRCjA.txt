I know they just opened but the food is disgusting. The service is super slow and the staff is extremely rude. I would NEVER spend another dollar or step foot in that place. It sucks because they are right next to the building I work at. STAY AWAY! Its not worth your money or time. Food is crazy over priced and its not even worth it. If I could have given a negative star I would have. Good luck Americas Taco Shop.
