There is one thing this place does right and hat is mess your order up every time. I order number 6 shrimp ranchero. Every other time it come with the tarter sauce. Last serval time they either forgot or one they says some crap like it does not come with it. Btw they need to learn customer service. I would love to see places like this go out of business. He manager on shift has a foulmouth.
