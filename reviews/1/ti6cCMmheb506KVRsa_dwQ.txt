Worst dining experience of my life.  I wish I could say that was an exaggeration.  Went on a first date here thinking it'd be a fun place to nosh and chat.  However, our waitress didn't even take our drink order for 20minutes, but she did swing by to tell us she'd be back to take it.  After another 10 minutes with no drinks my date got up and asked the hostess to bring us our drinks.  She did, and then we kindly asked her to send our waitress over to take our order (as that had not happened either).  When the food finally arrived it was so tainted by our poor service we had no desire to eat it.  Our waitress never came back to us, never asked how we were doing, nothing.  Wish the food had been worth it to stay after all that, but it wasn't.  We were very very disappointed.  We got up and left.  The manager was nice enough to comp our meal, but it didn't make up for it.  Worst first date ever?  Yes.  Second date?  Nope.  Thanks Nacho Daddy.
