Went to the drive thru to get some food. Apparently the manager thought it was a brilliant idea to take an unusually large order through the drive thru and inconvenience the rest of us that were waiting in the neighborhood of 15 plus minutes in line behind this genius or geniuses that placed said order in the drive thru!! This was totally ridiculous and they had a delivery at the same time so there was a semi blocking the parking lot as well!! WTH I finally backed out of the drive thru and left in disappointment!! You geniuses have lost my business for good! I'll never come back and will tell everyone i know to go elsewhere as well!! That was the dumbest most inconsiderate experience I've ever had in my life!! Its a drive thru to expedite service not hinder it!! You should be ashamed of yourselves!! Never again will you treat me badly! I hope you close your doors!! Btw time was 9:20pm  on sat 4-19-14  TERRIBLE SERVICE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
