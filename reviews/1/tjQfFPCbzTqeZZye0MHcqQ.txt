Very disappointed.  We have eaten here several times a few years ago.  We always enjoyed it back then.  But our most recent visit was very poor. It appears the old management has left and started a different restaurant elsewhere.  Those running it now have truly ruined the place.  Too bad as there aren't a lot of great Mexican restaurants in Apache Junction.  

Food was fairly tasteless (the death knell of Mexican food). The salsa was canned and the chips were bagged. Service was very poor and we were the only people in the place.  We will definitely not be returning.
