I had my suspicions when I was the only person at the restaurant when I got there. But it's between semesters so perhaps that was why it was slow, I thought. I had a margarita and a Mexican shrimp cocktail. The Margarita was so disgusting I had to add eight packets of sugar just to make it palatable. When the shrimp cocktail arrived I noticed the sauce had a sour/bitter taste that it's not supposed to have... It seemed almost fermented like it was expired. The shrimp had a funny skin on it that I've never seen on shrimp before. May have been the result of freezer burn but it also tasted funny. Against my better judgment I ate my shrimp cocktail ... but my worst fears were confirmed later in the evening when I developed food poisoning! Avoid!!
