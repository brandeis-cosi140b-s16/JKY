I must say I was terribly disappointed with my visit.  I grew up on tamales and was excited to try them here.  When I did. I found minimal meat, chewy cornmeal and overall lack of taste.  The olive placed inside too up a larger area (if looking from the side) than the meat did.  Chips and salsa were good.  But that alone can't cause me to like this place.
