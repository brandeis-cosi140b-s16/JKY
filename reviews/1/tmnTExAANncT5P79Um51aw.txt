This place is way too expensive. Over 20 dollars for one burrito and a plate of nachos? I didnt even get drinks!! (Nachos claimed to be for 4-6 people but was barely enough for 2!) Get real. And it tastes like any other mediocre Mexican restaurant. Plus they charge for sourcream. ...really?? Thanks, but no thanks Cafe Rio. I'll stick with Chipotle.
