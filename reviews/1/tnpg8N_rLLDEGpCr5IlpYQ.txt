SHOULD BE NO STARS, ONCE AGAIN.

My family has frequented this location several times.  Usually, we order quite a few things, however, I came from across Taco Bell because my little one wanted rolled tacos.  Also, maybe I was able to catch this mistake because I only ordered one plate, instead ordering several items and never catching it before.

I placed an order for #1 which is rolled tacos, rice and beans.  The order should have been $5.75 and tax, however, I gave my debit card and was charged $8.16.  When I got home, I checked the receipt and noticed I was charged for #11 which was $7.55 and with tax, came to $8.16.

I am not hispanic, however, I do know when the clerk turned around and told the cook "numero 1, pollo) I thought I was getting charged for the correct combo, not being overcharged for something I never ordered.  I was quite surprised my order was correct, just not the pricing.

The next morning I called the restaurant and was told Manwell was the manager and to get a hold of him I would have to call around 7:00 a.m. to get a hold of him.  I tried this morning and got several people who could not understand me to finally find someone who could speak to me in English to tell me his name is Javier and he was the manager.  When I informed him I was told Manwell was the manager, he told me to call back in a couple hours.

I have yet to speak to the manager, yet; however, I need to know if this is normal practice to overcharge customers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
