Just came home from this place and not feeling that great... I have been here numerous times, for some stupid reason I keep giving them a second, third, chance.  Today was the last time.

Ceviche is known for its shrimp, what I got today hardly had any shrimp whatsoever. 

The shrimp cocktail, if they can even call it that, was served in a small bowl, with boiled shrimp and what I could assume was ceviche juice. No detail, presentation, or taste. Some of my shrimp looked old.  Not recommended.
