If I could give this "0" this would receive this!  I stopped in here last night because I am always seeing how crowded it is, surely that must mean the food must be good, right?  Not always the case.

I ordered the shrimp burrito and I still do not know what it was that I was served.  While it had the outside appearance of a burrito, the inside was far from it.  It was like street taco meets Asian flare; what I do know, was not a shrimp burrito. 

Inside was cabbage, grilled onions, grilled green peppers, diced tomatoes and shrimp.   And the taste?  The shrimp didn't taste "right" and creamy sauce with caramelized onions and green peppers just did not mix.

This was my first and last experience
