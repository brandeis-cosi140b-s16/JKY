Once every few months I *forget* that I don't like taco bell and decide, what the heck?  Let's get some taco bell!  These guys are close, so we go here.  And EVERY TIME, in the last 2 years I've lived in the area, I regret it.  They are slow (via drive thru).  They've forgotten stuff I've ordered on multiple occasions.  & every time I eat from that restaurant, I throw it up instantly.  EVERY TIME.  I don't know what it is about this particular taco bell, but runnnnnnn!
