My friends invited me and my girl to Camarones (they had heard excellent opinions about Camarones Restaurant). Unfortunately I had a really bad experience! Let me explain; I ordered the grilled salmon, the mango salsa was already due (horrible!), I requested to the waitress to change the salsa what she did, but the pico de gallo salsa was even worst (the tomato was getting rotten) so I asked to talk to the manager who politely asked what he could do!
I decided to go somewhere else and have lunch.
I think they are not putting attention to a big issue: FOOD SAFETY.
If you are in the Food business you must comply with FOOD SAFETY REGULATIONS! 
Its a shame because the place is elegant !
