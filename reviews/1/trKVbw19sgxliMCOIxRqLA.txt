When my wife gets nostalgic for those good ol' high school days, she always mentions that Serrano's was a frequent hang out with friends. She recalls the great bean dip and the tasty enchiladas as her meal of choice. Well, after the eventual buildup of wonderful Mexican food, it really is a disappointment to find such memories are best left in the past.

My wife and I went to dinner here when we first moved down to the Tempe area. It was a week day during the lunch hours. It's a dark lit restaurant for "cosy" evenings (as one of my fellow reviewers mentions). No complaints on the service side of things, but no standouts either. When service is just fine, I typically don't come back because I know there might be something better on the other side of town. 

When it comes to the food, I'll give some credit to the bean dip. However, seeing as an appetizer was the most enjoyable item eaten that night, you won't hear another compliment from me. The food I had heard so much about was bland, boring and down right meh. Don't expect to see me hanging around this restaurant as I'll be spending my money on good Mexican food.
