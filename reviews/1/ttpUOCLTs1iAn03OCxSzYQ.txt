Been here before quite some time ago probably for a burro.  Came in today just for menudo. I won't be back for it again.  Before I could taste a spoonful I had to skim out quite honestly about 1/4 cup of oil/fat first. It literally filled the little styrofoam cup the onions/cilantro come in.   They don't clean the tripe, each piece had a layer of gooey fat on it.  Spoons were itty bitty, especially if your bowl had the pata.
