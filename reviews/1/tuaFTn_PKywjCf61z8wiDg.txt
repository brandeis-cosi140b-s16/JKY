Always hit and miss- but mostly miss

I rarely take the time on my days off from work to sit down for a large lunch in a good restaurant (I do for dinner). During lunch hour I am usually on a roll and I don't have the time for extended lunches.  With that in mind I am always searching for a good and quick place to eat. Unfortunately, Del Taco falls short. 


I have  said it many times before, I'm not a fan of Del Tacos food because their tacos do not have much filling in them, even when you order the double meat double cheese and the quality of food is always hit and miss.  However, my nephew enjoys the  food  at Del Taco so we decided to give it a shot. We decided to go through the drive thru.  I ordered two of the number six meals which included 2 double beef double cheese tacos, fries, and a drink.  I asked for the fries to be made "extra crispy" in hopes of getting fresh fries.  My hopes were crashed at least partially. As we pulled away I realized that one order of fries was fresh and hot while the other order was cold and stale. The frustrating thing beyond the cold fries was I asked the employee at the drive thru if the fries were fresh and extra crispy and she replied "yes".

The quality as a whole at Del Taco has seem to gone downhill fast.  I realize that Del Taco is a fast food establishment and fast food is what your going to get and I am fine with that. Howerever, I do believe the food should be fresh and made to order.  This doesn't appear to be the case with Del Taco. I have spoken to management on different occasions about the quality of food and have had meals replaced.

I will not be going back to Del Taco any time soon.
