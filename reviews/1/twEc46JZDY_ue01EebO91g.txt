Best mexican food I've ever had (no joke, the food is amazing! I had the super tender cheese covered New York steak)
...but the overweight waitress (that wasnt even my table's waitress) was such a total ***** at the register, it ruined this restaurants review.

I had a restaurant.com gift card for $25 off a $50 bill. She said It had to be over $50 and my check happened to total $49.83... She said it had to be over $50  before tax (huh? Tax on food? Guess I never payed any attention to that before). She rang me up a small drink worth about $2 but charged me $10. My new bill after my gift card now totaled $35. It's actually quite hard to spend $50 here for two people, everything is priced pretty fairly.
Also:   Literally all of the other restaurants I've used these gift cards at don't even care if you don't meet the minimum purchase requirement.
Honestly the whole gift card thing wouldn't have even bothered me if it wasn't for her absolute terrible manor how she talks to her customers. 
If you are the owner/manager reading this: Fire her asap.
