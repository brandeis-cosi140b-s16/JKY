DO NOT EAT AT THE TACO SHOP.

My girlfriend and I made a delivery order at The Taco Shop. When the driver showed up he let me know that he forgot the salsa.  Upon opening up our meals we also noticed they forgot the chicken in our chicken burrito, it's only the main ingredient.. After calling the Taco Shop the manager told us he would deliver another or credit us a burrito. Today we called to get a burrito after ordering delivery we get a call back letting us know that they would not deliver our food because it did not reach the $10 min. Great customer service guys! Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me.... if i ever go back there someone give me a spanking!
