Let me start off with we were the only guests at the time and the lady couldn't get my order right for 2 people. Cashier was too busy talking with another employee about unrelated job stuff. This place use to be the spot to go to for Mexican food, but they have refried beans from a can and the salsa is too watery. The extra guacamole we ordered was watery as well. It's as if they are adding water to the product to expand the amount, I would know and I'm a Chef. I've got to give this place a thumbs down and will be taking my business to Federicos down the street.
