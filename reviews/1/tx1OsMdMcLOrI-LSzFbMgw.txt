Obese guy wearing a king's crown at the counter.  What the heck?  Drive thu was the slowest I've seen in my entire life, and I was given a disingenuous apology from the staff who noted that an employee "just walked out".  No attempt to make it right, no free food, no discounted order, nothing.  This is place is hard to beat.  Interior is very dirty too.
