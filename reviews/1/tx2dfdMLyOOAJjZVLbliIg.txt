I need to start by saying I'm super surprised by all the stars this place has!!! First, the menu displayed online is nothing like the one they offer! Second, the place was so quiet we had to move tables so the people next to us would stop hanging on our every word! Third, "the service" our waitress was "channing" atleast thats what our receipt said we would have known had she spent more time seeing what we needed or wanted then pushing us out! We had to go get our own utensils after asking for them and she brought us 1spoon, I had to get up and find her to get a beer, she left our table while we were still ordering and I had to put in my food order way after the rest of our party! Then she charged me for everything thing....the tiniest side of onions,ranch, and $4 for four microwaved pieces of bacon literally the bacon you buy at the store all thats needed is a few minutes in the microwave! she was horrible but the food wasn't any better either! We visited this place a few,years back and remember it being good so today we were excited to revisit and find our dollars of our now passed grandfather and add one for our newest addition,but it was a total disappointment! Not only did we not add a dollar, but we all regret the hour drive there, the total waste of money for even going in the first place! We have no intentions on returning again either! Thanks for nothing tortilla flat!
