Worst Mexican food ever!! Do not eat here under any circumstances. Machaca - horrible.

#1 combo for lunch. Two tacos. The shredded chicken was just nasty and the shredded beef was like beef chowder in a taco. The tortillas were served barely warmed. 

Salsa - tasted spaghetti sauced based.

Should have listened to the yelp reviews!!!
