This is the second time I have gotten sick the morning after eating at Julioberto's on 32nd Street and McDowell Road.  I am a fit and healthy individual whose immune system is high - I rarely get sick at all during the year, even when the flu is being passed around.  However, I have noticed that the morning after eating here that I have a headache and a runny nose.

This isn't extreme food sickness such as diarrhea, but more along the lines of employees here not washing their hands perhaps, or dishes properly to pass on the common cold.  The first time I was sick, I gave it the benefit of the doubt, but twice is a bit too much for me and I won't give it a 3rd chance.  In fact, I'm staying away from all "Berto's" restaurants.
