My Husband and I just finished eating the buy one get one free dinner from the Special Tuesday menu. We both ordered the number 5/ Taco, Tostada, enchilada. We hadn't been eaten there for a long time. When are meal came, the enchilada was bland, but the real disappointment was the tostada and the Taco they were drowned in wet salad that made our food soggy and impossible to eat. Plus when I dug into my tostada, there were no beans, only wilted cooked salad. I showed the waitress my tostada and asked her for another one, she argued with me and said I can only give you a side of beans. The food was horrific, I will not go back. Manuel is a thousand times better and much tastier. My husband is going to call the owner tomorrow and tell them about how we had hardly any meat or beans and the salad was wet and glumpy as well as all the food shoved together in a soggy mess.
