This place is obviously for tourists who don't know their way around Vegas. When we got there, they seated us I'm the dining room because it was Latin night. A place that serves tacos has a Latin night? It turns out there was a band who began laying in as we were leaving (which means we could have say in the dining room). The coctel was more like canned clams, canned crab, strangely halved shrimp in a ketchup sauce. The tacos were way overpriced, as was the beer. For the price of the carne asada, I expected some flavor and no gristle, but the most flavor I got from one was when I bit into the hidden lime. If you want some authentic Mexican food, get farther away from the strip and go somewhere that has actual recipes.
