This place couldn't suck more. Waiter took drink order from one of us at the table then walked away. Never took our food order. Numerous staff standing around on a Friday night and the owner is getting drunk. Open kitchen so we could see that the cooks don't wear gloves and were repeatedly wiping their hands on their pants.
