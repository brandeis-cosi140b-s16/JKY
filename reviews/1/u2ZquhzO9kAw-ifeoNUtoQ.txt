I quit. Gone are the days of bringing in all of my friends and family to eat at yummy Sylvia's. My boyfriend and I used to go AT LEAST three times a month, but the service just kept getting worse and worse. We stopped going, but really missed the street tacos and flour chips and salsa, so we decided to try again. 

There was about 10 minutes left of happy hour. By the time our waitress came it there was only about 5 minutes left. I asked if I could get a margarita on happy hour and she said it was too late. We ordered flour chips... which we never received. Then, our waitress disappeared for a pretty ridiculous long amount of time. She apologized when she came back explaining that she was held up in the bar section. That's fine. Stuff happens. Then we finally get to put in our dinner order. We were going to split something, but I really wanted to try a navajo taco. Then she disappeared forever again. When we got our food my navajo taco was SUPER burnt, and completely not the kind that I had ordered. We had been there so long at that point that we decided to just go ahead and share. The burrito was good, but not worth the wait. 

Never. Going. Back.
