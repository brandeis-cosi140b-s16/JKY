ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING

Too bad I cannot give this less than one star.  I remember a much better eating experience a year ago before a flight and now I wonder if they were using the same stock of food from a year ago!

Service was awful.  We didn't even get our sodas until about 15 minutes after ordering them.  I ordered the chips+salsa and the veggie tacos.  I think they dump the chips in the trash and serve the bag cut up to look like chips instead.  No flavor, no salt, stale - come on at least heat them up to fool me!  The salsa is 'charred tomato' and it was cold as ice with once again no flavor.  I take that back, it did taste like the inside of a can of tomatoes.

The server said the veggie tacos come with a side of rice and black beans.   What I did not realize was that the taco 'shells' themselves were silver dollar flat cold 'patties' that looked like someone took instant grits and formed pancakes.  The veggies appeared to be pulled out of someone else's order and it was apparent they dont clean their grill.  

Oh and lets not forget the scoop of mush they called rice.  Those black beans, well yes there were some - exactly 9.  Yes, nine whole black beans on TOP of my rice.  This left a huge empty space on my plate which was instead occupied by a small plastic container of more ice cold salsa.   I was begging for salt, pepper, dust, sand - anything to add some flavor to the meal that tasted like crushed ice made from dirty water.

DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME HERE!
