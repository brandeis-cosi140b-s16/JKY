Cant believe all the rave reviews on here! If you like to eat dry, chewy tasteless meat in your tacos....this place is for you. If you like to eat with plastic utensils in a dirty restaurant and pay $3 for a coke....this is for you.
If you like grimy walls, dirty floors and a salsa bar with half the choices empty....go for it. The meat in the street tacos were overcooked, chewy and tasteless. The taco meal for $9 came with 2 small tacos, and a thimble full of beans and a similar amount of rice. On a piece of paper in a plastic tray. You have to get your own plastic utensils and napkins...which I dont mind, just not at these prices. The famous salsa bar was half empty and I had to ask for forks as they had run out.
Poor, very poor. Dont waste your money.
