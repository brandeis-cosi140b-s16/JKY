Very disappointed and somewhat disgusted with our meals. Not a good sign when your burger comes out in 4 minutes. Absolutely no flavor and a dog food like texture. He either knew we were coming and what we would order so it was ready for us or buys the already cooked beef patties. I had been here before and had the supposed world famous chili., wasn't impressed. During our meal I look up and see a head of a Havelina mounted on the wall right over our table that was caked with dust and cobwebs. The place really needs a serious dusting and cleaning. Just because you have old stuff doesn't give you the excuse to be so filthy especially in an eating establishment. I recommend popping your head in the door for a look see but I will never eat there again.i really couldn't finish my food. I hear the Town is for sale
