You can do a lot better for a lot less money in Maricopa, and that's saying something given how few resteraunts there are in town.   The food is ok though over priced.  The setting is ok.  It tries to be fancy but isn't, still, it's not disgusting or anything.  Service is where they fall off the table altogether.   The owner is a loudmouth who attacks people with her politics.  Her son is a fairly
open racist who made totally inappropriate remarks to my table, including insulting an ethnic group that was sitting there.  Her kitchen staff has twice gotten in fights/arguments while we are there and feel free to interrupt the already annoying owner at our table.
