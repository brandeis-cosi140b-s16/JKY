I think they need to change the name from "Authentic Mexican" to "Authentic Microwave".   I had the worst Chili Relleno of my life.   We got there just before 6 on Friday night and the place was packed with people waiting to be seated.  We chose to sit at the bar on the outside side.   It was dark and the lights out there were not working.  Seeing the menu was close to impossible.       We ordered 10 dollar Cadillac Margaritas which were the bar $5.95 Margarita with a Grand Mariner side shot.   No special Tequila.  We then ordered our food........my chili Relleno and my husband's chili verde burrito.   When the food came within 5 minutes the red flag went up.   There is no way to make a chili Relleno in less than 5 minutes.  Really???  It's was COLD on the INSIDE.   Best part of my meal......the rice.  Sad!    My husbands chili verde was tender but someone in the kitchen spilled an entire shaker of salt on it.    A very disappointing $50.00 dinner.   Won't be back.
