Service terribly slow.  It took 45 minutes to get fish tacos and chicken enchiladas!  People who had arrived after us got served before we did.  The margarita was too sweet.  My fish tacos were really bland. The fish was battered and fried like "fish and chips" fish that was chopped up and thrown in a tortilla with some cabbage and chipotle mayo on top.
