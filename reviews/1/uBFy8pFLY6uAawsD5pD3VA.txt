I agree with everyone on here who said the food is great but management sucks.  We went in with a gift card we got for our wedding with the person who gave it to us and other friends.  It had never been used and should have had $60 on it--the server came back and said it only had $18 when we were paying the bill.  My husband wanted to handle it discretely because we were with a group, so he paid the server and spoke with the "manager" (stupid--he should never have paid until this was resolved).  

The guy who bought it pulled up his bank statement on his phone to show he paid $60 and we had never been in there--so there was definitely a "mistake" made by the employee who sold it.  The manager did not know what to do and said he would talk to their computer guy when he came in later--it's been 5 DAYS now and no resolution, not even a phone call from the manager to let us know he's on it.  We have had  to call several different managers who all play dumb. I'm sorry, but this is theft--selling an $18 gift card for $60--and poor management for not handling it seriously. Too bad because we had a great brunch but I don't trust the honesty or the competency of people there. DO NOT EVER BUY a gift card from this restaurant.

Update: Filed a complaint against this company with BBB and Attorney General's office.
