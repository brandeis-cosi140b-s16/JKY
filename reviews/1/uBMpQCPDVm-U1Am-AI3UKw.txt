I love Macayos! When the Office Christmas Party was coming up and it was suggested that we have the party there, I was more than happy to call and set it up. The night was a horrid mess! We booked the patio for the evening and ordered the meal in advance. When I arrived I was told we would be sharing the patio with another big party and when I asked to see a manager the one I spoke to answered all my questions with "I don't know" and then ran away to never be seen for the rest of the evening. The heaters were broken and no one let us know in advance and the food was cold. The servers were great! They were nice, accommodating, and quick to be found. Management should take notes from them. I was informed that the General Manager was in the building and when I asked to speak with her, she never came out. I will never be hosting another party there and I will go to a better location the next time I am craving their food.
