3rd time in the place.  3rd time with terrible service.  This time we sat at the bar.  Literally.  6 bartenders were there and we sat there for 12 minutes and not once did anyone even acknowledge we were there let alone take our order.  I then asked a waitress that walked bye to get the manager.  Was told the excuse it was shift change.  I said. Oh. So for these 12 minutes and going you have 6 bartenders standing around not doing crap.  And we looked at them all they were all shooting the sh*! And not helping anyone.  I guess they did not want our money.  Walked down to double Barrell who had more people, was acknowledged when we walked in, had a beer within 2 minutes.  Amazing.
