I can't believe people like this palce.  In the early 90's my parents use to take me to a different location.  I hated the food and had not been back since 1995.  Recently I was told that this location was much better and the quality was great.  So I decided to give them a try.  Once again the food was horrible.  First off, cheese sauce wtf?? You have signs all over the place about how you make everything fresh.  Why not put real cheese on the nachos?  The beans are probably the worst beans I have ever had! I am from California and Arizona's attempt at mexican food is just sad.  Why waste time and money here.  If you want fake bad mexican food just go to taco bell.
