my wife told me to not go to filiberto's.  i should have listened.  but, being relatively new to the valley (moved here 2 years ago) and a big fan of mexican food, i wanted to try it out.

i'm never...eating...there...again.

large portions of bland, tasteless slop.  the refried beans lacked texture.  the burrito could have been made by a bobble-head doll.  it completely lacked any kind of thought behind it.  ground hamburger rolled up in an amateurish tortilla with the token green pepper.  that was it.  my one question is, how are they still in business?  i'm repulsed by their existence and continued success.  taco bell is an infinitely better option than filiberto's.
