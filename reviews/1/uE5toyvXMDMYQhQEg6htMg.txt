My first (and only) time there.   It was tired,but clean inside.  The staff was friendly, but very sloooow (it was not very busy).  I ordered checked fajitas, but was told later they were out of chicken.  I switched to shrimp fajitas.  A few shrimps were delivered along with some very oily green peppers, and a single tortilla.  The margarita was weak.
