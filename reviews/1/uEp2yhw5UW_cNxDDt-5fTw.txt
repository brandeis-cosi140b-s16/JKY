I was there today after 1:00 with very few people in the establishment. There wasn't a clean table in the entire restaurant. Further, there was food on the floor and it was downright filthy. After asking for a table to be cleaned so my friend and I could sit and eat, the cashier very lazily slopped a wet towel on a table and threw the trash from the table onto the floor. While the food is OK, this place needs management desperately! Will never return!
