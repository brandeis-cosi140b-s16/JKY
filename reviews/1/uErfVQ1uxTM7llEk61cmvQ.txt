If I could ever tell a person where to not go is here. From the horrible food to the manager that makes the staff pay for any meals that are returned for any reason. ..yes you read that correctly.  The manager is just effing outrageous.  If I could judge the food alone I would give 1.5 stars however the whole experience I'd give a negative 10.
