This location in the airport is trash. The meat (steak) was sooooooooo damnnnnnnnn dry the flour tortilla was even hard WTF. It's like the food had been sitting out for days. Not to mention we asked for salsa they only had green and even that was even a cream white / green color we tried it and I had to hawk a luggie it tasted so rancid.
