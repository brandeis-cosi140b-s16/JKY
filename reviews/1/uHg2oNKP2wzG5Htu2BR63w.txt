If I could give less than one star, I would. 

Came here on Taco Tuesday. Sat at a "barrel" table. A sharp metal part of the barrel not only stabbed my leg, but ripped my jeans. The server, who happened to be the "manager" initially condescendingly pacified me by saying, "sorry sweetie." Umm... First of all, you need to fix the problem, so no one else gets hurt. After asking about seeing a manager, his tune changed and he wanted to know the problem, when I explained he needed to fix the sharp edge and not pacify me, he came back with duct tape and said he'd take care of my tab. That's great, but my tab was WAY LESS than the coat of my jeans. 

The service was terrible. The tacos were the worst I've ever had. Hardly any meat, mostly lettuce and tortilla. 

Needless to say-- I won't be back. I recommend going to Native, in the same parking lot, on the same night for wing night.
