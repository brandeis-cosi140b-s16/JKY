Ordered one of the combo and asked if they could substitute the steak for chicken as I don't eat steak and the cashier girl said no problem. Order came and it was all steak. Went back to cashier (a different one was there) and told her this was wrong and she said that they can only substitute 1 for chicken (none of the item had chicken)... So they refused to fix my order. After going there many times, I will not go back or recommend to anyone...
