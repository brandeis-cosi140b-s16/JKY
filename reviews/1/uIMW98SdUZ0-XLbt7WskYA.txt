First let me start of saying this is the first 1 star review I have given, and the only other two star I gave for a food place was because of horrible service.  This one the service was about a 3.5 stars but the food, the food, OMG it was as horrible as it gets.  My wife and I have never had worse.  

I will say we both got different kinds of steaks, not normally what we get at a Mexican restaurant but they were on special so we decided to try it.  This place has no business cooking steaks in my opinion.  They never asked how we like our steaks and they came out extremely overcooked and dry.  Without A1 I couldn't have even gotten it down, and I always taste a couple bites before asking for steak sauce.  My wife's was the same, and she couldn't even finish hers.  Also I would think one would expect a Mexican steak to have some type of seasoning, but absolutely nothing, so it was also the blandest steak I have ever had a restaurant.  

My special also came with shrimp, again horrible, the shrimp was not even deveined, had no seasoning and was extremely dry.  In hind sight I wish I had taken a picture of my plate because you could see just how plain everything was, no garnishment whatsoever.  

The salsa was thinner than tomato soup and really not that much of a taste, and the chips were not at all fresh chips that one would expect in a sit down Mexican restaurant.  

Really the only reason for even one star is my daughter did like her rice and black beans and the server was OK.
