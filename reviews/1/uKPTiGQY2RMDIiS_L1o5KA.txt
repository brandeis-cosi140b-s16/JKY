I ordered some "fresas con crema" and the little green leaves on the strawberry were in the dessert. It was the most disgusting thing ever. I don't usually complain about hygiene but this place is always dirty. I remembered the other time I came here, and a very sick woman was serving the ice cream. I mean she couldn't even talk.  Wish they would improve because I actually like their "paletas de nuez." Definitely won't come back again.
