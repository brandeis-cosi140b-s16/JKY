Ughhhh!! go anywhere else but here! food was bland bland bland and horribly greasy! not a fresh item to be had. It was like drunk college food only worse.  It takes some serious work to mess up tacos rice and beans in my opinion but Valle Luna more than succeeded. Way too overpriced for the junk they serve. All I wanted were two veggie tacos and i got the greasiest hard tacos ever that were falling apart with refried beans from a can and not a vegetable to be had. Rice was tasteless and horribly mushy. We will never be back. Honestly I wish that I had complained but our server was too nice and we were so intent on leaving that I just did not...save your wallet and your stomachs and skip Valle Luna!!
