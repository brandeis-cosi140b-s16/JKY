I convinced my husband to try this place, as I am not a fan of Roberto's. Now, I'm not a fan of this place either. My husband thought the food was ok, but mentioned we won't be going back.
I ordered the Carne Asada quesadilla; very greasy. Per the menu it came with guac, pico de gallo and sour cream. I asked for these items, on the side. I get to the window, get my receipt and they charged me $0.99 ea for the guac and sour cream. When I asked about it, she said she thought I wanted a side order of each of these items. When I explained what her menu said, she agreed to refund me the money.  I get home with my order and there is no sour cream or guac; so much for it "coming with it".
