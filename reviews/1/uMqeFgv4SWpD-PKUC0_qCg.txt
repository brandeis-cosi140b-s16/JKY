We went here today around 5 o'clock on a Saturday. There were six adults and three children. The chips (some soggy) were cold and uneventful. The bean dip and salsa - complementary, we just okay.  The tea was okay. The margaritas that my friend had was lacking in flavor and booze. The Shirley temples were sort of flat and just okay.  The crispy cheese crisp was alright. The cheese just sort of reminds me of melted candle wax. There's nothing special or flavorful about any of the cheese. Chicken taco was bland and boring, boiled chicken, with no flavor. The beef taco was okay. The food was not hot. It came out just warm. The refried beans were just alright. One of our friends had the fried ice cream. The picture on the menu makes it look really big. But in reality it's very small.

We liked going to the Arriba on Camelback, and we were expecting good service and pretty flavorful food like we get there. This Arriba was very bland and unsatisfying. I will avoid the place. Maybe the Camelback one is still good. But this one just tastes like boxed macaroni and cheese. Everything had pretty much no flavor.
