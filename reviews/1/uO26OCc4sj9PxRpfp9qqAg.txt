This place is an "old school" Mesa staple that is always packed... with white people, go figure. That should've been the first red flag to walk out. However after years of avoiding this place I was caught in moment of weakness and proximity. Bad decision. Disgusting!  

Sent back two plates. One was cold and the other was a disaster, like someone threw up on my plate. I just walked out. El Charro needs to change its name to El Chafa or El Chorros.
