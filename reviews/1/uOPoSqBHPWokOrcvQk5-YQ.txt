Just left here.  We are excited to have a nice family dinner... Chips and salsa was food and after 10 min we order steak tacos for my husband, a quesadilla for my son and spinach enchiladas for myself. My family's food arrived quickly; however my order was absent without any comment. After ten min the waiter came back to check how all the food was tasting when I let him know that my food still hasn't arrived. Another 10 min went by before my food finally arrived (20 min after my families food arrived!!!) when I asked the waiter why exactly my food was served 20 min after the other food he ally stated that he had messed up my order. When the bill arrived he states that he split my entree price in half and that seemed fair to him.  I am not really sure what exactly the fair past meant? Too bad as the food was decent
