Went for brunch, and ordered a burrito with red sauce and rice. The rice was hard and tasteless, and the burrito was bland. My son who is 11 ordered a breakfast burrito, and the lady taking our order asked if he wanted one or two. He replied with two. When we picked up our food the breakfast burritos were each the size of his head with a serving of chips and refried beans. When I asked about why she would offer something like that to a family of two I was told it was already made and no refunds. Never expected to get scamed at a hotel resturant.
