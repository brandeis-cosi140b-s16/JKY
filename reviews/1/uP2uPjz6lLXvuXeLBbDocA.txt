Well...i have given this place many chances and the customer service just seems to be getting worse, not better. On the last three visits there have been a problem with each visit. Two weeks ago I was over charged for a large combo. I was charged 2.59 for chips salsa and drink plus an extra $2 for the large drink. I didn't realize it until after she ran my card. The cashier looked dumbfounded and confused as to my concern. Eventually, the manager came and refunded the difference. He didn't seem overly concerned his cashiers were over charging customers. 
The next visit I arrive well after lunch rush and before the after dinner, they were out of the pico de gallo. The manager was in the back cleaning and looked unconcerned. The manager(same guy as before) came out and said it would be 2-3 minutes. I choose to wait(I had a feeling i should have said forget it at that point). 10 minutes later he comes out with the pico to put on my cold burrito. No apology for the wait. Pay for my food and go to the drink dispenser and its almost all of the low calorie options were empty. Mentioned it to the cashier and the manager came and gave excuses as to why it was empty. I couldn't deal with it at this point and i asked for my money back. Went to Potbelly two doors down. Came back again today hoping, begging that they could get it together because their food is good.  Made it through the order process and when i asked for an extra cup of salsa with my chips and salsa he (same manager) said there would be an extra charge for the extra cup of salsa. He said this was a new policy. At this point, I just sat down and ate my burrito and half my chips because i ran out of salsa. I tried to give this place a shot because its locally owned by a guy named Brad I believe. I am for the local guy over the corporate giants but i doubt i will be back. Go to Chipotle or Potbelly instead.
