Chronic Tacos has the same sort of layout as Willy's, but it is in no way as good as Willy's! The service is horrible, the prices aren't great and the food is not good. 

My boyfriend got a chicken burrito and I got a veggie burrito.. We weren't expecting too much because we had read the yelp reviews before going in there.. But they didn't taste nice at all and my veggie burrito had a piece of meat in it. 

Thats all... 

Id recommend walking 5 minutes down the road to El Taco Feliz!
