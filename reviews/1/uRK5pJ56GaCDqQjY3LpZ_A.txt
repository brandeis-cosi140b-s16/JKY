Here's a tip, don't eat here. The food was bland and cold. The cheese in the cheese enchilada wasn't even melted. It was a tortilla full of cold shredded cheese. Also, the refried beans were awful -- I've had instant refried beans that held their consistency better.

We waited 20 minutes for this "food", and there were only three other occupied tables.

Also, this is the only place I've ever been to that when you order "chips and salsa" puts the salsa ON the chips. If you can call it salsa -- chopped tomato and onion with cilantro barely even qualifies as Pico de gallo, it sure as hell isn't salsa. But thanks for making my chips soggy.

This is the first Filiberto's I've been to. I'll try another just to rule out one pathetic location. But I'm never going back to this one.
