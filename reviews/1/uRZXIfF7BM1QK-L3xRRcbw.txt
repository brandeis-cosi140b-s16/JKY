I'm sorry but this place is awful.  We've tried it 4 times and tonight we just said never again.  Maybe it's because we've had Mexican food in Phoenix but this place has TERRIBLE service and it's ridiculously expensive and LOUD.  The view of the strip is nice if you can get one of those tables but the food is just bad.  Tried something new (again) tonight to see if I'm picking the wrong things and it's just the food and the cooking (tonight tried vegetarian fajitas and it was all green peppers, unbelievable that there were no other veggies but a few onions).  3 of us went to dinner and they forgot our soup and we sat there getting ignored when we needed a bill so we could leave the place.  Thumbs down, save your money and go down the street to Robertos.
