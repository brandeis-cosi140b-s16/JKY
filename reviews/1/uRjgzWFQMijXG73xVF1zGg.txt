Do not eat at this place! I made this mistake 2 times in the last 6 months once for breakfast and the other for lunch and every time it was the same run down, mildew smelling, gross food, and worst of all THE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE SERVICE!! Well today I thought I'd give it one last try so myself and some family that was visiting went in today an hour and a half before they closed. We walked into an empty restaurant with only workers sitting and talking to each other. Not one of them cared to stand up and help or even try to serve us they just looked and threw dirty looks at us like if we showed up 2 minutes before closing and now we're going to keep them from going home. We asked for a highchair and menus and the guy literally mocked us like a 5 year old and walked away!!! After 10 min of no one helping, no menu, and no high chair we decided to leave. Never again will I walk into this nasty place again and I will do my best to spread all the bad things about their establishment and horrible service to anyone I can.
