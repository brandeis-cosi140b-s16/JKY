I was very disappointed by my latest experience at this Garcia restaurant. I had purchased a local deal voucher for a $24 dinner for two. I was not aware that the voucher had an expiration date. When I printed the voucher I realized it had expired. We went to the restaurant anyway and talked to the front desk where we were told that the voucher would still be good. We were very surprised when our bill came to find out that we had to pay for the difference between what our voucher had cost and the very inflated promotional value of the meal. Thus we had to pay a second time.
So beware of Internet local deals: they do expire and the restaurants have no qualms making you pay twice! I used to go to Garcia relatively often. I guess I will part with them. The real beauty of this is that the manager tried to blame the local deal agency: they were the bad guys!!! In the end: Garcia profited from the deal more than anyone else. No one is dupe.
