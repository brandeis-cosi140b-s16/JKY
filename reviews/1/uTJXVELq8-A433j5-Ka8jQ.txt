Here I am, sitting at a table with my buddy at this location, writing this review because we are bored. It is 6p on Sunday, and this is the worst service that we've had in a long time! I only see two waitress in the whole place (one is the bartender), and we need refills. By the way, they don't have ground beef? 

It's now been 1 hour since we ordered, and nothing. 

Finally got our food. Nothing special. Expected better! Took forever for our bill. We won't be coming back anytime soon.
