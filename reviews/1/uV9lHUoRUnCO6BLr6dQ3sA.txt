My hubby and I stopped here yesterday for a late lunch.  The place was recommended by the Direct TV tech that had done some repairs at our house.   Boy were we ever disappointed!  My husband ordered the pork tacos and had requested flour tortillas but they came out with corn.  After calling our waiter over, we had asked him to change the tortillas to flour as we had originally requested.  He said not problem and within a few minutes, they were back on the table.  That being said, my husband said the pork was dry and lacked flavoring.  I had ordered the cane asada which came out very dry (some of the meat was actually curled up and crisped) and really lacking in flavor.  The beans and rice were just so, so.  Would not recommend although the staff was very friendly and helpful.  We will not be returning.
