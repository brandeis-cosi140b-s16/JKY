This just may be the worst Mexican food I've ever eaten, and I've eaten quite a bit of Mexican in my life.

My husband and I visited on a Thursday night. We waited for about 5 minutes in the foyer area before just seating ourselves in the dining room. Maybe we should have picked the bar, since we ended up waiting another 15 minutes before a waiter came to take our drink order. The service did not improve as the night went on; we had to ask several times for drink refills and finally for the check. 

My husband had a burrito and I ordered the Carnitas De Res. He was not impressed, but did not dislike his entree. I, on the other hand, could not eat more than a couple bites of mine. The steak had a strange plastic-y flavor. I assume it was just old meat. The cactus salad was also sad and strange tasting. I filled up on the beans and rice and we left the restaurant as quickly as possible. 

Salsa's, down the street in Ayrsley, is priced a bit higher. However, the food actually edible. We will definitely be skipping Don Pedro in the future.
