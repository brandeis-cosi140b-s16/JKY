I went there three times and I just don't understand why this restaurant has such high rankings. I think the answer is the low standards of college kids.
My opinion is that this food just doesn't taste good. The only thing I tried that was ok was a Mexican Taco, but everything else I tried (a couple of burritoes and different tacos) are not appealing at all. Meat is dry and has ligaments in it, not enough veggies, and just weird weird taste.
