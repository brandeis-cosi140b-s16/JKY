This is a serious matter that needs to be addressed.. I've had my fair share of chipotle, and this one by far is the most stingiest.. Us Fat ass American's love chipotle, for the taste and most importantly, the unnecessary portions! This location doesn't like to meet that criteria... It saddens me deeply to receive a burrito, or burrito bowl with a couple of pieces of meat.. This happens every time I go to this location... You guys need to step up your damn game..
