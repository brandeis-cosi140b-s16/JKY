My husband and I meet up with 4 other friends when we come through Arizona. We picked this  spot based on location, Margaritas and we all love Mexican food. From the outside it looks like an authentic Mexican restaurant, but when we stepped inside, we thought we were at a Chucky Cheese. The place was crawling with kids, and was really loud and junky looking. None the less, we sat down and finally got our drinks. We ordered a variety of food so we could all just kinda share. The waitress acted like she was doing us a favor by even taking our order. We finally got our very watered down margaritas and our disgusting appetizers. My husband and I switched to beer so we at least knew we were getting some alcohol. Nobody ever came by to take our plates when we were done. I mean ever. They must have cleared the table after they kicked us out. Yes that's right, we got kicked out. The place advertises that it is open until 10:00 pm. They started putting chairs up on the empty tables at about 8:30 and by 9:15 they actually shut the lights out on us. We were not being loud or obnoxious or doing anything wrong, they just wanted to get us out of there for whatever reason. So we continued to drink in the dark and have our fun, but by 9:30 we realized we weren't going to get any more drinks, so we decided to leave. So I guess technically we weren't kicked out, but when a restaurant turns the lights out on you, it's a pretty big hint to get the F out! We would never ever eat there again, but the way we were treated was comical and gave us material to laugh about for years to come. So for that one reason we thank you Raul and Teresa. BTW there are two locations and I have no idea how the other one is, but this was the 1363 N. Litchfield one.
