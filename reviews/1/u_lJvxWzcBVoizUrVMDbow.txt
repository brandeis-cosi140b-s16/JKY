One star is being generous in my opinion and only because the pre-meal chips were fresh and good.. We had a table of 8 there today. First of all my order was incorrect. I ordered a cheese enchilada and a chunky beef burro on the side. The enchilada was very small and had what appeared to be ground beef in the enchilada sauce....quite surprising! There was no lettuce and tomato garnish (which a little was provided upon request) on either item and the burro arrived enchilada style with the same sauce. As I cut into it...hmmm....where's the beef?  It was shredded chicken! The service was acceptable and I was not charged for the incorrect order which was promptly returned. Some of my group received cold beans and some said the rice was not very good either. Sorry Abulos, no return visits from any of our group or from friends and family that we can steer away from your establishment.
