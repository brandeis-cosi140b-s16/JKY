What's up with not handing out utensils with drive thru orders? Cutting costs? Pretty inconsistent. Those working the drive thru window couldn't care less if they get your order right. One morning I had to wait 10 minutes while the chick was too busy refilling hot sauce, meanwhile my food is sitting in the pass. Pay attention?
