Warning! Dangerous food safety. Had the three chicken combo. They just opened for the day. Beans and rice are literally cold. Which means they take them from the refrigerator and put them in the steam table to heat. It is not a safe practice and the food just grows bacteria instead of reaching safe heat temperatures.  Going in the trash #unsafefoodhandling
