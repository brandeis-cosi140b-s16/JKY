Wow.  Just terrible.  I was here with my family and it was beyond bad.  First of all, the owners aren't Mexican and the total lack of authenticity can be tasted in the food.  The salsa is thick and goopy.  The main course literally taste like what I would prepare at home by going to the Mexican section of Bashas and throwing foods together.  I'm a white guy who can't cook.  I so love Mexican food and this was a big disappointment.  

We have recently been going to Mucha Lucha Taco Shop with unbelievable food.  The owners and everyone who works there are Mexican and half the clientele are Mexican.  Now that is good Mexican food.  This is not that.  I will never be back.  I'll stick with Mucha Lucha, Carolinas and Los Dos Molinos.
