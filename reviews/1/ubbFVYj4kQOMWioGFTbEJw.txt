We went on a Tuesday eve at approximately 8:00p. Took 30 mins to be seated, waiter was quick and friendly when taking our order. This is where it took a dive. We ordered one appetizer, two entrees and a few drinks. The entrees took OVER an HOUR to come out after our order, the appetizer took an additional 35 minutes after that!! Seriously?!? It was a Tuesday, the place wasn't even packed! The waiter kept disappearing when we tried to get the check. When all was settled and done, we finally got to leave at about 10:30p! It's absolutely ridiculous to spend that amount of time in a very casual dining restaurant. A complete waste of time and money. Will NEVER go again! I gave it one stars because the food was edible. Barely.

Sorry for the very delayed review folks, this was from Aug of 2013. I can't imagine they've done a complete overhaul since then, though one could hope.
