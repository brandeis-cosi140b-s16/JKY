I will never eat here again. Ordered to go. Food was frozen when we went to eat it less than 5 minutes later and it wasn't made correctly. Instead of trying to fix the problem, we were told it was our fault it was cold because they told us it would be ready in 15 minutes and we showed up in 20 minutes. Also we were told it was cold because I added sour cream and guac to the burrito. Any other restaurante I've been to that adds those sides seems to be able to serve the food warm. Customer service was awful and the food didn't ever taste semi-good. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.
