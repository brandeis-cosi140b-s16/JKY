Would NEVER eat here again. My wife, sister-in-law and I all ate here last night. The service was great, and the food seemed to taste okay... About 6 hours later, all 3 of us were puking our guts out. The only thing that we all had in common was the meat, beans, and rice.

I called in and talked to a manager "Steve" the next morning, and he didn't sound concerned at all, the first words out of his mouth were, "We served that all day long and our health inspections and sanitation practices are excellent." Not and "I'm sorry" or let me look into this at all. He was more concerned about covering his rear end. 

I would avoid this place...
