Quite possibly one of the worst meals I've had in Charlotte. Not only were they basically out of beer (yes all of them) but it took almost 30 minutes to get queso, we never got our nachos and eventually ended up canceling the order, and then the enchiladas were fair at best and the rice horribly overcooked. We were told by our waiter that the management "isn't that great" and that the kitchen "is really behind" but the restaurant was half full at most. Oh and we're still waiting on the waters we ordered when we first got there.
