Went to a car show event here and the food took forever the waitress was rude asking if we were done when we hadn't even redirected or food and on top of that the rice was still hard :/ she forgot to put our order in so it took about an hour to get our food... I was tempted to approach the manager but we saw the that the news was going to interview him so we didn't want to embarrass him. In the reviewprofile I wrote customer service... I would go back but if I do I hope for a different positive experience. Seriously. 
I feel bad but my wife was remind me that I'm the one paying, I'm not getting stuff for free,  so yes we deserve better service.
