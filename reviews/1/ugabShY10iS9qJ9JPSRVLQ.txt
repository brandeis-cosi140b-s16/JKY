This was our first time at this restaurant. It was a thirty minute wait on a Monday night. But lots of open tables. Horrible service. Never received any drink refills or on the chips and salsa either. Out of four people that ordered, only 1 of us were satisfied with our food. Completely overrated. Would not recommend or go back.
