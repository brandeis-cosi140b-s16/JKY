Don't eat here. I found a yellow finger nail in my soft shell taco. I was eating there so I took it up to the counter to show the manager who acted as though it really wasn't a big deal. In fact he offered to refund me for the taco, not the meal I bought, just the taco. Um..... Thanks but no thanks. I've never eaten  there since. What made me even more mad was I wrote a letter to the owner regarding the situation and never heard a response. Very poor professionalism.....not even an apology!!!! It's too bad I loved taco johns.
