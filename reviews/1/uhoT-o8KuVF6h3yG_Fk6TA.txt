I used to regularly eat at the Los Dos Molinos in Mesa, this place is nothing like the original family owned place. The waiters were apathetic and the food was cold.  As someone else mentioned the margaritas tasted like cheap lemonade.  Our cheese crisp had no more than a tablespoon of cheese  We had a party of 6 (4adults/ 2 kids), when the $120 bill arrived they had added in the tip but had not indicated it, and had left open a spot to add in the tip.  Only when we asked for the itemized bill did we realize the tip had been added in.  Our out-of-town guests were extremely disappointed and as a long-time-ago regular of LDM I too was extremely disappointed. I will never go back.
