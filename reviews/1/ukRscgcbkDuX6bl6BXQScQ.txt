Visited here today and I was extremely dissatisfied with the food and service.  I ordered a Taco salad which came like a bowl of soup.  It had an awful taste to the point where I threw most of it away.  The server sat us and never asked if we wanted drinks until we had to flag her down. 
This is my first and last visit!!
