One thing I learned about Mexican food, is LEAVE IT ALONE!!! Border Grill tries to take Mexican food to the next level? Why! All they did is screwed it up! I will take a taco from the local taco shop any day before I come back here again. First they will give you a very salty chips and salsa, we asked for some with no salt and their reply was sorry but they put salt when they get out of the fryer! Then they will charge you for water! WHAT!! Because it was filtered water. BIG DEAL! We ordered their taquitos, tacos, tortilla soup. Seems like they do not understand how Mexican food should taste like! Just being there for a few minutes I already know what they are trying to do? They are trying to make them self a higher class then any other Mexican restaurant! Sorry but this place just can't cut it! Come down to Phoenix, San Diego, or Los Angeles. And your local mom and pops taco shack will turn this place out!!
