Ketchup with some spice, that was their version of salsa. 10+ minutes until we could order, and it was not even good.

Our visit started with a beggar outside of the door asking for money. We entered and were surprised by the pleasant decor. We waited a few min and were then seated.

Once we were seated we had a good amount of time to look at the menu and the waitress took our drink order but was not even interested in our food order.  A bus boy delivered s very small basket of chips and carafe of the ketchup based salsa.

We finished this basket long before our order was taken.  I ordered a Chillies rellno $4.99 a la cart. Most items are a bit pricier here.

It took some time for our food to arrive. When it did I was surprised by the small size of the portion. The quality was also on the lower end the breading was not crisp and there was little to no sauce on it, very little cheese inside and a over-sized dollop of sour cream on top.

We had to flag down the waitress for more water and chips which also took some time to come.

Even the bill paying process was slow.
