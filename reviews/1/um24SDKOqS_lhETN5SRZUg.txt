I'm getting really tired of going to restaurants and being treated like dirt.  

I placed my order and upon hearing the price thought it seemed high.  I paid first and after getting the receipt I discovered they charged me for a large burrito.  I told the cashier what I actually ordered - a mini burrito-  and instead of being apologetic, she was visibly upset.

Upon getting all of my food from the cashier, she angrily said, "they gave you a whole burrito instead."  She wouldn't even look at me and quickly left.

I understand that this restaurant deals with a lot of high school kids.  Well lady, you can treat them like that- you don't treat adults in such a rude manner.

Crossed off the list for good.  Oh and the food?  The pastor taco had chunks of fat in it and the beef taco was tiny.  The burrito was not very good either.

A hidden gem?  Nonsense!
