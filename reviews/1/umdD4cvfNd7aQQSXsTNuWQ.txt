I was so excited to try this new, nearby Mexican restaurant, only to be thoroughly disappointed. The staff was not welcoming. The prices are not competitive. The portions were ridiculously small. A burrito double the size is available at Gordo's a stone's throw away and for a lesser price! The salsa did not knock my socks off. My Enchiladas had barely any filling and the sauce on top was slight and dry. I will not be returning.
