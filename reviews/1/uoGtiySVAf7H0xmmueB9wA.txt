Ordered drinks, waiter was in a rush to get us out moment we sat down. Had to send one drink back twice because there was something weird floating in the drink (dirty ice?) third time was not the charm, zero alcohol in drink. waiter new it was a BS drink because he didn't flinch when we told him there was nothing in the drink. 

Sammy would not be proud, he needs to drive faster than 55 to come back and get this place in order.
