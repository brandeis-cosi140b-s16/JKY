I was in a great mood and primed to enjoy this place.....uhhhh....did not happen. Sooo disappointed.
Walked in at lunchtime today...3/24/15.  One other customer in the place.
Was met by a lethargic bartender who informed us we could sit where we wanted. Great! We sat outside at the cleanest table we could find. Ordered margaritas. The table was covered in salt and sticky. Margaritas showed up...they were pretty tasty.... ordered food and asked the barkeep to bring a wet rag to wipe the table....he came back and took one slow swipe by each of us with a dirty rag. Then proceeded to bring salsa and chips and two plates. Both plates had dried up green food debris on them. We cancelled order and split. It really was dirty. Can you imagine what the kitchen must look like if that is the best they can present to clients?
I am not a picky eater either....I have raised livestock all my life....hard to imagine all the junk I have ingested with dirty horse hands...probably am immune to just about everything...but this place was below sub-standard. Beware.
