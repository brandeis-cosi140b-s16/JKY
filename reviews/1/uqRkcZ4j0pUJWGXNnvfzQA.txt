So let me start out that we tried to give BU a chance to remedy our disappointment by inviting us back but the woman who listened to our complaint when we called to share our experience had nothing but excuses and no solutions :-(. 
Our experience: We made reservations the evening before on OpenTable for an early brunch the next morning, Saturday. We were delighted to see our table was ready. As our party arrived we waited patiently (30 minutes) to give our order. We waited another 30 plus minutes for our meals. During this time we were randomly flagging down various employees for a refill of our drinks. If we would have known who are waiter was we would have  ordered 2 or 3 more rounds of drinks. 
FINALLY My plate arrived and much to my surprise it included black beans....all 10 of them! I am not exaggerating. My husbands chili quillas was a few chips no cheese or sauce. I finally flagged down a very nice woman who brought me back a 1/2 cup of beans and introduced herself as the manager. I expressed our party of 8's disappointment and she was kind enough to bring back coupons for free guacamole and 25% off the bill. We were with family from SF who have no intentions of using their coupons when they return because they were not impressed with the food or the service!!
We were at BU for 2 1/2 hours!! With no one waiter to call our own, no refills of water, and no bill!! We could have all gotten up and left but since we are all law biding citizens we waited patiently for our bill. we were soo excited to finally leave we Unfortanetely left our my daughters soup behind.
Would I go back? Not now! That's why we called this past Monday to give BU a chance and to speak with someone who should have said "I'am sorry".... Not that the kitchen is small and we were there during Restaurant Week (wouldn't you think they would be on their A game since it was Restaurant Week?!)....
