I ordered my food without onions and the cashier told me that my order has no onions in anything I ordered. So I get my food and there were onions in my food. I am highly allergic to onion so I'm glad I checked before I ate my meal. I don't recommend this place to anybody. They should make the staff know the menu and if they are not sure then they should ask or be in back till they know the menu.
