I would stay away.  This was the worst Mexican food experience I have ever had, including Taco Bell and other fast food.  Service was painfully slow, even getting seated or water and chips.  Chips were bland and salsa even blander.  The burrito fajita came after a 20 minute wait and was disgusting.  No other word for it.  It was drenched with sour cream, soggy from the grease, and the ingredients tasted as if they were from a local school cafeteria.  I couldn't finish more than one bite.  The server stopped by after another 10 minutes, and I asked for my check.  No concern for the quality of my meal or even a thought for my experience.  Eat at Taqueria Guadalajara on Park St. instead.
