I was so excited that Espos was back.  I have been back three times since they had their grand opening.  Very disappointed.  Thought I would give them one last try.  I ordered their grilled chicken taco and their carnitas taco to go.  Got them home and opened them up.  I would not even give it to my dog.  They have done a lot in cleaning up the place, but the food does not compare to what it was like before they closed.  Would not recommend it to anyone.
