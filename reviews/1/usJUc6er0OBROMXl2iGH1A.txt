Normally, I go to the Taco Bell @ 99th & McDowell, but I was out running errands and stopped here.  The girl at the drive thru was rude and rushed, even though there was no one in front of me.  I got up to the window, and she huffed when I asked for a drink holder.  The cardboard food containers weren't closed properly and kept popping open on the way home.  One time, it knocked a taco out of the bag, which also wasn't wrapped correctly, (just scrunched around the taco and open at the top), so now I get to clean sour cream, lettuce and cheese out of my console.  Next time, I'll just go to the 99th & McDowell location.
