I will start by saying, the food was decent , but the experience was why I gave this a 1 star. Not all 
 "white" people are "white". The skin might be but the ethnicity could surely be mixed with Mexican/Spanish. The cooks , and guys working there were disgusting , and forget that they may not be the only ones who speak Spanish. Making nasty comments about a woman in the restaurant made my food taste like shit. An sending guys out from the back to have a look was a bit tasteless also. Mind you this woman was a mother of children. I would rather take my wife and kids to Taco Bell after tonight. Very disappointing , considering that the "token boy" -manager had no problem with any of this. It's no wonder 3  people came in to eat in the 45 minutes we were there. I think these men forgot that they weren't in the Tijuana strip club there used to. Not the "donkey show" Jotos, relax a little.
