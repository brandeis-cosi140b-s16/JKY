Unbelievable how bad the service is here.  Place my order with the first person in line and then order is taken over by another server who is not listening to the first person.  So I have to order everything over again, one fish taco meal, two chile beef tacos, chips and salsa-queso.  Pretty straightforward and simple, but they don't listen to you.
I was asked twice if I wanted cheese on the tacos, I said yes but somehow it never made it to the tacos.  When I noticed that the server was placing everything in one container, I reminded her that the fish taco was a meal..  She told me don't worry about it, my jaw is still wide open after hearing her talk to me like that!  Now I get to the cashier and she asks me for the whole order once again.  I still don't have my sides of rice and beans or the chips or salsa.  The cashier has to ask Don't worry about it for the rice and beans and chips and salsa, amazing.  So now I get the side dishes in a to go container, and she has to ask me if I want another container.  I say yes, because miss don't worry about it did not put it together as a meal.  After I pay for this mess, we go to our table.  The cashier tells me she forgot to ring up my chips and salsa-queso, but I show her the receipt with chips and salsa only rang up.  She tells me don't worry about it, and this time I dont!
The worse thing about the whole episode is that the food was horrible to boot. 

One thing they will not have to worry about is me coming back to this place!!!
