I am currently here. They have a teacher happy hour once a month. The place is brimming with teachers but they won't let us sit in the dining area. Call me crazy but shouldn't you be flexible and accommodate the clients?  When you advertise something, expect a turnout and be ready to keep the people happy. Our party had grown larger then the 3 tables we went to move to lower tables, which our waiter said we could do, the manager came over and said we could not and the server was wrong. She said we could not move unless we were no longer going to participate in the happy hour.  There were no diners waiting, just wall to wall teachers. This is the 2nd time I've been to this restaurant and the 2nd unfavorable experience.
