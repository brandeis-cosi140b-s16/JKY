We have been eating here at this location for years, love it, but lately they have had issues. One, the staff is less than friendly these days. Always seem to be in a bad mood, never say hello or thank you, seem like they don't want to be there and don't want to be working, just unpleasant service. Two, more often than not the food has been of poor quality and upset everyone's stomach. I'm not talking about just the normal Mexican food upset stomach, I'm talking sick as a dog upset stomach. I'm not sure what the problem is here but somebody needs to pay more attention to this location, staff and food quality. We have been eating at Vaqueros lately and their food is great and staff is nice.
