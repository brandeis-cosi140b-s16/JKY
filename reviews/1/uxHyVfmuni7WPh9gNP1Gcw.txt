Would really like to review Fogon.  Unfortunately, we showed up at 7:45 on a Sunday night.  Seems like they close at 8, and will turn away people that show up before then.  I get it.  If you want to go home, that's fine. But set the closing time for when you want people to stop coming, not when you want to go home.

Can't comment on the food, atmosphere, or drinks. We couldn't get served.
