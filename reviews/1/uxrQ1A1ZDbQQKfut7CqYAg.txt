Tried both food trucks: Taco Truck & Indian Truck
Seems like both were owned by the same people.  There are no instructions on how to order and where to pay until you step up to a truck and then someone tells you to pay and order in the storefront.  We walked in and asked the cashier about the different Indian dishes and she looked and acted as if she had somewhere better to be.  Another couple were in the storefront eating Indian food so we asked her about their order...she responded saying its masala curry, it has potatoes and it's good.  We asked if the masala came with anything else I.e. Roti or Naan etc.  She replied: everything that you see there.

Now, normally I'd walk right out the door after giving her a few tips on customer service but I was hungry, tired and really wanted to try the Indian food.  So, I politely (still) said okay, we will take a masala and a 3 taco combo (2 pollo, 1 carne asada).  We walked back out to the trucks and waited for the food.  We decided to eat at the storefront.  So, here's the scoop...

Tacos: flavorful chicken and steak but DRY!!  
Beans and rice..meh, nothing to write home about.  1/2 Star for the flavor.

Masala: curry had a good flavor but very watery, meh sides (roti with curried potatoes folded inside).  1/2 Star for the flavor.

Final verdict: skip the trucks and find another spot to eat at...at least until they fix a few things.  First thing to fix = the help!
