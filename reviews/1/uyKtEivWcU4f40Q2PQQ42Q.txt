Let me start by saying, I love the Big House Cafe and have great admiration for the owners.   My son and I were excited to try their new restaurant and stopped by for lunch.   I ordered the Chicken Suiza enchiladas and was completely disappointed when they delivered the food.  Basically the tortilla was dipped (briefly) in a red sauce, chicken was rolled up in that tortilla and then served as Chicken Suiza enchiladas.   When I complained to the waiter he said that was the chef's interpretation of Chicken Suzia.   Yikes, bland and boring without a very good taste.   So disappointed.
