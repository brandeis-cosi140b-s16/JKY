Very disappointing.  I would actually give this place a zero but yelp requires at least one star. This place is over priced and under staffed during dinner hours which caused significant delay. The food was warm at best and had to send my son's plate back because it was cold. They corrected the cold chicken fingers by dumping them back into the deep fryer. They were inedible at that point. I'm very excited to see what restaurant will move in next.....it's just a matter of time.
