FOOD POISONING!!!!
i normally eat at my local tacos mexico in los angeles so i figured i would stop by this one when i saw it driving from downtown vegas to the strip.
i ordered 1 each of pork and chicken tamales. BAD decision.
i experienced food poisoning within 9 hrs. (symptomatic from both ends, if you know what i mean)
if this place had an LA county food inspection rating. it probably be a C.
Ambience??!! this place has wrought iron gating around the windows and double entrance! (that should have been my 1st clue to dine elsewhere)
i do not recommend this place
