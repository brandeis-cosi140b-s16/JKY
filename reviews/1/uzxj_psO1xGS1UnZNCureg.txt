I posted this a month ago, but did not find it, so I am re posting it. 
I use to eat here frequently, and found out they may have sold this place to owners from Canada. I don't know if this is true but they sucked the Mexican soul out of this place (whoever they are). The food, well, it is not Mexican food. They replaced the salsa with some weird watered down sauce with some stuff floating in it and that is their only salsa. They don't make a hot sauce for us gringas who like spicy. We ordered the Chili con Queso as an appetizer, for $8, it was a huge rip off. It was about 2 tablespoons of room temp melted cheese. My daughter's cheese nachos were 4 chips with melted white cheese that had NO flavor. My chili relleno had no flavor at all and about halfway through, had the flavor of cleaning product. I verified this with friend who was choking down his weird enchiladas (no other way to describe them). The manager said they got rid of the hot salsa and took $3 off my dinner for the cleaning product relleno. This place has turned into a huge joke. Don't waste your time, palate, or money.
