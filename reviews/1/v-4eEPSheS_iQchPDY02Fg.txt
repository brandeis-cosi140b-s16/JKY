We have ate at Filabertos in the past and alway had great food. We stopped at this location thinking let's get some fast Mexican lunch. Almost $30.00 later, I found my rice was hard and crunchy to chew. Not only was it like that for me, it was like that for my whole family's lunch. Looks like it was cooked or reheated too much. Also, the taco combinations we ordered hardly had any meat in them. The same goes for the rolled tacos. I thought to myself, "where's the beef?"  This has to be the worst food experience I've ever had at a filabertos!  I have it 1 star because the cashier was nice. Take your time and find another filabertos to eat at or go to a sit down Mexican restaurant. Or, go to the Wendy's across the street. You will pay less for lunch there.
