Well my wife and decided to try Willy and Jose's again. We first ate there about 6 yrs ago. So we decided to try it again.
This second visit 6 tears later confirms it. What an awful place.
They served us the usual tortilla chips, salsa and bean dip.  The chips were old and hard. Bean dip .... Nothing to crow about. Salsa tasted canned.  The wife ordered a strawberry margarita. More strawberry syrup and not enough booze. $ 8.00 for a $ 2.00 drink.
Wife ordered chicken enchiladas with mole. She enjoyed it.
I ordered a 3 item combo. Pork tamale tasted fine but it was covered with a poor canned tasting enchilada sauce; the chili relleno was filled with cheese reminiscent of Velveeta or Cheese Whiz..the relleno was a little bit over fried.. And the flauta was not crispy at all. Soft like a enchilada. 
Service was okay but it could not makeup for the dismal food. 
I'm definitely not a fan. Won"t go back. Roberto's greasy Mexican food is heads above the garbage served at Willy & Jose's.
