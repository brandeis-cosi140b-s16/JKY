I wish I could say something good about this place but sadly I'll never get to know if the food is any good because of the cashiers horrible attitude. God forbid if you have any questions about how the food is served or special request to have the taco toppings placed on the side. All your questions get you is attitude and a sense that they want nothing to do with answering your questions let alone serve you. I've never seen such a small mom and pop shop with poor customer service considering they depend on your business to remain open. All I wanted was 2 avotacos with the lettuce, cream and cheese on the side. They made me feel like I was asking for a million dollars. I'll probably try again earlier in the day when you can expect people to have a decent, welcoming attitude.
