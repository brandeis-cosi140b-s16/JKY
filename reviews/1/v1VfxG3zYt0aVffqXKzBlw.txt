A year ago, we checked out The Sandbar for their crawfish taco Mardi Gras special... And they were delicious.  We went back a few times, and there were certainly some other nice tacos on the menu, but they weren't always consistent.

I stopped eating here when, one day, the waiter brought me an extra taco I didn't order (none of the five other people at the table recalled it, either).  I mentioned to him that I only ordered three tacos, and his response was, "It's OK, they're only $2."  Great point, sir: you see, your tip was going to be $2.  I guess it all works out! (Honestly, I would have still tipped had his response been something remotely resembling an apology.)

Seriously, though, that was the first time I was ever expected to pay for something I did not order.

For some reason, we decided to go back again this week to see if they still had the crawfish tacos for Mardi Gras... And they did!  Unfortunately, they were not $2 like the other tacos.  Even worse, they didn't mention that they were actually shrimp tacos with a few pieces of crawfish in them.  

Sorry, Sandbar, but this behavior is NOT OK.  If you're going to advertise something as crawfish tacos, it sure as hell had better not be shrimp tacos with a few sparsely placed pieces of crawfish.  I don't want to pay $4 for twelve crawfish (our waitress who neglected to mention that the crawfish tacos are not crawfish tacos did get a tip, but it was the bare minimum for her bad service, which was not just limited to the taco information).

Besides the deceit in regards to the menu items, the service here is consistently bad.  Don't expect to have a drink in front of you for more than 50% of your meal.

Fool me once...
