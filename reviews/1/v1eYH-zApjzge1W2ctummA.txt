Our dinner was not enjoyable at all.   It was Cinco  De Mayo, great occasion for a Mexican outing.  But the music was so loud that all conversation was drowned out.  Our waiter did his best under difficult circumstances.   My Tex-Mex was fine, but my wife's pork "tenderloin" was overcooked and tough.  Then the manager argued that it wasn't tough.  A miserable experience - we won't be back.
