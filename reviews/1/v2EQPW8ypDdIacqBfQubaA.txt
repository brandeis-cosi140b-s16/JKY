Terrible service. Had to advise someone we had been waiting for 10 min for menus and a server. Once server came over asked if we were ready to order even though we didn't have any menus. Waited 40 mins for food that seemed from a can and microwaved. Told slow due to only one cook working. Once food came out we had to go find our own silverware and napkins.  Never asked if we needed drink refills. Very bad service, food not so great more like bar food - not returning here.
