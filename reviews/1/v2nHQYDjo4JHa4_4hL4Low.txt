My girlfriend and I went to Paradise on Sunday to watch football thinking it would be really great.  We had read online about the great football specials.  We are Las Vegas locals and we were looking for a little change of scenery for the games and drove 15 miles to get there.  The food was mediocre at best but the 16 oz $4 Bloody Mary came in a small 8 oz hard plastic cup.  The second round came in the correct cups. When we politely questioned the cup size on the first round the bartender, Alan called my girlfriend a liar and said he would do nothing about it.  This is the same guy who earlier switched the game we were watching and then had to be convinced to change it back.   Finally Sean handled it and took the drinks off the bill.  Alan also told a buddy customer  that it was OK to smoke  in the dining area where we were eating when it is clearly marked "No fumar!"  Hello, McFly!  some people actually choose to go to a bar because it is No Smoking!  I have no problem with this addicted idiot getting cancer but please do it alone.  The real problem is that the bar staff allowed it and Alan even gave them permission.  Sorry Paradise we are going back to Millers at Town Square.  BTW the waitress, Sue was awesome.  Great service and great attitude despite the rude and arrogant bartender.
