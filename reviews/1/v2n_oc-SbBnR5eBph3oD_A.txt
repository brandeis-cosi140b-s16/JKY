I ordered a burrito without guacamole because their is sour cream in this guacamole and I'm severally allergic to dairy, and when I got it home to eat and took a bite there was guacamole and sour cream and I had an allergic reaction. This is the second time my order wrong :( I like there food but service needs work...
