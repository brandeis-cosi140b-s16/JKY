You guys are KILLING me.

I want to love this place, but the service is literally THE WORST.

The last time I went to The Stand, my fianc√© and I stood in line for about 15 minutes ... with just one other person in line in front us. That person ordered a single milkshake, and it took him that whole 15 minutes to get it.

When we finally moved to the front of the line, we stood there awkwardly, waiting for someone--anyone--to acknowledge our presence. I counted 5 people working behind the counter that night, and not one of them made eye contact with us. After 5 additional minutes in line, we gave up and walked out.

I'd like to reiterate that this experience wasn't an isolated incident. I think a lot of people (myself included) ignore the crummy service here because the food is so good, but when you've given this place as many chances as I have, the whole thing gets kind of old. I really want to support this local business, but they make it so tough.

GET IT TOGETHER, you guys. For the sake of your glorious shakes and burgers.
