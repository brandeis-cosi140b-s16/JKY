When visiting this particular restaurant, I'm sure none of us expect excellence in terms of food or service... But I must say, this specific location's absence of customer service (actually, just general politeness and listening skills altogether) was quite noteworthy.  It was our first time at this location tonight and the individual working there had a terrible attitude, screwed up our order on many different levels and didn't give us any green salsa (which, everyone knows is the only one that matters!!).  Oh but he did give us a free plastic fork (we ordered a burrito and rolled tacos...) and for that, one star seems appropriate.
