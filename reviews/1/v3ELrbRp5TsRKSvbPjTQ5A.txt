Some of the best tacos I've ever had... But I have to update from my last review. It actually makes me sad to do this but my experience last night must be put out there. Here we go...

Came here last night around 7pm to grab some shrimp tacos (3 to be exact) and 1 shrimp burrito. The guy who took my order didn't speak a word of English, which is to be expected but not understanding the sentence "3 shrimp tacos on corn tortilla" isn't acceptable. 
So he starts the shrimp on the grill grabs one tortilla and says "what it". I remind him it's 3 tacos. He looks confused and had to ask someone what I was saying. He says ok gets three tortillas. He had to remake the first one 3 times because he kept putting the wrong thing on them. The shrimp is done and he puts exactly two shrimp pieces on each taco. When I've been here in the past there was always at least 6-7 pieces. When I try to ask him about this he shrugged. I decided to try and talk to someone else. He then proceeds to mess up the buritto as well by putting guac on it which I said no to. I get to the cashier and it got worse...
I walk up and attempt to explain my situation to her, I even show her the amount of shrimp on my tacos. She laughs, snatches my debit card out of my hand and charges me right away. It was $20. She charged me for the tacos he messed up and the guac on the buritto. Now the money is not the issue here, it's the fact she laughed and literally took my debit card from me without my permission. I did not sign the receipt so I will be filling a statement with my bank. 
This was unexceptable. I have never been treated like this as a passing customer and I will never return.
