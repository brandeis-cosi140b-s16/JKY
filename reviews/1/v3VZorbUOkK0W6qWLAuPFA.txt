Arrived at 10:45 to the drive thru window 15 min before their listed closing time. Employees inside completely ignored us much to our amazement. Upon pulling forward to the window we noticed the hours posted and dumbfounded employees staring at us. Turns out the hours are incorrectly listed on yelp but not one of the employees inside could be bothered to get on the microphone and tell us they are closed!
