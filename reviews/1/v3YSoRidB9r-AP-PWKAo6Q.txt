Came because we had a coupon for buy one entree get one free from the entertainment book. They said it was a mistake and would not honor it. They did give a 10% off but it was less than half what it should have been.
I got the Carne Asada burrito. It was big and looked great at first. It would have been very good except the steak was overcooked and dry. My fianc√© got beef tacos which were fried too long so the beef was like jerky. My son got the chicken enchiladas which he said were alright but not great. The salsa was the best part. 
Not a place we will return to.
