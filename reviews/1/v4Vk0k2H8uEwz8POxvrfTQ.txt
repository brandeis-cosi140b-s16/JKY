Van full, 9:30pm, all hungry. We stopped by and got there, at the doors, at 9:50 (they close at 10:00pm), and the doors were locked, OPEN sign turned off, cleaning up. I knocked, and the lady signaled that they were closed! What?! I was like "10!" and put up all 10 fingers at her, and she just kept looking at me and shaking her head... So apparently, the managers and/or employees here care more about going home on time than the customers or keeping a job. Very short sighted. If they don't get customers, store closes, people lose jobs. They lost out on a nice sized check, and I can say with management like that, we're not going to support that business, and our money is going elsewhere. I suggest you do the same.
