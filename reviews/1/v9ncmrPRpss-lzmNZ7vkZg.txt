Came here due to a yelp deal.

The man at the counter said the spot is now under new ownership and they no longer accept these vouchers however they are keeping the same name.

They've added Mexican food to the menu, ice cream, raspados, caldo, still selling hot dogs.

The chilli cheese fries were nothing special as a matter of fact it was mostly cheese. The chilli looked like grease from whatever they could find in the kitchen. The fries were a little hard in the center as if not fried long enough.

As I stared at my fries another man walked in asking for a specific style of brats, the guy at the counter looked completely lost. The young man showed him a picture and the guy said they could make it but he looked more confused than anything else.

Judging by other reviews I came too late.
