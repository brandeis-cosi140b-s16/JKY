This is hands down the worst Roberto's I've ever been in. I know that's Roberto's isn't exactly a 5 star joint, but this was most worst experience ever. The cashier was so unbelievably rude. Yes, they were busy. Dinner Rush was going on but that does not excuse a negative attitude toward guest. The cashier did not greet me in any way at all and she was almost yelling at the old woman in who was in front of me. 
The food quality was mediocre, but the service is what will prevent me from dining here again.
