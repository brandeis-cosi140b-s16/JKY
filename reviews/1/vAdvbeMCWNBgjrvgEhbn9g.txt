Why zero stars is not a viable option is beyond me, because this Del Taco has earned exactly that. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.

I used to eat at this restaurant frequently, loved the value, and for the price the food was pretty good. Service was typically a bit bad, but they lowered my expectations at this location long ago.

However, even for me the end of the line was after seeing a group of small live ROACHES poking out from the drain at the soda fountain. YES LIVE ROACHES. Never seen this before in a restaurant, ever.  Left immediately and will not be back. A quick check of the Maricopa County health site revealed they have had 4 consecutive checks, all with LIVE GERMAN ROACHES all over the cooking side of this place and the soda fountain. 

So, unless a little unexpected crunch of insect protein is what you want in your fast food taco, I would not eat at this place. ZERO STARS.
