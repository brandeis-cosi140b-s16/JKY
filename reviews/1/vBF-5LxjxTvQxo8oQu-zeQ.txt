Sadly, I must update my review. I have been here three more times after my initial review and all three times waited exponentially longer than the time I was told. On this last occasion the lady on the phone told me 20 mins so I left my house after twenty minutes, arriving five minutes after that. I went in, gave her my name and they said it would be right out. I sat down. I watched three people come in, place their order, and walk out with their food. I went to yhe counter and asked about my food. She left to go in the back and said it wasn't ready yet. I gave her a look of bewilderment as it had been about 40-45 mins since I placed my order. I sat back down. TEN MINUTES later, she brings me my food and tells me she's sorry it took so long. That my order had actually been ready for a while and was sitting in a place she didn't know to look. Needless to say food was WET from condensation, cold, and less than UNsatisfactory. So sad. I wanted to like this place!
What did I order? Five tacos and a torta.
