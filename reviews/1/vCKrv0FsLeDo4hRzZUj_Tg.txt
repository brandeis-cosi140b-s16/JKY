The food is horrible!!! I ordered the carne asada nachos and it seemed as if they were microwaved, gross. The chips were not edible and tasted stale. My dad ordered the shredded beef wet burrito and said it sucked. Roberto's is far better and worth your money over this place any day.  Next time we will go to Roberto's!!!
