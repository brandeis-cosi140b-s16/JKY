Keep in mind i did NOT eat here. So this post is not about food quality. its about the service 
it was like i wasnt even there when i waited for 30 minutes before the bartender asked if i would like something to drink
ofcourse as soon as a girl came up to the bar the bartender would run over like a little puppy hoping to his ear scratched
