Traffic was bad after the game. Decided to wait it out at this restaurant in the mean time. I would advise to just stay in your car or walk across the street to Gordon. Took an hour to get food and only got asked if we needed a round of beer once. My dad never even received his food. I understand when it's busy but the restaurant was almost empty. Upon receiving the food it was all ice cold. We told the gentlemen to take it all back and he said the cook is screwing everything up tonight. We told him to bring our check and we weren't  paying for this garbage. Another server dropped off the check and didn't say a word about the crappy food or service. A lot of the restaurants on this side of the road are out of business this one will be close behind. There were many others that got up and left with no management intervention.
