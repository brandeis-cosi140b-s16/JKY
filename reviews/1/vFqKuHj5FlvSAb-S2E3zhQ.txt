Just like other reviews...rude customer service...I ordered a 12 piece family meal mixed, as she gave me the bag with salsa, I noticed that a few lids were open and saw salsa all over the inside. I knocked on the window and as she opened it she had a look of disgust. I advised her what happened and asked for a new bag. She became visibly aggravated then rude. When I got home the 12 piece meal consisted of only 10 pieces, three breasts and the rest were wings, small at that. $30 for bad service and a messed up order. Hopefully management looks at these reviews as they have just lost another customer.
