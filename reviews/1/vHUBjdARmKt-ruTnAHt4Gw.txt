Sadly, we were unimpressed with Maria Maria at Tempe Marketplace. We were there at about 2pm on a Sunday, so we figured we'd have the whole place to ourselves, which we did, and unfortunately, that included the wait staff. Service was terrible, it took 10 mins for someone to show up at our table, we ordered drinks and water and the water never came. We ordered the baked cheese appetizer and they brought it out with no warm tortillas. We searched for our waitress or the waitress that brought out the dip, but no one was around, for at least 10 minutes. The table next to us also had no attention. We decided then that we weren't going to finish our meal there. 
The chips and salsa they brought out was fine, they had a couple of hot salsas that were good. I'm a fan of all things tomatillo, so it was good to have that option on the table. 
Back to the baked cheese with chicken, chorizo and ham. It was OK, but was difficult to eat with only chips. Also, it had a strong cinnamon flavor in it and that wasn't appealing to us. I have read a couple of reviews regarding the cinnamon in some of their dishes. I get that they are trying to put their spin on the food, but like I said, it didn't work well. 
So, we ended up leaving and going to our favorite Mexican dive called Armando's on McKlintock and Guad. I will now be writing a glowing review for them!
