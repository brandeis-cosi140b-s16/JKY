This place does not pay attention to what they are doing.  I ordered chicken, they gave me shrimp.  I am highly allergic to shrimp.  I brought them up to the counter and had to argue with the cashier to give me my money back.  All I had done is open the taco to look at it and saw the shrimp.  Eating it would have put me in the hospital.  Not a place to go if you are allergic to shrimp because as I stood there and watched the cook, cross contamination everywhere.  Never again. My life is worth more than a taco.
