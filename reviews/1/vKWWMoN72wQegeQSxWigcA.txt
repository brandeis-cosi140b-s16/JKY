This one is simple. We had an 8pm reservation, we arrived an hour early, checked in and had a drink at the bar. Even though they knew we were there, our table wasn't ready at 8pm.  We waited until 8:20 when they told us we were "better off" ordering at the outside bar. We tried, but they had stopped serving food. At this time our reservation was cancelled and we NEVER GOT SAT. Showed up an hour early for a reservation and NEVER GOT SAT. The Manager (assuming there is one) never came out, never apologized, never offered a drink or a free app, never did a thing. Needless to say, don't go there. I'm a Charlotte native and this city has much more to offer than this so don't subject yourself. They will be out of business soon; much sooner than we would've got sat for dinner.
