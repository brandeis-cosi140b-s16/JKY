I was told this was one of the better more authentic Mexican food restaurants in the area so I absolutely wanted to give it a try. 
So what totally makes a good restaurant isn't just amazing food but the amazing service. And that's not something we received today. 
From missing promised chips and salsa to one person getting their food so fast he finished it before the rest of the party got theirs- I am disappointed. 

The atmosphere is also cramped and during its busier times is super crowded. The food also took longer than normal to be served. 

The food itself was mediocre at best. Definitely can get more flavor from the Nico's around the corner. The only thing I seemed to like we're the refried beans. 
Was hoping for more- disappointment
