We usually go to Diablos many times a year and recommend it to friends and family and usually treat our guests here.. This time was a horrible experience! $30 plus tax and grat for two margaritas and from the first sip, the margarita was totally watered down.  No flavor of margarita mix nor tequila. Very disappointing. They were busy, but still service was the worst we have ever had there.  Too bad as it was a favorite... Tried to contact a manager, but no luck. Very disappointed. Won't be returning and will spread word  our bad experience.
