The margaritas are good and priced right if you go during happy hour. The food, however, is awful. Nothing here is remotely authentic and, compared to the great places like Los Gemelos, Tacqueria Guadalajara and Francisco's Cantina, this place has nothing on any of them.

Frida's can be summed up with two words: overpriced and mediocre.
