We went to BQ for the first time last night for a MNO and the food was horrible! So sad we wasted our time and $$ there when there are so many options and even food trucks outside!! I got three different tacos, the shrimp taco had ONE shrimp, fish taco had no flavor and one with Carne as asada and chorizo was a bunch of burnt meat... I couldn't even... so unfortunate, definitely won't be back!
