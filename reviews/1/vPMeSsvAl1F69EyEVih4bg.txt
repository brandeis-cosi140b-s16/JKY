I never do reviews on restaurants. I try to give the benefit of the doubt because I'm in the industry and I know It can be real trying at times. However, I ordered food delivered from this place and it was not edible. I ordered a good amount of food. You think Taco Bell is bad this place is horrendous. I ordered beef tacos and it was a very stale hard shell full of jerky like beef and crisp iceberg. I only took a bite because of curiosity. The nachos??? Forget it. Mystery meat at best. Took a bite and tossed it. This place serves below grade food....again. I don't write reviews ever but I don't want anybody to make the mistake I did. Go to Taco Bell and you will be better off. This place has no business serving food.
