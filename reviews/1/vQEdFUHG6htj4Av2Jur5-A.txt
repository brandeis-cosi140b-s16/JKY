Went here for the first time. Ordered a taco trio. The cook had gloves on and changed the trash. Then he didn't change the gloves and made my tacos in front of me with the dirty gloves he just changed the trash with. 
The staff seems friendly and that they want to be there. 
I cannot comment how the "trash tacos" tasted as I threw them away. What a waste of $7.59.
I think the health department needs a visit here soon before people get sick.
