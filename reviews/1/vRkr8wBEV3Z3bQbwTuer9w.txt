First, I feel bad about this.  I love Valle Luna and have been a regular customer for years now.  Good food, great ambience, and generally good service.  Not tonight.  We settled in the lounge to take advantage happy hour drinks with a plan for a nice long evening ending in a full dinner and desert.  It was a hot day in Phoenix, and even hotter inside the lounge.  In the end I was literally about to pass out and had to leave mid meal to go to the car to cool down. We mentioned the heat to the waitress who, much like her services (I won't go into that, but not good), dismissed us saying it was hot for her too.  Frankly it was inexcusable to have the establishment even opened,  and a waste of patron money ordering food that they are unable to eat.  I would have preferred they had closed the doors until they could get their air fixed.
