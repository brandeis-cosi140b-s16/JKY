I have to say that I was shocked to see this place receive an average of 3.5 stars.  I met my family at this place after a great round of golf and was on cloud nine.  This was several months ago so please forgive my delayed yelping.  My daughter who loves tortilla soup didn't care for theirs.  I tried it and couldn't even think of taking another bite.  Disgusting.  I also tasted the Pizza but once again only one bite.  That was enough for me.  If you can't get soup or pizza right you mine as well close up shop.  I highly recommend a visit to Baja Fresh over this place. I predict 6 months tops and we will see a vacancy sign.
