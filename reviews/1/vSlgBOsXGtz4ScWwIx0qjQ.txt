First the good...
The building is very nice and the decor also.  The service was also pretty good but the place wasn't full. That's it.

The bad...
The food was expensive, probably averaging $20 a plate.  The food also wasn't very good.  Very bland.  Totally disappointing.  Without some serious changes I'd be surprised if the place will be in business at this time next year.
