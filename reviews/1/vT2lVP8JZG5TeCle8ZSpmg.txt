Terrible. Service was non-existent, and the food was laughable. The civiche had shrimp that seemed like it was from a can, not fresh. Actually everything about the establishment seemed stale. My bf is from SoCal & myself from Austin TX. Now locals in Vegas, and this was two thumbs way down. Go to Mundo instead!!
