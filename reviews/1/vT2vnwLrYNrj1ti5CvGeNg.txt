I'm from San Diego where the 1st Roberto's location started. This place is nothing like it. Not even close. I will just wait until I go back to San Diego this weekend to go there. Really hard to find taco shops here. I've had some of the best in San Diego so I know what it's not suppose to taste like. Sorry I will not be going back here.
