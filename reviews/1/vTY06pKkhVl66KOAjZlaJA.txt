I'm not sure why we ate here after reading the reviews, but we gave it a shot. I had high hopes for the green chili chimi, but it was flavorless, as were the rice and beans. My boyfriend got the taco-enchilada-tostada combo, which was like something you'd get in a school lunch. Both salsas were just terrible. I'm fairly certain at least half of our food was microwaved leftovers. It was a disappointing experience and we will not be coming back.
