Again, another review, another update. This place is not ever consistent, ever. We've gone back quite a few times since the last time I posted. I'm not a reviewer but something about this place caught my eye for the first time, second, third..... So I had to whether experience be good or bad. 
I still wish I knew this fabulous servers name, the only time we have ever had an enjoyable time (twice) and even another when we we sitting in bar, forgot about by our server this lady, my only favorite came by to say hi & quickly grabbed boxes, cleared empty plates and said let me get you some refills. Short brown hair, glasses and a huge smile. The name Elaine sounds familiar but I honestly just can't remember. But owners needs to put this lady in charge. Very attentive, knows what she's doing and puts smiles on everyone's face. Seriously. 
It's sad, this place has so much good quality, the food is fabulous you guys can do better but they need someone in charge. Not the young girls up front that are solving all the issues, taking-wrapping to go's (for 20 minutes & still come out wrong) , answering phones, seating.... Etc. Not these girls, it's a shame to not see this place poppin like it should be. Straighten up the service. I'm not sure after Sunday nights to go experience, we'll even waste our time coming back Here unless I see that lady (maybe Elaine) & know she'll be waiting on us.
