If you like bland food covered in a TON of cheese and horrible service, then this is the place for you! Because of the excessive amount of cheese used, everything is SUPER greasy. In addition, I ordered a margarita and it tasted so bitter I could barely tolerate it. Water glasses are the size of shot glasses and dirty. Waitress was bitchy and looked like she had been up all night boozing. All around horrible experience and I'll never go again.
