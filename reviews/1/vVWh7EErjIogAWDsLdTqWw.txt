It has been months since I have eaten at this place. I used to eat here often, especially on Taco Tuesday. I walked in today just knowing I was going to have another great experience so I took my order to go. There was only one young lady (I could see behind the counter)  who was quite pleasant and pointed out the new menu items which were of Indian origin (like Chicken Tandoori, Curry Chicken etc). I thanked her for the info and told her that maybe I would try it next time. So, I ordered tacos (hard) with shredded chicken on the inside. It took no time for my order to come up. It took me less than 5 min to get to my destination and BOY was I disappointed. The taco shells were cold (why? not sure). Then I broke apart my shells and discovered my chicken was ice cold as well.  I was so sad because I enjoy a good taco.  Every element of my taco was cold, as if everything came out of the fridge.  If this place has been sold to someone else then they need to just do the Indian food and forget about the mexican food. I wont be returning unless I want Indian food. The lady said she makes that fresh per order.
