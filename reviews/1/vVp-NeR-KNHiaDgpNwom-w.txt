Absolutely the worst Mexican cuisine I've ever tried to consume. If I could get away with taking stars away I would.

As everyone here has stated, the place was packed. Very small for the volume of folks trying to get a seat. Which, as you read, I have no idea why.

Chips and salsa- the red salsa was really a tomato sauce with a hint of garlic, the side of beans were very bland and the tomatillo salsa was extremely sweet. We asked for something with a bit more kick and the waitress brought out their 'taco salsa'. This was the same salsa with chili powder and crushed red peppers added.

I ordered the carne asada- chimichanga- enchilada style with beans. Again the beans were bland, the carne asada was greasy, grizzly and had a funky taste to it. It came with a side of pico de gallo. I don't think I've ever had jalapeno free pico before. The guacamole was nothing more than pureed advacados.

The ladies had their meal, chicken fundito. Another hideous, bland plate. While a very generous serving of chicken, there was no seasoning whatsoever.

All in all, this place is great for anyone with ulcers, as there is no heat in their cooking at all. 

Kind of reminds me of New York City's idea of hot.

Not a chance in hell that I will ever recommend this place to anyone wanting Mexican food. You're better off going to Taco Bell.
