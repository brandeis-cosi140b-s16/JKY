I wish there was something below one star. So everyone knows this is the third owner since the place opened, after it was sold the first time there was no saving this dump. The food is horrible now and I waited In the drive thru for 15 min, and then the kid in the drive through who seemed very confused handed me our to go boxes and told me they were out of bags. Like what in the world is wrong with this owner. I will never return and I hope this place closes soon it's giving the reall Baja taco from California a bad name. Your food and staff sucks and seriously you can't just keep raising the prices. The place used to be great just like the ones in cali but now I wouldn't give it to my dog. Everyone beware this place is crap and overpriced crap at that, there's a chipotle and a pollo loco right down the street just drive past the dump that is Baja Taco Las Vegas!!!
