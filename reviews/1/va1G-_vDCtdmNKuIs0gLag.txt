I spoke with a manager, Erica Martin about our happy hour drinks. She was beyond rude, even started talking down about us to the staff. All because we had a misunderstanding about where to sit for happy hour. She used that "I am being fake voice" when she would say things like "anything else I can do for you" "do you need a bag for that" (it was one to-go box) and "have a wonderful day." She would drag on the words in a high pitch voice.
It was bad. It was for my birthday with my friends and family and she humiliated me in front of everyone. 
I have been here many times and I will never go again, not just because of her attitude but the way she was talking to her staff about us, using air quotes and mocking the questions we had.
I have contacted corporate on her.
Best of luck!
