Do not ever order in the restaurant. My kid had to use the restroom, so we ordered to go. Stood there for over 15 minutes waiting for our order, watching over 10 vehicles go thru the drive thru and get their order. Just shameful. Corporate must have some crazy time monitoring of their drive thru service, but if you choose to order inside you will just wait and wait and wait. Most of the time we waited it was this awkward staring at the two guys working the counter and wondering what the hell was taking so long.
