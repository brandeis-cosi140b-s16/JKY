Another bad experience at this Garcia's! As much as I enjoy their happy hour prices the service is always horrible. Anytime I needed our server she was MIA and when I did see her she was rushing past our table to help someone else....it was ridiculous! This is the third time I've been to this Garcia's and had a bad server... Its obvious management is not managing and good service is not a priority....one more thing the bus boy was eating while he was working, I thought that was weird. Don't go to GARCIA'S in Az Mills, you will regret it.
