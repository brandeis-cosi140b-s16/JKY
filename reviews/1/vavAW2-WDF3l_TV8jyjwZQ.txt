My rating used to be 5 stars, but this place quickly went downhill. I used to get chips and salsa with taquitos every time I came here because they were really good. The last time I came in here, during the day, the taquitos weren't thoroughly cooked and the queso had a 'fishy' taste.

Tonight I came in and the salsa had to have been bottom of the barrel because there was almost no salsa in the salsa. It was almost all salsa water, or whatever it is. I actually got the taquitos at the same time as my chips and salsa, which was odd, and they were barely cooked at all. When I said something to the manager she replied "well we are almost closing". Instead of making excuses maybe she should be a real manager and address the issue with her employees because I don't like gambling with my food because employees are too lazy to do the jobs they are paid to do.
