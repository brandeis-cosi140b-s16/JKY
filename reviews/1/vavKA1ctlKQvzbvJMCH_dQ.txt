I would love to write a good review of Gil's Taste of Taos but it is never open during the normal posted business hours.  I was able to eat there once for lunch and had an amazing meal.  I have been there three times since during the normal posted business hours and it is always closed.  This establishment needs to find a way to run a catering business and a restaurant at the same time or quit selling itself as a restaurant that has normal business hours.  Do not waste your time trying to eat at Gil's it will most likely be closed because they are out catering.  There are plenty of great Mexican spots in town that keep their posted business hours.
