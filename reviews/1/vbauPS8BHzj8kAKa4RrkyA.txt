The place looked nice but when I ordered my burrito I asked them to put it on the press because I like my cheese melted.  I've had this done at the 3 other Chipotle's. Two were here in Vegas and one in SF. It seems like a simple request.  It doesn't hurt anything to stick my burrito on the press for 5 seconds. But I was denied and maybe it was in the way I was denied that further fueled my outrage.  I wasn't given a reason why it couldn't be put on and they just dismissed the idea completely and moved on.  Ridiculous!  But that wasn't all. My burrito was wrapped into the shape of a bloated square basically. Not long and rectangular-like like any other burrito I've ever seen but like a bloated square that I couldn't even get my mouth around to eat.  So when I'm half way through this thing chicken and rice is falling out all over the place. Next, I go to fill up my cup with Sprite only to get a mouthful of carbonated soda water in my mouth.  I tell them they needed to change it and they just stick an out of order sign on it. Guess I'm not having Sprite today either.  All in all, disgusting staff etiquette and lazy workers.  I will never eat at this Chipotle again and advise you not to either.  

DO. . . . . . .  .    NOT. . . . . . . . EAT. . . . . . . . . AT. . . . .  THIS. . . CHIPOTLE!!!
