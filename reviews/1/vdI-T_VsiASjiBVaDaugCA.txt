VERY DISAPPOINTING!!!!  This place looked fun and inviting. But as soon as we walked in 
the hosted was lame and boring didn't really show us to a table she just said find a seat then she went back to reading her book. So we sat on the outside patio surfboard tables. How cool.
There was sand all over the patio just like you were on the beach. There's even a little swimming pool. That says NO SWIMMIMG. What fun.. WRONG how the atmosphere is so great then you get a REALLY LAME WAITER. SLOW AND NO PERSANALLITY.
FOOD LAME. I would rather have gone to Rubio's or Feliberto's. OVER ALL this place is LAME.
I complained to the manager and realized why this place is LAME. It's because the MANAGER is LAME. 
The best thing about this place is the DECOR.
