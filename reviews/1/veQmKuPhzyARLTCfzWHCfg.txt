I had the Pollo Diablo, formerly named Pollo Magnifico.  They renamed it because they added more cream cheese, so calling it Diablo would give it that extra edge.  Apparently this burro wasn't enough of an artery clogger just yet.  I didn't know what to get so I decided to get what the Yelp review highlights recommended.  Unfortunately it is not always clear if those highlights are for a positive or negative review of the dish. My quick scan indicated that Pollo Magnifico/Diablo was a good thing, so I went with that.  

Pollo Diablo is a deep-fried chicken burro drowning in jalapeno cream and cheese, served with a side of beans and rice.  I took one look at the thing and felt myself getting full and bloated already.  The fried touch made it not quite crispy, just a little greasy.  The inside was tender but hard to really pay attention to with all of the jalapeno cream and cheddar cheese everywhere. I was overwhelmed and ate less than half the entree.  Nothing worth taking with me, either.

The worst part about eating here is that we all just got tired from eating.  They are big, heavy portions.  I looked over at my cousin and his head was propped up in his hands, his eyes drooping.  My sister's tamale was basically a hunk of really heavy and dry cornbread and she was exhausted from eating, too.  This was heavy stuff.

I'm not from the Southwest so maybe I just don't know any better, but for this California girl, I would much rather  eat Mexican food in a dirty hole in the wall in San Jose than to come back here.
