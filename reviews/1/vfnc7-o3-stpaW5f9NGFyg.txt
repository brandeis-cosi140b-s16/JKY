I have been eating at carls jr for 30 years. Their restraints have always been good or bad, meaning you know which ones to eat at and which ones to avoid. This place was one of the good ones but appears to be making the move from good to bad. Yesterday, the food was horrible and incorrectly made, the restaurant and the bathroom were both dirty, and the service was not good. It was as if the manager was AWOL and the workers did not care about their jobs enough to step up and run the place correctly. I don't know if I'll ever return to this carls jr. Looks like we are going to have to find another one.
