I was driving this morning, coming South on Greenfield Road approaching Brown Road in Mesa AZ.  In the strip mall on my left (NE corner of Greenfield & Brown) I saw a sign hidden in the parking lot lot.  The sign was behind the "Epic Hair Studio", and visible when people walked out of the gym there into the parking lot.  The sign said the following:

"Coming Soon, Tia Rosa.  Until we open, please visit us at our location in Gilbert off Higley Road. "  

If this comes to fruition, and it does come back into business at this location, I will be a regular customer...again.  Hope that the food is still good!!!!

Eluding to my previous comment, there is a location of Tia Rosa @ the  NE corner of Greenfield & Brown in Mesa.  They have been open for maybe 2-3 weeks maximum.  The place is actually more like a taqueria or cantina, and more of a casual fast food type.  

I was really put off by it.  This is the reason I rated 2 stars.  I went in there and ordered the three tacos combo (seafood tacos).  The portions were very tiny.  It amounted to two star food (quality and quantity) for five star price/cost.  I was really disappointed.  My wife has some other colorful words to say that are not politically correct to say (she described the food and place with four letter words).

I can find better tacos, seafood or otherwise, with appropriate portion, at a lower price at a Mexican food street kiosk or "walkup" in metro Phoenix any day.  The Mexican markets (even those in Mesa) make better tacos.  Going to this location was a real let down!  I was a fool to spend my money here!  

I hope that you are able to turn it around, as you will disappoint many followers with what you are doing at Greenfield and Brown in Mesa today.  You might as well have just kept the Gilbert location on Higley, and never bothered to re-open in Mesa AZ.
