Went here at 1:05am on the morning of January 6, 2010.

The neon sign said "DRIVE THRU OPEN," but nobody answered at the order speaker.  I drove up to the second window and knocked on it until some dude opened it and looked at me like I was going to sell him a fucking vacuum.  I asked if they were open, which compelled him to just turn his head and yell to the other guy in the back to come take his place.

When the other guy came up to the window I asked him why nobody answered the order speaker when I tried to order.  High as a kite, he looked me straight in the eye and said, "Ohh, dats cuz I shut off my headset fo awhile."

He gave me a large water when I asked for one, which was great, but he didn't put the lid on all the way and I immediately spilled 10 ounces onto my crotch right before the big presentation.

This place needs to by mystery shopped.

Where's the oversight?  Whoever owns this joint is paying good money for the help to shut all the lights, untuck their shirts and smoke weed out back all night.  God forbid a customer of this 24-hour drive thru restaurant should interrupt the party.

Quit smokin' dat chronic by the grease dumpsta an git yo dumb ass back in da kitchen.
