I came here to try the barbacoa. I now know that I don't care for it, or I dont like their version. It took way too long to get from one end of the counter to the other while my food was being slid from one person to the next so when I complained that I suspected my food may be cold they did offer to remake, but only remade the last item of the 3 ordered.  I won't be back. I gues in closing Ill add that when I made a drink and pushed the lever under the Coca Cola sign it came out clear. Also after we ate what we could tolerate and went to throw away our trash, the can was not even there.
