Ive been here twice and both were terrible experiences. I would not recommend going there for the nightlife, drinks are over priced and they kicked my friend out for literally no reason at all.

We were sitting at a table with 4 other friends conversing and security just randomly came up to my buddy and said "you need to leave right now you are too intoxicated." He didn't even get to finish his second drink. I think it was because we were taking up a table and not spending a lot of money on drinks or food right away. Not quite sure. When I respectfully asked the security what happened and what my friend did to get kicked out he was disrespectful and brushed me off like he was too cool. He just said "intoxicated" and walked away. We went over to City North after and had no problems the rest of the night.

 I will NEVER come back to Sandbar. After reading other reviews it looks like I'm not the only one who has had this problem.
