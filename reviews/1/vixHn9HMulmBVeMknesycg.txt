Waited for dinner on Saturday night 45 min wait, we where offered a drink for waiting..never recieved  the  drink!!! Finally we where seated upstairs on a cat walk, no room for waiters or people to walk by, felt like I was in everyone's way. Ordered our drinks from the bus boy Louis the only bright spot of this dinning experience. Louis was very attentive. As for our waitress krisa,she was the worst!! My meal was wrong had to wait another 15/20 minuets. she did apologize for screwing up, but made no offer to discount the meal or bring a manager!  The food was not great, very over priced!!  This resturant has been open for 2 weeks, sadly I will not return! I also witnessed one of the owners drinking..taking a shot at the service bar. 
If I could, I wouldn't give this resturant  1 star.
