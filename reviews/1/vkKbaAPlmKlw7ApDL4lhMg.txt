OK!  came here because my sister thought it would be some good mexican food. Absolutely not this place is so far away from REAL!! MEXICAN FOOD its a disgrace if i could give NO stars i would so i had a Chile quille which was a made up americanized concoction so far away from a real chile quille would have my grandparents rolling in their graves.  Couldent remember what my sis had but she said it was sure not satisfying never going back again!!! If you are in the mood for FAKE MEXICAN FOOD then this is the place to go. You would think with the high price they would actually have real food very disappointed.... READERS beware not real MEXICAN FOOD!!!!!! : (.....
