We had a few minutes to kill before our flight and El Bravo looked to be the best option. I was excited to see they bragged about their tamales and decided to try the tamale burrito with beans and rice. At first bite I was impressed. The tortilla seemed to be homemade and I got a bite of the masa shell. Unfortunately the next bight I got meat. It was the greasiest, worse-than-taco-bell type flavor I've ever had. The beans and rice were nothing special and I had that awful meat flavor in my mouth the entire flight home.
