Wow, they could not have disappointed me more if they had tried! The woman at the cashier's stand was unfriendly, the food took almost 10 minutes to come out even though it was a VEGGIE burrito so it didn't have any meat. No one bothered to apologize that we stood there waiting patiently while others got their food (including 2 cars in the drive thru.) Then they marked our orders wrong so when my spouse and I went our separate ways with our to go order we got the wrong burritos and couldn't switch. I was late going back to work, spent money on something I didn't even order, and was treated poorly. I'm sure not all experiences are like this based on so many good reviews (which is what made me choose this place in the first place!), but it was disappointing and I won't be going back even though it's near my home, and I was considering using it more often since it's so convenient. Guess not.
