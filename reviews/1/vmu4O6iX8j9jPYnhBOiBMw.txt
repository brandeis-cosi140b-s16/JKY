Husband and I came here an hour and a half before we had to be at an doctor's appointment. We figured that would be enough time to eat. 

Whew, were we wrong. 

I want to start this off on the positives of this place: nice waitress, tastey blue corn tortillas. 

Anyway, to make a long, boring rant short, we waiting just about an hour for our lunch to arrive. I had two tacos and he had a burrito. Essentially, we had only 20ish minutes to eat, get the bill, and book it. The beans and rice looked old. The rice was definitely undercooked (I don't think you're supposed to almost break a tooth on rice). My husband, who has the lowest standards of food (he's a McRib fan) thought his burrito was "gross". 

My drink was watery. 

This place has friendly sevice that moves at a glacier speed and food that tastes old, undercooked, and boring. 

Glad-ish I tried it, but will never come back.
