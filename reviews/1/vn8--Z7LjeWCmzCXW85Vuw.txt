My wife and I used to love Arriba's, til recently when we joined some friends at the end of their table for dinner. We arrived about an hour after they did, and they were finished when we got there.
 I ordered a stuffed poblano chili dish and it really was not good at all. Bad enough that the food was bad, but when we were ready to leave, we asked the waitress for our check, so she gives us a check for the whole table.
 My wife said, "No-we want our check only" and the waitress said that they do not do seperate checks, which is B.S. because we always have gotten seperate checks at the Arriba's in Arrowhead. This created a big hassle for us because we never carry cash, so my wife had to pay back one of her friends for our share of the bill the following week.
 This is no way to conduct a business, and I also sent the main office an email telling them about what had happened, but they never answered the email. I guess customer satisfaction means nothing to them, so we will NEVER go back! 

 Anyplace can roast chilis, so thats nothing special for Arriba's.

 Macayos is the place from now on, and the food there is superior to Arriba's.
