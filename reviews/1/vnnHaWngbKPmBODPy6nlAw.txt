Screw this place

Service: Slow and lazy

Food: watery, bland, cold, disguisting

Who is going here and why? Why is this place still open?

I saved myself from being arrested on assault charges, having almost launched myself over the counter to choke the fat bitch working behind it when she answered, "I don't know, want to taste it?" to my asking if a certain product had meat in it. No bitch, if I don't eat meat I don't want to put it in my mouth to double check. You should be aware of what your serving, you'll end up poisoning someone with a food allergy for your ignorance and sheer idiocy.

Someone who was either the manager or had just been working there longer rushed over to save her ass when he saw the shadow of murder upon my face, and kindly took over and answered any questions I had. But really, it was obvious he knew she was a moron, why are they letting people like this work here?
