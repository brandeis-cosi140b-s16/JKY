Well, I debated writing my review for this place because it happened a few years ago but I still boycott it to this day so here goes. I went here to meet some friends and bought a quesadilla. Nothing special but still good. I paid with my debit card and tipped the waiter $1 on the receipt I was given to sign. After looking over my checking account a week or so later I discovered that my tip had magically gone from $1 to $7.00! Now, ordinarily one would think there was a mistake in my handwriting however, I had also totaled the amount on that same receipt for the cost of the food and the tip so there was no way my math was off by $6.00. 

I contacted the bar several times and gave them copies of my receipt that I signed and they did nothing about it. They never returned my calls or offered to refund the money. How big of a deal do you make over $6.00? I gave up but vowed to never return to this place again. If you do go, do NOT under any circumstance use a debit or credit card and if you do watch your bills like a hawk for unscrupulous accounting errors.
