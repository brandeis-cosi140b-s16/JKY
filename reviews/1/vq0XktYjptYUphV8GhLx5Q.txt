Please bring back the old shrimp tacos. The new tacos make no sense from a culinary standpoint, taste bitter, and are greasy. The older recipe nicely combined soft corn tortillas with fresh sweet corn, succulent shrimp, and cilantro. These new ones are apparently a "fajita style taco" (huh?)  loaded with greasy fried onions, bitter peppers, and lime wedges. It's an assault to the taste buds, very unappealing, and nonsensical.
