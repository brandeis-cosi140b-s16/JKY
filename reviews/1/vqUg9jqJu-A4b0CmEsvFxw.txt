1st off this place is not called Robertos but Don Tortaco! 2nd I called in my order so that I wouldn't have to wait but lucky me I got the new guy who didnt take down my order correctly. So here I am writing my review as I wait for my food. Got home and my carne asada plate had corn tortillas and not flour! That might seem minor to some but I can't stand corn tortilla. First and last time coming here!!!
