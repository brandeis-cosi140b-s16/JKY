My boyfriend and I stopped to grab a late dinner. We wanted to go through the drive thru but the line was so long and slow we decided that going in and getting it to go would be faster. After dealing with the rude cashier girl and paying, a cook decided to tell us it would be 45 mins to an hour for our food. AFTER we paid. I continued to tell the cashier that if I would have been told that before i paid I would have left. They both got an attitude and proceeded to tell me that they would make our food first. After 10 minutes, we got the food and ate some, I found a HAIR in my burrito. I am NEVER going back to this Taco Bell location again.
