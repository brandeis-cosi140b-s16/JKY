My wife and I visited this place (at Tropicana and Rainbow) last evening. As we were ordering they said we could order ala carte. I ordered Shredded beef enchildas with beans and rice, and my wife ordered beef enchiladas with rice only, ala carte. When the price was unexpectedly very high, we were told we couldn't order ala carte. We decided to go ahead anyway. We paid for our drinks and sat down, there were no chips and salsa or any other appetizers. After awhile the waitress came over to tell us they were out of shredded beef. But, she said we could get chicken " it's shredded too....." We asked about other options, but nothing appealed to us so we got a refund 
and went home to eat a salad. We barely started our drinks, but no refund there. Not a good experience at all. The prices are way too high for an over the counter place. The rest room door was stuck shut and the operators speak very poor English - they'll take advantage of you if you don't speak Spanish. So, if you don't speak Spanish, don't bother.
