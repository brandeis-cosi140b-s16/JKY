We used to really like this place and have taken at least two dozen people here, some of which are regular diners now. That was then..

My husband tried to use a coupon from Dine4az.com and the owner refused to take it, saying it was a fake coupon. First of all, Dine4az.com is a site that restaurants sign up to promote their restaurants. Not just anyone can create a fake coupon and post on that site. The owner completely embarrassed my husband in front of a very large group of friends tonight and made my husband pay for the cheese crisp on the coupon. 

We will never be back!
