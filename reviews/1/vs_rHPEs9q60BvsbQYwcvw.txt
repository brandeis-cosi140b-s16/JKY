Me and 3 coworkers came here for lunch. It takes us less than 5 min to walk there, so we thought it would be perfect for our 1 hour lunch break. The service is awful; people are rude and SLOW. The server brought us a wrong drink and the appetizer took forever -- we order ceso and civiche with chips. Our food took 35min or more, and I had to keep asking the server. We definitely couldn't finish our lunch within an hour there. Again, kitchen is slow and the servers are not helpful nor friendly. DO NOT RECOMMEND..
