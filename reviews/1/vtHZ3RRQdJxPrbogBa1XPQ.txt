Went here for a friend's birthday and it was awful. 

We went at the start of the summer and were seated at the patio. The entire time there was this god awful freezing cold wind blowing down on us. I understand that in Arizona there needs to be some sort of mister system or fan but this was ridiculous. If I were 5 lbs. lighter I probably would have been knocked off my seat. We attempted to move a few times but there was no escaping it.

The food was disgusting and overpriced and the service was terrible. They messed up a couple of orders and ultimately tried to put it on us & gave us a really hard time when it came to handling the check due to the mistakes they made.

Needless to say I will never go back. By far my worst experience at a restaurant ever.
