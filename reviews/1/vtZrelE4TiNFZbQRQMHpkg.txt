I normally enjoy chiptole,but poor service and mismanagement will keep me away from this location.

Let me note that I have always had issues with this location and the training of the people that serve the food.  They act like the portions they are dispersing are coming out of their salary.  Even the lettuce and beans are light.  Note to manager's if there are any, train your employees!

Today they were out of chicken and forks.  The chicken sat on the back counter until the employee responsible for cutting it sauntered out like he just got off break and couldn't care less that people were waiting.

Should have picked Pedro's today.
