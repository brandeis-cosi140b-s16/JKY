While this place has great food, it is the WORST customer service I have ever seen. Total disorganization during busy times, they ignore you when you're standing in line to pick up food and in general have no clue how to handle a busy restaurant. Chef Ramsey would have a heart attack....

The food is not good enough for me to stand in line an hour to pick up a called in order only to be told it wasn't ready yet and they didn't know when it would be.

Lost a customer...
