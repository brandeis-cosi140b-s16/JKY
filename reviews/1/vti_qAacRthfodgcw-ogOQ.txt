Don't bother going and wasting your money.  We went there for Sunday lunch today and waited an hour for our food.  The place was not even half full.  Unacceptable! I ordered the chicken torta (sandwich) which was blah! and not worth $13. My friend ordered the Fish Tacos, that were very disappointing, she said the tacos at Taco Bell were better! and her husband ordered the Fried Eggs, Beans and Potatoes, very basic.  The only decent item we had were the Margaritas, and Nick our server was very nice attentive.  It appeared that the Kitchen was completely disorganized and not experienced.   Very disappointing to say the least.  A big thumbs down!  Oh an the parking there is terrible and the valet SUCKS!
