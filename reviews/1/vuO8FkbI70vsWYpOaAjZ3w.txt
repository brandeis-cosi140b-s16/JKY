My husband was wanting a breakfast burrito and he had recalled getting them from here a year ago. I ran over and picked up 3 of them up. 

We we got home and started eating them they tasted awful. The eggs and meat tasted like yesterday's leftovers. No taste to the burrito and the salsas were just as bland.  For over $16 for three of them I will make my own next time. 

Tried this place once, now twice and won't go back a third time.
