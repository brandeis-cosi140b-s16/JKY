This place used to be a Taco Del Mar and it was awesome. Anyway I was really craving taco del mar and thought is give this place a try.


I got cheese enchiladas. The lady made them and rolled them up and then put them in the microwave.......I almost left right then. Really the microwave? What am I paying you for I can make crappy enchiladas at home. And as I expected they were pretty bad.

Everything here is just super bland. The rice, the red sauce, the beans etc. Its usually easy to tell a place is going to be bad when the only change half the sign from the old restaurant. Taco del Mar....into.....Taco4U.  

There are plenty of good Mexican food places around this just isn't one of them.
