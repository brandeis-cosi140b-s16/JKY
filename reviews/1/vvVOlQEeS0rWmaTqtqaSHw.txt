Horrible food. Horrible service. The place wasn't even that busy and I felt like an inconvenience for them. Been here a couple of times and it always seems to be the same, But I work in the area so I always think it's going to be quick and this time it was almost a 15 min wait for 2 bean burritos! Lol! Ya I'm done with this location.
