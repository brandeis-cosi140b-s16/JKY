If I could give negative stars I would.  Everytime I leave this location I'm so frustrated. Formerly we lived close to a cafe rio in Nevada and loved it. We have been to several locations and always had great customer service. This place is the worst I've ever encountered. The staff is young and careless it seems like they just hired a bunch of 16 year olds and didn't train them. The wait is often back to the door thanks to lack of efficiency. Example, tortilla maker was too busy talking to care that they were out of tortillas while their line of 30+ continued to pile up to wait for her to do her job. For some reason this location is the skimpiest on portion size that I've ever seen. Why is this so inconsistent from Cafe Rio to the next Cafe Rio??? Presentation is aweful, you seriously have some shaggy haired kid throwing tortilla strips on top of your salad with no matter what it looks like he just grabs a handful and throws it on there. I have no problem paying extra for the different sauce that I want or cheese etc. however there is no reason to rudely state it the way this staff does. Seriously where is the training here?? If this wasn't enough to fire the entire staff and start over new then the hair in our salad should do it. Yes that's right a nice long long piece of hair halfway through the salad. Seriously so disgusted and disappointed.  I'm a huge cafe rio fan but after many chances at this location IDE rather starve than go back to this staff. Seriously, fire them all and start over.
