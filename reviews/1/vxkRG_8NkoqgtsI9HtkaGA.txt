If the personalities of the place could be excused this place would get more stars but the undeniable fact is the arrogance of the staff makes it impossible to enjoy this restaurant. The food is great no doubts there but if you aren't ordering it for take out you might as well go to Del Taco down a little bit for all the trouble it is to eat there. They do have NFL Sunday Ticket for football but they only have 8 TVs there and they arranged so that for some you have to sit in a booth. Half your party won't be able to see the game you came there to see. You're better off going to an actual sports bar than to see the Giants playing the Panthers at this poorly arranged and attended joke of a restaurant.
