I grew up on Serrano's and used to love their food. That being said...... Hubby and I ate at the Power and Southern location in Mesa this past Wednesday. The food was TERRIBLE and so was the service. We both got the chimichanga plate, one pork and one red chile beef withÂ enchilada style. The food was bland and tasted old and nasty. The chimichangas were not really fried either. Server was just this side of rude, never returned to the table until we were pretty much ready to go, and never provided a receipt other than the store copy. Over all HORRIBLE experience. Waste of $ 30 some odd dollars. Never again.
