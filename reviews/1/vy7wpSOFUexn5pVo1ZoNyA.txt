Came from out of town and was craving good Mexican food, saw this place on yelp and had good reviews. Not sure how this place got so many good reviews. The salsa was terrible! A good Mexican restaurant should always start off with good homemade salsa and chips, apparently not this place :/ my ice tea was nasty, and my plate was a bit too salty. This place is not your authentic Mexican food. Service was prompt but that's about it. Should've had a burger instead else where.
