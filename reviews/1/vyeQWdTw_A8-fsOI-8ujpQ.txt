Really this place just an over priced no flavor wannabe Mexican food. I know it's trendy hippy earth friendly food, but cmon @lbertos is better than this. 

Rather spend less and slam some &ago bell. 

Hold the tortilla wtf is that, make this stuff at home if your gonna take that route. 

Don't get fooled thinking that  your doing something cool eating at this place. Can't wait till the rest of America wakes up and sends this place to hell. 

Ugh!
