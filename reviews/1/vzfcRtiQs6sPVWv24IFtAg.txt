I wish I could give 0 stars but yelp doesn't let you. Came here for lunch and the place was empty (2 other tables), should have taken the hint that this place has seriously gone downhill. Ordered the steak and avocado salad as usual and had to send it back it was so awful. Asked for a chicken taco instead and they gave me a beef taco. For $13 you can get a large tortilla covered in grease (which they call "2 enchiladas"). What a disappointment the entire meal was. So it you want horrible service, outdated decor, and overpriced, disgusting food -- then this place is for you. It's a shame, I  actually used to enjoy this place.
