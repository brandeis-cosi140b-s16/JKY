UGH... Three weeks ago my husband and I went into the Macayo's restaurant in Goodyear and smelled a TERRIBLE smell.  The hostess explained that the sewer had backed up, but if you go to the back of the restaurant you really can't smell it.  REALLY?!?!?  I don't think so... and I think it must be against a health code someplace to keep the doors open when your sewer is backed up.  The bathrooms are located right next the front doors when you walk in.  There a lot of people in the restaurant eating even with the stench.  I can't believe they continued to serve food, the restaurant should have been closed.  I'll never go back there again.  Disgusting!
