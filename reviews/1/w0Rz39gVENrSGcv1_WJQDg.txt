Would have so enjoyed it more if during our conversation we did not have to scream to each other to be heard. We made the mistake of going on a late afternoon Saturday, between the blaring jukebox so loud that it made your ears almost bleed and the even louder mariachis playing in between the jukebox music, we couldn't even enjoy our meal. Don't think we will be back, although the food was good, it isn't worth the risk of going deaf!
