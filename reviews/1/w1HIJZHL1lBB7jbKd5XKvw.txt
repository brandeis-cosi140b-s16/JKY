This place really needs better customer service. Word of advice, DO NOT hire air headed bimbos to be the hostesses and pay them to file their nails while ignoring incoming customers. My family and I came yesterday for dinner and accidentally walked into the restaurant without a hostess' lead, but only because they werent at the front helping anyone..... Let it be known there were two of these air headed twats. After being literally dragged back outside by one of the clueless waiters, we were introduced to the hostesses (who seem to have some kind of eye kink to work out because they kept rolling their eyes) who told us to wait 30 fucking minutes for a table. We asked them why we couldn't be seated since the restaurant was half full, and they replied with a "LOOK WE CAN'T SEAT YOU RIGHT NOW OKAAAYYY?!?!" (Insert eye kink/roll)..... Right after yelling at us, they proceeded to ignore us like air and continued their non-work related conversation.  I understand if you are short staffed, but you still can't yell at people trying to pay and support your business. I see this restaurant failing in the next 1-3 years if this horrible customer service keeps up. 
*note to the blonde hostess with the pony tail, Your eyebrows are fucked up and needs help. Its better to use your wasted time at work filling in your eyebrows  than to gossip about other people. Thats a better use of everybody's time.
