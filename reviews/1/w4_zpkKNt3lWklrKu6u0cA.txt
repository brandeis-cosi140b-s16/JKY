Long time customer. I walked in, ordered some food to go. I guess they are doing a new thing where the cashier gave me three lids that were for small salsa cups. At salsa bar I wanted more, I put some salsa straight on my meal instead of the cups and a worker (instead of talking to me nicely he right away treated me like some criminal) scolded me for that because "to go" orders (even though I came inside to order it) were only supposed to get three small cups of salsa. Huh?!? If I decided to eat there then I can drown it in all the salsa I want but not if its to go?!? 
They had plenty of my business in the past but will not in the future.
