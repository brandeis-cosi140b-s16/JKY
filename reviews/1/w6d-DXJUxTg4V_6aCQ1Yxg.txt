I really wanted to like this place,  but it was just bad. 

Good: Unfortunately I did not like anything about this place. 

Bad: I had the fish which was small and overcooked. The service was just terrible and the cocktails just tasted strange. I also feel like for the dishes themselves and size it's overpriced.
