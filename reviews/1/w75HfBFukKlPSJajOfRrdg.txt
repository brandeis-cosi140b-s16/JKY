Wow! I can say I won't be back! I got the chicken nachos! it's Chicken, tomatoes, some creamy cheese on the bottom and a few sprinkles of shredded cheese on top! that's it! ooh, and some goop, ohhhhh I mean beans! the chips where better than the toppings, I picked it up to take it back to work with me, and it was ice cold by the time I made it back to work, and I only work about 4 minutes away from there. ! it was horrible! 

The taquitos were ok, nothing to brag about, but that would be all I would order, but the sauce that comes with it is suppose to be avocado sauce, I have no idea what it was. 

My coworker says "diddo"
