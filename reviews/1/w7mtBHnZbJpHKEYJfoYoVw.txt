DO NOT EAT HERE!  The food is microwaved and tastes like it came out of a box.  Yes, they have homemade tortillas, but the stomach ailment you suffer from after visiting here is totally not worth it.  Even the drinks are watered down and the place is full of viejitos.

Instead, take a short drive to Cuco's on Buckeye Rd off of Stoughton and ask for Diana.  She makes great margaritas :)
