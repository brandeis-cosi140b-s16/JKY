I went to this because my girlfriend is absolutely in love with this place. She said it was better than Chipoltle.

Qdoba is the equivalent of Jack in the Box compared to Chipoltle. It's dirty, smelly, grimy, the employees are rude and look dirty and it smells.

There was hair in my food. The tables were unclean. It basically is a sewage dump in this restaurant.
