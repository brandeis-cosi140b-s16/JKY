ALWAYS PAY CASH HERE.

This review is not about the food at Filibertos. I love their food and have had many meals from different locations--I need my Filibertos Fix at least once every couple of weeks. Their portions are big and grossly delicious. 

This review is rather about a shady credit card charge at this particular location.

I drove through, ordered my usual #16 (2 fish tacos with rice and beans), and pulled up to pay. $7.26, as always, awesome. I gave them my card, they swiped, I signed a receipt, got one back, drove off, life is wonderful.

2 days later, I'm checking my credit card charges and I see a charge for $9.26 from Filibertos. WTF? Thankfully, I found my receipt from that purchase. Oddly enough, the receipt they gave me listed that I had paid with $7.26 in "Cash"--it wasn't a credit card charge slip. I should have looked at what they gave me, but who really does? I just assumed it was a credit card charge slip, crammed it into some orifice in my car and drove off. 

I don't really feel like printing out my credit card statement and arguing with them over $2, especially since this is the closest Filibertos to where I live and I don't want them spitting in my food if they see that it's me in the drive-thru. So the bastards will get away with overcharging my card this time. 

But I definitely did just want to warn you all about this shady business. 

I know I will definitely be paying cash for my meals here now. And counting my change.
