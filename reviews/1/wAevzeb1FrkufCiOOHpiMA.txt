One word:
HORRIBLE!
The food was lukewarm and not very appetizing. The only thing decent that was served was the chips and salsa....when it finally arrived at the table.
I tried to do a take-out order on their Chicken Tortilla soup, but was told that they don't have carry-out containers??! I wouldn't be surprised if this place closed in the near future.
