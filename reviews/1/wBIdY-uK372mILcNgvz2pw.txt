We visited this place a couple of times and it was nothing to write home about. On our last trip there our waiter had suggested that we try their signature margarita witch allegedly contained 6 shots of liquor. Both of us being very light drinkers could barley taste any liquor in it what so ever, for a drink that cost 17$. We decided to ask our waiter to consult with the bartender about the issue. The bartender came to our table and copped and attitude with us saying "I know what's in it, I made it!" Very arrogantly.
Of course they offered no compensation or explanation for the virgin drink. These people seem to be very untrustworthy so that was our last trip. Try Azteca, it's less than 2 miles away and never disappoints. Just my two cents.
