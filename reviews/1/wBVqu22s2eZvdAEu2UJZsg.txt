They have have renovated the restaurant and updated the menu, and I don't know that is for the better. We were told we could get almost everything off the old menu, which is what I did (Baja chimi), hubs had the new grilled fish tacos and the kid had mac n cheese.

To start, the salsa was VERY runny when compared to the old. Cutting my chimi was very difficult. For the restaurant that claims it invented the chimi, I find this disappointing. The flavor of the chicken was the same, but the tortilla tasted old and like they left it in the fryer too long. And the Baja sauce is $2 extra. No thanks, I'll get frozen chimi's and deal. It will be a LONG time before I ever want another one,  though.

Hubs liked his tacos but the portion size is too small. Barely any fish, tons of cabbage. And his side of beans was a child's portion.

And the part that makes me upset. My kid always orders mac n cheese and I know it is Easy Mac. Well they made it pretty poorly. She wouldn't eat it. How do you screw up microwaved mac n cheese? I mean, really?

The staff was nice, but that was my only good thing to say.

Lunch on a Sunday and there was almost no one there. That speaks volumes. I should have listened to my gut. Now my gut is screaming at me from how unhappy it is. Lesson learned and I won't go back.
