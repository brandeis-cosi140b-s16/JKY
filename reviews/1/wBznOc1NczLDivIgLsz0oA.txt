Take out orders are only accepted in person.

I called to place an order, received a very annoyed employee on the phone,  and was told (reluctantly) that they do take out orders, but you have to place the order in person. 

I don't understand the policy. 
The employee was rude. (Main reason for the low rating)

I probably won't eat there in the future. Luckily,  I ordered from another local restaurant. Excellent service and food.
