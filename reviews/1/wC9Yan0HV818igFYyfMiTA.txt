Stopped in on a Saturday morning with my wife long story short we had a bad experience with our sever and decided not to leave a tip so I specifically crossed out the tip portion of the receipt. I received my banking notifications from the weekend on Monday morning and noticed that a 19% tip was added anyway. I will never set foot in this place again the food was mediocre at best, the service was horrible, and I was charged an un-authorized amount of money without my permission. I DO NOT recommend you waste your time or hard earned money at this run down "family restaurant"!
