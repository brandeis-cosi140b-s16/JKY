So I went into Zaba's for the first time in a long time. I bought some food for a friend and I. With that food I bought some sour cream, there is barely any sour cream in the bowl. On top of that, they rung me up for guacamole, which cost me more then the 99cent sour cream. I called the store to just say "hey, what gives?" Instead and an explanation, the girl that answered the phone told me she would get a supervisor. The supervisor came on the phone, I told her what happened, and then she told me sorry I didn't hear you and want to me to repeat everything all over again. Her name was Cele... She cared so little but she didn't even take the time to explain why I paid $1.59 for a guacamole when in actuality I bought sour cream. I usually don't leave reviews and this'll be my first one on yelp. I just could not stand the fact that this supervisor, employee, store charged me for something I didn't pay for. I honestly never even would've looked at the receipt, and saw that they charge me more money than I should've been charge for, if it wasn't for the sour cream that was hardly even there.
