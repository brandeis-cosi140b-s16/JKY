I came to this place some time ago and yet the horrible experience still haunts me. Matter of fact it's a running joke between my son and I. When I can't decide where we should eat he always chimes in "let's go to Tony's Mexican Food it's your favorite!". 

I walked in with a certificate from restaurant.com and was seated promptly. We were the first customers of the day. The kiddo had nachos. I wish I had a pic to show how sad this plate was. Chips were stale, the ground beef were so dry, hard and dark brown that I knew it had to be old meat left out or uncovered. The cheese was some generic shreds that wasn't melted at all. Those were the only 3 ingredients for these nachos. The plate looked so dry and sad even a 5 year old was disgusted by it.  

I got the shrimp cocktail and chili relleno plate. Shrimp were so incredibly rubbery and the cocktail was way too acidic for my taste. It literally gave me heartburn upon tasting it. The chili relleno was so greasy it had about a tablespoon of oil under it. The batter was also falling off of the chili. I was so dissapointed in the food that I decided that all this crappy stuff was served to us because I had a voucher. The service just made me feel uncomfortable. Why give offers if you're going to hate when people redeem them? 

To top it all off, they overcharged us on a to-go item.  My son seemed to like their rice and beans so we ordered it to go. The rice and beans plate he had in the restaurant was about $2. The to go price... $6!  I never stepped foot in this place again after that bad experience and I have long lasting memories of why I won't come back in the future.
