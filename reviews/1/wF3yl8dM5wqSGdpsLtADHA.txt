I had to try it, I love Roberto's, but this has a drive thru and would be more convenient. So one night, craving a shrimp cocktail from Roberto's, but already home and not wanting to leave my comfy pjs, I decided to come here. After ordering I was asked to park in the front of the restaurant, as well as the two cars that came in behind me. My food was brought out, 20 minutes after pulling to the front, and incorrect. I proceeded to wait another 15 minutes! When I got home (I live 2 minutes away) everything was cold. So my company very unhappily ate a cold dinner. Next time I'll throw some jeans on and go to Roberto's.
