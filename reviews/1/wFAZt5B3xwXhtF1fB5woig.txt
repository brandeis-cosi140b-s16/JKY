Worst experience from start to finish. Came in the day after Cinco de Mayo. Place was trashed. No one greeted us at the door. Finally someone came. Took forever to get the food (It was 5pm & only 2 other couples in the place).Food was luke warm. Waiter never came around to check. Plus I had order the Plato Caribeno. Wanted it cause it came with plantains. Received it. NO PLANTAINS. Told waiter he responded " yeah were out of those". Didn't care to mention that when ordering. Manager never came out and when we got the check they only too $0.50 off the bill. It was a $15.95 dish. Could of at least taken half off or all. Nothing like my parents remembered it to be. Ian's Pizza here I come.
