Terrible customer service!!!  The waitress ran my transaction through on someone else's debit card and ran the other person's transaction on my card (and the other person's transaction was about $40 more than mine).  She also gave me the other person's card (which I didn't notice until the next day when I tried to use it).  I immediately tried contacting the restaurant to rectify their mistake, but they don't answer the phone, there is only an answering machine.  I left a message, but no one bothered to call me back.  Horrible, horrible, horrible customer service.  I will NEVER go back.
