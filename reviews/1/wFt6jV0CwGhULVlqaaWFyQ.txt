I wish there was negative stars. Reservations or not and you will wait for 30 mins plus. Then you sit down and You wait forever for drinks and food making you late to whatever evening you plan on having. I'm writing this review while waiting on dinner and having a show to go to in 2 mins. Stay the F away from this place.
