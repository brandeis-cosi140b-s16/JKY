This was our 2nd time coming because the first time it was good. Well I don't know what happened but the waiter did not even pay attention to what he was doing. The food wasn't even good the green chili tasted water down and the carne Asada plate tasted like the meat was old. The horchata was disgusting and this will be the last time we come here
