We used to come here a lot. Now, no wonder nobody is ever there. They nickel and dime you. Tiny bowl of chips, about a quarter cup of salsa...if you need more it's $1....no matter how many in your party. If you have six people in your party you get the same amount as someone dining alone. 

The real kicker was we had 3 $25 gift certificates. Our bill was $45...they don't give change and you can't use balance for a tip.  So to not lose out we only used one $25 gift card. We have to go back now. And no the gift certificates were not purchased at a discount. 

Anyways, bottom line we used to love this place, but this new owner had really ruined the whole concept. :(
