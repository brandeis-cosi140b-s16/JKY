Came here for lunch. I would NEVER go back. We felt completely like we were a nuisance to the one waitress working. Mind you we were the only ones in the restaurant. It took 15 minutes to get her attention that we were ready to order. 

The chips (though free) were stale and too thick. The burrito (though large) was doughy and the fillings were not high quality. Very disappointing experience.
