Hate to say it but the El Sombrero we once loved to visit is no more.  My wife's salad was obviously old lettuce.  My wife's dinner of an enchilada, taco, beans and rice was awful in every way.  The enchilada was dried out, the taco meat was cool, the beans tasted spoiled and the rice had obviously either been in a pan overcooking all day, or just simply old rice that was reheated.  I had the same meal, regrettably, except I ordered a chile relleno as well.  Other than the relleno, which was average at best, my meal was equally bad.  Sorry to say, this is one restaurant whose time appears to have gone.  In ten plus years eating here, it has never been bad except this recent vist.

Notably, I did not see the familiar faces of the ladies who we've seen so many times in the past.  Maybe the restaurant was sold/changed hands.  Whatever the reason, I will not recommend this place again.  :(
