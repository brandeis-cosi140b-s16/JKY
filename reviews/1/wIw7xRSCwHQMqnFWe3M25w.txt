We went for lunch today at 11:30 and the doors were locked despite signs all over saying "now open" so I'm giving it 1 star. There were waiters inside who quickly moved away from the door when we approached. I have no idea what that was about. We'd love to try it and will give it a shot again later, but it was an odd experience to say the least.
