I hate to write a bad review on a locally owned restaurant but Don Juan is a waste of money. They have changed the restaurant to eliminate servers. When you walk in, there is someone who takes your order (the person who took our order didn't even know the menu very well). The menu is on a board (like most fast food places) instead of having hard copies. Their menu selection has been cut in half and everything seems more expensive. The burrito, casadilla, chimichanga and something else is $5.95 but make you pay extra for any sides ($2 for rice or beans and $1 for chips and salsa). The Chimichange just had beans and steak in it too, not worth the price! I had the enchilada meal. It came with 3 enchiladas, rice beans and chips. It was not bad, just came out a little cold.  We had to wait 30 minutes to even get our food. The food quality also seems to have gone down. The queso tasted very cheap along with everything else. 

Sadly, at the table we were at there were ants crawling all over the place. How digusting!! I loved Don Juan before and now it is so disappointed. Overheard a lot of other people say that they would not be coming back either.

If I was rating the food alone I may give it a 3 stars but with the service and prices.... I will not be returning!
