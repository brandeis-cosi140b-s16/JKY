Something must have gone horribly wrong since this place was last reviewed, because when I came here the quality didn't match up to past reviews. I ordered the two beef burrito combo plate and my boyfriend ordered the two carne asada taco combo plate. My burritos were completely tasteless - the meat had been cooked way too long with far too little spices to the point where I couldn't even taste the meat, only the texture persevered! The vegetables in the burritos were blanched and equally over-cooked, but had more flavor than the meat (which isn't saying much). The beans were okay and the rice was meh. I seriously thought there was something wrong with my tastebuds at first, but I could taste the horchata (which was good) fine and my boyfriend couldn't taste anything in my burrito either. On the bright side, his tacos was alright. 

If you're out late and drunk to the point where it doesn't matter what you're putting in your mouth, by all means come here. The portions are generous and the prices are decent, if only it had the flavor to match. What a pity.
