Terrible food! My stomach hurt all day afterwards and I could not get rid of the horrible taste. The rice was dry and tasted days old. The beans were flavorless. The enchiladas contained no recognizable meats and had a bad flavor. Just awful overall. And I was very upset by the lack of hygiene, with meats left uncovered and exposed to the files, which were everywhere.
