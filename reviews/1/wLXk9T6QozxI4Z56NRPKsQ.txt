A Mexican restaurant that can't make good beans should have you running for the door. If possible, this place would receive negative stars. 


The service was far from great. 
The food was mediocre at best. 
The salad wasn't fresh (found a limpy brown piece). 
They weren't busy at all yet they failed to send someone to our table to make the guacamole as described in the menu.
The BBQ chicken was served cold; when told the chicken was cold, they merely heated up the same piece. (My food [chimichanga] was also not so hot, but instead of telling them I just stopped eating because it wasn't that good anyway)
Oh, and one of the plates were dirty.

My hunni was immensely disappointed :(
We felt a bit deceived because the hostess that showed us to our table was nice and friendly but I guess customer service doesn't reflect the quality of food.
All in all, $60 at Carlos & Charlies = a crappy meal.  We had to make up for it by eating a wonderful dinner, so we went to Olives, at the Bellagio, which was delish! Review coming soon :)
