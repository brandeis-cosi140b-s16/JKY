This Chipotle location is awful. Being a huge fan of this chain, I know how things should be better than most of the staff - only because I have been going since most of them were in elementary school. 

Service was awful. It took forever to get through the line because the employees just don't listen and don't pay attention well enough. The shift lead, or whoever the heck it was bouncing around was completely flustered (probably because he saw how awful it was at that moment) and was rude to me. I could barely get a tray for my food without him letting out a loud sigh. 

The food was not up to par either. The steak was fatty and chewy, the chicken rubbery. The folded the burrito weird so the sour cream and cheese was at one end and everything else on the other. 

It was a bad experience, and I wont be back to this location.
