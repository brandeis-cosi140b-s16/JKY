Location on Alma School & Ocotillo 
I used to be a Chipotle fan,  but not anymore...  They were stingy with the portion on barbacoa meat.  It looked like about 1/4 cup of meat total on my burrito and a boatload of undercooked white rice. The barbacoa meat had no real taste and no punch to it. My husband ordered the steak burrito and his meat was very chewy. Ummm... Yuck! 
As for the staff...  They need some serious customer service training.  They roll their eyes when THEY make a mistake with your order and the manager acts annoyed when you point out that what they are producing and dishing out to customers is subpar.  I guess the manager is leading by example.  

Stay away from this place... If you want good customer service and better tasting food,  go to Papa Chevo's across the street.
