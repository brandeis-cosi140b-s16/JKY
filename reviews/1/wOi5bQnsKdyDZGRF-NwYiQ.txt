Ok I'm not one to bitch or complain but el hefe was awful. I'm a bartender myself and I'm usually pretty understanding and like to give people the benefit of the doubt but I've never received such awful service in my life. My gf and I sat at the bar, ALL of the bartenders were very inattentive. The best service I received was from the expos. My tacos came out wrong, they reordered them and the new ones came out quickly but the meat was burnt and I had to send them back once more. The bartenders weren't paying any attention so it took three times longer than it should have. I ordered a margarita with no sweet and sour, the bartender gave me a super confused look. I told him specifically tequila, lime juice, agave and soda and he still gave me a confused look with some attitude. Once I received the margarita i tasted it and it wasn't the best but I was so over complaining that I sucked it down anyways. There was a female bartender working also and disregarded my gf and I but was paying attention to all of the male patrons. I don't ask for a lot, I just want good service. If the service was good I probably wouldn't have even complained about the tacos. They would have received at least three stars if the service would have been decent but unfortunately it was the worst service I've ever received and that says a lot since I come from the same industry and I'm usually very understanding. Monty in particular was the one giving us the worst service. He didn't bother to check on us once. It took over ten minutes to close out my tab and the only reason it didn't take longer was because one of the new female bartenders who had just clocked on was nice enough to ask how I was doing and she closed out my tab. The service was awful the food was ehh and I won't be coming back the next time I visit Tempe.
