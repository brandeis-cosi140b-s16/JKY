I guess, judging by all the other reviews, that I was a little late to get the decent tasting food. To be fair it was only like 2:30. There should have been some left.

This was gross. Not to be all rude about it, but bad food is bad food. And, baby, this was HORRIBLE.

So, I ordered the #1, which was four rolled tacos stuffed with shredded beef topped with guac and then cheese along with rice and beans. How you can mess this up is beyond me, but I'm about to tell you.

First, please don't spread the guacamole all over the tacos like it's a sauce. It is not. It's a side. Then, don't even think about putting shredded cheese on top of the guacamole like the picture illustrates on your drive-up menu board. I will gag.

I thought I was fixing the problem until I bit into the first rolled taco. What's another word for 'where in the heck is the moisture in this taco?' Oh, that's right, DRY. If you deep fry something and then stick meat with no moisture into that, it will be no wonder that I feel as though I've been driving down a freeway going 80 with my mouth wide open. That's pretty dry, FYI. Also, covering it up with guacamole may help, but what a scam. By the way, the guac was the only decent thing going on here.

Please tell me how you can mess refried beans up. No, honestly, I had no idea there was another way other than scorching them to death. These were so heavy and filled with more cheese (they apparently love their cheese here) that I couldn't even eat them. They didn't even taste like beans. Please take 'mexican' out of your name. I'm embarrassed. The rice was the same thing. Just heavy, not light. Weird.

I can't do this place ever again, I wish  I'd just kept driving past it day after day. Foul.
