Coming from So Cal, Mexican food is a vital part of my everyday food category. I was hoping to find a place I could eat here when visiting my parents. I can say this is probably one of the worst establishment I've ever been in and truly some of the worst "food" (if I can even call it that) that I've ever had. The "salsa" was water with little flavor. The chips were very greasy. The beans had no flavor but they were the correct texture. The Spanish rice was edible but barely edible. The portions were equivalent to a child's plate. Honestly I am shocked that this place has as many positive reviews as it does. I will not be back. I usually love hole in the wall, dive'y places. This place just didn't cut it. Oh and they charge you for EVERYTHING.
