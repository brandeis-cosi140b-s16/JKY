Yes, I am giving this place 1 darn star!! Let me explain why..
Thursdays, 50 cent drinks until midnight.. nice.. but NOT worth it!
First off, it's so packed! And sweaty! 
Everyone is totally s*faced and there is always bound to be drama!
I got kicked out of there once when I was not even making a scene, ugh.. 
My phone was stolen there, seriously, why??
My mp3 player was stolen there.. wtf?
Some guy stole MONEY from me there and no one did a thing when I told security. 
The guys there look like they all have two baby mamas and live at home.
There are always random fights breaking out. 
I don't know, I'm sooo not into this place, it was a true nightmare and I'm scarred for life from my experience there.. be careful everyone!
