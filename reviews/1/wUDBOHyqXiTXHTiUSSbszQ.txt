The Blue Agave is theoretically the seafood side of the Mexican restaurant, Gardunos, at the south side of the casino. I have friends in the Palms management but I'll tell them the same thing I'm telling you: This is a horrible mistake. 
First time I went there (in the company of a columnist for Nevada's biggest circulation paper) I found it very difficult to find service. Finally I was able to order a been and a dozen oysters. The chef literally rinsed the oysters in water. Don't try that at home. Tastes even worse than it sounds.
Second time I went there during a three-day alternative music festival. I was dying for some seafood - but should have hit the buffet. Again, sitting at the bar waiting for someone to take my order. It took about 15 minutes for one of the floor waitresses to come by with a menu, half of which was unavailable. (One of the reasons I sat at the bar, or sit at the bar on any night, is for quick service. A huge mistake there.)
I ordered a mixed seafood roast, which is a creamy thing most of the casinos have at their seafood bars. It can be quite tasty. In this case, I actually received their version of seafood gumbo, which I grudgingly ate anyway despite a passing resemblence to cat vomit.
Also, the margaritas are terrible. 
The coolest thing about this place is that all the rock and roll people who wandered in there while I was there had something to laugh about that weekend. Seriously, you will ask out loud if there is service available and then you will wish you hadn't.
