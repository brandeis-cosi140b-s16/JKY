Besides being Emmy at 8, maybe it is early closing. The food was poor. Ordered tortilla soup and guacamole. Soup took 30 min and guacamole 40. Thought I was ordering quick derive items. Soup was Luke warm and not very good.
Guacamole was flavorless . No additional chops offered or given. Manager came by and all he could say was I am sorry. 
Put you time and money somewhere else.
Then it took a bit to get a check and no other apologies
