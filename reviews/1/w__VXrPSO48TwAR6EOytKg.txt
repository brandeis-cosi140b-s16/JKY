Well first of all when you offer a chili verde burro of any color I'd hope it would at least have flavor I even tryed to spice it up a bit with the salsa they have to offer lets just say this is the second worst place I've ever had a burrito this bad first being a hole in the wall place located in marfa tx. That being said I noticed a Filibertos on my way to the little sombrero, next time ill be sure not to pass it up
