I ate at the one in terminal 3. -  to sum it up it always this reassuring or Wendy's across the way - I should have chosen Wendy's 

Food was way to salty for the wings! And the chimmichanga was bland - but that would have been OK if the service would have been OK - but it sucked - I know the place was short staffed but there was no attempt in the wait staff to even care!  Never checked and looking for a refill on a drink was an act of congress !  Terrible!
