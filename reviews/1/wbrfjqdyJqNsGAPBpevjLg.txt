I have to preface this by saying the experience was with takeout, not sit down and perhaps the issues were due to that. Anyhow it's simple: cold-as-ice food, no packets or small containers of salsa or any condiments of any kind, shriveled up tiny limes, the worst-ever Mexican takeout I've ever had. Just dry tacos, cold beans and so-so rice. The best part was the average tortilla chips. This was a big order for about 10 people in a corporate setting and it was just plain bad.
