Well guys I dont have much to say thats gonna be nice about this place. My dinner here was like someone used my tortilla as toilet paper, threw some cheese in it rolled it up and stuck it on my plate. Just in case I was not sure of the flavor i was experincing the stuck a nice big spoonfull of what was in my tortilla on my plate and called it beans. The only thing mexican about the food is they say its mexican and perhaps they keep their tortillias in the bathroom (kitchen) to use as toilet paper and cut down their cost and staffing of a real cook.
