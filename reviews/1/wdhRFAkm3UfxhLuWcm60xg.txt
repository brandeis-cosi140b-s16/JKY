This is the Worst Filibertos I've been to. And I've been to a lot of them all over the valley. I asked him twice to put sour cream and guacamole on the side and it was even on the receipt. Got my food and guess what it was all over the top not on the side. When I asked them about it I got an attitude like I was putting them out if they had to remake it. Since I didn't want spit in my food I just ate it that way which was gross! Oh and I forgot to mention they forgot my drink. The bathroom was disgusting and toilet clogged. I'll NEVER  come here again. I'd advise you all find somewhere else. Too many choices  around to settle for bad bad service!!
