Okay,  obviously anyone who likes this place isn't a native Arizonan who knows what real Mexican food is!  First indication that it was not going to be great was the salsa tasted like it came from a jar.   We ordered a quesadilla which was pretty good,  however the "guacamole" was basically pureed avocados.   I ordered the pork green chili burrito with green chili sauce and cheese on top, which was actually pretty good and the pork was really tender.   The rest of the food lacked something to be desired.   
We also discovered a hair in the chips, and then when my daughter got her food,  she found a hair in it as well!  When we told the waitress about the hair,  instead of refunding us for the meal,  she gave us $10 in a gift card, which is worthless since we won't be eating there again.
