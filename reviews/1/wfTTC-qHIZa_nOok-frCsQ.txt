It was such a nice day I wanted to find a patio to sit on and drink a margarita. I was a little fooled by a review that mentioned "outdoor" seating. I guess I still can't wrap my head around all the fake b.s. that makes up this weird town. Yeah, no outdoors to be had. So I walk in and head for the bar.

Margaritas - boring and watered down. Nothing exciting and really I can't believe that a casino would make something so ridiculously weak. They were fairly cheap though so that was ok.

Chips and Salsa - Boring again. The bean dip and salsa had no flavor. The chips were kinda stale. I kept wishing there was flavor. None to be had.

Fajitas - Seriously, even Casa Bonita does a better job. God were they ho hum. I mean at least TRY to put a little flavor in there. 

Service - The guy was nice enough but it seemed like he was tired and burned out. He was trying to be nice but you can tell he's been in Las Vegas too long.

Atmosphere - It would have been ok but then some horrible music started up. Apparently, yet another cheesy, mouth breather "light show." The blaring sound of "Cotton Eyed Joe" had me practically running out the door. 

No, I won't be back. This is the first time I've been in Sam's Town and see NO REASON AT ALL to ever make it a second time. Place was just sad. I drove back home wondering if real Mexicans get irate at the insulting bastardization of their food. I KNOW this crap isn't what they eat. Save your money and go elsewhere. Anyone who has given this place a good review should stop reviewing anything because you CLEARLY have poor taste.
