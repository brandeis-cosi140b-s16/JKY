Customer service was horrible the cashier was being so rude forgot to charge us for the drinks that I clearly told her I wanted. Then she came back and told us that we need to pay for them if we want them. Well duh! I didn't expect free drinks because of your mistake. The food was  dry and flavorless I've heard so many good things about this restaurant and I came out really disappointed.
