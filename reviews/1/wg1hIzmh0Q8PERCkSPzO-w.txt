I used to love this restaurant, it's been years since I've been. My boyfriend and I went last night, and we never plan to go back. We have both been getting sick since shortly after eating there and still are very sick. To start it was very hot in the section we wear sat in, were told it's because it's by the window, but don't see why they wouldn't make accommodations for that. Other ladies behind us were saying how hot it was, and they were both from Mexico,just saying. So we had to ask twice for a salsa, then we ordered ceviche to eat as an appetizer, and that was the worst decision ever. They did not offer it as an appetizer,which makes no sense to me. I still order the $25 item, to receive bland, limeless, saltless and all-around flavorless rubber and onions. Everything was severely overcooked and just plain bad in the ceviche. My main course wasn't much better. Everything was bland, dried out from sitting under a heat lamp, and the chicken looked like it came out of a wrapper. We ended up spending close to $100 altogether including tip, just to spend the next 24 hours in pain. This place has sadly become the worst Mexican food place ever,for me. We wish we had gone to McDonald's for our date night, rather than having gone there.
