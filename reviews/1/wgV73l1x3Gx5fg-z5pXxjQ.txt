The owners of Pinatas tried too hard to fit in their surroundings in trendy Grayhawk and focused too much on the décor. Maybe they should have tried the food first. This is bland, greasy Mexican fare that has nothing to offer as far as originality. The chips left a greasy muck on my fingers and I'm pretty sure the salsa was Pace Picante. The waiters and bartenders were so busy mingling with the beautiful people that they didn't notice how terrible the service was. And did I mention this spot is overpriced? I'll go to Taco Bell next time I want a Gordita. Skip this one -- Xtapa Joe's and Jalepeño Inferno further north are much more reliable.
