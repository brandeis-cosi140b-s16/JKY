i was with a group of four and we entered the La Casa Blanca at 1:30pm for lunch, we left at 3:20pm.  We ordered drinks and then waited for over half an hour for our waitress to return to take our food order.  It then took over 45 minutes to get our food and the food was awful.  The meat tasted like it had been cooked before, put in the refrigerator, then reheated.  The retried beans were stale and hard looking like they were microwaved, and the guacamole was a dark grey color.  When we asked for the check the waitress never came back.  We went up to the front and asked again for the checks and waited again for 15 minutes.  Now I was reaching my end of patience and decorum and asked for the manager.  She came out and stated in her rebuttal that we should have asked at the table for new food and not at the end of service.  I was (over the cliff) and asked why in the world would we do that when it had already taken so long for our first order?  The manager just starred at me with no hint of being attentive.  I asked why she was turning the blame onto us, and she smiled.  This "Manager" actually accused me of being belligerent and talking over her.  The only good thing was the diet coke!  I will never support this establishment nor will I recommend this place.  Too bad because its beautiful!
