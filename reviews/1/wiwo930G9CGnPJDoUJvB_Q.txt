Ok, so this is right down the road from me, so I thought convenience!  Unfortunately, that did not save this place.
1. menu is expensive.
2. Food is alright, but not memorable in any way really
3. The staff are pretty much worthless.  I went there 3 times... 3 times!  And each time they screwed up the order.  The girlfriend is vegitarian, and of course they still put meat in it, so she couldnt eat her dinner.  Then when we told them about this, they just said sorry and thats it.  The next time we went back we ordered churros, didnt get them, but they didnt forget to bill us!  Of course, when we called they said "ohh well come back and you can have them.  Yes I get that, I paid for them, but lets not go out of our way and go above and beyond... lets just make me waste my time and gas for your screw up... and then there was another time they screwed it up.

So we have a rule.. 3 strikes and your out!  Would not recommend this place...
