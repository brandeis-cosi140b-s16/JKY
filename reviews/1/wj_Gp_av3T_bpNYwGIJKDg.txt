I was genuinely excited to see a Moe's at the airport. I had had it dozens of times before when I lived elsewhere and loved it but hadn't had it in years, so I thought "Yay!" Oh, my goodness. Flavorless, the rice was undercooked, they are incredibly expensive even for an airport, and they should start their staffing frm scratch. Not only was the young lady at the register unwelcoming, she did not give me the correct change for my payment and when I brought it up she gave me a look and said "Yeah, yeah." before fixing it. Are you kidding me? Honey, I understand that maybe working fast food is not your ideal job or maybe you've had a bad day but come on.
