We have been going to Mannys on and off for several years.  It has been over a year since our last visit.  Ordered shrimp tacos today and was very disappointed.  Two small cold flour tortilla shells with nothing inside but eight mini shrimp.  Served with a side of thousand island dressing and shredded lettuce salsa.  I don't recommend you order this seafood item here.  If you can't say anything nice better not to say anything my mom always told me.  So I guess that is it folks we will not returning again until I can forget today's eating experience.  The Mexican beer was the best part of my meal and only $3.75 each.
