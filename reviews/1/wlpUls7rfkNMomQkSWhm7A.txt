Stopped for lunch yesterday. Drive through is a restricted lane, once you're in, you're stuck till you reach the end. No way to opt out if it's taking entirely too long. Worth mentioning because it takes entirely too long. Seems this is the place where they train slow drive through staffers to excel at being even slower than imaginable. The car in front of me was sympathizing with raised arms. (I was quiet, politely waiting in my car, not even making a scene). DONT come here if you're time limited in any way. Come here if you've got all the patience in the world and you must have standard Taco Bell fair. If thought it would have taken as much time as it did, I would have sought speedy lunch elsewhere.
