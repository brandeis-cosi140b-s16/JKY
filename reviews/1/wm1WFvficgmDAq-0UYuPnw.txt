Just moved to Maricopa and decided to stop and eat there today for lunch.  Had a friend with us.  The food was "ok".  I had their fish tacos and literally had to hunt through the bell pepper and onion to see if there was any fish in there, never was sure.  It was 87 degrees outside and hot inside as well.  Had to ask them to please at least turn on a ceiling fan.  Our friend had to go to the restroom while we were there, when she got to the ladies room, the handle was off the door and you couldn't open it or even if you could, there would have been no way to lock it.  She told one of the waitresses, the waitress told her to just go in the men's????  When we said we wanted 2 separate checks (me and my husband) and our friend wanted to pay for hers.  We were told they couldn't so they would just divide the total between the 3 of us.  I had to give them my debit card, my husband had to give them his and our friend had to give them hers?????  They actually said they needed 3 separate cards to make it work???  By this time..... we asked for a manager, the service was so ridiculous!  We were told, "O I'm sorry, he just left... he went home sick today". ????  The place wasn't clean, service horrid and it was hot as hell in there.  So...... If you don't mind bad screwed up service and like mediocre food, this is your place.  We will not be back.
