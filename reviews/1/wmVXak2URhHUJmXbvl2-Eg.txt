This place is absolutely awful.  It took forever to get our food. There were lots of employees standing around; at one point they seemed to completely forget our order.  The table was dirty. The salsa bar was a complete mess and looked filthy.  There were lots of screaming children running around. The food was cold when we finally got it. The whole place creeped me out.
