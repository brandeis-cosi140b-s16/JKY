When we arrived we headed to the saloon where we seated ourselves, waited a bit for service, When service did arrive, we were told to take our time, but felt rushed by the server.  A comment was made because I brought a special salad in I have to eat because of my health and doctor recommendations. My daughter and wife ate off the menu, and i split the lunch with my wife. Maybe it's because of health laws, which I was made aware of by the waiter, but the initial remark sparked this yelp comment.  He did tell me later he realized we did order from the menu, but reminded me you don't come into a bar and bring your own beer!   True, but then I also have to adhere to my food i brought and not letting it spoil in the hot car. I will not say i'm not at fault on this entirely, but  I should have consulted the manager prior. It's just that b4 making any comments at least question and find out why I had brought in the food; don't just assume, or state your policy politely.  The ice cream shop would even spot me a small complimentary scoop to see if it agreed with my tastes. So I said ok, never mind and walked out.  We didn't even bother going to the mercantile store!!  I'd not be interested to revisit this place
