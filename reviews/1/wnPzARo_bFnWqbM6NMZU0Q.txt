Went here this past Saturday hoping to get some yummi food. Unfortunately, it was still closed at 9:30 a.m. I guess I am used to Mexican restaurants being open early but that is my fault for not checking the hours. I went and had breakfast elsewhere and then came back because I have heard the radio commercials saying they have Tejuino(which my mom loves, so we were excited to try it). So I went back at around 11:00 a.m and entered the restaurant. There was nobody there and we had to wait for someone to greet us. When we asked about the tejuino(which is advertised on their windows as well) the guy simply responded, " No we don't have any." This after a 30 minute car ride, Bummer!
