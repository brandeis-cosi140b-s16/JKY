My husband and I chose this place for our anniversary dinner, having just moved into the neighborhood and wanting to find a Mexican restaurant to frequent. This will not be it. 
The food was disappointing, with the red sauce tasting like Chef Boyardee and the rice like Rice a Roni Spanish rice. 
Then our server, Ivan, was mia for most of the evening, forgetting us it would seem for over twenty minutes after we asked for boxes and the check. 
It's kind of a dark place, even though there are a lot of windows.  
There was lots of smoke from the kitchen as they must burn a lot of meat. I definitely left smelly smoky and hate that. 
And their soda tasted off, like they weren't using real coke products. 
Needless to say, we will not be going back.
