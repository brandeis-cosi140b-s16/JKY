First off, I love chipotle. 
This location is not visited enough to have the freshest food. Every time I go the pico de gallo has already begun to ferment and has whites bubbles floating around in groups. They still proceed to serve it's like they don't see it's spoiling and for that reason the customer service LACKS BIG TIME. 

If you love Chipotle go to Tempe Marketplace. The Grove location has no standard will make you distrust Chiptle.....
