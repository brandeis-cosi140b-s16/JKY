Used to fairly regularly drive 50 miles from Mesa just for the lunch buffet here. One time, they'd packed it up early because things were slow, but at least set it back up for me. This last time, the rice was noticeably dried out, and the refried beans had been reduced to a crust resembling parched desert. When I asked the manager if these items were going to be freshened up, she copped an attitude instead. "These *are* fresh!" she insisted, plowing the old rice under with a spoon, and angrily trying and failing to stir new life into the crusty beans. "No, these are disgusting," I said, and walked out. I won't be back.
