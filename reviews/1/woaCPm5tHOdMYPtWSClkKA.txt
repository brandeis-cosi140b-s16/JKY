So we came to this restaurant about 4 years ago and it was good.
We came back here tonight 11/12/2014.
Wow I can't figure out what was so special about this place.
We get seated in a both, so that was nice with the baby. Then that was it no water on the table to drink, while waiting for the waiter. Then after about 10 minutes a waiter shows up we order our drinks and food and a hour later the waiter tells us, sorry for the wait, their are only 2 cooks. We finally got our food a hour and a half later after ordering.
Well I'll never come back here again.
I wonder if they will wait a hour and half after we leave for their money.
Wow and this dinner was lousy worst so called Mexican food ever.
The check for the 3 of us was $40. That's crazy.
