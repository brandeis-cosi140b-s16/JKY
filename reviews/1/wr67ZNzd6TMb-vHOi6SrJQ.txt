I ordered a carne asada burrito and a pepsi. The lady didnt charge me for a pepsi and then has an attitude. Then the woman in the drive thru handed my drink to me with the lid partially on and watched it spill all over everything in my car and then closes the window to walk away. She saw that we needed napkins and she wouldn't acknowledge us.
