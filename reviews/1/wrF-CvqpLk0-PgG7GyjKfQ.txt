RUDE RUDE RUDE. I asked a question about an item on the menu on one occasion, and the condescending waitress treated me like a deaf child who couldn't read. Another time, the waitress we had was obviously having a bad day because she kept cursing in Spanish under her breath, and practically threw our food at us when it came, and then never returned the rest of the time we were there. The glasses, silverware, and tables have been dirty EVERYTIME, and they always take FOREVER. Not returning to this location.
