Big disappointment. My husband and I were there this past Saturday night.  The food was riduculously expensive, and the ambiance and quality of the restaurant did not warrant the cost.  We won't be back.

Weird lighting, we chose to sit on the patio, because the interior of the restaurant was almost painfully bright, think hurt your eyes bright.  Conversely, the patio, which is contiguous to the parking lot had a few bulbs burned out, and even though they had 2 fireplaces, neither were lit.  We felt like we were sitting in the dark, in a parking lot, which of course, we were.  If the fireplaces were lit, and they had more screening from the parking lot, and the bulbs had been replaced, it could have been nice.
