No, no, no.  If you are looking for even remotely good Mexican food, DO NOT eat here.   Go to Ajo Al's instead, which is just down the road off of Shea and 70th street.  At Garduno's, the food is over priced and bland.  Taco salad - blah - nothing exciting.  Maybe, the only thing to get excited about are the complimentary sopapillas with honey.  For that, I give the place one star.
