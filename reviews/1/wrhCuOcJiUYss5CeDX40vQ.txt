I went to buy 3 menudo bowls, the menudo top lids melted all over my pass seat. I went back to let the register girl know she said it's your fault, not even I'm sorry or what can we do to help. She said it's your fault and what do you want me to do. I asked to speak to the owner she said he isn't here she said here is his #  she wrote it on my receipt. I called it when I left and it was the wrong number. Well I had a bad experience,
