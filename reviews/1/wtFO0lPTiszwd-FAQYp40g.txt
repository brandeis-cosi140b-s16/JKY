We were so excited to try this place, and were completely disappointed. The food was the worst Mexican we have ever eaten! My husband had chili colorado, that was dried up beef chunks in a bland sauce that tasted like canned chili. I had fish tacos that were flavorless, and the fish was undercooked and tough. The waiter never even bothered to ask how our food was. We will never go back and do not recommend.
