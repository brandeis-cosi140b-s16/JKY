I visited this chipotle for the first time today and it will most certainly be the last time. I ordered a chicken bowl. The chicken, and all of the meat, looked like it had been sitting there all day. I also asked for lettuce on it, there was only scraps at the bottom and instead of getting more to actually have lettuce on my bowl she just put a little. The customer service was lacking and the food was not to the same standards as other locations. I recommend steering clear of this location and going the extra couple miles for better food and service.
