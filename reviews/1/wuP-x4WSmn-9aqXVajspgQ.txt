The food is ok at best. It's convenient so we've had it a few times. Last night I ate the rolled tacos with rice and beans. 5 hours later I was hospitalized at gilbert mercy. Severe food poisoning. I will never go back again.  I'm wondering if anybody else got sick last night from this particular location.
