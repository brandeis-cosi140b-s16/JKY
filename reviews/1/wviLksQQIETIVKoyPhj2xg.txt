The best rice and beans food ever.  The meat is there, you can see the 1 oz put on there, and you can almost taste it, but almost doesn't count.  The guacamole is priced at like 2-4 avocados, 400% or so markup, not bad.  Don't come here, because its good as junk food.  Carbs, and more carbs with a little fiber and maybe protein.
