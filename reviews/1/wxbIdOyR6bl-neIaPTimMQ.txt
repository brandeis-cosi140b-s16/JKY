We were extremely dissatisfied by our visit. We  used to frequent Cocina Real, in the same location, and since the staff and management are the same we assumed the quality would be as well. Right off the bat we realized how sub-par the food actually was- the tortilla chips were completely disgusting. They were so oily (the wax paper lining the chip basket was completely soaked) and a horribly flaky texture. We wondered if the chef has fried the tortillas at the wrong temperature or for too long. When we received our food, we were horrified at the greasiness of our food. It went beyond the typical unhealthiness of mexican food- the food was literally inedible from the amount of oil it was covered in. The size of our orders was so small for the price we paid for them. We were terrified to order dessert for fear that our flan would come drenched in oil as well. When we received the check, the prices we were charged did not match those on the menu (we were charged additional). We will not be returning to this restaurant.
