It was 2pm and the owner was on his computer in the dining room (uhh they make offices for that stuff), but this was Peoria and the town is not exactly brimming with good food options and I was on a lunch time crush. The town has alot of those annoying, "we close at 2pm restaurants" So, I took a chance and was the only person eating in the place at this time. They only have about seven choices in the lunch special category and once they said that they only use DARK meat chicken, I should have hit the road. These establishments are saving money by not wanting to serve more expensive products. The chips and salsa came out first and the chunky salsa looked like it was ortega with green onions tossed in there, but the darker thin sauce was at least pretty good and the top layer of the chips were crunchy and fresh. The food though went downhill. The sour cream green sauce ground beef enchilada was a disaster, although for some reason I did not mention this to the nice owners when I normally would have a comment. I told him it was "not bad" It was not a sour cream sauce, it was a lob of sour cream tossed onto the food and the green sauce was not present or was tasteless. The ground beef fell into a the tasteless category as well, no seasoning or flavor and the tortillas were not helping much either. Nice staff, but not good mexican food.
