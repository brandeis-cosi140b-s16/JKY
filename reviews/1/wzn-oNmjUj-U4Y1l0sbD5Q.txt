Disgusting;  we just stopped in for an early dinner (4:00 p.m. Sunday evening) and went into the bar so we could watch the games.   There were two gals and a guy behind the bar, just chatting between themselves, and a few other patrons.   Every table that was empty was dirty, the bar had dirty dishes piled on it.   When we let it be known that we wanted to sit,and to please clean a table, we received so much attitude that the three of us walked out.   Obviously no management was on site, one of the gals (heavy, long curly hair) was extremely rude.   

I'm so disappointed as I live in the same neighborhood but won't be going in there again.   If it's that filthy in front of customers, omg what does that back kitchen area look like? 

All three of those employees should have been fired on the spot; as it was we ended up going to Tommy's and had a clean fabulous atmosphere in their bar area with much better food.   Thank you Tommy's..
