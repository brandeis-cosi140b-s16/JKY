As a frequent business traveler, this was my go-to place in the airport between connections.  My usual dish was the chicken verde enchiladas with black beans and rice.  The verde sauce and sour cream were plentiful, the rice flavorful, and the black beans were a nice change from typical refried beans.  They recently pared down the menu but the chicken enchiladas are still offered.  I have tried this dish 3 times since the change and each time is equally awful.  What the heck is going on???  I have to order extra verde sauce and sour cream because all that is given now is a scant squirt of each.  The rice is now a very bland white rice with some green specks of maybe parsley?  Black beans are now replaced with refried beans that are as equally bland as the rice.  Three times is enough.  I am sorry to scratch this one off the list.  I predict that this restaurant will close in the near future.
