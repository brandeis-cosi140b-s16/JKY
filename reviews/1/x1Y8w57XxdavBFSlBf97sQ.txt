If I could only use one word to describe my dining experience at Valle Luna it would be LOUD. If you want to have a conversation, get ready to yell at the person sitting across from you.

My family and I went there on a Friday night. After a short wait we were seated in a booth right by where the waitstaff comes out from the kitchen and bar, which definitely contributed to the noise.

The place is pretty crowded and the atmosphere was one of general chaos. I saw the waitstaff running on more than one occasion and there were lots of kids screaming and running around, too. Not a great place for a relaxing dinner after a long week at work. Our server was fine - not particularly friendly but not rude. She just kinda went through the motions. I ordered the fish tacos with black beans and rice. For as lively as the restaurant was, the food was rather lacking. Well, the entr√©e anyway, the chips and salsa were good. The fish in my tacos was small and overcooked and the tortillas were kinda dry. The rice and beans were just okay, nothing special. 

Afterwards, I just felt bloated and gross. There are way better options for Mexican food in this town. I won't be going back to Valle Luna any time soon.
