Sigh - another restaurant going downhill in Madison. I don't know if Kevin Tubb is still involved here, but I suspect he isn't anymore since things have changed over the past year, and not for the better. Tex's used to have the best queso in town - and I know it was Kevin's recipe - but sometime in the past 12-24 months they changed the recipe and it is now bland and watery and a big step backwards. I'm sure it's cheaper to make, but damn, it used to be really good. The other thing we noticed is that there is way less of the good stuff (i.e. meat) in the quesadillas and burritos. The last time I was there, about 6 months ago, I actually peeled open my smoked duck quesadilla (which used to be packed with duck) to see if there was, indeed, any duck present, since all I could taste was onion and pepper. I haven't been back since, which is a shame because it used to be a regular stop for me, my guy, and my kids.
