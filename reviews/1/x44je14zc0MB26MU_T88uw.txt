There is such a thing as "bad Chipotle", and when it happens to you, it's really quite awful. My rating for this location WAS a 5, but that was awhile ago and employees and times have changed. This 1-star rating is based on my last two visits, but I will elaborate on my visit yesterday. 

The Bad:
1. Incredibly long line due to incredibly slow service. Chipotle is usually a rockstar at squashing long lines! What is going on here and why are there employees standing around chatting when there are customers to help and filthy tables to clean? Seriously, at one point there was only ONE guy on the assembly line and NO-ONE at the register. They were NOT short on help.
2. Poor ingredients. Black beans were actually black water with several beans floating around (my boyfriend's burrito was very soggy as a result). Mild tomato salsa was mostly liquid (I have NEVER seen this before at a Chipotle). I had to ask the guy to scoop my salsa at the end where some dry tomatoes were hanging out. I don't want salsa liquid on my salad. Which brings me to another problem... where was my salad lettuce??? I wish I had been paying attention when he put it in the bowl, because when I started eating it, there was barely any. I can't have rice or beans, so I really need an appropriate amount of lettuce to bulk this thing up. I also opted to pay for double chicken, and I wish I hadn't,  as the chicken was quite fatty and gristly.
3. This is a personal pet-peeve of mine, but as we were eating outside, we saw a couple employees getting into a car that was parked front-and-center by the entrance. This shows a great lack of caring for the customers. Even when I was 20 and working at Starbucks, I knew not to take those few coveted spots in front. How rude!

The Good:
1. Um... well really, nothing. How awkward.

Overall, this location has gone to hell and is in dire need of a change in management. It no longer meets the standards that I have come to expect from Chipotle.
