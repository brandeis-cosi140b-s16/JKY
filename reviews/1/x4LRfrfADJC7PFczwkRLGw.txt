Previous reviewer is absolutely right about Cancun, and it's too bad since this is a recent 'overhaul' to the restaurant.  I think it's changed hands or management or something.  Until about 6 months ago, I'd have recommended it as a go-to for good, cheap Mexican.  We were there last month and I was so horribly disappointed.  Everything was different, from the Pace-quality salsa to the awful chips to the really boring burrito.  Where's my fajita taco salad, dammit???

Prices have increased substantially and the quality has nose-dived, so I recommend giving it a pass.
