HORRIBLE SERVICE. I ordered takeout which was supposed to be ready in "15 minutes". It was ready in 15 but no one even looked at it or realized that people were waiting. We sat there for another ten minutes before I decided to ask someone. The guy attempts to tell me it isn't ready (after 30 min) and when I point to the to go boxes he realizes that it has been ready. He comes back with the food which wasn't even done well and forgets to put in the chips and salsa which I paid for. After telling him he forgot the chips, he comes back with a bag with about ten chips and one thing of salsa (when I paid EXTRA) for more salsa. All in all in was probably the worst takeout experience I've had. Bad service. Food was cold. No extra salsa that I paid for (which is ridiculous you have to pay for extra salsa). If you want Mexican food, you're better off with taco bell. Sad.
