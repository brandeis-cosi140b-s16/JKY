Chips, salsa, and beer were about all that was good at this restaurant. It was my first time here with my husband and I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed the chips and salsa it gave me high hopes for the rest of the meal. We got our chili con queso and the cheese was grainy and way too thick. Then I got my carintas tacos with rice and beans. The beans seriously lacked salt and the rice tasted old and crispy. The tacos were the worst of all. The meat was harder than beef jerk and soggy in the rest of it. I am sadly disappointed and will not be returning.
