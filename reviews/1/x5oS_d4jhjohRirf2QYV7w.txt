My mom & i decided to try this new place. We ordered to go. When we got home, my torta was missing. So i went back & the dumb waitress has a bad attitude saying it was with my order & I was lying.... Told ME not to have a attitude.. So i asked her to speak to the owner, saying i didnt think the owner would appreciate her talking to a paying customer so rudely. So the owner come out, looks at me like im dumb & says "ok. I'll talk to her" like she really didnt care about my problem. I will take my business elsewhere. I don't recommend this restaurant. My moms red chile burrito tasted like the meat was dried out. My torta was good, what i could eat of it after they ruined my appetite..... SO RUDE!!! They need to teach their employees how to act. Not good for business.
