I've created a new award: the "Wanted" award for worst of any given thing.  You know, the movie with Angelina where you could fling your wrist while shooting a gun and the bullet would somehow curve in midair?  You remember!  The movie with (once) respectable actors taking information from a giant loom that "WOVE" the "FABRIC" of time?  Get it?!?!?!?

Well the first Wanted award is in the Restaurants category.  Applause for Top Shelf, the absolute worst restaurant I've ever eaten at.  On the menu, you can choose from nachos that taste like cardboard, tacos stuffed with filling straight from the paper shredder, burritos made out of something a bum would live in, and enchiladas that fill your mouth with the familiar flavor of kleenex.

I hate to be mean.  But since I have a duty to anyone who reads this to disseminate truths, I have to just tell you that you should never go there.  If anyone wants to bring you there you should go all gandhi on them and start a hunger strike.  *trust me*
