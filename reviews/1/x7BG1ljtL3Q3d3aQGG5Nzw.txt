We decided to give this place another try. We had horrible service once again. Alicia, who is a supervisor was our server. She took our order for drinks and someone else brought them out. About 15 minutes later she shows back up to take our order and that was it. We never saw her again. No one come to check on us and after we had completed our meal and have nothing else to drink we literally waited another 25 minutes before we flagged someone down to ask where our server was. She said that she took a big party and couldn't get back to us. I then asked for a manager and the young lady explained that she was the supervisor on duty. So I asked for her to come over, which she did and I expressed my frustration as to why she never came to service us. And she stated that she assumed that someone else would be taking care of us. I let her know that it was unacceptable as a supervisor or manager to assume something and at the very least she could've come over to explain to us that somebody else would be taking care of us. Very unprofessional and unacceptable.
