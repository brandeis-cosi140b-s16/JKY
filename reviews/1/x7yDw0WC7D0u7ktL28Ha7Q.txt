Absolute Joke. Went here ordered my kids a Kids quesadilla and a bean and cheese for the others, not price checking, that was a huge mistake. Chesse quesadilla- 12 dollars. lol for a local and theres absolute amazing mexican places rt around the corner from this hole I was totally livid.NO SIDES are even included. Bean and cheese burrito small and crappy looking? 12 dollars. This place is obviously never getting my or my friends business again. DONT FRIGGIN GO HERE. Even if you are staying, its just a joke.
