Second time here and I'm still NOT impressed....Last time, the carne asada fries were so bland, not to mention there was very little guac and the cheese was not melted. AND! !! This location doesn't have much variety (no Lengua Burritos!!!! :( ) 
I went in today and as always the cashier was not pleasant, not only did my food take forever to get to me, but my California Burrito just SUCKED. It seemed to be soaked in grease and salt, there was mostly meat in the frickin thing..hardly any "fries, guacamole, & pico de gallo" as they claim... and guess what? THE CHEESE WAS NOT MELTED, AGAIN! Ugh, I don't know how they cooked that meat...but it has left a bad taste in my mouth. I will never return to this location. 
P.S. this location has a "C" Grade as far as food inspection.
