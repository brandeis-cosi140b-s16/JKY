Being from New Mexico I thought id go here and have some amazing Green and Red Chile dishes. Not so much. I spent 14yrs in New Mexico and know New Mexican food very well. This is a fairly bad knockoff of what New Mexican food is. 

Si Senor is a bland chain in New Mexico that is reaching to capture other markets apparently. This is no Los Cuates!
