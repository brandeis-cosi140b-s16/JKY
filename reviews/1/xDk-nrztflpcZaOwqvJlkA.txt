I've been going to cafe rio for a few years. Tonight I went and ordered a pork quesadilla with extra meat for a first time. I had ordered it to go and when I got home to open it I was very disappointed. They put meat inside, but seemed to have no cheese so the  tortillas didn't stick together and meat fell out everywhere. They never cut it into pieces so I had to use a knife and fork to cut the whole thing apart. It looked so unappetizing and looked like an open face taco, not a quesadilla. Very disappointed they would serve this.
