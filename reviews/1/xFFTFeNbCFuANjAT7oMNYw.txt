I normally love little dive taco shops. I will start out by saying that the staff was very nice and polite. We ordered two bean and cheese burritos to go and it did not take long. I was optimistic at that point. Once we got home to eat we opened the bag and it smelled like seafood. The paper the food was wrapped in smelled like seafood and so did the burritos. The burritos were way over filled. With one bite the tortilla tore and it fell apart. We could not finish our food and were really disappointed.
