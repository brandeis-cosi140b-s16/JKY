If I could give this place 0 stats I would. The food was horrible. I had a jumbo burrito, tempura shrimp to be exact, a grilled fish taco, and guacamole n chips. I had a shock top which wasn't very cold but probably the best tasting thing I had there. The burrito was filled with beans, rice and lettuce, it's supposed to be a shrimp burrito and there were 5 SHRIMPS (keep in mind it was a jumbo burrito)!! I was so disappointed that I didn't eat any of it after a few bits. Someone that worked there asked how everything was tasting and I said well not very good, she answered and said "well is the shock top good at least?" And I said yeah probably the best thing here. And she walked away so carelessly. That shows you how they could careless about the food they provide. 

Don't waste your money, time or appetite just so be Unsatisfied to say the least!
