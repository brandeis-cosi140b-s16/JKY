Tried to call in a delivery order, I was told to hold. The girl put the phone down and I could hear her and three other people complaining about how thy didn't want to do the delivery order. Literally going "ugh" and trying to get someone to take my order. One lady even flat out said, " well I'm not doing it" needless to say I hung up and will never eat here or call again.
