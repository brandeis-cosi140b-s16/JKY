Plain and simple:  The place looked tired and grimy (floors, tables, condiment area, etc)...  Food was bland, soupy and greasy.   Server / cook had on dirty clothing early in the morning.  Disgusting experience we won't forget soon.  It's hard to understand how anyone would give this restaurant a high rating unless they are related or friends of the owner.  We were the only customers the entire time of the visit......that alone speaks volumes....we should have turned around and left as soon as we walked in the door.
