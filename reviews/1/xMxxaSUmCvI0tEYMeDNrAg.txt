This place fails. Just totally fails. I was forced to eat here one night even though all I wanted was a delicious burrito from one of the -erto's, Betos, or Fiesta Burrito. But no, I was coerced into coming here because they're "open late" and my friend swore up down and backwards that it was "amazing". I really should have known better because her favorite Mexican place is Arriba-really?! I feel bad for her, because there's so much great Mexican food in this town! 

OK, so they decided to extend their hours, but you know what? THEY CUT THEIR MENU TO FIVE ITEMS AFTER 1 AM! Not cool. 

Pro: The golf cart that drove us here from Dos Gringos...apparently it's a club shuttle, but has "Julio's Too" written all over it, and the guy driving it said he's work for them for 10 years and that the owner of the golf shuttle also owns Julio's Too. This driver claimed everything here was "delicious" but couldn't be specific about any item. Hmmmm, I wonder if that's because...

Con: THE FOOD SUCKED. It was just plain bad. I mean, I eat from some grimy burrito places, and their food is AMAZING compared to the stuff they're passing off as food here. Maybe it's because we went late, but either way I decided to play it safe and order a bean and cheese burrito that I could barely eat five bites of before completely giving up on it. Others in my party ordered the carne asada burrito (oh, I should mention that I was the only sober one here-everyone in my party was absolutely sloshed), and most of them ate all of it, but later told me how bad it was and what a bad idea it was to eat it. They said they would have much rather gone to a good place (which I agreed with!), and collectively we all agreed never to come here again. 

Next time you see the Julio's Too shuttle driver pass by, ask him for a ride to the nearest GOOD Mexican place! Or even the philly cheesesteak place near the bars which is decent. Just stay away from this place.
