If you're into Ahwatukee Housewives swapping and popping prescription smack on Saturday night, having your ass grabbed by a creepy divorcee old enough to be your father, weak sauce beverages and "Mexican food" that makes Taco Bell look appealing, then you will absolutely love Loco Patron.

I also haven't been back in four years, so maybe things have changed. Still, I wouldn't go out of my way to give it another shot.
