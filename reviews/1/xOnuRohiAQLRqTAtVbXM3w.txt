I only gave this a 1 star rating as the past few times we visited this restaurant the owners could care less about that original personal touch, they stated that they were out of green chili tamales, but found one in the freezer and would be bringing it right out,  it took forever, and they always had tons of Children running around...one was said to be 5 and was carrying around a baby, (not a doll)  It was too much to watch, I was so afraid that the infant would be dropped.  The owners and waitresses were unkempt, and that personal touch was not present.  The food quality was greatly in decline.
