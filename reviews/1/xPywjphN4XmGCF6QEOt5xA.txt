I know this is their opening week and all but wow this was very, very disappointing. Went with my family and got food to go. Really expensive for the amount of food we got (about $40 bucks for 3 little burritos and a quesadilla). I had the carne asada burrito and it was overfilled with pico, zero meat. The tortilla was cold and the chips on the side were very stale. 

Not making a good impression for their opening week. Like I said, I understand it's their opening week, but you have to be more prepared. Cashier also was clueless when questions were asked. Perhaps they rushed to open the store because based on the staff and quality of food, it doesn't seem like their ready.
