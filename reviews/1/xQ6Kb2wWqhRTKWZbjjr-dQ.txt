Blechh.  

Clearly it's not just me - the owners need to spend some time traveling to Milwaukee and eating at a place like Riviera Maya, or even El Rey.  This is just crappy food.  How do you screw up pinto beans or pico de gallo?  I've never eaten Mexican food with so little flavor.  I asked for hot sauce, they brought me red sauce with pepper seeds in it, and it had NO flavor, and NO heat.  What??  And to make this more memorable you can buy the flavorless sauce to go.  I actually had to salt my food, which I never, ever do in a restaurant.  And the rice tasted like it was made with old onion that had been pre-chopped and stored in the frig - you know that taste?  It tastes like your old college roommate's shoes smelled.  

I make far better Mexican from scratch.  Heck, Ortega makes better.  

Drive 5 more blocks and go to La Guadalajara, WAY better.
