this place plainly sucks, unless you have not taste for great Mexican food than you should go here.  The food was discussing and the black beans were way undercooked, which he said that's because they were for the salad ( I want them cook even for my salad) nothing like a cold crunchy bean. The salsa was way to runny and had no flavor but the chili powder or what ever was it in. It's not worth the price they want...GROSS GROSS GROSS
