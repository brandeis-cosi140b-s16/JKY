Bad Americanized Mexican Food: 0 stars

Reeks of dismal chain restaurant.

Paying for the check now...couldn't wait to tell the Yelpers to stay away.

Food: 0-stars. The burrito I ordered came out with everything on the side, i.e. guacamole, beans, cheese. Only thing inside was rice and meat. Yet burrito was closed. 

What??? So then it's a fajita right? The rest of my group shared other complaints.

Avoid at all costs.
