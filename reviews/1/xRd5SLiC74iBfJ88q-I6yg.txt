My boyfriend and I had a few hours to kill for dinner before a movie.  We were going to grab a beer and food at Fat Heads however, the wait at Fat Head's was long per usual.  We were seated right away as there were three hostesses however we were not greeted yet alone offered drinks by anyone for about 12 minutes. 

When the server finally came over, she was disconnected and unfriendly. Ordering food was equally as painful a process.

We watched uncomfortably as one of the hostesses asked a table of two whom were completing their meal if they could move them upstairs because there was a misunderstanding with the number of people needed for a reservation.  

Overall the food and atmosphere were fine however the service was unprofessional, misguided, rushed and frankly impersonable.
