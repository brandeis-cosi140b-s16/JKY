This is the last time we will eat here, tried it once before very bad food, then came in on cinco de mayo it was worse, that explains why there wasn't anyone there, it's a shame because we live so close. Ordered the mini chimis, raw doughy tiny piece of chicken inside, the quesadilla was so soggy you couldn't even pick it up, salsa was all watery no flavor. Waitress was MIA the whole time had to track her down just to pay the bill. I would give them six months then adios!
