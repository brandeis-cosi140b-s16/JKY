What happened? 

The other Mexico City locations shut down, only this one exists now - the menu has been pared down and somehow something has changed ... for much worse. Maybe it was a change in management? I don't know...but I think that whoever runs the place should try being their own customer and objectively taste the food and look around and see how bland this place has become.

The chips served with the salsa were old and stale. My fountain coke was flat, it tasted like syrup - no carbonation. The price of tacos went up to 3 dollars per taco - i mean thats kinda steep for a little tortlla with a tablespoon of filling.. my barbacoa and pork tacos were flavorless - the meat was unseasoned. The tortilla was fine but not even heated..They no  longer have horchata.. 

this made me pine for Reyna's food cart or wish I had headed over to vicky's. 
To add to the mediocre food experience the waitress (albeit very nice) left us sitting there for 15 minutes after we asked for the check. 

Will not be coming back again.
