I've eaten here for years.  I used to like it alot.  But over the past year or two, it's been downright mediocure.  Today it bordered on gross.  I ordered a beef quesidilla and thought I was getting steak.  I got some geasy ground beef I asume they use for tacos.  It bore no resemblance to a quesadilla.  It was just a taco with stuff on top. I  would have done better at Monterrey's, or even Taco Hell.
