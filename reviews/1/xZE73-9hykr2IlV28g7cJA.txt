We been lived here in West Valley for number of years, we tried most of the mexican fast food or restaurant here even in central phoenix..And we know exactly what good authentic and GOOD mexican food are!! La Loma Mexican grill not even close!!Very plain eating in styrofoam is awful plastic utensil it makes the food more un-pleasant! Not recommended to anybody that looking for real mexican food!
