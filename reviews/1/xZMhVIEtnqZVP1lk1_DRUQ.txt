Service was terrible. Came in for lunch and the place had 20-30 people in one group and the poor service staff were rapped up waiting on them. Took 45 minutes to get a watered down ice tea, with no ice. Finally got up and walked out. Seemed like the large group was waiting to protest some event at the Convention Center.
