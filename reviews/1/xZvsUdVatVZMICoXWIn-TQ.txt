Can't speak for the food just yet, seeings how I'm actually sitting in my car with the burro I just purchased.....customer service was GREAT until I went to pay!  Apperently the girl working the register at 2:35 pm on this day doesn't like her job one bit!  Rude as could be, and not only to me, but the 4 customers in front of me!  No smile, no kindness what so ever!  Shape up young lady or I fear your job status may change in the near future!  This was my firsr and last visit!  Grunpy people shouldn't work with the public!  Managers....this one will run off more customers than she'll bring in for sure!!!
