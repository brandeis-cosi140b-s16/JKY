Not good Mexican food. Very straight forward dishes done very poorly. Bland salsa, chile verde was bland, escabeche was lackluster. Very disappointing. The place was hot inside, drinks had no ice, service was apprehensive. One star is given for food being hot.

I don't think this place will be around for long...
