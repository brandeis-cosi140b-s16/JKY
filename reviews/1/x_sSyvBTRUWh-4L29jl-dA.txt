Just finished reading the new times review. Posting my response here.  Meh, I suggest you read the review again. Not far off the mark is way too kind for "spicy rubber"," over priced 1/2 chicken ", " hard to swallow " tacos, "salsa that failed to bowl us over" etc. Thoroughly disappointed that Gallo is gone. Why the hell would you hire a chef that already had one failed restaurant unless you want another. Just sayin'
