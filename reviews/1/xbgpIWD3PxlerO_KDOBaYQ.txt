Blech, yech, YUCKY.

Complete and utter disappointment.  I'd sooner go to Taco Bell and Del Taco before I would ever set foot in Filiberto's, Rigoberto's, Aliberto's or any of the 'bertos in that chain.

Yuckity yuck yuck yuck YUCK.

Did I say YUCK?

Best Mexican by far I've found here has to be Rosa's.
