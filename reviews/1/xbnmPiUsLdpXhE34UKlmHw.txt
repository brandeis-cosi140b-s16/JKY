We were excited to try Pepes carne asada fries as they advertise the best in Vegas!
We walked in to no greet as an employee mopped the.floor and the cook looked at us didn't say anything disappeared we waited for someone to come to take our order finally another lady comes out to do so. I didn't like how you can't see much of the cooking taking place.

Highly disappointed we wasted over half of our food there were no beans as another user said bland guacamole no pico de gayo and CANNED CHEESE SAUCE!!! You've got to be kidding me!! There is absolutely NO comparison to Roberto's!!
