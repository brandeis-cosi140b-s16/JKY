Awful! My husband and I came out to mesa to go to a concert at the Nile and figured we would get out there a little bit early to eat something before the show. We sat outside and the boy that sat us gave us some chips and salsa..which was okay. What was not okay is that we sat around for 15 minutes without someone in the staff even glancing an eye at us..even bringing us water would have been great.

After my patience ran out I looked around and noticed another very unhappy couple asking for the manager and complained about the food. After that we decided we have had enough and simply walked out. The next time I come out to the Nile for a show I will be sure to eat somewhere before we get out to mesa.
