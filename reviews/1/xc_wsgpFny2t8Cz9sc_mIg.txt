Custermerservice was down the drain. Meat was heavily cooked in grease (Not authentic Mexican style). More oil on my tacos than there was meat. Cook was talking smack not knowing this guy can speak read and write in Spanish. Server had a bad attitude. No chips and salsa....psh. There is a McD right next to it, you are better off going there.
