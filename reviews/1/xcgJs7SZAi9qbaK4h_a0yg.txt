Been visiting this location for about 3 years. Normally, the staff at this location is great. Tonight, however, very different. I went through the drive thru and the woman immediately had an attitude, scoffing when she found it hard to hear my order. I'm sorry you work for Del Taco, but this is your job. Treat your customers with respect from start to finish for the sake of your company and your pay check. A note to the manager, perhaps make sure the person taking the orders for the drive thru gets some customer service training.
