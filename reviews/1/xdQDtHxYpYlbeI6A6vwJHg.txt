The food was very bland. It didn't taste like authentic Mexican food and I tried two different plates. Not good at all. I asked the waiter for two carne asada tacos and he shook his head no.. I thought he was joking, but he said some nonsense about how they only do big orders of carne asada tacos? I didn't fully understand what he was saying, but he just kept shaking his head no.. That I couldn't get tacos. That was a first..a Mexican restaurant not selling carne asada tacos.. Very strange. I ended up getting a chicken enchilada and it was gross. Probably the worst Mexican food I've ever had.
