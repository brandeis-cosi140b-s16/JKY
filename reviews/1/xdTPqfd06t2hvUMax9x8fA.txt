We - 11 of us with a reservation - went there Friday 2/25/2011 for dinner.  Had to wait over an hour, many additional chips and salsa, after we were served for the dinners to be served.  The wait staff was not the problem, management should have been living in the kitchen getting the orders out.  Fajitas were tasteless.
Last time we go there and we have been there before.
