Questionable buisness practices. Watch out for overcharging.

 The waitress here tried to scam us to get a higher tip. The first bill she gave us didnt have the drinks added but way at the bottom she added gratuity of almost 7$. I probably wouldnt have caught it but the bill just seemed too high. When i complained she said there was no manager but it was by accident but the new bill had one drink. I complained again because she was only gonna give us free drinks if she could rip us off. She then informed us we had actually recieved two drinks. If she knew that, then why did she only charge us for 1. She was trying to get a big tip by making it look like she was hooking us up when in reality she was ripping us off. 

On top of all that the service was horrible, we got one refill and thats because I stood up and looked for someone to give us a refill. When I finally got her attention she got me a refill and never asked anyone else at the table if they needed anything.
