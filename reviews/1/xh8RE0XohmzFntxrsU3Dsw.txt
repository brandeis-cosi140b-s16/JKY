I guess you guys agree with me, but if this place isn't good why are they ALWAYS packed?! I'm so confused. And during my 8 years of living in AZ people around me all seemed to love Macayo's, another thing I don't get, because I think the food is nasty. It's inauthentic and makes you feel like crap after you eat it. 
I like the idea of the restaurant with all the bright colors and the cool patio, but the place is actually really dirty. Now they don't even have taco salads anymore! What kind of Mexican restaurant gets rid of their taco shells?? 
If you're looking for Mexican food go up the road to Si Senor, that place is amazing!
