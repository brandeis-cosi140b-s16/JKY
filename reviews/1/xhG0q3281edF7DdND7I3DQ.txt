Attended a group event here. there was no air conditioning in this establishment and it was  114 degrees. We tried to make the best it it, but it was pretty unbearable no matter where we tried sitting. The owner said she had just had  new air conditioners installed. If that was the case, they were not working. Then the food came out and it got worse. Frankly the food was unedible. Absolutely awful. I will never go back.
