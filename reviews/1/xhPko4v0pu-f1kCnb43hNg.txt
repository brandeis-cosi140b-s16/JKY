Wow. Just... wow. Never again. This place is a rip-off. It was dead-empty when I walked in, which was cool because I didn't have to wait in line. I immediately ordered some carne asada "super" nachos, which cost me damn near $10 (the price of a large supreme pizza or a movie ticket). They made my food in a timely manner, but it was about a 1/3-1/4 of the size of the carne asada nachos from Roberto's. I figured it would at least be a lot better tasting. WRONG!!! The steak was chewy and grisly, the cheese was barely melted, and the pickled carrots from the salsa bar were mushy. I ate my food as quickly as possible and left never to look back. Roberto's' version of this meal may be incredibly greasy and make you hate yourself after eating it, but, most of the time, they at least hook it up and give you what you pay for.

Go to Taco Y Taco instead. There, you get great service, delicious food made from fresh ingredients, and it doesn't feel like a cut-rate wannabe Roberto's. I'm looking at these other positive reviews and it makes me question the state of mind some of those people were in when they wrote them (probably drunk and/or stoned out of their minds at 3:00 in the morning and needed something to quell their munchies).
