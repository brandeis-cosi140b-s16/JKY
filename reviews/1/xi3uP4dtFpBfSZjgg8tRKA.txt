This was the worst mexican food outside of texas. The staff was ok but the salsa had no flavor, the combination menu said tacos and floutas but they serve taco (1) & flouta (1) . They were both so soggy they fell apart when picked up. Rice and beans were mediocre at best. 
Do yourself a favor and head for the cafe, buffet, food court, or the convenience store down the road.
