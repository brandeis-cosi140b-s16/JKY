I've been going to the burrito company for years. The #5 w/ guacamole, sour cream, and cheese is delicious. However lately I've noticed that they've started to slip with their customer service, and quality of food. Saturday 9/5/15 I came there with some friends, and we ordered our food to go, yet the lady that took our order gave half of our group their order to go, and the other half dine-in, and our receipts clearly said "take-out". That really wasn't a problem because mistakes happen. The issue was her attitude when we asked for our order to be wrapped to go. Clearly we didn't make the mistake so what's with the attitude??? Anyhow I didn't let that bother me I let it roll off my shoulders, and went back on Monday 9/8/2015. Before entering the facility there was a sign on the door that said "Close early on Labor day at 2pm." We arrived around 12:30pm. We ordered the #5 (When made correctly is delicious), the cashier that helped us was very pleasant :)  However when we got our food it was COLD!!!! Now I expect the sour cream, and guacamole to be cold, however the carne asada was COLD, and hard!!! The cheese wasn't melted at all so that further let me know that the meat was cold. On top of that the tortilla shell was hard, and crispy...I was totally dissatisfied with my food. I wasn't going to write a negative review because I truly like this place. However yesterday's experience was disturbing. Remember they had a sign saying that they were closing at 2pm well patrons were trying to come inside, and order food but one of the workers locked the door at 1pm. Yesterday was a complete circus. I don't believe that I will be coming back here again. Which is sad because I've been coming here since 2002.
