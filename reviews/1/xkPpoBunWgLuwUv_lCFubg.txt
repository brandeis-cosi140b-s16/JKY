Didn't like. My coworkers and I planned for over a month to go on their grand opening. When the day finally came we find out it is only a 'soft opening' for friends and family, but they allowed us to stay. The food was mediocre and flavorless. The wait staff was nice, though I was taken back when the owner Nico couldn't take a minute from socializing to come greet our table given we all work in the strip. Nico seemed more concerned with socializing with 'important' people from community than greeting his neighbors from the strip. I won't be back. If you want authentic, cheap tacos try Edgar's right around the corner on 21st street.
