We have been eating at this Faustos on Stephanie St. for at least 4 times a month for 12 years. I don't know what has changed but the food has been slowly declining for at least last six months. The last straw my sons cheese enchiladas on 9/4/15 was disgusting, he complained of the flavor so my husband and I tried them and they were absolutely rancid. We have been long time loyal customers and will not be back due to decline in your food.
