I'm not happy... I ordered extra Chicken and  it's too little as in so little... I ordered steak and they gave me 10 small pcs of steak... The size of the steak is a same size of a sugar cube... For 10 pcs of that...  How the hell in this world  somebody can eat that... I don't put so much in my steak order... It's only rice steak mild sauce sour cream cheese and lettuce... That's all... I am not so happy about this... They r giving u rice like little girl... What the fuck... Management should do something about this...
