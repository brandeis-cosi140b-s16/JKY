I hadn't been here in 13 years, this place used to be the best. Now not so much, after being seated we waited a long time before our waiter acknowledged us. Many wait staff walked by and nobody offered us a drink of water. Then the patron in the table in front of us walks to the register to complain about something and they go find "our" waiter. He then stopped at her table and they conversed and he left again still no drinks or anything. I'm starting to get annoyed. Then several minutes later he brought her cocktail and she decided she wants to talk his ear off and yet he's looking at us and not making the effort to end the conversation. Finally I started making loud comments were talking 10 minutes without any service, it wasn't busy either. He finally comes to us, we placed our order. Then that chick gets up like every few minutes to speak with the hostess and a manager comes to her table and she talks her ear off. Then a random patron starts conversation with her and she says how she's a stripper lol 

-fast forward- 
Our food arrives I had combination plate chile relleno and taco. The chile relleno was disappointing the sauce wasn't good no flavor, like a can of crushed tomatoes was dumped on it. The taco had half a cup of shredded cheese and lettuce not much to it. My husband had fajitas they were mediocre . Not once did our waiter check on us, the guy with the refills was the only one doing his job.

Conclusion: this place isn't what it used to be with quality, service and price increases don't coincide with this place. Thumbs down
