They made my order wrong, it took so long for the waitress to come by and me to tell her that it was wrong, that everyone else at my table was almost done eating.  I told her that I ordered it without onions because I am allergic to them, and they put onions in it.  I asked her to please have them make my new order to go as everyone else was just about done eating.  I discovered there were onions in it on my third bite, it took everything I had to not get sick all over the table.  Our server told us when she brought the check and my food that they had a new chef and he doesn't read the tickets all the way through.  I am going to be sick most of the night because of his laziness.  I was really shocked and disappointed when I looked at the bill and saw that they not only didn't take my meal off the menu, they didn't even discount it!  I felt so disappointed that this restaurant that I had loved for so many years would treat me so poorly that I just paid the bill and left the replacement meal there.  I will never return and I would not recommend them to anyone.  If you want good Mexican food  in that area, try Mexteca or PoPo's.
