It was about 12:45pm when I tried to order my food through the drive thru. When I was ready to order I politely asked if I could do two transactions, the employee Marco proceed to argue and tell me he isn't allowed to do that. Meanwhile I have been to Taco Bell and never have I ever had a problem with making two transactions at the drive thru. I don't understand how that could be a problem there was no one behind me inline till after we argued the concept for 5 minutes when by that time I could have already got my food!! That employee handled the situation very unprofessional and was rude to add on to it.
