The proof is in the picture.  Ok, so we know Taco Bell really isn't known for quality, but come on.  Took this taco back up to the counter to be told that's how they make them there.  I commented on the Taco Bell site only to be called back and told, again, that's how they do it.  I was offered half-off of my next visit and two tacos.  Really?  That's the solution?  How about promise to make your food look like the pictures on the menu!
