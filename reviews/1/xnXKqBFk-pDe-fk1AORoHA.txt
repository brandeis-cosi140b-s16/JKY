Last night a friend and I went into Asados and sat for 10 minutes as the bartender saw us sitting at a high top table waiting to be approached, and finally the manager asked us if we have been helped. Basically I won't bore you anymore we were there a total of 39 minutes and never got anything but chips and salsa and empty drinks. She never planned on coming back I guess we just were not of importance when as little as she knows we are both I. The business and gave her way mor time than she deserved. We will never ever be back and what they are related to the owners of Mastros? Wow horrible
