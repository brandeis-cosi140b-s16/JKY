honestly worst fast food place out there, if I could give this place a 0 star I would. yeah it may be "real Mexican" but it's absolute trash. I asked for cheese fries, and what they gave me were terrible soggy fries with cold shredded cheese, I was so displeased that I 1.) paid over $4 for them. but 2.) that when I tried to return them, the manager gave me sass and replied "umm we Dom have a microwave" because I wanted them melted. so unprofessional and will never be returning to any del taco again.
