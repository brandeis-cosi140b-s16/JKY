I love filibertos in general, but this location is very hit and miss, this goes for the food and the service. They recently upped their prices , which is fine but the quality of the food should have least stayed the same.

More times then not the inside of my carne asada burrito is cold, not lukewarm but actually cold. Their breakfast burritos are very good and so are the rolled tacos. but if you have a choice, choose a different filibertos or even a whole different Mexican place.
