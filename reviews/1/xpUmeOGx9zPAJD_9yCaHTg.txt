Marc, you have work to do.

Your employees are rude. Lady in front of me ordered a burrito. As the wrapper was finishing the burrito, she informed another employee how much extra meat juice was in the burrito. There was quite a bit. She even showed the burrito with juice going everywhere to this other employee.  The other employee acknowledged it and she proceeded to finish wrapping the burrito even though she knew it wasn't right. 

As she trying to get it in the foil, the patient customer ahead of me asked her if she could do something about all the juice. I kid you not, the employee grabbed a plastic salsa container and was going to position the burrito over it to contain the juice. The customer asked what she was doing. Employee then rudely asked if she wanted it double wrapped and then stared at her like she was stupid.

The customer said she did not want it double wrapped. Employee kept staring. Then asked, well do you want it re done? The customer yes. Instead of just dumping the ingredients in a new tortilla, she asked the customer to confirm all the ingredients so she could start all over.

The lack of customer service at this chipotle is amazing. They've had different managers and all new employees but nothing changes.
