This Chipotle really is the worst I've ever been to in terms of sanitary hygiene. I came here about a month and a half ago and the woman serving was wiping her nose with her wrist (gloved hand, but at that point what difference does it make?) I stopped going to this one for a while because that seriously turned me off. I came back 2 days ago, seriously craving a "Chipotle burrito." My boyfriend found a hair in his food! NASTY!! That should have been the final warning for me. They handled it like any restaurant with poor customer service would, got him a new one. No refund, no free chips and guac, nothing to accommodate for that at all. Ok, so of course I'm craving Chipotle again today and as my bowl is being assembled the server decided to turn around and tap her buddy on the back with her, AGAIN, gloved hand and then once she got his attention, grabbed at the cheese and lettuce with the same hand!!!! I've had it with this place! I got home and threw the bowl out (I know silly of me to pay for it.) But I planned to call their corporate and let them know how unhygienic this place. To bad this is a franchise so I'm out of my $8. Seriously train and manage these people on how to better handle people's food because this place is gross!!!
