Crummy service today. Disappointing because of their bad attitudes. Ordered a Nino quesadilla and a paid kids meal. Girl slammed down the food and even the guy behind me commented on it. Then I ordered the special and the girl said it would be 5 mins. I said I would wait then she sighed and said more like 10 mins co said fine I'll wait then she said 15. I was in disbelief. Then when I said never mind she rolled her eyes and walked away. At the pay counter my wife asked for the beans and soda that come with the paid kids meal and she just stared at us. Finally she slammed the chips on the land and the beans. I was already giving them a second chance after the horrible experience we had before. No more. We are done with them.
