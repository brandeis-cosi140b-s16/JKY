Um...no!

Chips are obviously from bags.  Salsa were runny and definitely not spicy.  (Remember - "made in New York City?!?!?)

I had the carne asada.  It was ok.  I usually devour the entire place but I just couldn't get into it.  The rice was bland.

Overall, it was just disappointing!  I should have just eaten at Qdoba which was nearby.

Service was mediocre. 

Moral: just because it is right next to the hotel doesn't mean food is gonna be awesome.
