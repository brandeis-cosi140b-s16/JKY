We were really looking forward to meeting friends here, the menu looked intriguing.  We arrived at 6:30 on a Saturday for dinner, and there was only one other couple dining there - not a good sign.   We were seated at a small table that was only big enough for two, so I asked if they had a bigger table since there would be four of us and was told that was the biggest table they had.  Really?!?!?   Two of us had the tamale pie - big mistake. Not only did it lack eye appeal, but it wasn't even tasty.  It looked like dog food, or mush. Our husbands had tacos which were only so so.  Only one other couple came in while we were there.  So on a Saturday night from 6:30 to 8:00 they only had a total of eight guest.  Difficult to serve good fresh food under those circumstances.  I don't predict they can stay open long
