Okay so I'm a huge fan of Mexican food. And yes the food had good flavor however the way the restaurant was run is not at all favorable. We walked in at about 8:30 on a steamy Saturday night. There is no air conditioning, no fans and the windows were shut. When we walked in we weren't greeted at all. So we sat wherever we choose once another couple directed us to do so. After waiting about 5 minutes we were brought menus and asked if we would like something to drink. 
The chips I think are homemade but must have sit under the lamp too long. But the salsa was good. We finished our waters and finally someone took our order. Now at this time there was only another couple that got there a few minutes before us but we ordered before them and shortly after we ordered another gentleman came in and ordered. Both other tables got their food before us and we waited approx 35 from ordering to service. We were offered more water but it was warm. 
The taste of the food wasn't worth the wait.
