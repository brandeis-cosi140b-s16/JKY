Worst service we have ever experienced. We came on a friday for lunch and the place was not very busy. Took 10 minutes to get a table since all of them were dirty and nobody around to clean them. Took another 15 minutes to place our order and it took them so long to bring our food out we almost left. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. The food quality was bland with no flavor. This is NOT authentic mexican food. Stay away from Suzies and you will thank me.
