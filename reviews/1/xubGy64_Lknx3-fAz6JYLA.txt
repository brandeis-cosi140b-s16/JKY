I feel that in a world of negativity the positive review caries the most weight. That said, I rarely take the time to write a negative review but in this instance it was well deserved.

I am a Chipotle enthusiast, and can pride myself on my understanding of Chipotle's attention to quality and overall consistency and this particular location fell short. Despite many reviews eluding to this, I failed to drive the extra 3 miles to a location with better reviews. Lesson learned.

My tomato (Mild) salsa was more of a mush, Carnitas were dry and overly salted, and portion size was sparse. My bowl was literally half empty, and I got the stink eye when I asked for "a little more rice". I was also charged for double meat when the portion wasn't even that of a normal bowl at any other location! I was very disappointed. 
To top it off they had no lemons or smoked Tabasco, and were unapologetic when I asked about it.

I'm not sure if this is a result of poor management, lack of training, or tight margins at this location, but my meal as a whole was very underwhelming, and that has meaning coming from someone who drives an hour each way just to pick up Chipotle.
