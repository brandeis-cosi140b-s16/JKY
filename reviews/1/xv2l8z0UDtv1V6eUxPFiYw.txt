I have a love-hate relationship with the Mesa Community Restaurant. I love the decor and the owner, Spiro. But I just hate the food.

It's a free-standing building just off Country Club, with parking on the street or beside/behind the building. Parking is never an issue. Inside, you'll find every color imaginable, with a heavy dose of teal. The plexi windows that enclosed the old smoking room have painted on Christmas decorations even in July, and there is an assortment of random photographs and prints on the walls.

The food is Denny's or worse. Pastas are watery, burgers are uninspired, and hashbrowns are underdone. It's never that busy here, not that I'm surprised.

The wait staff here is not great. I like to sit at the counter and watch people, and I've actually seen a waitress grab a handful of ice from the ice chest and drop it into a glass for a customer (right under the use the scoop or get fired sign!).

But Spiro's a gem. If you decide to stop in, be sure to spend a few minutes chatting with him. Just don't get your hopes up with the food.
