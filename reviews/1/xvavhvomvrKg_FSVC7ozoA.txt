My husband and I went to Pinches Tacos inside the Downtown Container Park because it smelled good. As we waited in line we noticed the cooks behind the counter were NOT wearing gloves. My husband (a chef) was very skeptical about this and wondered what other health codes they were breaking. We found out a minute later as one of the cooks scratched his ass and then pounded out a tortilla with his bare hand. Adios Pinches!
