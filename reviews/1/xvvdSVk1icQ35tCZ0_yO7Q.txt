So let's just start off with my boyfriend & I go to this Rubios all the time for taco Tuesday's. Well never again.. So we came here on a Sunday night just because we didn't know whatelse to eat & it's way closer than the Chicken Shack where my boyfriend wanted to go. We come in, there's no customers in the restaurant, the employees looked like they were messing around the whole time. So we ordered 4 fish tacos & asked for flour tortillas. Sat down, waited for what it felt like half an hour for our tacos. (we were the only ones in the restaurant). They brought us our fish tacos, it had corn tortillas instead of flour, I didn't make it a huge deal. We left, went home & called it a night. I woke up around 4 am throwing up, had to call out of work. My boyfriend started throwing up around 6 am & called out of work too. We both got food poisoning from this place! Never again am I going back. One time I did see the cook preparing food with no gloves on when he was also cleaning a different counter right before! That should of been the last straw.. So disappointed, just the thought of fish tacos now disgusts me.
