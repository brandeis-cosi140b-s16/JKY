I am not much of a Mexican food eater so I will go by what my kids and wife ate. I will address the service part of it though myself. The kids said that their cheese tortilla and carne asada chimichanga were ok. Not the best though and I asked them why and they said not much taste to it. The beans and rice were overcooked was another comment. The wife was not impressed with her meal as well. I had a regular burger and it was ok. 

The service though was awful. The server was slow, served us the wrong drinks, spilled sauces on me and didn't even say sorry. He did bring me 1 napkin to clean up. We paid 55 bucks for the 4 of us and with service and food it was awful and this place deserved a 1 star rating.
