Thirty-eight minutes for some so-so tacos?!

I've been an occasional Fuzzy's customer since they opened a few years ago.  I especially like the breakfast tacos, but the fact that they don't open until 9 pretty much rules them out for breakfast.

Service has been hit-and-miss, and I've come to expect that Fuzzy's is never  quick.  Today took the cake, though -- it LITERALLY took THIRTY-EIGHT minutes for me to get three simple tacos.

Thirty.  Eight.

The tacos were fine.  No taco is that good.

I will not be returning.
