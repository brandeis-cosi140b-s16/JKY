I give up! When I go in (between 5pm - 6pm) on a weekday it's never a line BUT they don't have white rice or they they are out of peppers and onions or chicken. They have a bald guy who works there who is rude. I won't go back to this location, I come in as a customer who is real chill and polite and it's no need to take your day out on me.
