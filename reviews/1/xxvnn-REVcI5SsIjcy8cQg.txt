God these people are rude as all hell. I don't expect you to be my best friend but I do expect service that isn't you acting like I'm interrupting you. Snippy short questions, rude responses ("um I didn't hear you"). 

And then they screwed up my order (subbing beans instead of beef) so I had to go back. Guess how they acted then? Snotty.
