This was at gate 15. If it wasn't for the worker being rude I would have tried this place out. This was around 9:30am, I asked a simple question to see if they can make nachos and she said "breakfast only" not only was she rude she shook her head and rolled her eyes at me. If it wasn't for her doing that I would have ordered something from the breakfast menu. A simple question doesn't mean you have to be so rude about it.
