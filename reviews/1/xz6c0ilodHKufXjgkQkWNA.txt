AVOID AT ALL COSTS.

Baja Fresh is a poor man's chipotle, but that's an insult to poor men everywhere.

First off, I think everyone in Phoenix is missing the gene where they actually listen to directions.  When you order something, you shouldn't get ANOTHER.  Totally got that, it ruined the start of my vacation and it made me sick the entire time I was in Phoenix.  Ironically, I never stepped into a Baja before, but I learned my lesson to eat dirt rather than eat here.

I ordered a burrito bowl (I think it's called "bare" burrito), and I asked for whatever the hell it was, and you have to special order steak or chicken.  I said neither but Iwanted guac.  No problem they told me.  I hate chicken and I got it anyway.  I didn't know until I got back to my conference.  Note to self: they fuck you in the drive-thru.

Anyway, it wasn't even that GOOD.  And it made me sick.  Did I mention that?  I don't totally blame Baja though.  Chipotle did its part in pissing me off for the whole trip.  Baja unfortunately just fell out of my butt hours later.
