I was really excited to find a Roberto's near my workplace especially since I just had some the night before I came here. But boy was I met with total disappointment at this Roberto's establishment! 

The facility itself is messy. The salad bar wasn't fresh AT ALL, the floor was sticky and needed sweeping, and the staff spoke very little to no English. On top of that, one of the counter personnel (I'm sorry I will not disclose who this person is nor their gender, I'm not trying to get anyone fired) came out to talk to my coworker and I about their oral health concerns (in Spanish). Now...I completely understand Spanish...but it takes me a little while still to form all the correct words in my head in order to carry a conversation in Spanish...but I responded to all the questions with English while still holding the tongues with hot carrots in them. They didn't get that I wasn't interested in that conversation. AT. ALL. Anyway that's beside the point...my point is...I'm on lunch....don't you think it's rude of you to approach anyone to talk about the pus coming out of your tooth you thought you extracted a year and a half ago?!?! I'm in the dental field...I have a strong stomach but yuck! That's not something I want to hear from a place where I'm getting my lunch! 

So now...the food :(
I ordered a chicken chimichanga and my co-worker ordered a chicken nacho plate thing with more chips than chicken. My chimichanga was full...and I mean FULL of onions...WTF where's the meat?!? I usually like onions but c'mon man! That was just too much! My co-worker's plate was full of onions too!!! She asked for more chips than chicken meat and she literally (and we counted) only had 9 chips!!!! She was pissed! 

The food was edible. That's about it...nothing to wow about. I should have driven the extra 5 or 6 miles to the other Roberto's I went to the night before.

Not ever coming back to THIS Roberto's again.
