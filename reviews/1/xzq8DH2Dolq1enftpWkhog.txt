This rating is solely based on a take out order. The food was ready when I came to pick it up, I was in and out fairly quickly. I ordered 2 combo plates, one was a cheese enchilada and chile relleno and chicken flautas with another chile relleno. The problem is that one of the chile rellenos had a broken toothpick inside of it, luckily I didn't swallow it and it didn't cut up the inside of my mouth. Needless to say we haven't been back since.
