Never, ever again will I darken their door. The waiter was way too touchy feely and flirty for my liking. After we ordered he suddenly turned to rude, I guess because neither of us ordered an alcoholic drink (which he took 3-4 minutes to list and explain in detail). 

The fact that their chips were stale should have been an immediate turn off but we decided to order anyway. Bad plan, I feel sick today and I definitely don't think it's a coincidence :(

The girl who refilled our chips was rude and according to the menu only the first 2 baskets of chips are free, after that they are $3. Seriously? They aren't good... who's ordering multiple baskets??

This was just not a good experience overall and the staff was not helpful or pleasant. I won't be back and I hope others will follow suit.
