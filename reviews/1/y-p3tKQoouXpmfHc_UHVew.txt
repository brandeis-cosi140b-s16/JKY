I'm so over this location. This is by far the worst location for any Roberto's or other drive-thru I have visited. Recently went to grab 2 breakfast burritos, 1 ham and 1 bacon and I get home and what do I have? Two chorizo! How does this happen when I am the only vehicle in the green slime filled drive-thru? After driving back I now have to enter the location and I just want a refund at this point. The gentleman working the counter looks at me multiple times and doesn't come to ask my concerns. Finally after he finishes with other patrons he comes to ask what's wrong. I inform him my order is wrong and I just want my money back. He says I'll fix it where I again say no I want my money back. He then rings up other customers and one car thru the driv-thru and then decides to bring me my money. Hire some new personnel because these people are failing miserably.
