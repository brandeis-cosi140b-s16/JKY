Yuck pretty much covers it.  

There is a serious diconnect between atmosphere and food here.

If Tia Rosa put as much thought into the quality of their food and the authenticity of their recipes (or at least call it what it is...which is to say *Not* Mexican) as they do into their decor, they might really have something.

until then, if you want to eat someplace cute, enjoy!
if you want to eat someplace good, try something else.

(I didn't finish my fish taco here...I am kinda famous for cleaning my plate, even if I'm not that into it...does that tell you how much I didn't like it?)
