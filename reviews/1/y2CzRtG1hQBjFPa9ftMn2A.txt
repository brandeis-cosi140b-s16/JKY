Not sure about the value of Yelp's rating system....we had a disgusting experience at Gordo's which was factually written....only to have the review removed after a short while.   I would advise anyone to take a close look at this restaurant BEFORE you place an order.  If it looks like a place you want to eat....then it's right for you.  I suspect highly the "rave reviews" are written by friends or management.
