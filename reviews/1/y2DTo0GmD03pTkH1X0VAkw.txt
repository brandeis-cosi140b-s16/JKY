I was so excited to revisit the old Agave.  I love the outside patio. Unfortunately, it was too hot for my taste.  We were seated by the door and it was still pretty warm inside.  I did enjoy the chips and salsa.  However, my sangria was sample sized.  We order the ceviche duo with shrimp and tuna.  There might have been one or two (very small) chopped shrimp and a few bits of tuna.  Since I was so warm, I ordered the chopped salad.  It was bland.  Won't be back again.
