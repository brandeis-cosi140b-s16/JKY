Went here about a week ago during my lunch break. There were, really not exaggerating either, 6 people on the whole place. We ordered burritos  and literally had to get up towards the kitchen and ask about our food. I don't get how this was so slow. We took it to go and was given the orders wrong as well. They should have given us a discount or if anything free. They were not even apologetic about anything.
