Simple order. Nachos bell grande with no tomatoes and asked to substitute beef with beans. What did I get? A regular order of nachos bell grande. This was at 8:45 at night with no customers in drive- through or inside. Apparently this was a complicated order for them. Incompetence to say the least. How hard is your job anyways?
