I've loved EPL since I was a kid, first choice in chicken FF, never really was fan of fried chicken and EPL has practically been the only one that doesn't serve fried chicken. They have a self-serve Salsa Bar where you can get as much salsa, onions and cilantro as you want. 

Our usual order is the 10pc Family Meal with 2 large sides (Mac 'n' Cheese & Mashed Potato) and flour tortillas. I love flame grilled chicken and their seasoning soooo good that I actually like eating the skin of the chicken and I usually don't like chicken skin! Mac 'n' Cheese is super inconsistent. The Cheese can be super thick, super thin or chunky. Mashed potatoes are usually a little more consistent. 

Yes, I've said that I love EPL but I gave this location 1-Star because when we walked in, the Salsa bar was DIRTY, there was only ONE clean table in the entire restaurant and we took it before anyone else could. Trays on the other tables with trash, tables weren't wiped down, it was GROSS. 

My son accidentally spilled a cup of water on the floor and on the table, so he asked them for a rag, and what they gave him was thinner than the napkins on the table in the dispenser! I got tired of slipping and sliding on the floor so I asked one of the employees to mop it dry and the guy says "OK" and walks away. I don't know if he understood me but the water sat there so I let it be their problem for the person that slips in it. I hope to change the rating on this location in the future as I heart EPL.
