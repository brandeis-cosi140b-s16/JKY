Use to love this place because of the service and food, but since the the move this place has went to hell. Been there two times and since the move and sat for 10 minutes and did not get waited on once. Second time we waited 5 minutes and didn't get waited on, people came in after us and were waited on before we were even approached. It's sad to say that a place once known for great service has gone bad. And for the food, I can't comment on because I had no service. Overall I will never go back to this restaurant.
