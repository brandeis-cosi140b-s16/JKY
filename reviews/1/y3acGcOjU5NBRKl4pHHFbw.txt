This place is just terrible. Maria and her crew are all very polite but Maria is extremely money hungry. She'll charge you a dollar for a small amount of guacamole. That's another thing, the quality of their food is AWFUL! They charge more than Roberto's for the same exact thing, and it's DISGUSTING. I'm not sure if its because they prepare the food now here, at CSN, or what, but the food is just a huge let down and the price is just ridiculous. Which is unfortunate. Obviously, we're all poor, college students. I can't afford to shell out 8 dollars for a meal that's just going to give me diarrhea later.
