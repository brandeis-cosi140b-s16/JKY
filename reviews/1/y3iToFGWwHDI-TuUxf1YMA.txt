The food is consistent with all other chipo's but the A/C is either not working or needs to be turned down!  It is always hot as @$&/ in there. Every time I ask the staff why and they have no explanation.  When I asked if other people have complained the said all the time.  It's Arizona...  Every restaurant should have a working hvac in AZ!!!
