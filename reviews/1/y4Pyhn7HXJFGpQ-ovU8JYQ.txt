It's basically a sit down Taco Bell. Orders came out wrong (breakfast burrito vs carne asada), not authentic food and the nacho cheese is best described as cold Velveeta. Very slow for a night that wasn't busy. Maybe it was just an off night, but would not return and would not recommend. Probably better if drunk.
