Used to love this place.... it has gone completely downhill, except for the prices.  It was $18 for 

2 mini chimi
1 shredded chicken taco
3 rolled tacos
Side of rice & beans

It took 25 mins to get our food.  The chimi's & chicken taco were soggy.  As in raw dough soggy. It was disgusting. ...  even worse, my husband dissected his chimi to try and salvage some of the meal, but found a short nasty hair in it.  Absolutely disgusting and we will NEVER go back.
