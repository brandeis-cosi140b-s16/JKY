I've been coming to cafe rio since someone stole his idea and called it cafe cabo. So it's been years. And I've been to the eastern location as well as the one in Stephanie. This one is TERRIBLE! a bunch of teenagers running the back. One yelling at her coworkers screaming profanities. 

The food was not as good as the other ones. My guacamole was black and old. Ew. 

And the WORST part of it all was the straws. Whoever owns this one must be too cheap. All the other locations have individually wrapped straws... This one has a pile of straws in the straw container UNWRAPPED! EW! Is that even complying with health codes?! So disgusting. All the peoples dirty hands ugh so gross. Needless to say I won't be returning to this one. 


Ew.
