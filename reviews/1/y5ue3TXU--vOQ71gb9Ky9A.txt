This place had horrible service from the hostess (who didn't greet us at the door), to the waitress (who didn't even know what kind of soda they had & had a horrible attitude), next came the manager (who gave my phone to another patron to check out my phone), then if all that wasn't bad enough the owner of this "fine" establishment wanted to fight me for voicing my opinion about the manager passing my phone off for a customer to check out!  Besides all of the for mentioned, the food wasn't that great!
