We got vouchers to this restaurant ..thank god all we had to pay for were the drinks.. let's start off with nothing  having flavor food seems to have been micrwaved or Re fried to many times..soda is water down lazy staff and a food prep eating in the line which is so unsanitary and illegal.. no liquor licence but advertising for buckets of beer for 12 dollor a scam obviously used to lure people In. Dont stay do not let the smell fool you mine could have been prepared better by my 6 year old. Dissatisfied and disgusted with this place. Off to del taco I go.
