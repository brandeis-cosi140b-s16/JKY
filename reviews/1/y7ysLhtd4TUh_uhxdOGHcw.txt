If you're ordering for a big group everything will be wrong. Every time we order nobody's is right. Yea they took $27 off today because they didn't have chicken at 11am the opening time. So we were forced to choose another meat. Everything we asked for on the side wasn't in the box and if you see the picture posted earlier of a bowl with no meat full of water you'll get the picture. We're done ordering from this location. We think they do this purposely because it's to busy and they don't have time to deal with huge parties especially during peak hr lunch. Good luck with your offices and orders! I again didn't eat because my food was soaking in a mystery juice.
