We checked online what time they were closed, it said 10:00pm we went at 9:15 as we are quick diners and knew we would be done quickly. We showed up at 9:15, clearly before they closed and were refused dining. We will never go back and try this restaurant because of how rude they were to us. NEVER go there because they are extremely rude and only care about getting out early and not staying open until the posted time!!!!
