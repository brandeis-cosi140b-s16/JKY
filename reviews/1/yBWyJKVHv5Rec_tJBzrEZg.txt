This place is awful. Go to Poliberto's down the street and get the carne asada burrito, which is about 3x better.

My Migo Burrito reportedly had 8 ingredients. I remember a soggy tortilla (1), french fries (2), meat (3), tiny avacado chuncks (4), runny re-fried beans (5)...and that's it. Oh, and indigestion (6)...a big portion of that.

The only thing that might maybe possibly somehow get me back through those doors was the salsa verde. The guys eating tacos looked pretty happy, so there is a slight chance they may get one more shot. 

Save yourself the trouble and the money, pass on grass...
