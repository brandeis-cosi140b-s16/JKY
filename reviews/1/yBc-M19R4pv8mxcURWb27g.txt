This place was great once upon a time. Don't even waste your time. The building is old and the bathrooms are disgusting and falling apart. The service is very bad. The food is better than most mediocre Mexican restaurants but not worth the hassle. Food finally arrived after 52 min wait.  Get it together Los Olivos!
