Worse mexican food I have ever eaten. I ordered chimichungas and received a wet burrito. The rice was dry and had no flavor as did the salsa. I asked for the manager, and she couldn't be bothered to come see me and kept sending messages thru the serever. If your looking for authentic mexican food, i suggest you go elsewhere.
