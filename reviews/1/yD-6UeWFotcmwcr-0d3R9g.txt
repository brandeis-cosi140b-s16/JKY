I was super excited when i thought i found an "authentic mexican taco shop" close to my new home, (im originally from Los Angeles so i KNOW what a real authentic taco is, i was practically raised eating authentic mexican food) anyway this place was dog shit. I mean u walk in n the ppl working there are clearly mexican n dont speak the best of english (which is fine), i ordered Carne asada taco and chicken taco... Since when is carne asade little chunks of grizley flavorless meat?? So gross... Everything was gross tasting there. Im not a pickey eater but i couldn't do it, my body wouldnt allow me to swallow all the chewy grizle (gross)... I gave it to my dog n she wouldnt eat it either. The chicken was not as bad but it wasnt good. 

This place was an epic fail, i feel like they have lost touch w theyre culture n what mexican food really is. 
Maybe this is mexican food in vegas (god i hope not). its just whitewashed bland not even close to real mexican food. Im surprised they didnt put ketsup ontop as the sauce. 
Im warning u.... U might vomit if u eat here

Oh ya... even the rice and beans weren't edible for me or my dog, if thats not enough the girl working there was a BI%*H. That is all :(
