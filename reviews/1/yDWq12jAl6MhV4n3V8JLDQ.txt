Anyone that tells you they have fast service and great drinks is a liar. I have been forced for years to meet at the Sandbar before going on bike rides or a central point for everyone to meet before we all go out. Bartenders...suck, slow and pour weak drinks...make that expensive weak drinks. The servers missing in action, screw up orders constantly and lack any kind of customer service. The only reason this place is still around (unlike the others that failed miserably) is because its the only freaking place in North Phx to go. I pray for another place to open soon to put these guys out of business.
