Tried this place today and quite frankly I have no idea why this place has so many good reviews! I ordered the five taco special all carne asada and a drink-total was over $9.00! Wow that was not expected since the reviews below say the food was priced well too which it was not! The tortillas was good but very greasy from the grill. The carne asada was over cooked and dried out...flavor was bland not what you would expect from a Mexican place! Greasy food is not something I like and this qualifies as greasy! I love spicy bold flavors and I was not impressed at all! Growing up in LA I guess I was spoiled with great Mexican food but out here things are different. This place overall would get a no star review but I can't go this low. Lacks quality and flavor, I will not be going back.
