Bottom Line:  Grumpy employees, slow service, greasy food and disgustingly dirty.

I was desperately hungry for lunch so decided to get a quesadilla at Lost Taquitos. In hindsight, I would have been just getting some snacks at the local magazine store.  I was able to order quickly but it took a long time for my food to come up which consistence of a steak quesadilla and some hot sauce.  Some vegetables with this would have been awesome.  I think it was supposed to come with pico de gallo.  Also, a smear of guac could have really livened this dish up.  Heck, some lettuce and tomatoes inside the quesadilla would have been good too.  There wasn't anywhere to sit which is probably ok since there are literally inches of dust hanging on the exposed sealing overhead.  I took my greasy quesadilla to go but not before heading past the adjacent restaurant to the soda machine which was Pepsi.  Bleh.
