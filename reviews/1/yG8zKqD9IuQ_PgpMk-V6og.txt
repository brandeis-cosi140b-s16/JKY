This place was awful. I'd rather have Taco Bell. The salsa was tomato sauce with cayenne pepper in it. My dinner had no flavor AT ALL and the service was slow at best. Our love of Mexican cuisine has spanned generations and if this is what's consider good Mexican food in the west valley then I'll keep driving to other side of town. Very sad.
