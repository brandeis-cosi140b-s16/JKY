I ate at this restaurant last weekend for my father-in-law's birthday and spent over $200. From the moment we sat down, the service was terrible. Perhaps that is because for large parties, this establishment automatically adds a tip onto your bill. We were there for almost 2 hours, yet our waiters and waitresses never came by our table to check on us, when we would ask for a drink refill, they wouldn't bring it, they messed up our order and overall, they seemed more attentive to the smaller tables. I couldn't believe that a restaurant has the audacity to charge a large tip onto an already large bill without providing any hospitality or service that would warrant such a charge. I would never come here again. The food was good, but when you and your party blatantly get ignored, at least for me, that discounts my whole experience.

And for everybody going here with a large party (good luck with the service) - the automatic gratuity added onto your bill is NOT mandatory for you pay. Effective Jan. 1, 2014 the IRS held that these automatic charges ARE disputable. This automatic gratuity does not fit its definition of a "tip"; therefore, feel free to tell your waitress to take it off.
