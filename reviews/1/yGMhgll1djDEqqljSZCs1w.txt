Note to self: chicken tacos here are horrible, terrible, deplorable, with out a welcome taste, a full on insult to my palette, flies would turn them down, marooned sailors would rather chew sand than eat these, so bad that a cat falling in the mix would be a welcome addition, so poorly seasoned and dry that I got more moisture and flavor from the cabbage. On the bright side when I throw this up in a bit my dinner from last night will make it taste better going up than it did going down! 

If this place has been here for over 18 years it certainly had zero to do with chicken taco sales or the business is actually a front for a money laundering operation for the mob! The owner did look Italian..

My sister and nieces company "niece wisely chose not to eat" did make it slightly bearable though..

Next time I will have the fish tacos so many other people on here review well and hope for the best.

 I still can't get over the nasty chicken tacos, the owner needs to try his competitions tacos and refine his, if a stand in baja in the middle of no where can get it right with limited resources he should be able to get it right too.

P.S. the horchada didn't suck.
