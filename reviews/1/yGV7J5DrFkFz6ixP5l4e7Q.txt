Don't bother calling in an order if you happen to need it to be gluten free. The person that takes the order is highly unlikely to follow protocol. I proved it today walking in early to pick up my order and no one changed gloves or changed out the cheese or lettuce. Yet it wasn't marked on the order as a GF bowl. People have no idea how sick one can get from cross contamination. Most don't care. It's Disturbing.
