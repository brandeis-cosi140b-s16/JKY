Elvira's has been around for a long time and it looks like it.  When another guest sat down in the booth behind me they nearly knocked me into my plate.  Anchor those booth backs.  Service not so good.  Never checked back, late with the check.  Other patrons children running wild.
Not such a great experience.  18 years in AJ first and last time at Elvira's .
