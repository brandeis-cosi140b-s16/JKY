Tried again today since it's close to work...won't return.  Female wait staff was unfriendly and again on a party of two, one order came out wrong.  Lunch chicken fajitas barely had any chicken, but had an over-abundance of peppers...thinking they should rename that menu item.  Neither waitress came back to check how our food was or offer drink refill.  We had to go to the counter to get our bill - we paid and left, we do not tip for bad service......and we will NOT be returning.  It's no wonder they are never very busy in a spot that should be getting a lot of business considering they are off of Hwy 51 with Dean Health Care and Boumatic right across the street.
