I walked into this hole in the wall in a shopping center hoping to find some authentic Mexican food. As I walked in, there was a woman washing tables. I placed my order with a man on the phone clearly having a personal conversation but he paused long enough to take my order. After I ordered, the woman who was washing tables strolled into the back where you can see them prepare the food. She wiped her hands on her dirty apron and reached for a tortilla with BARE unwashed hands I almost walked out right there but was so shocked I just watched in disbelief!! She proceded to slap some ingredients on it from containers rolled it up sprinkled some cheese; still no gloves. The best part; she put it in a styrofoam container and then PUT it in the microwave!! Mouth dropped to the floor after just paying $8.14. I walked out and threw in the trash, so disgusted!
