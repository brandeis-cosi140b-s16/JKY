I knew I would have a fairly long layover at LAS but decided to quickly Google for decent food instead of Yelp. What a mistake.

I skimmed several websites that gave this place good marks so I decided to try it out. 

Bland flavors, dry meat (I got the "special"), soggy iceberg lettuce and tortilla, watered-down tasteless pico. 

Thought about giving this place 2 stars considering it's airport food but decided against it for the $9.72 I paid.

I had thorough time to explore terminal C. I'll probably be sticking with Burger King next time I'm back.
