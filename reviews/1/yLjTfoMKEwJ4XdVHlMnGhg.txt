Everytime in go my order is wrong.  I ordered  Fiesta chicken salad and it came without the side salsa.
The 2 crunchy nacho dorieto tacos we're Cool Ranch and for some reason and empty restaurant has no empanadas at 9pm. Call the number listed on the receipt to complain and its a non working number.  I have lived in the area for 4 years now and my orders are always messed up and I hate going to Taco Bell but when the family wants Taco Bell we go and the orders are always messed up! Always! 
The end of the tomatoes are in my salad because nobody bothers to take them off ever. This is the worst most inconsistent Taco Bell I had ever been to and I don't even go during the busy hours.  I don't know if they need to change owners or what but I'm going to stop going. I've wasted so much money at this establishment on crappy food the employees must not care about their jobs.
