Was here for a company lunch... Decent food and ambience is very authentic Mexican... I ordered fish tacos which was good but it had a fish bone which got stuck in my throat ... I had to go to urgent care to get it removed later on... I can't imagine that this was not taken care of by the chef... Horrible experience as it did not work in my favor... My colleagues were upset as well as we did not expect this kind of problems to arise in a restaurant of such high caliber.
