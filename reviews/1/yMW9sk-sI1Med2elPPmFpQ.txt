Ate at La Paz years ago with little reason to return. Decided to try them again and yep...remember the lackluster flavors and friendly if not horribly disorganized service. When the waitress asked about the food, we mentioned the bad rice and she admitted that depending on who was in the kitchen changed how the food tasted. Nice.  BTW, our waitress was sweet and helpful despite the disorganization or lack of staff...wasn't sure what kept them MIA.  Don't waste your time or money...there are dozens of great Mexican restaurants in this town.
