DON'T GO THERE.  This place is not only overpriced, but the club, the worst.  Security guards (They think they are police officers) are horrible, especially the jerk with long hair old creepy guy who could not get a better job and thinks he is a cop.  They are horrible when it comes to customer service.
I only gave them one start because I have to give them at least one.  They do not deserve even 1/4 of a star
