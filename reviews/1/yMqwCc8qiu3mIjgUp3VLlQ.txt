Would have given 3 stars based on the food, but the server (Brianna) was what made this place get only 1 star.
We (4 of us) went for Cinco de Mayo and they weren't busy when we got there, about 430.  Brianna took our order, another guy brought our drinks, she didn't bother to tell him I wanted lemons for my water.  She didn't bother to ring in margaritas on the rocks instead of frozen, and when she finally came back to the table, she just kinda chuckled and said she didn't write it down and told them to take the wrong drinks to us anyway because we would be happy since they had alcohol in them....UMMM NO! it is not okay, we asked for more chips, she walked by them and kept walking.  A few minutes later we passed by them and got our own.    Asked for extra napkins...we had to get our own.  She didn't seem to do anything right.
Asked to speak with a manager, Forrest, he seemed very timid and unsure of everything.  Not sure how he is even a mgr.  All in all she shouldn't be allowed to be a server, she also discriminates offering certain tables stuff while doing not even the bare minimum for others.
