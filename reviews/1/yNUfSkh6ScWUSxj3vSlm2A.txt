The restaurant was dirty and the service was incredibly slow.   We went there on a Thursday night at 6:45 we waited over 20 minutes, then asked how much longer and they said they could not tell us.  We got our money back, walked over to Jimmy Johns and got our food in less than a minute.

The employees at Jimmy Johns were amazing, happy and provided very quick service. Employees at Taco bells seemed like they were miserable and moved at a very slow pace.
