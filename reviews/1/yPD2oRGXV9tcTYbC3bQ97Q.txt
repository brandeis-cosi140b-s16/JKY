This has got to be the worst fast food place we have ever been to! Terrible customer service! Terrible prices! Terrible everything. I over heard one of the cooks say something about a cucaracha...now, I can't understand most Spanish but I do know what that word means. For anyone who doesn't, it means cockroach! I immediately lost my appetite! They made my boyfriends food wrong and because of his allergy he requested that they remake it. They put up a huge stink and because the cooks refused, the cashier ended up having to go back there and make it himself. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone.
