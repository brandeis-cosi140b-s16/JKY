Just picked up food from here about 9:00. 
First of all I ordered a barbacoa burrito and chips and queso. Went to pay he told me one price then switched it on me after he told me. Also thanks for serving me burnt queso dip. This is the worst cafe rio in town by far. Very inconsistent food and service the last few times I have been has been below par. Also your supposed to serve the same food an hour before you close that you do during the middle of the day. Don't give customers scraps because they come in late!
