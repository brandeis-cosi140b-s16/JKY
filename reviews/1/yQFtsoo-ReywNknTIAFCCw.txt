I wish that I could give NO stars because the previous posters are right; this place is TERRIBLE. They are always out of something, often it is chicken! A 20 minute wait is the norm, be it the drive-thru or inside. You might as well go inside if you insist on eating here, as your order will most likely be wrong. I have been told they are out of verde sauce and that they will no longer be carring it (not true), I have been given 2 chicken strips instead of a breaded chicken sandwich (often) and even if I order one thing, 50/50 chance it will be wrong.
 I have called to complain to the GM but never recieved a call back. Today the GM, Farrah, was there. I told her the issues I have and she said, "We'll work on it." and blew me off. It was rude and dismissive.
 I only go to this location because it is literally across the street from my house, and my son begs for Taco Bell as a special treat. No more.
 The location at 43rd & pinnicle Peak and the one at 57th & Bell aren't as bad, and the Taco bell/ Long John Silver is almost always right. However, I won't go anymore. I can get junk food anywhere, made right and with a smile; why would I give my money to them?
