Avoid this place. As much as you can.
The chips were stale, and the salsa was bland. Although the portions were decent compared to the price, the quality of the food was poor. I ordered the mushroom quesadilla, and it was SWIMMING in oil. I was literally draining my plate every 2-3 bites to get all the excess oil off. There was also WAY too much cheese in the food. If you love mexican cheese, you might like this, but it was too greasy and too bland. My friend ordered the burrito with steak in it, and the steak was over-cooked.

Next time you want a mexican fix, go to El Toro or Maize. Those dishes will hook.you.up.
