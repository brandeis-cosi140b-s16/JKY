Horrible service, horrible food. Bad experience. So basic! The decor is nice which is why they get the one star but the waiter was rude. The food tasted horrible! The beef taco carbon or whatever was horrible don't get it. The pancho nachos suck. The only good thing is the salsa and the creamy jalape√±o.
