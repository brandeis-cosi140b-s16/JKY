Dreary experience. Came in before 8pm, had to wait 15 minutes for a table in a near-empty restaurant. We ordered, and waited 45 minutes; we were finally served, with a few dishes ignored and the rest cold. 5 minutes later, bright spotilights came up so that they could start cleaning up.  We asked the speak to the manager, who had the lights lowered slightly. She also comped one drink on a $130+ bill.  Particularly unappetizing was the $29 Molcajete De Mariscos, which was a shallow bowl of gummy overcooked riced with a thin covering of fish and a few shrimps.
