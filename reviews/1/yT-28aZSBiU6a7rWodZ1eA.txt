Jajajajajajaja.  (That's laughing in Spanish.)

This place got such bad yelps and had such a horrible name that they changed their name!!!  That's right.  They CHANGED THE NAME OF THE RESTAURANT!?!?

Funny thing is (jajaja.) that their new name may be worse than the original.  Hotel California conjured visions of bad 70's rock and a downtown hotel here in Vegas that caters to the Hawaiian crowd (mahalo!).  Definitely doesn't bring to mind great Mexican food.  Not many people are even aware that the song by the Eagles, Hotel California, refers to a place in Baja, CA.

So, yeah, now it's called Baja Fresh Mexican Grill.  I mean Baja California Restaurant and Cantina.  An even worse name than HC?  Yep.  To me it's like naming a restaurant "Las Vegas, Nevada, Restaurant and Bar."

Bottom line though is same ungood food served in a soulless room.  Again, if "Baja" cuisine means cheeseburger, pizza, tacos and paella, count me out...
