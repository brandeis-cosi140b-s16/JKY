Seriously disgusted right now guys. I have been eating here for about 2 years and never had a complaint. Right now I don't even know if I dare eat this crap. I'm mad and to sum it up your place is filthy, flys all over, salsa bar is crusty and looks like it has not been cleaned in forever, your trash can is covered in multiple layers of filth, and when I asked for some fresh cucumbers your staff came out and put in new cucumbers then grabbed the old slimy ones and dumped them on top. Oh my God you must be kidding. The place is pretty busy and I'm surprised I'm the only one who seems to even notice.  Disgusting! The store in Phoenix by my hospital is clean, well maintained and has decent sense of cleanliness and well prepared food without the complimentary flys to go.
