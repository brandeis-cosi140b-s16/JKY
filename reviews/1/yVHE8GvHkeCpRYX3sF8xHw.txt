Very disappointed!!! I'm sure anyone that can remember the days gone by when Filibertos truly was the best place to get a carne asada burrito would feel the same.  This place has retained almost none of its former glory.  I must sadly concur with those who have given one and no stars to their once great carne asana burrito. It was pretty much nothing more than over salted meat.  Everything else about the place seems to have also really gone down hill.....this state of affairs is very sad to a once devoted admirer
