I grew up in Denver! (Where Qdoba and Chipotle started) & This location is by far the worst one I have visited, I have been to this location many times. And my luck its get worst every time I go. Im am not the one to be a bad one to review a place but the people that work here are not happy. Sad cause cause if you visit most they are welcoming and are happy to help.
