Stopped in for the first time today. If there's one thing I can't resist, a good plate of Mexican food! Unfortunately I was disappointed, almost from the get go! 

Service was mediocre at best. I constantly let the young lady helping me know that it was my first time at cafe rio, she seemed more agitated then excited to have a new customer. She really was no help at all. I asked for sour cream cheese and pico on my burrito, she said I could only have cheese because they have to put it in the oven. I explained to her I didn't want it in the oven, she basically said there was no choice. I told her just to make me something since I obviously don't understand how to order and I can't have what I'm telling you I want. Instead of offering me assistance she looked relieved and just made something. 

Not very good, tasted microwaved honestly. Kinda sad. 

Basically my experience and the food were undesirable and I won't be back. $20 for a burrito with chips and guacamole and a drink. 

Best part, bottomless horchata!! That's why I gave the one star.. dam good horchata too..ironically
