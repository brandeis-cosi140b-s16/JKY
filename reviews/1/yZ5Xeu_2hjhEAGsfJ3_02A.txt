Happened to try this place during their Challenge with "Slidin' Thru" Slider Truck this afternoon or more like yesterday afternoon. Pretty Cool Themed Truck/Trailer and Owner was delightful and Convincing as he briefly explained his inspirations for his creations of Korean Fusion Tacos and such..

Here is what I got roughly an HOUR after I placed my order:

Pork Taco & Beef Taco

Both the tacos had their version of korean inspired kimchee/saurkraut spiced with a twist. UUmmm.... Okay, I'm always up for new takes on food. First off, there wasn't much meat in either of the tacos and the tortilla made them look even more skimpy (especially for the price). Secondly, the beef was very bland, pretty chewy (not in a good way) and all I could really taste was spicy/heat?! Where's the flavor? Pretty much the same with the pork.. except it was a little juicier with a bit of flavor?! I couldn't comprehend what they were trying to accomplish here..

El Korean "Nate" Dog

This looked interesting but wasn't much different in regards to its flavor profile compared to the Tacos. The hot dog tasted like a regular hot dog and bun was no different. The only slight upside to this was the texture from the same kimchee/saurkraut thing that accompanied the tacos.  

Disregarding the horrendous wait (which was the dagger), the bang for the buck, and the slight edge the hot dog had over the tacos, I cannot give this place much justice. Sorry
