I used to love this place.

Omar is hands down the best bartender ever. Unfortunately he wasn't here today. 

I walked in, sat down, and waited for five minutes. No one helped me and no one was even in the bar. I got up and asked a man who was talking to another woman in the next room where the bartender was and the bartender "Cesar" was the man standing in the other room, leaning over the counter, talking to a server. When I asked him if there was a bartender he said "ugh yeah, it's me. What do you need?" I wanted to walk out right then. He made me what I ordered slammed it down, and was gone for another 20 minutes.

The food wasn't as good as usual either.

I don't think I'll ever be back on Wednesdays or Thursday when mr. "Cesar" is working.
