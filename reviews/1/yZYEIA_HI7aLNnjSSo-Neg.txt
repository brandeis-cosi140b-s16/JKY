Called in our order, went to pick it up and presented a 20% off coupon I received in the mail.  A male employee started speaking to the cashier in Spanish about the coupon for quite a while.  She very meekly pointed out to me a letter they had printed up and put on the register that the coupon was dine in only, however, the coupon didn't state that on it.  So, obviously they were losing money on the deal (the place was totally empty at dinner time), and decided to change their policy AFTER the coupon was sent out.  I was also offended that the cashier and this other person were speaking about me and my transaction in Spanish in an attempt to hide what they were saying, not sure what the big deal even was, just tell me the coupon is dine in only and leave it at that.  And, after all that, the food was very mediocre, not worth the price.  My daughter wouldn't even eat her food.  We won't be back and I'll make sure to spread the word!
