Yuk.  This place is garbage.  I did not like it when it was Cabo and I still think it's crap.  The one star is for the excellent service.  
The beef enchiladas had a awful tasting red sauce that needed to be cleaned off in order to make the enchiladas edible.  Menu stated it was supposed to be green which it obviously was not.  
The pollo ranchero was supposed to be a braised chicken. It was actually grilled because it had the burn marks of being on the grill.  Tasted O-K.  But wasn't worth going back for.  The beans and rice weren't nothing to write about either. 
The service from our waitress was outstanding.  She tried to make everything right and threw in desert freee of charge.  The chef told her that the problems with the food were because the menu has so many misprints.
I'll stick w/ Roberto's taco shop for mexican around these parts.
