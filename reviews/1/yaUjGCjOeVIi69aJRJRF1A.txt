Sometimes you pay for convenience and this time was proof of that. This was the first time that I walked in rather than using the drive thru. So glad that I did I was able to finally see this disconnect between what I imagined and what is handed through the window. There were only two people on staff I expected slow service but at least accurate and consistent. Man was I wrong my burrito had cheese that wasn't even melted all the way. I fell in love with the restaurant years ago and maybe it's franchising has led to a more diluted product. Not all California staples can withstand not having that key needed oversight. This will me my last visit to this entire chain. If your hungry in the area there's an In and Out across the street , it's a better use of your time and money.
