I've been a loyal customer for 15 years. I've even moved out of the state back again out of the city and have made sure that La Hacienda has been a staple on my food tours whenever I'm in town. However today marks the last time I will ever patronize this establishment. First off the drinks and food hasn't been the best as the years have gone by but there's something about nostalgia that keeps you going back. That said, today the service was awful, the food was ok and the drinks better than the last time I was there, but we were given a bill that wasn't ours. We didn't realize, as yes it seemed cheap but ultimately was a matter of $15 difference, we paid and were  leaving tip when the waiter curtly said I gave you the wrong bill and then presented a bill that was illegible and hand written  with a different amount in it. We went to the front to clarify and ask that they go over the bill to ensure it was clear and the hostess was rude and flustered and void of understanding as to why this all would be frustrating. She wasn't interested in our frustration, she was unhelpful, and didn't care whether we continued to frequently the establishment. Needless to say we won't be back ever and it's unfortunate that 15 years of my money went into a resutarant that doesn't value customer service.
