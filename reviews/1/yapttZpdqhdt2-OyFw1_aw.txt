WORST FILIBERTOS EVER. They seriously just tried to charge me 6.50 for two beef tacos! This filibertos menu and their prices as well as quality of food has always been subpar to the majority of filibertos in the valley. Their food was always about 70 percent as good as other Filibertos I've been to but now charging so much it's definitely not worth the visit. Most other filibertos in the valley charged a 1.99 for a taco. I could have gotten this in a combination plate for 6.50,  same chain all other locations. This restaurant won't be around for long if they keep this up
