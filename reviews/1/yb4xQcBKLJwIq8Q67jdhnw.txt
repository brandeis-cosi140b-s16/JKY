The food here is usually good but tonight they could not seem to get the order right.  After getting home with our order placed in the drive thru we find out that our side of rice is missing.  My son goes up there to let them know they forgot the rice and they just gave it to him and didn't even offer to remake his burritos.  He gets home with his rice and begins to eat his cold burritos to find out they gave him the wrong burrito.  There were other items in this order that were correct so it was not like they gave us the wrong order.  The receipt even had the rice on it.  Very incompetent employees working tonight.
