Uninspired Tex Mex food served up by an apathetic staff. None of the ingredients here are fresh and it tastes very much like the corporate Sysco food that cafeterias dish out. Probably wouldn't have finished if it wasn't for the copious amounts of hot sauce I applied. 

If a Taco Bell and Del Taco burrito taste around the same for about half the price you know there's a problem. There's much much better options at Sky Harbor

*Tip - There's a 4 star rated Los Taquitos  off the airport that came up in my search that made me think this place was good but make sure you get the airport location in your search or your going to be pretty disappointed.
