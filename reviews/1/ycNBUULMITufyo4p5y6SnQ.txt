The food that I got at this location last night was the worst food I have ever had at any Taco Bell in my entire lifetime. This is actually the second time I have been to this place and hoped that things have improved since my last visit since it was a very long time ago. After last night, I now know that I will never visit this abysmal excuse of a fast food restaurant ever again. On both of my visits, the contents of my food was "lacking". I ordered tacos and burritos and all items barely had any filling or contents. I mean BARELY anything!!!! There were literally less than 10 individual shreds of lettuce in my tacos. When I first opened the packaging I honestly thought there was no lettuce in my tacos. Then I just looked closer and noticed the very very few sprinklings of meat, lettuce and cheese. PLUS, they got my order wrong. I ordered a taco supreme and it was not supreme. Unfortunately, I bought my food in the drive-thru and didn't discover all this until I got home. I was furious!!! To boot, the place inside is filthy, empty and just downright terrible. Don't ever go to this restaurant. The franchisor is obviously instructing his staff to short change their customers by not preparing the food to the franchise's standards (i.e., actually putting food in the taco shells or tortillas). It just sucks because this is the closest Taco Bell to my house. Oh well, I truly hope they go out of business and fail miserably because this franchise owner doesn't deserve success.
