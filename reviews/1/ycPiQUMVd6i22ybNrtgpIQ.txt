Being in a good area of Henderson and having the name it does - I had high hopes for this place. I was craving a cheese enchilada plate for days. I went here for my fix.

First of all...8 dollars and change for cheese and tortillas and a scoop of canned beans....RIDICULOUS!

Second - When I asked for sour cream on my refried beans - she charged me....I think 90 cents? Wow. 

Sidenote - When the girl took my money - there didnt appear to be a cook in the back - and she, herself went back into the "kitchen" (which looked more like a pizza assembly line with old toppings)...she threw all the ingerdients together in about one minute)

Third - When I received my food, I was SO excited to enjoy it that when I got home and saw pretty much just a styrofoam box with brown bean goop in it....I was frightened of even eating it.

They put refried beans ONTO my two cheese enchiladas. The cheese inside the tortillas wasnt melted....the tortillas themselves were tasteless and soggy. The beans were bland and COMPLETELY tasteless.  AND to boot - there was no sauce (red sauce - traditional and AMAZING when done right) and I literally could not imagine someone making a WORSE plate of "enchiladas" if they TRIED! I wanted a refund so badly but since I was home watching a movie after a long day it wasnt even worth stepping foot in there again. 

I dont know about any of the other menu items at this place - but the cheese enchiladas are absolutely DISGUSTING. Most disappointing mexican food I have ever had.

Alibertos or Faustos for me, next time.
