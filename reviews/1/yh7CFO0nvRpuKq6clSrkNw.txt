I came here with my wife and daughter for some dinner. My wife and i have been here before so we figured it would be decent.

The service was lackluster. The waiter took my wife's order and mine, but ignored the fact that I had my daughter with me. I had to chase him down to give him her order. Drinks ran low a few times and we had to ask for refills. Empty plates sat on the table until another waiter decided to clear them for us. 

The food was.... well, the chips and salsa were the stars of our meal. The chili relleno wrapped in an omelet was.... different. I can't recommend it though. My taco and tostada were overwhelmed by scallions. The sauce for my enchilada tasted exactly as if it had come from a Banquet microwave meal. My daughter barely ate any of her two mini tacos. My wife grabbed her leftovers since she wasn't interested in finishing her chili relleno and said "no wonder she didn't eat her tacos! These are terrible!" 

We were very disappointed with our meal. I could have gotten better food from a Rolando's at a better price.
