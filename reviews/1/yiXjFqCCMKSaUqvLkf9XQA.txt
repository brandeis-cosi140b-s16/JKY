Came in with my family to eat. Recieved a bottomless chips and salsa. With a rubber band in it. Yummy. Not really. It was really. Pretty nasty. Its a shame. Because I love this place. But didnt like the treatment the manager gave us. The server was nice. That was the reason for atleast one star. But I dont think i will be coming back. Need to work on guest service and compensation. Im not talking about $2.95 for the chips and salsa. Maybe we need a health inspector to come down and check this place out. Or a dirty dining channel 13 stop....
