I was disappointed. 

I dined in the restaurant Saturday evening. Everyone that worked there was courteous and friendly. Unfortunatley, the food wasn't all that.

The chips and salsa were ok, but the refried beans looked and tasted like Rosarita refried beans.

I order a 2 item combination dinner and chili rellano side dish.

Beef Taco - Beef was tasty, but disappointed in the taco shell - it was paper thin. 

Chicken Enchilada - bland and saugy. The tortilla that wrapped the chicken was thin and mushy. The chicken was seasoned well.

Chili Rellano - it was standard. Nothing spectacular.

Mexican Rice - standard.

Refried Beans - I'm CONVINCED they are from out of the can!

**Overall it was disappointing.**

Prior to dining in the restaurant, I went into the restaurant to obtain a menu and I spoke to the hostess. I asked if their tortillas were handmade. She said, "yes". After dining in the restaurant, the tortillas may very well be handmade, but they are handmade paper thin. The tortilla chips were thicker than the taco shell and enchilada. 

My bill came out to about $15 which is typical of a restaurant of this caliber. But for the same money I paid for this dinner, I could have eatten at a Lindo/Bonito Michocan and listened to LIVE entertainment since it was a Saturday night.

One thing that I did notice, there was a large party leaving the restaurant's private dining room. They looked to be Mexican nationals, which I assume were friends of the owners or family. All I could think is "I wonder how these Mexicans liked the food because as a Mexican myself, it was subpar". 

My reccomendation would be for the owners to check out Leticia's Cocina located in the NW to experience AUTHENTIC Mexican food.
