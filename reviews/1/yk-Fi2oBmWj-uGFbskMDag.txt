Where to start.....after waiting forever for a table (6 total people in the restaurant) plus 3 servers, we're served store bought (waiter admitted) chips.   Food is definately nothing to write about, it was NOT GOOD!  Spicy just to be spicy, you couldn't taste the food itself it was too HOT!!  

The only good thing, the "local" discount!  

Don't waste your time here!!'
