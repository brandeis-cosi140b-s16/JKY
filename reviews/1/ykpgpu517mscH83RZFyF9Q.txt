I have to rate today's visit with only 1 star! I've eaten at this location at least once per week since they opened and today I had the worst service imaginable. I even stood at the counter before leaving to talk with the manager and was ignored and not even asked what I needed. We waited over 30 minutes for our food. Got it and my order was wrong.. I can accept when they are busy and need a little extra time- I get it. But my order was wrong and the attempt to fix it was just pathetic! I ordered the standard gourmet grill chicken tacos without the bacon and sauces. Everything else as normal. I got plain tacos with chicken and avocado only and served on a cold tortilla!! They went back in an attempt to correct it and added onions, cilantro, and dry shredded white cheese! When the order was re delivered I let them know this is still not right and was missing the grilled tortilla with melted cheese! I was told I was wrong (as a customer!) and this is how they are made and it is now made correctly! Can I say at the least I am super irritated since I've eaten these yummy tacos on numerous occasions! They have lost a customer! So sad!
