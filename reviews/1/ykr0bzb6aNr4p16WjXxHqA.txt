This place sucks!! The cashiers at this location don't know what they are doing! I asked for a carne asada burrito with red sauce on top and  aka a wet burrito, she told me no, she doesn't feel like making it! First of all, that's rude!  2 I'm the paying customer I get the order the way I want even if it means me paying more. And three where the hell is customer service!! Never again!! I has to talk to the manager and she said they don't have one???? Really??
