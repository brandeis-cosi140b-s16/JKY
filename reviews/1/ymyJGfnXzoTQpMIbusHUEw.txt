Just horrible,  overpriced, no flavor and just all out bad.  My fiance and I  shared an enchilada plate and we each got a drink, and nothing was worth the price.  Our waitress said the drinks were strong and they weren't.  The food was bland.  Nothing special, taco bell would have been better.  Stay away unless you like tourist traps, bad food, and bad service.
