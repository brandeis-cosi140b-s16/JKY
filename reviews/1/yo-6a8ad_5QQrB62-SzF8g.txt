I LOVE Cafe Rio and have eaten at all of them in town except this particular one till last night. The service was friendly and helpful. I got their chicken quesadilla, it was luke warm and very water chicken. I also got chips and queso, which was very watered down in comparison to the other Cafe Rios I have eaten previously. All of these things should have given me a tip off when my tummy started not feeling good before I even left the establishment. The rest of the evening was a bust after that meal, without going into further detail. All in all, may have been a fluke visit, but I won't be visiting this particular cafe rio ever again.
