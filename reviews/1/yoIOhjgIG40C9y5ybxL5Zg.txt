DO NOT GO HERE!!! My girlfriend was verbally assaulted and intimidated tonight by the bar staff. I had gone to the restroom and while my girlfriend was sitting outside at the pub tables a bouncer "Jaime" had tripped on a stool positioned in front of our table. He used profane language and told my girlfriend that she needed to get the (sensored) out. I came back to another bouncer "escorting" my girlfriend out. She was terrified and the abusive and profane language these people were using made her fear for her safety as a 100 lb female alone vs a couple 200+ lb guys. She promptly asked for the manager to which she was told they were too busy for her. She looked up the manager "Scott" on the website from her phone and spoke with him and was told he would be with her shortly, but he was a no-show (I even left several messages and no answer). I spoke with several bouncers who told me that I could not speak with a manager unless I had a tab open. The head of security was willing to talk but offered little help except to come back tomorrow.

This place is dangerous!!! Any place that encourages and defends their position to verbally batter a sober female who is alone is going to find themselves in a very serious legal position. I will not be bringing my business here and am going to actively pursue changes in their management for the safety and perceived safety of those who come here.

I hope they read this and try to contact me... That would be the first response I've had from these people.
