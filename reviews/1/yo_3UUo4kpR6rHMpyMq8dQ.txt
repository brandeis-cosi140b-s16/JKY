TERRIBLE!! 
1st clue: Tomato sauce for salsa. 2nd clue: Dirty floors and bathrooms. 

Fajita's, what Fajita's, they just serve you 4oz of meat and a pound of onions for $17.00. look here for photo http://www.fajitasaz.com/our_menu.html where is the meat - lol...

This place is the COCOS of Mexican food, no flavor, no heat, taste like they use canned food and sauces

Take some advise and go to NANDO'S Mexican food, way way way better then this place. Don't waste your time or money on Fajita's, It's a cruel joke.

I understand it is a wonderful thought to know they cook right in front of you, but I suggest Benihana or any State Fair for that matter. The fajitas at Chili's tasted much better than this place and for much cheaper(chicken and shrimp fajitas for almost $16 or so) !!!! If you are looking for good fajitas try places like Abuelo, Chilis, On the Border, or any other Mexican restaurant but not this. This place for sure does not live up to the hype.
This place doesn't even hold a candle when compared to less known restaurants which serve better food for cheap.
