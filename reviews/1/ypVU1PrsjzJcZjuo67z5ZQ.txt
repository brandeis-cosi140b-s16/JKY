First off you have to pay for chips and salsa...what kind of Mexican restaurant charges for chips and salsa?  When you ordered the $4  chips they weren't even any. good.  the food was mediocre at best and the worst is the double charged me for my child's meal.  We asked them to take it off the bill they said no.  do not go here!!!!
