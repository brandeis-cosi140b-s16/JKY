I have a very hard time believeing this place warrants all of the high praise.  Maby the dining in experience is better.  My review is based on a catering order of breakfast burritos that my company did.  The burritos were poorly labled and was difficult to tell which ones did not have nasty chorizo in them.  The burrito I had a bite of and spat out was a salty, greasy mess.  Of course I picked a burrito with chorizo.  So glad I did not waste any calories on this.
