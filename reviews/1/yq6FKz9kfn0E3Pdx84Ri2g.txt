I didn't really care for Pure the first time we went there.  But we gave it another try tonight.  Dinner came in a matter of minutes even before we got the chips and salsa.  I tried my son's kids beef taco and the beef was horrible tasting.  The menu is over priced for Mexican food plus it's not that good.  It was also extremely hot in the restaurant.
