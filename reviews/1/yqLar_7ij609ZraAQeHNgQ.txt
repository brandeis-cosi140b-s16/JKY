What's worse than a chain taqueria with no ambiance, really bad tasting food, and rude staff? Nothing. 

I almost never eat at these big chain half-fast food restaurants. I didn't have high expectations, but I thought it would be better than taco bell. Wrong. 

The tacos I got on taco tuesday tasted terrible, and then gave me about 12 hours of food poisoning.

Go to a mom and pop taco shop and avoid this place like fire avoids water.
