I'm partially tipsy. On the strip. On a holiday. And hungry. Del Taco who serves french fries, tacos, and nachos sound like an amazing idea, right? 

But as Josh Q says, this Food Court is terrifying. The odd combination of overpriced fast food that is available in 99% of the rest of America for like 1000% less than is sold here is disgusting. 

After waiting in line for what felt like an eternity, the less than chipper young chap takes my order of 1 carne asada taco, 1 chicken asada taco and chips/cheese. You know I'm a high roller when I get the $3.00 taco! 

I wait...and wait....and wait....food finally comes out. I was really hoping they were back there slicing the carne asada to perfection for my delicious feast I was awaiting. Turns out, after one bite, it was more suited for the little doggies in Mexico. 

On the first bite of taco #1, I can't identify the meat which was room temperature. NO WAY it was steak! It was a gelatinous square chunk. The texture was one that makes me cringe when thinking about. 

So, I push the first to the side and ravenously bite into my second taco...chicken, that should be better, no? WRONG. Same texture, different color. They must have some machine that is manufacturing meat pellets, made with two different colors (yellow for chicken and brown for steak). 

Even after a few glasses of champagne and feeling what I can only describe as Ethiopian hunger...I threw that nasty stuff away! I couldn't even choke down 1 bite. 

YUCK! Del Taco, Mexican for "Trash."
