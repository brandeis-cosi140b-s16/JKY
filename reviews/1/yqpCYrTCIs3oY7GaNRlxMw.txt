While on a long road trip, I stopped at this Taco Bell in Buckeye. As I always do at Taco Bells across the country, I ordered a Vegetarian cantina power burrito, which should be just like all cantina burritos, containing Pico di gallo, guac, sour cream, lettuce and your choice of protein. In the case of the vegetarian option, this protein would be black beans. Unfortunately, it wasn't until we were many, many miles down the interstate that I was unpleasantly shocked to find that I had just paid over $5 for a grilled tortilla filled only with iceberg lettuce. It seems the employees here are perplexed by the term vegetarian. Definitely would not recommend. My lunch sucked.
