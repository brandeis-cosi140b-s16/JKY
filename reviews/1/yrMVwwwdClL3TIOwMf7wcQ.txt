Worst Mexican food!  Not sure what the other reviewers are talking about.  This is the furthest from authentic Mexican as you can get.  Everything is dry as a bone no matter how much sauce you put on it. The tortilla soup was seriously canned chicken broth, dry shredded chicken and a ton of diced avocado I guess that made it look authentic.  The staff are friendly high schoolers but have zero sense of urgency. My food and my kids food came first and we waited 10 minutes for my husbands food.  Found the server standing behind the counter joking and laughing with his friends as our food sat under the heat lamp.   The nachos with Chicken were so dry my kids would not eat them and they pretty much eat anything!  We sent them back only to be charged $2 dollars for a side of sour cream!  Are you kidding??!!The tamales were over cooked and dried out.  I mean seriously this place has such amazing potential - get the food and the service in order and it's a keeper.
