I love "mom and pop" businesses.  I love authentic Mexican food.  I don't love Papa Chevo's....I don't even like it.  From the lethargic person who took my order but did not know what some of the menu items were to the cook who kept yelling at an older employee while I waited for my order to the non-existent decor.....well, you get the picture.  And, I haven't even gotten to the food yet which was basically tasteless.  Maybe I hit it on a bad night?
