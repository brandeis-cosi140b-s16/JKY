I will never go to this place again, I would rather drive 10 miles for Mexican food than drive the 100 yards right now to filibertos. I don't understand how a Mexican food place can be out of hot sauce, and they never get an order right. And just fyi hair nets are obviously an option here because hair in your food is a regular find. If by chance they do have hot sauce and ask you how much you need you pretty much just have to say give me what you think I need because they never give you what you asked for in first place. I could go on and on but I think I've said enough about this. The 1 star rating is by default because you can't post a review without a rating.
