As the saying goes:  I've got 99 problems.  Unfortunately the flavor and heat level at Fiesta ain't even close to being one.  FC was so crowded that ye olde boy friend and I  held out hope for a Mexican experience that would put the culinary and GI horror that was El Toro out of mind.  We're still waiting for the GI results, but at this point I think we're ready to call it:  unless you want to be depressed and wallow in milquetoast mexican food, don't go here.  The ambience was fine.  It was bright and kitschy in ways I find endearing.  

Getting the order wrong and forgetting a side?  Forgivable.  
Ruining tequila with a syrupy excuse of a marguerita? bad news.  
Swapping the meats on my BFs platter? worse news.  
Unflavorful and rubbery fish tacos smothered in soggy slaw and served on a plate where everything was white:  death.  
A soggy fry job on a cimichanga: death warmed over.  

I feel like mexican food is easy to get right:  it is my go-to for home meals when I have nothing on hand.  With beans, cheese, lime juice, salt, something in the pepper family, a tomato and a tortilla -- it is easy to be great.  If you start there and possible add cumin then there is nothing you can do wrong.  I'd be happy to assist FC if they would like to develop this concept.  Until then, I'll just be over here soaking some beans and making my delicious oyster mushroom fajitas.
