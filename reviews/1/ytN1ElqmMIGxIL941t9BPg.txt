I come here EVERY week, sometimes even twice a week because it's delicious and it is close to my work. I always order the same thing (carne asada with no guac) and always see the same people working there. 

Today, I went in as usual and ordered. As I sat to wait, I noticed my receipt said no pico instead of no guac. So I asked them if they could change it. They lady said they had already made it and said word-for-word, "Since you ordered it wrong, it's not our fault and we don't have to make you another one." I did not order it wrong, and regardless, she should be more willing to please someone who visits on a regular basis. This is NOT good customer service by any means, especially considering she knows I come there all the time. 

I am very disappointed because now I have spent 6$ on a burrito that I'm not going to eat. This is my second mishap with two different locations, and I'm honestly just considering never coming to any Los Favs ever again. They used to be great with their loyal customers, but now it seems like they're just careless.
