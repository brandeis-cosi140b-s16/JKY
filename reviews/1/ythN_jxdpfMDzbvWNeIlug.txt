Wait staff.  Yea because you are going to wait a long while before you get any service and they act as if they are doing you a favor.  Sunday afternoon and the restaurant wasn't busy.  Now I know why.  Chips were stale and greasy.  Sauce was mediocre.  Wonder what bottle they got it out of.  Got up and left their attitude and crappy food behind.
