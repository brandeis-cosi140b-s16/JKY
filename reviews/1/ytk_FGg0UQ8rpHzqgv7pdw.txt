I was craving Mexican and had heard about this place from a couple of locals in Vegas. All I can say is I guess people have varying taste. I had the beef taco, chili relleno and a tamale. The beef taco was soaked in marinade, the chili relleno had zero flavor and the tamale that this place is their staple signature dish was as dry as the desert this Las Vegas town sits in. The only thing I found good here was the chips and the service. Pass on this place.
