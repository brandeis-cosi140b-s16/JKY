Went for a late night meal since Los Cerritos was closed. First time eating at the this location. The following day was filled with throwing up bial and not keeping anything down. Pins and needles in the hands and feet. Nausea and light headed. 90% sure I have food poisoning from this steak egg and cheese burrito with potatoes and beans. Never again.
