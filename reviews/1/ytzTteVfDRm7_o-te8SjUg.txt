Not a fan of this place. I stopped by in the evening to grab a quick bite for a couple of buddies and the food was over all not very good. I called the order in and the food still was not ready after 30 minutes. The condiment area was disgusting. I know that it was at the end of the day and people get lazy at closing time BUT, it's still a restaurant!

Upon getting home, I was not surprising that the to go containers were poorly packaged  - it seems that mexican food, much like chinese food is suppose to explode in the bag when you take it home. The food is what you would expect from a chain mexican joint. The food wasn't very good. If you are in the area go to Taco Juarez, the food is comparably priced and feels authentic.
