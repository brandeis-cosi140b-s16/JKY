So horribly disappointing, as per usual. Ordered 2 regular size bean and cheese burritos, a large order of chips and guac. and a Dasani water. This came to $17! A ridiculous price point for fast food Mex, but what made it worse is that the tortillas smelled like plastic. Our finger tips literally stunk like some weird chemical that was laced into the tortillas. The beans and cheese were tasteless. Which was just as well, because after I discovered the plastic smell was coming from my tortilla, I couldn't even finish. They only gave us 1 tiny salsa for 2 burritos. F'ing weird. Lastly, the chips were inedibly stale. 

I would have taken everything back and demanded my money, but it was take-out, and we were too far away when we discovered everything mentioned above. 

Hoping for a decent order at the counter place to open in it's place. A girl can dream. Until that happens, I'll just have to drive a little further to La Santisima.
