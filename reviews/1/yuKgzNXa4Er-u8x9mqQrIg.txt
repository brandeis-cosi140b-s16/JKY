Went there with my husband and 2 kids. We are of Mexican decent and in there all you see is white people. They look at you weird or you catch them looking at you and pretend they weren't. Now for our waitress, I hate when she serves us. She is so snotty and looks at us bad she seems like she has no patience for Hispanic people because once she turns around to a table with white people she is all smiles. I just feel so uncomfortable at that place that every time my husband wants to go I remember her. I gave it a last chance this weekend and still the same.  She's a white woman with green or blue eyes and red short hair.. just warning you if your Hispanic and you go there. If you are Anglo she will like you. Now for The food. . Its alright but doesn't have the real Mexican food feeling to it. The rest of the people who work there are nice and give you chips and salsa.. which I do like the salsa! Hope that if you go there you don't feel as uncomfortable as I do in there. The weird part for me is that I feel so uncomfortable in a "Mexican food"  and I'm Mexican. To be honest I do not recommend it the food is not worth going through what I did. Sorry Los compadres but I gave you many chances.
