Got violently sick 6 hrs after eating a beef taco with salsa fresca from this location last night. Im a nurse so I know how food poisoning works. I'll  never go here again. I'd give no stars if I could. I'm also not the first person to get food poisoning here... Read down the reviews. There have been others recently. 
TO THE MANAGER: food poisoning has nothing to do with how natural your food is... It have everything to do with temperature control, handling and employee hand washing . Please fix you problem before other ppl have to spend the day vomiting.
