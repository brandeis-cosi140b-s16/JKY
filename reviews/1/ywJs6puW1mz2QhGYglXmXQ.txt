My bf and I decided to try Serrano's because it is very close to where we live and based on the previously good review on Yelp. It is a hole in the wall with decent prices and good service, but the food was so BLAH! I may be biased having grown up with homemade Mexican food, but I find it very hard to make flavorless Mexican food, which this was. I had the menudo which was was neither good nor bad, until I got sick on it. My bf had a carne asada burrito which he said was "ok." We both agreed that the chips were not good at all; seriously, how many Mexican places make crappy chips? VERY few. The salsa bar was also quite sad.

Serrano's redeeming qualities are its good service, the fact that they make their food upon ordering, and its horchata. The blandness and fact that I got sick are enough to make me not eat there again though.
