Attention grouponers!  Refund your groupon and avoid this place! 

I too was part of the groupon disaster yesterday.  Calling this place a joke would be an understatement.

My group of 4 arrived there at about 10 (so an hour into the buffet service).  Already, they were out of fajitas, tortillas, fruit, and pancakes.  We picked up the scraps that were left of everything else and took a seat.  Thereafter, it took about 30 minutes-and a couple rounds of propmting our waitness-before we even received our water and memosas.  

Things then went from awful to pathetic.  The buffet line proceeded to run out of every single item at the same time.  It remained completely empty for at least 30 minutes!  So now, 90 minutes into the service, there was NO food.  It was a "no-ffet."  That's when the memosas dried up.  Although they did give us margaritas to make up for the memosas, the margaritas lacked any discernible alcohol and were overloaded with ice and margarita mix.  That aside, how do you run out of memosas 90 minutes into a 5 hour breakfast service?!?  It wasn't even like the place was busy.  While we were there, they had maybe 20 guests at max!

The worst part of all of this was the dishonestly revealed throughout this whole experience.  The groupon promised a buffet that "stretches across the restaurant."  In reality, the buffet had 8 items and fit onto maybe a 6 food table.  Even if it had food (which it didn't), it would have been a disappointment.  What was worse was that even after the "no-ffet" ran out of food, the hostess continued to sit people-providing them no warning whatsoever that there was no food.  It was almost comical to watch their complete disregard as they sat people, only to watch the people walk up to the buffet line that lacked food!  

In short, if you want a buffet that lacks food and drink, this is the place for you!  If you want what was promised in the groupon, well, you better keep dreaming.
