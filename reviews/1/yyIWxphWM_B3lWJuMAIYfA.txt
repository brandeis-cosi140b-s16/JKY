The food at Los favs used to be so good! I've been coming here for the last 6 years and I'm so disappointed in how they have gone downhill. There is a woman who works behind the counter here who is so rude. She has a constant scowl on her face no matter how nice you are to her. Tonight we went to Los favs to give it another shot (as it has been a while due to the bad attitudes) and I was so disgusted! I was 1/2 way through my favorite chorizo breakfast burrito and I took a bite and found a large piece of hair. I immediately felt sick to my stomach and stopped eating. I noticed that most of the people there wear hair nets so I can only think to contribute it to the 3 construction workers who were doing repairs to the ceiling over the food prep stations. So disappointed and sad that the level of service and food has become so subpar. They can redecorate all they want but you can't hide a bad restaurant with a coat of paint.
