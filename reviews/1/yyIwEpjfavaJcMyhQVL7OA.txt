Not a good experience. Took the family after church today. Chips were just ok, salsa was super runny, like a bowl of watered down salsa with hardly any tomatoes. Ordered fish tacos and it was the kind of fish you get in the frozen section at the grocery store, fried. Topped with a small amount of tomatoes and a little slaw, and doused with sauce. Came with refried beans that weren't tasty and a side of rice that was bland and not good. My husband got a mix of hard and soft beef tacos with the same two sides, they are kind of standard. He was not at all impressed with his food either. Got two kids meals and those were no good either. Honestly it's hard to believe how this place is staying in business. Walking out there was a couple on the sidewalk thinking about eating there who asked me how it was. I said not too good and they thanked me and kept going. Certainly won't be going back and will not give any positive reviews on this place! I hate that we spent the money we did, definitely our loss. :-(
