My boyfriend and I had been flying all day and were hungry and craving Mexican food. So we came here. First of all they gave our order to some one else on mistake (get it together people, they weren't even busy) and took sooooo long to remake it. The manager was standing right there as he noticed what was going on and didn't even apologize for the inconvenience. The rice was DISGUSTING and the beans were bland. My burrito tasted like a frozen chicken burrito. I would NOT recommend coming here. This airport has a lot of food options. So go else where!!!
