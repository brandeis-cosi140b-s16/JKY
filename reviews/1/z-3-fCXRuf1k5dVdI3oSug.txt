Being so close to Mexico, you'd think Phoenix would have some of the best Mexican food in America. So far I've found much better Mexican food in random places like Denver, Las Vegas and Florida. 

But I keep searching for some real, authentic Mexican food in my home state. 

I stumbled upon Ocho Locos thought maybe this is it.  Meh. Totally not! 

Unfortunately this place may be the worst Mexican food on earth. The guacamole at Taco Bell is much better. We've eaten here four times in two years every time thinking we just hit it on a bad day and maybe THIS time it would be better....  Finally decided there is no "better;" it's just as bad every time. From the watery salsa to the guacamole to the overly greasy and salty dishes, I have never had anything (except for their very good frozen margaritas) that is above one star. 

I've concluded that any rating above one star has got to be from people that think Del Taco and Taco Bell are Mexican food.  If this restaurant were in Mexico, Mexican officials would have had it deported years ago.
