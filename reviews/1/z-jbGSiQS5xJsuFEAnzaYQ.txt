They washed the floors while we were eating.

We stopped here at 7 on a Saturday night. I was not impressed. Their chips and salsa were some of the worst that I have ever tasted. Their burrito was average. The worst thing was as we were finishing our meal, someone came and mopped the floor next to us. This was not a spill but the nightly cleaning. The smell of Lysol was a little overpowering. I am all for cleanliness, but do it after you are closed, not while people are eating. Since we were almost finished, we left what we had remaining on our plates, paid the check and left.
