Store #020899 in Apache Junction. What a joke. I've lived in AJ for about 13 years now, and I've gone to this location plenty of times. Not one of these visits has ever resulted in a pleasant experience for me, but I like the food. However, that's to be expected when you purchase food from a fast food franchise joint that hires teens with multiple children and mid-20's adult "Juggalos" who still live with their parents and have a drop-out, 10th grade education. Tonight, 11/28/2014 resulted in a much more irritating visit than other visits. I ordered a plentiful amount, as my family was fairly hungry this evening after putting up Christmas lights. So, I get to Taco Bell, order, pay and leave, unsuspecting of a fouled order. I get home and behold... a missing taco and my daughter's beloved Cheesy Potato burrito, gone. Well, I drive back, inform the girl at the drive through about the mishap and am told it will be immediately corrected. Cool. Whatever. I kust wanna go home. Well, I get the burrito and taco and head home. Guess what! Wrong effing burrito! Back I went to finally get the correct food. By the time I got home, MY tacos were soggy, my tostada was soggy and everything else was cold. Meal... ruined. Don't go to this location unless you hate yourself.
