This place is a joke, we order carnitas and they had no flavor at all. We also order the lamb stew and its tasted like tomatoes juice, with no flavor. These are very traditional dishes with bold flavors but they missed the mark. The only thing I enjoyed was the habanero sauce I asked for to try to cover the bland taste of the food although the sauce itself was bland. If your looking for authentic this is not the place and top of it its overprice. Save your time and money and go to a mom & pop shop. (Service is excellent)
