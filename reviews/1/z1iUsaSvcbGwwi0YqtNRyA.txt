I took my family to this little restaurant because of the great reviews on yelp but this will be the first and last time I will ever go again the one good thing about the restaurant is its cleanliness but the food is tasteless, the service was a little less than average, and prices are really high. In the future I will be more careful in choosing where I go. I don't think this restaurant deserves such high reviews
