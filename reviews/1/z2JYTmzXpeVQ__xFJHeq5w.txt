Came here with the intentions of drinking margaritas and having some at least decent Mexican food. The Margaritas came in a regular glass, and my fried ice cream came in a margarita glass?? Kinda confusing. My family friends 55th birthday was today and they wouldn't serve her alcohol bc she didn't have her id, she is obviously of age. What we wanted to be a nice quick decent Mexican meal, turned into a big fat joke. Won't come back. I'm sorry!
