Gross. Another desperate attempt to eat after waiting too long. A friend told me this place is good. He must secretly hate me. This place is a joke. They should close their doors. Carnitas burrito was literally dried up nasty chopped pork with zero flavor. Zippy. Nada. It was an oversized tortilla with pork and a tiniest little bit of guacamole and like maybe a piece of a tomato. WTF are you selling as a burrito. There's a sign that says the "wait is worth it". This is what is defined as a bold faced lie. Fuck this place, DO NOT EAT HERE. It really can't be any worse. Well I guess it could.
