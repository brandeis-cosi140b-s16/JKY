Easily some of the worst food I've had in this town.

After dipping into the free salsa (read - v8 with some cilantro floaters) I asked for something spicier - and was brought huy fong cock sauce. I'm sitting there, staring at it, saying to myself, there's no way they're trying to pass this Pho condiment off as a housemade spicy salsa, but there it was, and that was the gist.

Aiight. Perhaps a beer will shroud my anger in a warm blankie of malt and hops and we can move along. Except they don't have most of the list - so I end up with a Dos Equis Lager, aka Mexican Bud. Sigh.

Fajitas were sub par and eerily sweet. Guac was olive-fading-to-bark brown, and dispensed very stingily. What did I attempt to eat? Their tortafication of a veggie burger, which despite muchos toppings, was mushy boredom. Served on waaaay too much Teleras bread. And unripe avocado, which, when put on a sammich, likes to make a run for it and squish out onto your lap/plate/shoe.

Our server was good. Poor girl. Find ye another fake-Mex place to practice your arts in cuz this one ain't gonna be here much longer.
