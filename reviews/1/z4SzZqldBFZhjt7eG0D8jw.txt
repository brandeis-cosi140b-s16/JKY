Probably the worst chipotle location I have ever been to. I'm a big fan of chipotle don't get me wrong but this location is awful.

The service is slow, the staff aren't very attentive, and the girl that made my burrito was useless. As soon as I started to open the foil wrap the burrito started falling apart. In the end it's really not that big of a deal but if I wanted a burrito bowl I would have ordered one.

Probably the worst part about this location is the wait time to get your food. The dining area is never all that busy but the line is always at least 15 to 20 mins long. The staff just move slowly plain and simple. 

I will continue to enjoy chipotle, but I don't think I will be returning to this location again, not worth it.
