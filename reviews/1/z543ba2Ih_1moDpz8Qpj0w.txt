Horrible service. I stopped in today at 6:30 pm and was greeted by a rude waitress that told us to sit anywhere with an attitude. I asked her if they sold "tejuino", a traditional Mexican beverage. The waitress responded by saying "not right now". Being that the sale of this beverage is advertised on their Facebook page, I would expect them to sell it. The fact that they weren't selling it isn't what upset me the most, it's that she didn't even tell me when they would be selling it or apologize for not having it.

With so many Mexican restaurants in Phoenix, I hope they get their act together. People will not accept rude service and will go else where
