I have been to cafe rio on Stephanie never a problem excited because this one is close to my house, ordered a cheese  enchilada and taco total confusion on line and just in general rude! Sat down enchilada was cold on the inside so I ask them to warm it and the manager took it and threw it in the trash remade it and took so long now my taco was cold so my husband takes my taco up and the the manager mumbles something rude under her breath about remaking it and when my husband ask for the manager she throws a business card at him and says that's me! The dining room is freezing! Won't go back to this one till they make some changes! They really need a new manager!
