I have lived in this area for 20 years and have never gone to this Filiberto's - my intuition told me no.

I should have listened.  But noooo....

I finally said - oh what the heck - it's right here and how bad could some carnitas and a bean burro be?  Safe...  right?  

No.

First - it's 12:30 in he afternoon when I order and the cook is nowhere to be seen.  On a lunch break?  Probably.  I'm a patient guy and he or she deserves a break - NO biggie.  So I chill and wait for a few while watching a Mexican telenovela. 

About 5-8 minutes later he starts to emerge from the back room - not too long as a break goes - so I think oh great here he comes - until he emerges from the back room with a crappy attitude.  He's scowling at the half-dozen customers lining up for lunch and mumbling under his breath.  The young lady taking orders looks horrified and mumbles something at him in Spanish and he stops ranting for a bit.  Only to do it again a short time later.  

You ask - hey what's the saving grace here??  Well, I can fully see him cooking so I feel confident he's not spitting in the food.  That's a bonus! 

I could go on and on but I'll keep this short...

My takeout is done in just a scant few minutes and I haul it home.  The bean burro sucks.  The beans taste like they are 3 days old.  Dry as a bone and taste horrible.  

The Carnitas?  Same deal - they suck.  Dry and tasteless.  

I'll stop back and try for a refund.  Yeah whatever.  I'm not holding my breath. 

And most importantly:  I'm not going back - ever - ever - ever - ever - again.  

Even more importantly - never - ever - ever -ever - go to any restaurant without consulting YELP - this could have been avoided.
