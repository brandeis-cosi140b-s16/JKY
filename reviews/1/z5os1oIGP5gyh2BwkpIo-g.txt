Service is very slow.  
The menu doesn't explain any of the items and out waitress didn't know any of the ingredients.  The salad. Only. Had 3 ingredients... All of which were not worth 15$

We ended up leaving after there was no good vegaterian options and no solution was offered. 

When we said we're were going to leave our server did Zero to change our minds. 

I give it one star because we did get chips and Salsa and the Salsa was good.  The chips were not so great.  

I would definitely never recommend this over priced place to anyone... Walk down the road to The yard house for a great menu,  healthy options and 150 beer selection.  And better prices.
