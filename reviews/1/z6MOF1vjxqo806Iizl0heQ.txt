I thought that I would try El Pollo Again. What a mistake. Only thing that could be drier than their chicken would be a dried up mud pie and that would probably taste better. Chicken was dry and the part that looked like chicken was very yellow. Tossed food in trash, and walked out only to never step foot in this or any other El Pollo Yucko again. Save your money and your health-go somewhere else.
