This is literally the worst chipotle ever. DO NOT GO HERE. I used to work at chipotle in SF and this place has no standards. I asked for 2 crunchy tacos to go (steak and drained beans and salsas, etc). I came home 10 mins later and they were mushy, DISGUSTING. I also asked for guacamole on the side and received a half empty container of guacamole. They do not understand the concept of customer service and high performance. Pathetic. I wanted to jump over the counter and show them what to do. Oh! And their beans were undercooked! Like what the ??
