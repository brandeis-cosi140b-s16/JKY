I can not even express how mad this place made me! I went there sat night April 11. We waited at the hostess stand for Ten minutes never got waited on, so we sat at the bar. The bartender told us to take the table behind us and wait for a server. We waited for another 15 minutes and nothing. We noticed two men who worked there were busy with an angry woman who was having issues with another woman giving her dirty looks... We were passed by three servers no one ever checked on us. So after we noticed a man at the hostess stand finally taking another couple to the table we walked over and I slammed my menu down and walked out. We were so disappointed, we had only heard great things and no one even wanted us to experience this. I will not recommend this to anyone... Disappointed and annoyed!
