Went in Sunday to grab a burrito and was told their rice cooker was broken... So no rice, I had to have salad as a base for my burrito.  The chicken was cold and beans undercooked.  The flavors and quality of the food are just not nearly as good as Chipotle.  This is not even a reasonable substitute, especially at this location.  Never again.
