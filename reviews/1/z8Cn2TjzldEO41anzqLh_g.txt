The food and drinks are awful. How do they stay in business? I ordered a Pina Colada that was just a small glass of chipped ice. I did not detect any alcohol in it, just some very faint coconut flavor. At happy hour that was $4.50, and normally $9.! What a ripoff. 
A friend had the buffalo wings, that he described as boiled chicken with hot sauce dumped on top. They were not marinated or cooked properly! Another friend had a chicken salad that was tasteless and mushy. Come on - how hard is it to make these basic items? (The waitress was good.) Desert Ridge has many other places - go somewhere else!
