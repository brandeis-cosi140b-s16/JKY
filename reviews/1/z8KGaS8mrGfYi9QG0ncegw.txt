Went to the Taberna Express for breakfast. The food was mediocre, but the service was bad. Ordered a breakfast burrito and coffee. Added cream and sugar to the coffee and noticed they don't have coffee stirrers. I asked the woman at the counter if they have stirrers and she said no. Then I moved to the pickup area and the counter was stacked with boxes, so there was no room to put down a bag or your coffee, or pick up your food. Later as I was finishing the coffee, I got a mouthful of grounds in my mouth. I said something about the coffee to the same woman who was now unloading the boxes in the food pickup area and she wouldn't even acknowledge that I was speaking to her even though she was standing right next to me on the client side of the counter. The staff at Taberna Express couldn't be less concerned about customers. I highly recommend trying anything else in this area of the terminal.
