1900 Mexican Grill Sucks !  I have given them time and time again to get there service together.  They never have enough waiters.  Today was the last straw after going many times to find the same bad service.  Done!  

Had to ask for my server like 3 times today, had to ask for water 4 times.  I did get my drink and it was great however, I wanted another one and then more food and the server never came back and by the time they did come to the table I was over it.  I walked out!  

HORRIBLE SERVICE, if they got there service together it could be an alright place for Mexican food.  But, really all Mexican food tastes the same, so that's not saying very much.   

Don't waste your time going here.
