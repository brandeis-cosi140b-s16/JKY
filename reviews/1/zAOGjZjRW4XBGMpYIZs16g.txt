I feel really bad writing this review - but I have to. Ok, here it goes. They have no liquor license, but their menu on the wall shows prices for beer, etc. They also do not currently serve 1/2 of the food menu on the wall but it's in bold, large letters. I don't know why they don't cover it if they're not serving it. 

First of all, the first time we went they were out of guacamole, lettuce and cilantro.
The staff was super friendly so I decided to give them another shot today. 

Today they were out of straws and medium sauce. *sigh*The salsa was good but the beans were really hard and my tortilla was burnt. I had to pay $2 extra for guacamole and there wasn't hardly any in there. 

The portion for the burrito was HUGE but the beans were hard so it wasn't super enjoyable. 

I don't think I'll be going back and to be honest, there isn't much food traffic going in there. I don't see it being open for too long.
