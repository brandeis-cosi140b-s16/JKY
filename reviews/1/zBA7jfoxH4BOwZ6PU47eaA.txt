Hadn't been here in a while, but popped in on a saturday night.  It was rainy, so there wasn't a wait time and there were two young guys working at the time.  I ordered a simple bean burrito without cheese and side order of fries.  When I pulled up to the counter, I paid.  And then the kid asked me if I wanted extra cheese on that burrito.  I smiled and said that it was no cheese please.  And he says, "oh, ok."  He had a smirk, I should have known.  

Sure enough.  Not only cheese on the burrito but, on the fries too.  Funny!   Obviously it was a joke to them..  Anybody that messes with your food and thinks its funny is obviously just a little punk @$$ B!%C#.   I'd never trust anything coming out of there again.  My last stop to this place.  I didn't even bother with trying to go back and get it fixed, I just threw it away.   Instead, I'll just let everybody know my experience and you can make your own informed choice.
