This place had such an amazing ambience and even more promising buildup as I eagerly was seated with my party way ahead of reservation time.......... Unfortunately little did I know ..... This was the peak of my evening. Overly creative menus and no investment in a cocktail menu left me puzzled and frustrated only to lean on my Negro modelo "standby" beverage w a side shot of ice water . As I sipped on my mildly cold beer and forced my stomach to indulge in some flavor challenged guacamole, I kept thinking to myself - " this has to get better."  Flavorless chicken fajitas and rubbery Camerones (shrimp) left me hating myself after I paid for my overpriced letdown. The only advice I have for anybody reading this is Lindo is down the freeway - if your Yelp motivation is to enjoy better food and less dent to your wallet.
