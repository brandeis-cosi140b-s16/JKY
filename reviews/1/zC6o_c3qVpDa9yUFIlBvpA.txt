impressed only by the fact the lady taking my order didn't seem to speak any English but did manage to cut me off each time I started talking to confirm my order wrong. I ordered one meal combo...ONE & she somehow figured out how to mess the whole thing up. it took me 3 minutes at the speaker to get her to understand what I actually wanted, which in actuality wasn't hard. just no sauce, that's all.
