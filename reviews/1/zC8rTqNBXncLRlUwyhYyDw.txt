Really a bad location and the wait staff could care less if you get served or not. It reminds me of a place that was in such a hurry to open they forgot a few of the must haves. Avoid it like the plague. Also I know many who have had their vehicles towed from parking around Dos Gringos. There is no where to park unless you're one of the first 10 patrons. Food was forgettable and the margarita gets a 1 out of 10 limes from me. Blah!
