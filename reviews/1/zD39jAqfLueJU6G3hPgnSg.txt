DON'T GO TO THIS RESTAURANT!!!!!!!!!!!    

I wish I read the reviews before I went to this place.  Chandler is in desperate need of a restaurant like this, however Rock Taco is not the place.  

I want to begin by saying that I did not try the food here, but I never had a chance to.  While sitting at the so called bar, one server finally decided to ask us what we would like to drink.  After we selected off of their specialty drink menu she then had to read the menu to figure what was in the drink so she could make it for us.  I am sorry but if the bartender has to figure out herself what is in the drink you know the drinks are not made well.  This is the last time anybody spoke to us until I flagged down a different bartender to ask for our bill.  I never even had a chance to see the menu.  None of the servers in the restaurant seemed liked they wanted to be there, attitudes were horrible.

Another problem that Rock Taco does not have a clue about is their entertainment choice they have on the patio.  If I was Kona Grill across the way I would be complaining about  #1. How loud the so called band  is.  And #2 they should be calling the animal control clinic because it sounded like somebody was strangling a cat.

I signed up on Yelp just to write this review.  Overall worst experience ever for a restaurant!
