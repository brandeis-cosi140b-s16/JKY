There aren't many places to eat where I live in Laveen, though there are two Mexican eateries, and now three close to each other (not counting Taco Bell).  

I was in the mood for a quick Mexican meal, so I went here, where I had gone months before, and remembered getting a cheese quesadilla with beans and rice on the side which I remembered being good. 

So today I returned, just requesting a cheese quesadilla.  And a side of fries, since I noticed they had them.

The quesadilla was soon ready, and they waited till the fries were done to summon me to pick up my order from the counter.   The quesadilla was sliced in several non-triangular pieces, with apparently jack cheese oozing uncontrollably from inside its soft shell.  As I ate it, it seemed to just become a congealed mess, with the soft shell not even crisped much.   The fries were plenty hot and tasty, and I wound up eating all of those and leaving more of the quesadilla behind.

So--how can you screw up a quesadilla?!?!  I mean, it's pretty basic.  I suggest trying out the other Mexican restaurants if you are local--even if it means waiting a little longer.  Life is too short to eat bad food!
