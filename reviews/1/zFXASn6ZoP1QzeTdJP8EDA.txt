I am originally from New Mexico. I haven't been back in this area for a while. Anyone who is from my neck of the woods knows that green chili runs through our veins. I was sadly disappointed with choosing to eat at Del Taco. I needed an amazing Mexican food restaurant and this was not it. :(  dun dun dun.... !
