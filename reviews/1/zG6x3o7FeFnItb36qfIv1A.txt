I visited Clarendon Kitchen twice. My first time was bad. The most tasteless, boring food I have experienced in a long time. How can anyone make a bad burger? Burnt on one side and the chips they give you pre-meal were un-edible, stale and flavorless.  I hoped it was a bad night or a fluke in the kitchen, so I deceided to give it another shot.
I had lunch 08/09/08 and it was even WORSE. The food which took forever, was just bad, it was awful. I hate to use flavorless again. But it was FLAVORLESS. Has the chef ever heard of spices? This is a Mexican restaurant, afterall. After a few bites I quit and vowed never to return. 

What a shame too since I live right across the street.
