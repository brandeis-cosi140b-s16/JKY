worst Mexican I've had... and I like the standard Tex Mex that usually all tastes the same and seems like it must be easy to get right, but I couldn't even eat this.  it's a holiday so maybe the staff wasn't the usual but beyond that even the chips weren't good, the taco shells were stale, the ladies room smelled like a dirty kitchen and the food was overall flavorless.  I never send food back (didn't tonight either) but I almost feel like I should have given them some feedback... thus the review.  oh yea the service was odd... the waitress didn't even ask us if we were ready to order. She just gave us a look... even if she didn't speak english she could have smiled or something.
