Tried it for the first time tonight, I should have just stuck with what I know. But I wanted to give them a chance. Yeah well I shouldn't have, nasty nasty and nasty. Did I say nasty? The rice was crunchy, that's new. Huge onions and peppers no problem, not cooking them yes that's a problem.  The chicken or lack there of, yeah really bland. Talk about being disappointed. I surly was, it was a fajita quesadilla which are always good usually at any Mexican restaurant, but not here. They topped it with a three cheese combination, I felt like I was eating a inside out Mexican grilled cheese sandwich. I'm so upset and I was super hungry, the best thing was the chips, and that's not something they give with take out. That's shocking, I've never ran into that before. Needless to say I will not be going back. I tried and that's it.
