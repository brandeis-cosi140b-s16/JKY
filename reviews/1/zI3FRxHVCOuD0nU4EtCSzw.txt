I would give this place no stars if I could.  This will go down as one of the worst dining/bar experiences I have ever had.  I like Sammy Hagar, I like patios and I like tequila, but there is nothing to like about this place.  Okay, maybe the patio for the simple fact that the people watching is great and it's a great location on the strip.  

I love food and I'm not ashamed of the fact that I like to get my grub on.  So, for me to leave a restaurant and NOT EAT MY FOOD really says something.  That is exactly what happened at this establishment.

A server took our drink order.  Ten minutes later, we got our water and beer.  Then, over 25 minutes went by before he came back for our food order.  No exaggeration.  All of this could have been overlooked had the server been nice (he wasn't) and/or the food been good (it wasn't).  It took an hour for us to get our order of nachos and fish tacos.  I ordered nachos because I thought, "how do you screw up nachos?"  Well, Cabo Wabo has found a way.  The nachos consisted of about 12 individual tortilla chips and each chip had this meat cheese crustiness.  The overall effect was dog food.  My nachos looked like dog food.  They had a really weird taste too.  And the fish tacos looked better but tasted equally bad.  We literally got our check and left without eating our food.  And left a 10% tip due to the bad service, even though it killed me to do it.

I enjoy a good tourist spot.  They're overpriced and a little cheesy, but sometimes I dig it.  If you want a good tourist trap, visit Margaritaville.  I've never had bad food or bad service there and that place is incredibly busy.  Oh, Sammy.  Why????
