I am so sick and tired of coming to this Mexican restaurant for a $5 burrito and not getting what I order. I order a carne asada burrito every single time I come to one of these places. And this place which happens to be right behind my house always shorts me on my  guacamole always always always.. the last time this happened I tried to bring my burrito back in return it but they would not accept it and told me that I had to buy another one. You know what after tonight I will start going to 75th Avenue and cactus to that fast food Mexican place to order Mexican food. I don't care about the convenience of being right next to my house you guys suck. If you want you can either make it up to me and buy my family dinner or I will never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever come back to your restaurant ever I promise! Give me what I pay for when I order it don't Short me and then have me eat a dry nasty onion field cilantro covered burrito with steak and no guacamole
