Okay im not one to EVER hate on chipotle but I came here today asking for a quesarito which I get at every chipotle and know how they make it at every one. So we came to this one because we just happened to be on this side of town and they presume to tell me that I dont know how its made, and they just fold the tortilla over to melt thw cheese inside my burrito but they CHARGED me for a quesadilla and a burrito? Um last time I checked im pretty sure a quesadilla was two tortillas with cheese melted inside. SO would they have charged me extra for a "quesadilla" if I would of just said I wanted melted cheese in my burrito? ON TOP of that they put my toppings in a bowl and then put them on my "quesarito" after.. and I took 3 bites into my burrito and all it consists of is lettuce. The burrito continued all the way to the bottom in layers of what I wanted on it so by the time I got to the bottom I was only eating steak. (See picture) Absolutely terrible. So disappointed and I will NEVER attend this chipotle again. Maybe they should learn from another chipotle in scottsdale how to get things right. 
I love chipotle but this is the worst managed chipotle ove ever been to from los Angeles to new york!
