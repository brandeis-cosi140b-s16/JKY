We live right down the road and frequent the place often. It's always been one of our favorites. We went and sat in the bar last week and received terrible service from the bartender. We sat at a table next to the bar. He took our order for drinks, we received our chips and then he took our meal order, all was good. I got the burger, (yes it's very good at a Mexican joint) and it was over cooked. My wife's meal was fine. It did get a bit busy and I understand that as I am in the restaurant business. If you're in the industry you know to not let customers water go empty! He finally came over and asked how everything was, as I began to tell him how my burger was he noticed that we had no drinks and interrupted me by walking off vs asking then listening. The manager on duty, can't remember her name, maybe Susan came over and asked how everything was. As I began to tell her how my burger was and that we had been waiting on drinks for a bit the bartender decided it was a good idea to confront me and say "we got busy". He and I were not having a conversation and the manger did notice his condescending and rude outburst and said she would report him. He then looked at her and said as he walked away "I will let you handle this!" Wow, extremely unprofessional. The manager apologized and was very sincere about everything. She did an amazing job making sure she could do whatever she could to please us. I commend her for that. She may be the only reason we come back but I doubt it. We have another spot we get great service at.
