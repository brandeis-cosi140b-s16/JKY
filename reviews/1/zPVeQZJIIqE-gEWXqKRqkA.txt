Located on the 5th floor of the Imperial Palace Hotel, Quesadilla looks like a mix between a Chili's and Acapulco except it has much lower quality food and lacks their own bar. They have to share with 2 other restaurants.

Food: 1/5 stars
The carne asada and carnitas meat were both dry and tasted like cardboard. The rice was bland and I think the only reason they added it to the plate was to take up room on the plate as well as your stomach if you can tolerate the taste.  If they're going to serve dry food, they should have the courtesy of giving us refills on our waters.

Service: 3/5 stars
Nothing spectacular. They weren't really friendly and didn't check on us.
