My first ... and prolly my LAST visit.

Thought I would try something new and different for dinner tonight.... (never been to a Salsaritas).

Went to the line to order. As i went down the line I ordered Steak.  The guy said "That's gonna be a little extra".  I said, " that's OK".   Then i asked for peppers and onions..... "That's gonna be a little extra".   Um,  "OK".  ......" I would also like Chips and Guac please".   He says...."OK, that's gonna be a little extra".   I said, "well, of course it is.  I would expect nothing less."  

I get to the register and ran up a $15 bill.  Looked at the small portion i got for $15 and thought to myself...."i hope this is at least somewhat good."

It was less than mediocre.  The steak was dry, the queso tasted like sanitizer, the chips were way over salted.  About the only thing that tasted good was the Sweet Tea.

Also, how can they justify $1.50 more for 1 small scoop of Saut√©ed peppers and onions.  I mean hell, you can get 1 green Pepper and 2 onions for that price at the grocery.

Basically, this is an overpriced fast food Mexican joint lacking a lot of taste to be desired.

Sorry Salsaritas. ....you better up your game for the price.
