I have tried Leticia's numerous times.  Each time I am dissatisfied. I kept going back because they are close to where I live. Finally the other evening I have really had enough bad food. I have sent back a simple burrito because the meat smelled funny.    
"Only to be told that it is the broth they cook it in" My food has been cold over and over again. The most recent experience is I was given a incorrect meal after waiting a very long time for it to arrive.  During our wait our water glasses were not filled and we were not given any extra chips. I asked to speak to manager who basically told me that there  would be no charge for my meal but my son's meal was still being charged "$20.00 for a build your own burrito". So I waited for him to eat. It was a horrible experience once again. Anyone considering going to Leticia's please look for another place to go. I am not a one time customer who had a bad experience. I am a returning customer who has always had a bad experience.
