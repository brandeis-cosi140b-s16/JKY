This place leaves A LOT to be desired! I would only go here for drinks & the spectacular view! As far as authentic Mexican food, it's terrible, and I'm Mexican! It all tastes frozen & microwaved, the service is terrible. When I want authentic Mexican, I go to the original Lindo's on Desert Inn & Eastern or Bonito Michoacan on Decatur & Twain. I will never waste my money here again!
