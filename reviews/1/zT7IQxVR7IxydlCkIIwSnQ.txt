I have been a customer of PURE since it opened in Matthews. The food has never been great. The service is substandard, but the Tres Leche' cake is fabulous. My son, who now lives in Nebraska is visiting for Thanksgiving and wanted Shrimp Tacos. I told him the food and service was horrible and that I no longer eat at PURE but he insisted. We went around 5:30pm on 11/20/2012. To be brief, there were LONG hairs in the complimentary chips. The waitress didn't even apologize for that. Our server was horrible! She constantly dug in her nose and never considered refilling our drinks. We were extremely disappointed, so we were in a hurry to leave. On the way out the "hostess" says something to the effect of "have a good night". We smiled and continued out the door. At that point she yells out "Well fine, don't say anything back!" STAY AWAY FROM THIS DISGUSTING PLACE!!!!!
