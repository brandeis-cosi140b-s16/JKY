Very rude, not deserving of our business. I called and asked for delivery and the response I got was "you're really rackin them up here!"  I didn't know what he was talking about and he explained he just got 2 previous delivery requests so "hey.. it may be a while".  I thought he was kidding but he was actually annoyed that I wanted delivery. So I hung up.  Places like this DO NOT DESERVE our business.
