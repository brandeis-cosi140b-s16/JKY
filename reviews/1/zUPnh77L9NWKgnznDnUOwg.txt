Never in my life have I experienced lack of care or knowledge. Food was OK I've had much better and much worse but the charges they don't tell you about are what kills me. They ask if you would like sour cream or guacamole but don't tell you it's an extra $3 each. That really raised the price to what a five star quality dining place and this place is no where close to that. For the birthday girl they told us they offer a  complimentary ice cream or sundae. But never completely tell you that  complimentary is actually $7.  They charged the wrong card for our order. We had a party of 16 most being kids and six are free and the book was still close to $200. I would recommend if you want good Mexican food at a good price go to ponchos on central ave in phoenix. No hidden charges there either.
