You may have been told at one time or another by old time locals that El Sombrero is "the" best Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas. Myself as a Hispanic find this to be completely false, and I strongly disagree.

I'm not sure why so many people have told me that this place is the best. It is definitely old. The exterior has lost the paint and you may have driven by it on Main St. and not even see it. Inside it is quite cramped, but that is a plus. You can chat with other dinners. It gives off that hole in the wall feel. I like the character of this place.

The food, is far below fair. I always say that if a restaurant claims to serve a certain type of food then they should be able to make the simplest staple of that type of food perfectly. Example: an Italian restaurant should be able to make a great meatball and marinara sauce. Hence, a mexican restaurant should make a great taco. If they screw up a the simplest dish, how will the rest of the entr√©es turn out?

I love tacos, so I ordered their taco dish. I was highly surprise to receive a very generic, un-freshly made tacos. The shells were the packaged hard ones you can purchase at the grocery store. The meat was ground beef with a very noticeable taco mix seasoning. There was way too much lettuce. I was very displeased.

Not sure how this place has gotten such a notable reputation. My only conclusion is that these "so called" old time locals don't really know what is good Mexican food.
