Had the worst dinning experience in my life here tonight (58 years)!  We made a reservation at approximately 11 am this morning for 7 pm tonight.  We were a party of 12.  A new, inexperienced waitress was assigned to our table.  We were aware the waitress was new and we're accepting of this small inconveinence.  We have all been in her shoes.  The food, while very good, was inconsistent in arrival and size, ex. We received three orders of guacamole all of differing size ... from 3/4c to 2 Tbsp.  An hour after ordering, our entrees began to arrive.  We then learned that half of those who order entrees w/beef would not be receiving their order because the restaurant was out of beef.  The chef/owner and an experienced waitress were confrontational and unapologetic for their poor planning and service.  They blame the new, inexperienced waitress for the entire horrid experience.  She was the only employee at the restaurant who tried to provide true customer service.  While the food appears to be inventive and flavorful, Unfortunately it was clear the chef/owner does not have a clue how to manage a restaurant or an understanding of basic customer service!  As we left, he swore at us in Spanish, those of us from Florida and Houston easily understood him.  F- for customer service!
