I gave this place one star cause zero is not an option I waited 30 minutes for a bean and cheese burrito. There is some guy with his hat on sideways just walking around the kitchen the lady at the counter was so unfriendly she just kept giving me this dirty look. When I got home the burrito I waited 30 minutes for was hard as a rock. I wonder if anyone even reads these this place is out-of-control
