Gross, unsanitary and rude staff. I returned my order. First strike was that no one was focused on the cashier stand/customer. The gentleman who finally came to ring us up had his hands in tortilla chips and then handled money - yuck. The place was dirty and the floor grungy (see photo). Next strike, when my order came - a bean and cheese burrito for $8.60- it had no toppings, as I watched them make it, and when I asked for salsa they said "we don't got none" and tried to send me on my way. I asked for a refund the manager was found and said "we have salsa now". No thanks, your dirty restaurant made me lose my appetite.
