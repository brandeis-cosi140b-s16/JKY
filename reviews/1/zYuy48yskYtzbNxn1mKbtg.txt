I have been here twice while on business on that side of town. First-shortly after they opened, and then this past week. First of, cant they smell how it reakes in this place??? Im not so sure the firewood is helping the taste any. Also I had to order something else since they were out of hot dog buns......... Seriously dont bother, you will leave stinky and disappointed.
