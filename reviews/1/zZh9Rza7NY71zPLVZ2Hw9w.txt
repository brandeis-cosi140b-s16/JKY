I have lived in phoenix all my life and seeing as mexican food is one of the main dishes here it goes without saying that i have tried numerous places both good and bad. This unfortunately was a bad one, the flour tortillas and salsa were the best thing of the 2 dishes I tried. The beans though they were creamy and smooth seriously lacked flavor of any kind the rice was also just as bland as disappointing. The chips they serve when you first sit down are ok, but they only serve 1 basket free where 99% of other places will serve you as many as want. this isn't a huge deal but it adds to the experience. All in all it was not the worst mexican food ever it just didnt meet the standard that has been set by the south phoneix classics which are Carolina's, Poncho's, and Rito's.
