Avoid if all possible. Horrible service, rude managers who talk bad about you in Spanish to everyone else thinking because your white you won't know what they are saying... Too "busy" to fix the soda machine when your the inky people in the restaurant because they are all wanting to go on break and no one will fix it (also talking about that in Spanish). We used to love coming here 3 years ago and let's just say since moving back we will never come back here.
