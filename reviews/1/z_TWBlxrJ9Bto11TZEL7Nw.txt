AWFUL!

I sent my margarita back twice and finally settled on water. I ordered some mediocre nachos, paid my bill and caught my flight. A few days later, my bank statement included one bill for the nachos, and then the waitress, without informing me, charged the 2 margaritas that i sent back to my card, as well, but on a separate bill. How deceitful! Definitely regret my experience here.
