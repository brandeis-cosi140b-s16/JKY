We utilized their catering service for a baby shower, IT WAS THE WORST SERVICE!!!!! The people were supposed to be set up by 2 P.M. they were super late. They were not ready to serve until about 3:00. They sent two girls for the catering, they couldn't even unload the supplies we had to unload everything for them. They finally got set up but the flame kept going out on their stove, so that held them back for an extra 20 minutes or so. We had about 48 guests show up and ordered food for 60 guest. The portion size for each taco was tiny and all of the guests were complaining. 

The food ran out and not all of the guests had ate. I had to run to the store to buy more meat to cook and asked the cook to make it. She got mad and said that was not part of her job even though they were still within the time they contracted to be at the baby shower. 

She also ran out of paper plates and had to supply her with our own. The server that came out was BLANCA, she was here with her daughter. I will never return to their taco shop or recommend their catering service to anyone. DO NOT USE THIS PLACE FOR CATERING SERVICE, THEY WILL BE LATE AND NOT BRING ENOUGH FOOD FOR YOUR GUESTS.
