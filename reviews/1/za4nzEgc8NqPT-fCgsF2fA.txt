Just had some take out from Qdoba Mexican Grill for the first time and last time. The food was slopped onto the plates and other items were squished into the containers. Once I arrived home to eat the food, everything ice cold. I highly recommend choosing a different place. There was young staff and what appeared to be no management there at the time. I am very disappointed with the lack of concern for quality and value. I feel bad for the franchisee that this product is being delivered to customers. They should review their strategy before more customer base is lost.
