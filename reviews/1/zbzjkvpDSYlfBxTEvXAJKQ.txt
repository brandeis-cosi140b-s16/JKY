Although I have been coming to this place for more than a decade and I love the food it's like comfort food from high school. But the last time I was in and received the worst customer service. The people that work there are rude and do not put the customer first. It makes me sad that management allows their employees to be so disrespectful and not offer quality customer service. I work for an organization that provides ALOT of business to their restaurant and now because I have had such a negative experience it saddens me that this will not be our normal lunch place. Hopefully they can read these reviews and work on their customer service and I will try them again in a few months.
