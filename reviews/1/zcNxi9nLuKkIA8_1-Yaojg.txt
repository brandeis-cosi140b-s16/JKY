Someone was in the mood for Margarita and a 30% off coupon had been dropped in our mailbox so there you have it.

Food:  nondescript, generic and messy. There's a very good reason this chain thrives deep in the Carolinas : the owners know what most people around here like (hint: it ain't real Mexican food).  Jerk chicken a Mexican signature dish ... can people even locate Mexico on a map? yeah the menu has Italian, Hawaiian, and Jamaican, what a joke. 

Margaritas: meh! Tasted like like coolaid and tequila, some of the worst margarita mix I ever had. 

Service : really bad, not just because our waiter suffered from ADD - which he did.  In a nearly empty restaurant, with a dozen employees in sight doing nothing it still took 30 minutes to get our first drink - and I had to get up and grab someone for it to happen. 

Finally the whole restaurant is an incredibly ugly mishmash of smeared walls, crude carpentry and assorted poor design choices. I'm left with nothing good to say about this restaurant.
