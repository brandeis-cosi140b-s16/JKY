This Del Taco is an absolute wreck! I understand that I am getting what I pay for and considering their tacos are under 50 cents each I am not complaining about the food. The staff on the other hand is a different story. It does not matter whether one works at Del Taco or Boeing....customer service is very important.

Every time I visit this Del Taco it never fails that these people always get my order wrong or do not give me what I asked for. I visited them yesterday for a quick dinner as it had been a long day and they are always fast in the drive-thru. My order was completely wrong and when I specifically asked for a certain sauce three times the manager failed to give it to me. No one ever speaks English and I struggle to understand what they are saying.

When I did call to complain about the service the manager accused me of not telling the truth which in turn I became livid with her. I drove back up there and showed her what she did wrong and she still had an attitude about fixing it! 

I will never go to this Del Taco again and I advise that if one seeks good customer service they avoid this place also. I will drive to the one on Tatum and Bell if I feel the need for some Del Taco!!
