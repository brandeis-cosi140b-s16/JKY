Terrible service, over priced, terrible food. Beans are out of a can. We live 1 mile a way in Summerlin and will not be back. We were really hoping it would be great So Cal Mexican Food but not so. Very noisey, tables cramped together. We kept bumping into the people next to us and they were bumping into us while eating. Robert'o for a fraction of the price is 100% better. However we enjoy sitting down and having a drink so Viva Mercado it is on Sahara and Fort Apache. 5 star service 5 star food 3 star pricing. Been there at least 50 times and every time it is consistent and amazing. We have all worked in restaurants putting ourselves through college and know the business well. It is not rocket science to make great food, served with a smile and priced correctly. This place is insulting to our intelligence. 
Never Again
