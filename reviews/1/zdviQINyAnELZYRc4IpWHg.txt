Bought one of their vouchers on Amazon what a joke.  Voucher good Monday - Friday  only in fine print.  We didn't know it at the time so we went to have lunch on a Saturday and I showed the waitress the voucher and asked if she needed to see it first and she said no that's ok I don't need it until after your meal, fine, I said ok.  You would think that if a restaurant was selling vouchers on line they would notify their staff about it and the details, but not this place.  Finished our meal and gave the waitress the voucher, she came back a few minutes latter after talking to another waitress and she said she couldn't accept the voucher because it was only good Mon - Fri, I couldn't help but laugh and I looked in the fine print and sure enough she was right.  lol Now what restaurant sells you a voucher and makes it good only Mon-Fri.  I thought since we offered to give the waitress the voucher initially and she didn't take it and at least look at, the least they could have done is accept it and apologize for the confusion, after all it's not like we were asking for a free meal it's something I paid them for already.  I thought about it and decided to give them a call a few days latter and speak to a manager and let him know how I felt about the experience we had in his restaurant.  Low and behold when I called, all I got was a recording and answering machine to leave a message.  I thought to myself how would you even make a reservation here you can't even talk to a live person on the phone lol.   It took them 3 days to call me back.  The atmosphere is your typical bar on the beach.  The menu is very limited and over priced for what they have.  The food is terrible.  I don't recommend this place.
