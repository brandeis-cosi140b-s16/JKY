I liked Chipotle at first , but after this previous experience it ruined it for me . The guy with the dreadlocks has the worst customer service I have ever seen . I was paying , and very , very low he asked me if my order was together (with someone who was ordering at the beginning of the line) . Because of his mumbling , I assumed he asked me if it was to go , and I agreed and told him yes , it's to go . He gave me my total , which was 18 dollars and some change and when I got my receipt I double checked it and saw he charged me for another bowl . I told him it was just my burrito, his attitude was very foul. Instead of trying to fix it in a positive attitude he told me as if I'm annoying him, "I asked you if it was together." And turned around to call for a manager to void the order. Being that I work in customer service , you should never make a customer feel bad , or be rude about a mistake . It ruins the entire experience . Customer service isn't for everyone , especially not for him . 
And food wasn't good...it wasn't flavorful. Definitely going to Canes or Arby's next time .
