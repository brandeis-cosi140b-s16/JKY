Went there about 4PM on Sunday afternoon 2/15/2014. Got menu's and chips but that was it. Several young ladies came by to ask if we had been helped and we told them all "no" but that didn't do any good. After watching several folks around us who came in after us get their drinks and have their orders taken we just got up and left. Won't be going back.
