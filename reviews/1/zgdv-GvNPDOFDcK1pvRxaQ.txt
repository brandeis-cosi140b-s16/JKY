I ordered three hard tacos with barbacoa and the guy behind the counter put so little meat in each taco i thought he was playing a joke on me..... he then proceeded to tell me they put 4 oz. in three tacos.. combined. I think he was short by 2 oz. it was pathetic. id hate to see what the kiddos get.. they're tacos probably don't come with meat. Sadly, i would never go back. not worth the $.
