Our food today was Discussing!! We have eaten here b4 alot....but after today, NEVER again. The rice was unflavored, less than one forth amount of beef, no cheese, barely any sour cream and no salsa! I called about the order and Chantel who said she was the manager said there was NOTHING she could do they are almost out of many things. They never said anything about that when they took my order 15 minutes earlier!  But we were told we could drive back to Cardinals stadium where there located on a game day and return the food for a refund. We absolutely did but they have lost our buisness for ever! I can't even believe they served the food the way did FLAORLESS! And if Chantel REALLY is a manager she should be FIRED!
