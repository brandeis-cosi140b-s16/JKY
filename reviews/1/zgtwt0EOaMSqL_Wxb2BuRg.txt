This was the most disappointing experience that I have had as a diner.  Sunday night is "children eat free, with a paid adult entree".   My granddaughter, who is almost eight years old, and I sat for a good ten minutes before the waiter ever said anything to us, and then he only stopped long enough to tell us he was busy...AND he had a bad attitude!  So when he took my order, I asked for two single tacos for the child.  Oh but he could not do THAT! I had to order the child's meal and then order and pay for a second ala carte taco. so, okay, fine...whatever it takes, the only thing she would eat is the two tacos!!!!!! An hour later we were STILL waiting for those two damn tacos, and my simple entree! By this time the waiter's attitude had changed to contrite, and the manager was an ASS.  A second manager, and the waiter were far more conciliatory.  As far as I am concerned bringing a child to Arriba Mexican Grill on a Sunday night is a huge mistake, even if they do offer a "Kids eat free" come on.
