Don't eat at this location. Super dirty, the guy working the window is only friendly if you're Spanish speaking. Never again.

The same guy just sprayed windex on the inside of the glass that the sides are in....without taking the sides out first. Good luck to whoever eats that. Windex carrots and everything else. Terrible this needs a health inspection
