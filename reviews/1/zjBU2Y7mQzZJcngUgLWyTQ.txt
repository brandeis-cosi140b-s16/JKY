Probably the worst burrito and bowl i have eaten in my life. I have no idea how a place this terrible get such high reviews. Ive been here twice and each time regretted why on earth i chose to. Taco bell or any fast food chain is better than what this place has to offer. Upon my first visit i tried there burrito. The tortilla they had gave me was ice cold as if it had just came out the refrigerator. It had a dry and chewy consistency, and the chicken was as bland as cardboard, i had to drown my meal in hot sauce just to eat it. The beans were extremely liquidly and after taking the first bite all fell out of the burrito ( not to mention it was poorly wrapped). The next time i came here i got a bowl, i figured theres no tortilla, they cant really mess that up but boy was i wrong, same problem with the chicken and it was still cold, i didn't even finish i had a few bites and threw it away. All i can say is that I'm never eating here again.
