I use to come here alot , till I ask for a request and the employees acts like they never done it before.  I asked the cook  if he can cook it for me, all his response is I don't know how.  Do the manager asked what I need I told him,  his response was so rude.  And he asked me who done it for me to give  the person's name so he can fire that person. I said no I'm not gonna give the name.  So I just walk away, I'm never going to that place again.
