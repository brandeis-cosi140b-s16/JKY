Do not go to this restaurant! I bought 4 ceviche tostadas for 15 dollars and they charged me 150 dollars.  After that they charged me 15 dollars more because they made a wrong calculation the first time.  

Don Poncho pretended to give me a refund electronically and gave me a fake receipt.  When I checked my balanced I was missing 150+ dollars from my checking account.  Called Don Poncho and told me that he did not know how to work the system and refused to give me back my money.  He never acknowledge that I was going to be missing 150 dollars from my checking account and was very reluctant to admit it and NEVER EVER APOLIGIZED.  I was charged an overdraft fee from my bank and Mr. Poncho said that was not his problema. Very RUDE. 
He pretended not to know what was going on and told me to go ahead and call the police. 


He told me to bring back my checking card so he could deduct another 150 dollars from my own account which made no sense to me whatsoever. He said he did not want to refund me on the spot and this is what business usually do, give you a refund.  He also refused to refund me the 15 dollars for the tostadas even though I wasted 5 hours trying to get my money back and I still do not have it. 

DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!!
