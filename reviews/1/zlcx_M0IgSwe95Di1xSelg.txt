This place has the worst ordering service ever! I don't care that they are so called, "the best tacos in town" they're just tacos! The wait is too long and you have to make different lines to order different types of meat tacos..Wtf! And people continue to go even though everyone complains about the same thing. At the end their tacos are not that great! I don't care what anyone has to say! Go to Taco Y Taco in Henderson. Now that place has amazing tacos, great service, and the place looks very upscale for the same price!
