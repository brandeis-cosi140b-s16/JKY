HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!! I will never go back. If you live in the area, and you are looking for great Mexican food try Bi-Om-Bos which is just down the street in Concord. Food at Loco Lime was bland and appeared to be heated in a microwave. Waited over a hour for this sorry excuse for dinner. Don't waste your time or money here!!!
