Went  first time on Saturday night.  Wait was at least fifteen minutes after the guys in front of us in the drive through got his food.  Ordered extra cucumbers for our shrimp, but got extra shrimp and was charged for it.  The manager actually asked for our food back so he could remove the shrimp.  What a health code violation.  Refused to give us a refund on something we did not order and a mistake on their part.  Window person was difficult to understand and she had a hard understanding us..  To me  service was zero and food was ok.    But probably won't go again  because I can get the same quality food elsewhere with people who are a lot more service oriented and customer friendly with a lot less wait.
