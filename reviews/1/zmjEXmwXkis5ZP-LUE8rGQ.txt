My visits to chipotle are always pleasant and every location I have been to has been great. Always lovely customer service, I've never had a bad experience at any chipotle. That's why today I was surprised that I felt uncomfortable during my visit. When we walked in, we waited at the front of the food assembly line like normal. We weren't acknowledged or greeted for a while even though a young lady was standing right in front of me. When she finally did stop yelling to her co workers and goofing off, she took our order. There must have been a misunderstanding between us and I was given something different than what I asked for, when she was corrected at the register she was visibly annoyed. That made me feel very unwelcome. After sitting and eating, I couldn't help but observe because the staff were so loud. They all seemed very young, and were very obnoxious, yelling immature banter back and forth through out the restaurant. Even going as far to talk about how "dirty and disgusting" the neighboring pizza place is, loud enough for everyone to hear. One thing that got my attention was that I clearly heard a young lady yell to her co workers about her employee log in code. That is not the kind of information you should be yelling in your restaurant. Luckily the wrong person (hopefully) didn't hear. I have never complained about a restaurant before, yet I felt the need to say something because I was just so put off by that experience. I have been a chipotle fan for years and of course I still will be, but not at that location.
