If you're a vegetarian, this place is great. But the few times I've eaten chicken here have made me regret it (I kept going back to try again because of all of my friends telling me how great the chicken was). The first two times, the chicken tasted a bit burnt. This past weekend, I went and ordered the chicken and I was pleasantly surprised. The chicken didn't taste bad at all. Well, two hours later, I had thrown up all of the chicken and was sick three times until about four in the morning. Thanks for the food poisoning, Chipotle.
