I just walked out of this place.  This location continues to struggle with its customer service.  I walked in and sat at the bar hoping to watch some of the game.  I sat there waiting for the bartender.  Several other wait staff looked at me several times and walked away.  No one even brought chips, you know this is usually the quickest part at a Mexican Restaurant.  Highly annoyed at this point I got up and walked out.  On my way out I let the hostess know to let her manager know that after waiting for a bit and not even being acknowledged I'm am leaving.
