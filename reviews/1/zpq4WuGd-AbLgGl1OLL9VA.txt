Not sure who runs this place, but the service is consistently the worst I've ever seen.  I've been to this location 4 times now, and it's never improved.  If anything, it's been increasingly worse.  It's as if the manager encourages and rewards their employees for being rude to their customers.  

Some of the rudest employees I've encountered, and the whole place seems to be an unfocused mess.

I've been to other Cafe Rio's that had good food and great service.  Honestly, this location is a big stain on the name of Cafe Rio.  I'm surprised someone from their corporate office hasn't pulled the plug on this place.   The entire staff needs replacing ASAP!   You kind of lose your appetite after being treated like you've ruined their entire day just by walking through the front door.
