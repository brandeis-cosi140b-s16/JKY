Service sucks...! No really it sucks. Im all about supporting local businesses but i will no longer give these folks any of my money. The cashier girl at night is very un professional,(never smiled once the whole time i was there), lazy and a little rude, I've lived in the area ten years
And have eaten here three times, two times within the last two weeks now i see why i never eat here. The food was "ok" at best i told the girl i liked the green chili chimichanga she said..Oh no i don't like the chimichangas here! I asked why she said i just don't..! Then she walked to the back and talked to to cook the whole time,it felt kind of weird because I'm a a people person and i just tried to engage in a lil conversation about the food while i was waiting but all she wanted to do was bother the cook, which caused him to take a really long time to prep my order.so i finally got her attention to tell to make my order to go..the place was empty and the tables where filthy..! (Same service same girl twice)..To the owners You need better customer service being your food is not all that great. I noticed the "cashier wanted" sign on the door so maybe hire someone who is friendly and cares about your restaurant...! GOOD LUCK  9/6/13
