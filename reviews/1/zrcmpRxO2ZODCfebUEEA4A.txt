Bland, greasy and uneventful. Had the flautas, got 3 greasy rolled tacos with a sprinkle of cheese, I had to pay extra for the guacamole and sour cream. Absolutely tasteless. Boyfriend ordered the tamale plate.. Tamales were dry and over microwaved. Will not be coming here again that's for sure. Next time I'll have Taco Bell for "authentic" Mexican.
