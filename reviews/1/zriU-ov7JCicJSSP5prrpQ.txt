Disappointing visit.  Granted we went at 12 midnight, completely sober, mind you, that shouldnt mean customers of that hour should get jipped.  We ordered a steak quesadilla, 1 hard 1 soft taco, and a 7 layer burrito. All were jipped on fillings! The tacos had maybe a half inch of combined fillings, the 7 layer burrito has definitely shrunk in size and filling is just as poor. The only great thing about it was the nice drive through gal and the plentiful amount of sauces they gave us! love the verde!!
