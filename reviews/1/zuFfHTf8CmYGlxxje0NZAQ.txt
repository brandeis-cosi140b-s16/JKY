This is about the one near Hilldale.  Awful. No stars.
 I guess we should have taken our clues form the emptiness of the restaurant and the fact happy our lasted until closing....
The margarita was a sickly peach color and was solid in the pitcher.
The plates were served with the thumb of a dirty oven mitt in the food (I'm guessing they came out of the microwave).
The enchiladas were slimy and water-logged covered in a dilute, flavorless "mole" (i wouldn't call it that.
The rice was instant and without any seasoning, not even salt,  with a couple bits of also favor less corn.  The waiter did one of those disinterested "howseverythinggoingeverythingokay" before we flagged him back to say it was inedible. We declined his offer to make it again and just received a bill for the margaritas that we also left.
On the way, when we commented on how gross the food looked as well as tasted, another dinner confirmed she would never go there again.
So we went across the road to Pascals and had real margaritas and excellent enchiladas with Mole.
Stay away!
