Ahh I really hate to do this but I don't, I have eaten at chipotle since 2007. 

I ordered a salad here, and the chefs and staff are getting this business model from food prep to cooking all wrong.

Resulting in some huge insults to my taste buds. I ordered a salad here with carnitas last Friday. The server girl notices the lettuce in container is lacking she scoops a sparse handful, then yells for more lettuce. I think great she's putting more in, my salad bowl wasn't even bedded with lettuce, nope nothing. 

I know I should've said something here but I'm way too tired to care so I don't, next comes a huge scoop of pork carnitas cool I'm down with that. Then my guacamole which actually  somehow more guacamole ends up in my bowl then lettuce. I don't figure this out till later.

The result once I blend my salad with fork is a ooey gooey non crispy mess. I take a bite....

Whoa chef were you salting the carnitas for a Mayflower voyage? Because all I tastE is salt city. 

Ok someone's over salting the pork, as I move on I find someone's over salting the guacamole too and alas that's the main flavor of my dish.

Then ewww the texture... Is more soupy then salad. Just all wrong guys so wrong.

I want to come back here but if I do I'll be that annoying bossy person when I order because if these folks can't make a salad it's likely a burrito will short circuit some brainwaves.
