They obviously don't know what a "Cheese Crisp" is 
Keyword "Crisp"
I saw them take a floor tortilla with some cheese in it and put it in the "microwave"
This isn't even how you make a quesadilla.

They boxed it up and handed it to me and I told him it was a quesadilla not a cheese crisp. 
The guy behind the counter told me they were the same thing only folded. 
So I paid over $6 for a Cheese Crisp and got a $3 quesadilla.

I won't be back.
