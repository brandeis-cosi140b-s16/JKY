I'm a northern California, transplanted Arizonan and came to visit family in Phoenix.  I was craving some real Mexican food and from reading the reviews on Yelp and also the recommendations of the person sitting next to me on the flight down here, I called for directions while waiting for my luggage and my sister and I went there for lunch.
I don't know what constitutes good Mexican food in Phoenix, but I wished we had gone to Taco Bell instead.  
We both ordered the same combination plate of shredded beef taco and tamale.  We also ordered something called queso fundido and 2 margaritas.  
First of all, the place is very festive and decorated nicely....that's really the best I can say for the restaurant.
The margarita was good, nothing spectacular, but good.  Now for the food:  Everything we ordered came all at once.  So, we got the fundido and it was served in a basket with the melted cheese in a crock on top of the flour tortillas...hmmm...where do you think that crock had been sitting before being put on top of food?  The "tacos" were dripping with grease and if there was meat inside, it was hard to find.  But the worst of the meal was what was being passed off as a tamale.  It was a chicken tamale, which where I come from (Tucson) is NOT a traditional tamale filling and the menu never mentioned it would be a chicken tamale.  It was dry and absolutely flavorless.  We had to use salt to give it some kind of flavor!  Did I mention the service was lousy too?  Couldn't wait to get out of there.
Crossing this restaurant off as a food destination when visiting Phoenix!
