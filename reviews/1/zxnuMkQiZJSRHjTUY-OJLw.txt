Over priced! Stop for a quick bite before a flight out of town. Never heard of the restaurant before and would never recommend this place now.  I was charged for the"complimentary" tortillas and guacamole - $3.95 for one person. The sirloin entree I ordered was tough and dried out, and was only about 5oz. The majority of the $17.95 entree was room temperature refried beans. Save your money and go to Taco Bell!
