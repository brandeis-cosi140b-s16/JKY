Since KoMex was closed until 27 Dec for the holidays, my buddy and I went went to Macayo for a real sit-down Mexican restaurant (instead of a fast food Mexican joint).  Big mistake as the kitchen took forever to prepare our food on account of the large group that was in the back room.  

The chips & salsa was ok, my taco, tamale, enchilada combo was ok.  Our server Melanie was nice, but I don't plan on going back to Macayo.  I'll wait until KoMex is open again or just opt for a fast food Mexican joint.
