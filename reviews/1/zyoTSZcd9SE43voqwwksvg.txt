The reason I give Pink Taco one star is because I haven't gotten a table there yet. Last weekend some friends and I decided to check it out. My boyfriend and I were pretty excited because we haven't had a chance to eat there yet, and we wanted to see if it lived up to the hype. Much to our dismay because we were a group of six we were told we wouldn't get a table until 10 pm. IT WAS 7:30! Now I realize it was a Saturday night and Pink Taco is evidently still very popular, but that is just ridiculous! Hopefully I can add on to this review in the future, but right now I'm no hurry to go back.
