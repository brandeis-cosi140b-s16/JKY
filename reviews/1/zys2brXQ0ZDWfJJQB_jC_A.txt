Once again their lousy customer service rears their ugly head.  I never would've gone back to his place, but my family decided to order food to go, which they completely messed up.  I took the food back, explained the situation and was proceeded to be argued with by the vapid "manager" who has no concept of customer service.  Here's a tip, even if the misunderstanding was the customers, is it worth the lousy $11 to NOT make it right?  To ensure a returning customer?  I have a family and lots of friends here and I make it known, this is the LAST place you ever want to get your Mexican food..not as I have said...WHEN THERE IS LIKE 10000 OTHER TACO SHOPS WITHIN JUMPING BEAN DISTANCE!!!
