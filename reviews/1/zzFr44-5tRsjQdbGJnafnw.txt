I have been four or five times and all I can say is that it is fair at best.  The tacos and burritos are very bland.  The owner makes no effort to learn who you are.  This part of town is a very neighborhood friendly place and Picante just does not fit in.  I was so excited to see this go in, however  I will be driving right past it to Chipotle.
