They use deli chicken instead of real chicken. I could not stand processed chicken,even KFC has better quality chicken than this place. "Chicken" taste like rubber. The servers were not nice at all.
Food takes a while also, the tomato salsa is basically like marinara sauce. 
The avocado salsa is good and spicy though but everything else about this place just not worth coming back.
