Definitely not impressed with this place ..... the food is terrible for the prices.  The drinks were tasty but $10/margarita gets old pretty quickly.  Four of us went for dinner and drinks on a Saturday evening, before it got busy.  We went into the main bar area and actually had to move before we got our food because there were about 20 flies just attacking our area -- it was pretty disgusting thinking that we were going to try to eat there.  We moved into the main restaurant where we were definitely happier - lower music so we could actually hear each other at dinner and no flies but the food was not good.  We started with the steak kabob appetizer and it was literally inedible - absolutely disgusting and way too rubbery.  None of us were impressed with our meals and we ended up leaving after dinner to go to TGI Fridays so we could actually eat
