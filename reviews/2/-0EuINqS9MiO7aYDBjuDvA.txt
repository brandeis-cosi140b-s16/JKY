There is nothing special about the food in this place. The atmosphere is nice and the staff is friendly, but the food menu is a bit limited, a bit small in portion size, and a bit expensive.  They have a decent mixed drink menu, and a few beers. Mixed drinks seem to come in bigger glasses than the beers.

Overall I would say the food is nothing great, there are much better Mexican places to eat in Pittsburgh, and it's a bit pricey for what it is. Wait-staff and atmosphere is nice
