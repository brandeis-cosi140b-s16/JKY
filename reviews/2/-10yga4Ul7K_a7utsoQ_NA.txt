I came here after a grueling evening swim practice so I was really hungry - which means anything should taste really good, right? I ordered the carne asada meal, and I have to say that the service was quick and the food was inexpensive. The meal I got, though, was a disappointment. The beef was very dry and tasteless and the rice was dried out, although the refried beans and the soft corn tortillas were OK. Overall, the meal was unsatisfying and I left quite a bit of the meal unfinished. I may try the place again some day as this may have been an off day for the restaurant, but for now I'll have to give it 2 stars.
