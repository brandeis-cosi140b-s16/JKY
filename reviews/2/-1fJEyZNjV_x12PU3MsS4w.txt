Overpriced and overrated. The steak was dry, the service was poor. Had to ask for a new server cause she didn't come by for 10 minutes to greet us. I watched 2 other couples get sat with chips and salsa while our table was empty. Manager comped some guacamole but that still doesn't make it okay. Drinks were expensive, rice was gross. The only part I liked which is the reason for the second star is their shrimp taco I had.
