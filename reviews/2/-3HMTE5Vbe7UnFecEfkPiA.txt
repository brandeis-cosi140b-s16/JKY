I've been here three times and I hate this place.  I keep getting dragged back here by my friends. 
Last night we went and the hostess told us it'd be an hour wait unless we want to sit in the building adjacent to the restaurant.  We figured why not? It's right next to the restaurant and it's set up like a karaoke bar.  Could be fun, right? WRONG.  I don't recommend eating in their special little room unless you're there for the karaoke.  The service is not the same as in the main restaurant area. 
It took almost 2.5 hours to eat dinner.  I was miserable. 
We were forgotten about for long stretches. Had to ask for things three or four times. 
Every other time I've been there I was brought chips, a green salsa, a brown salsa, and bean dip.  No bean dip last night.  And three empty baskets of chips for 14 people. Cups sitting empty. Waitress made no effort to remember who ordered what so when the food was delivered she was just holding it and shouting what it was and you had to speak up if it was your's. 
I got the quesa tacos and they were bad.  The shrimp were missing from them and they were dripping grease and the cheese was burnt. Waitress completely forgot my cup of fideo soup and about 10 minutes after I reminded her about it she brought out a stone-cold BOWL of fideo soup.  I just pushed it away.  Luckily she took it off the bill without me even asking.  I guess she could tell I was less than thrilled.  
I really hope I don't have to go here ever again.
