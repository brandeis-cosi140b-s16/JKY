Convenience is, indeed, the only reason to go here.  There are a surprising (surprised me, at least) lack of Mexican places within walking distance of this part of downtown Phoenix.  I work in the area, so I end up eating here once a month or so because I've been to the spots around it an exhaustive number of times, or I just really want some beans and rice on a particular day.

Said beans and rice are acceptable but don't rise above that level.  The entrees are meh.  I usually get the tacos because, again, they're generally acceptable if not great.  Like many I found service to be slow and, given that the sub-Filiberto's fast quality of what you get, I don't see any excuse for that.  It's never been particularly busy when I've gone in, so it wasn't that the staff were horribly pressed, either.

You can do better, is the bottom line, but if you REALLY want Mexican on a particular day, El Portal is...there.
