When my wife and I sat down, we were excited to try a place that had been really talked up to us. The menu looked really interesting. It had a few of our go to tacos and a few that we'd never tried before. Our server came right away. She was knowledgable and even funny. We ordered and the food came out fairly quickly. That is when the wheels fell off.  The three tacos, for which we were paying paying $16 each person, were about 1 inch in diameter. They were SMALL. This is not the "I'm an American and I want a lot of food" rant here. But the tacos were like appetizer size. The food was pretty tasty, but nothing that made me feel like "Wow this is a great tasting taco, I don't care that its thimble size!" No, it made me think, "where is the rest of the food."  The rice that came with the tacos was pretty good. But, seriously for that kind of money, I want at least regular size tacos. In Chicago, the taquerias didn't serve giant tacos, but they were a decent size. That's at least what I expected, not munchkin/dwarf tacos. 

So overall, it was kind of disappointing. Which is sad. The service was good, the place is clean the atmosphere has a great energy. But, I can't get past the fact that they are charging so much for itty bitty tacos. I left hungry and I'm not a big dude.

There is a lot of great Mexican food in Scottsdale. Blanco is good, but for the price, there is a lot better. It's too bad because I really wanted to like it.
