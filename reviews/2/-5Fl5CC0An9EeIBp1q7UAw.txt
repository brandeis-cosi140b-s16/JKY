Our first visit here was amazing. Second visit was OK. Third visit a bust. 

Third visit a fight broke out between two tables...complete with profanity and yelling. Not that it was the restaurant's fault, but it was their attitude about it that floored me. 
We were asked to be moved because I had my young teenage son with us and our family from out of town. Their response? Hmph!!! and said we would need to be put back on the waiting list (even though there were empty tables). Really? Then they said there was really nothing they could do about it. 

Yes, they eventually moved us outside, which was great except they acted like we were a huge imposition to them. Now, if this was my restaurant and a patron was being unruly and yelling/swearing I would ask them to leave out of respect for everyone else who had to listen. Honestly, I was a little scared of the group next to us as they were really getting loud and yelling profanities at another table. The restaurant? Turned a blind eye. So odd.

Once we were moved they almost forgot about us. The service was slow. They gave our dessert to another table and didn't even apologize about it. It took almost 20 minutes to get it. 

So unfortunate because the food is pretty good. But the waitresses are a bit rude. Is that suppose to be part of their bold brand? I don't know but I am not impressed. If I go back, I will sit at the bar. The bartender was great and polite. But, I doubt I would go back now. Rude. Rude. Rude. Hard to forget that kind of experience, honestly.
