We ordered a cheese quesadilla. Just cheese, no meat, veggies etc and it cost $8.25. Seriously? Worse yet, it wasn't very big. I let my husband have most of it because it was so paltry with very little cheese. We also ordered chips n queso with two drinks for a total of $18. 

Their system of ordering similar to Chipotles, going down the line where different people put various ingredients in for you. Multiple people try to take your order, no one seems to know what the other is doing and the cashier always seems confused. 

We've been here a couple times since they opened. For me, the meat tastes very sweet and the process of ordering and paying is so convoluted that we've decided it's our last trip. We will go back to Chipotles who has this process down, has better customer service and it doesn't cost as much.
