I went there and placed my order with blonde head girl after 20 minutes and watching many orders go out I then asked what happened.The cook replied that she had made my order awhile ago and appologized and quickly made my order again. My frustration is that the girl behind the counter saw me wait awhile and never questioned it.I work in afine dining establishment and rarely do orders take that long or I would question the cooks.The food was good and I will go back for a second chance
