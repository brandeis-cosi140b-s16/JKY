The service is awful. We stopped in for lunch. After being seated it took about 5 minutes for the server came over and tell us that he had to go make guacamole and he would  be "right back." About 10 minutes later his helper asked us if we wanted drinks. 5 minutes after that the server comes and doesn't even apologize but says "do you know what you want?" He takes our order. We had to ask for chips after sitting there for 20 minutes. We sit there for 30 minutes waiting for our 3 tacos to come. It was not busy at this time because it was 1:20 and the rush was over. Our waiter was nowhere in sight. No refills, just left us there. He checked on us once after the food arrived.  We had to eat fast so we could get back to work. The waiter was still  nowhere in sight so we had to go to the front to pay. The Manager on duty was there and when we inquired about why it took so long when there was no one in the restaurant she said "well it was busy." All she did was make excuses. We paid our bill and left. The food was okay if you want to pay $10 for one avocado in your guacamole. I don't feel like I need to ever return. They did not seem to value my experience at all.
