A seafood place with questionable seafood.


With scenes of watery docks, and fish leaping from the sea surface painted on the wall, you expect a seafood-centered menu, and that's exactly what you'll find here.  I went with a Shrimp Ceviche tostada and the fish tacos.  While the chips and salsa were good, I can't say the same for the rest of my meal.

The smallish shrimp served on the Ceviche tostada was flavored well enough, but unfortunately none of them were deveined.  I'm an adventurous eater, but I'm not trying to eat the last meal of each shrimp, partially digested.  I sent it back, and the waitress was nice enough to remove it from my bill.

The fish tacos were sloppy, with big pieces of lettuce and a few scattered red onions.  While the fish itself was lightly fried well, there was little flavor and an odd texture to it.  

The service was fine, but the product is lacking.  I can't see returning here with all the other options to explore in Las Vegas.
