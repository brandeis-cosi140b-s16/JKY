Serrano's is to Mexican food as Friday's is to American food.

That is to say Beans and Rice are to French Fries as Corona is to Budweiser.

What I mean is Chimichanga is to Cheeseburger as Salsa and Chips is to Bread and Butter.

So you have Quesadilla to Pizza as Margarita to Cosmopolitan.

In summary, Two stars is to restaurant ratings as Die Hard is to movies.  

It'll get the job done but it won't be memorable or soon repeated.
