I usually give good reviews of course but IMHO it's my first time to try this place and it's no bueno i had the chichen chimichanga with rice.  Chimi was dry and rice was not hot not warm. But a lil cold.   I only had like 3 bites and that's it. Water tastes like bleh. 
 My daughter didn't like it either.  So no stars this time .  maybe 2 stars for the friendly staff and the presentation.  . 
I'll give it another chance though I'll maybe come back to try their tacos.
