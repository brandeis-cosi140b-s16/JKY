I have visited this place a few times now, a couple of times not so sober and I remember it was good then...

More recently I went back during lunch and the expeirence was not so stellar. The carne asada i got on my tacos had huge chucks of fat on them, I get trying to cut corners but if tacos jsut come with meat and tortilla make sure the meat is good. It was a bad experience, I guess I should go back to see if it was a fluke but don't really wanna watse a lunch when there are so many other good options out there. 

Only good point it that it is cheap but you get what you pay for here, fat tacos not carne asada.
