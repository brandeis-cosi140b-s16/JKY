Since my last review things have changed...

They no longer have the 99 cent burrito on Wednesday. It is now $1.50 bean and cheese jr burrito, and it's only this location that has changed. So now the burrito is tiny and you pay more. They also used to have Saturday and Sunday kids meal special but got rid of them because kids weren't getting them, adults were... Seriously, does that even matter? Anyway, it seems like new management has taken over and decided to change everything. I don't know, all I do know is that they prices went up and the food items got smaller. It doesn't seem like the same place my husband and I went to almost every Wednesday for 5 years...
