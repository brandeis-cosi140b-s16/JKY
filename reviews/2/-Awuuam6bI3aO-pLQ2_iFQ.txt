Good food + weak shaty service= dos
Stars. 

Heard this spot was good and wanted to try it out. Went there for lunch on a Thursday and sat in the patio area. After waiting 15 minutes a server graced us with his presence. 

For some reason, while they serve carne asada tacos, they lack the technology to offer carne asada burros on the menu.

For anyone not familiar with burro 101, here are the required steps in creating a burro. 
1. Tortilla (sometimes called a "wrap", but only by gavachos)
2. Filling (meat, veggies, fiberglass, etc)

In looking at the menu, they have all
The prereqs to make my dreams come true. 

Fast forward to lunch arriving, it was good, but my burro was covered in red sauce. Weird that the server didn't think to ask if I was good with that?

This is going no where quickly, so allow me to land the plane. 

PROs 
-Good food
-Decent atmosphere

CONs
-Slow service
-Like chips? Expect to pay for anything above one serving. Since it takes so long to get your food- you really have no choice but to survive on chips and sugar packets. 
-Slow service
-High prices for what you get. I can see paying for chips if it's a little taco
Stand, but this place is a bit pricey to
Have to pay for chips.
