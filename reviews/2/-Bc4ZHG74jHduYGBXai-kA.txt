You do realize that this isn't the pool at Mandalay? And you realize, on Monday, you will have to go back to the cash register and US Magazine? And really, you thought it would be a good idea to get a tattoo of your dog on your shoulder?...next to the tribal swirl? 

All questions I didn't ask, but did wonder, while at Spanish Fly. 

If you want to hang out at or near a pool with Scottsdale's "finest", well this is the place. It is presently Exhibit A. 

Of course, at night, stay out of that pool! No, I am serious, they will physically take you out if need be. But, during the day, you and dog tattoo boy can hang out in the water all day. 

The service is friendly, well minus the typical Scottsdale door people, who generally fail, as always, to remember that they are not working the new hot club in LA or NYC (come on people, South Park makes fun of Scottsdale!!). 

Oddly, at night (because of the pool I presume), you need to sign a waiver...I will leave it aside as to whether that waiver would ever hold up in court. 

The drinks run the norm, but I've never had the food, however I did see someone carrying out sushi rolls to a table in the 100 degree heat...ummm, no thanks. The DJs...ehhh, the usual, but better than Drift. 

If you want to see 20 somethings in bikinis, a few cougars on the prowl, high rise baseball hats, shorts and high tops, and really bad tattoos...plus catch some water and sun, this is a good spot. 

It is worth a 30 minute show if there is no cover, but it is hard to swallow as an afternoon hang out, and I would never pay to get in.
