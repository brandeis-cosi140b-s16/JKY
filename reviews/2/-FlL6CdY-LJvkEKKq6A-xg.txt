Went for the first time last night and I have to say... I am not a fan. I went with a friend of mine and when we first arrived they said it would be an hour in a half wait. We decided to put our name in and go sit at the bar (and if we got tired of waiting we would just go somewhere else). We ordered our first drinks. I bought the house margarita... and it was one of the worst tasting margaritas I have ever had. Normally with margaritas they are to sour... but this margarita tasted like straight tequila. I asked them to add some sour mix and the bartender looked at me like I had 10 heads (and he didnt do it). He pretended not to hear me. We only had to wait about an hour to be seated. The ambiance of the restaurant is great. The service was great as well. But the food was so so. The guacamole is tasteless and they give these crazy homemade tortilla looking hollow disks. When I tried to break the tortilla up, it just crumbled into crumbs. It was nearly impossible to eat the guac with these things. All I wanted was some real chips. I ended up getting beer battered fish tacos and they were decent... just not wonderful. The portion size was decent. Overall... I wont be going back anytime soon. I am sure that there are better mexican restaurants in the area.
