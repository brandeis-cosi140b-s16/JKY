The service was pretty terrible. Food was average. My office will have qdoba catered and I usually enjoy it, but dinning at this location was a pretty subpar experience. Staff was clearly agitated and not very friendly. Perhaps this was just a blemish at the location. If we are comparing it to chipotle, I would still rank chipotle higher. Service is better and so is the food.
