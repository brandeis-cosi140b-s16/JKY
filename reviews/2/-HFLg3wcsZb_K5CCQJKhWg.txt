On the naughty list

I can't really express myself here the full extent. 
What I will tell you is that the tacos are over $2.00 each, they taste better at Pepes Tacos.

The location is horrible there are always people panhandling, or wanting to sell you something while you are trying to eat. 

The staff is really slow, they don't pay attention to orders. I asked for one thing they gave me another. 

They over charged me and didn't give a proper refund. 

Overall the inside looks dirty, just like the one on Easter Ave. 
The owner if Roberto Robledo, who is the owner of the Eastern, Durango, and a few more, So far the only location I can recommend is Warm Springs and Durango.
