If I were rating on food alone, I would rate David's 4 stars...but I'm not.  I have ordered delivery from David's 4 times, and EVERY SINGLE TIME they've gotten something wrong!  My boyfriend and I always order ranch with our French fries, and the second time we ordered, they left out the ranch.  So, the next time we ordered, I specifically mentioned the ranch and the fact that they'd forgotten it before, and I asked them to please remember it this time.  Was it in the bag??  No!  Another time, I ordered a breakfast burrito and specifically asked for sour cream and salsa and told them to be sure not to forget it...and they forgot it!!  I call and complain, and the person I talk to sounds like he's 20 years old and couldn't care less that I'm complaining.  I did get a credit once, but no other time has it been mentioned.  

It's a shame that the delivery service sucks so bad because the food is actually very good.  Their burgers are great, and their milkshakes are to die for.  But, next time I order delivery, I'm going to tell them that, if they mess anything up, I am never ordering from them again.  Four times in a row screwing it up is just ridiculous.  This is delivery food, not rocket science.
