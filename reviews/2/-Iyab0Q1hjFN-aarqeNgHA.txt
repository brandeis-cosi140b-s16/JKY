dissapointed!!! since i have been in the restaurant management side of it for over 30+ years!!! i do not like to give bad reviews!!! well, i knew that the sirrine family had sold the mckellips location, and i forgot about the fire that they had there! ate and mesa dr. and university years ago right after the "new" owners took over, and it was wonderful! well, went to baseline before it shut down and wonderful again! well, went to the "hacienda", and i can tell some things - canned chicken was in use! the "roasted corn", was the herdez frozen mix, and just plain dissapointed!!! son ordered dos xx beer on tap, and came out warm!!!  on the wonderful side - green salsa at the table with wonderful chips were awesome!!! the male server was only back to check on us twice!!!! not good!!! - the manager(s) did not even "table touch" to see if something was wrong!!!! for being "prime time dinner time" at 6:30 pm, there was one table being used outside, and about six tables in use!!! - was it the democratic debate on cnn??? - my guess not! i could list more, but that is not my style! i like to be happy about where i go, and it will never be hacienda de rosa's again!!!
