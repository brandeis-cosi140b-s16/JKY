Marginal at best. 

I expected great things based on the Yelp reviews and from asking locals.  What a disappointment.  I was not turned off by the dated decor; it's rather charming in its own funky way.  Besides, you get some of the best Mexican food at the no-frills places.  However, this food was sub par.  The salsa was watery and I could have made the enchiladas much better myself.  Also, I was less than impressed with my margaritas.  I tried two different varieties to be sure :) but that was a waste.  Absolutely nothing stood out about this place.  

Where, oh where is the great Mexican food in Phoenix/Scottsdale?
