So I came here for lunch with my husband, and wanted to check this place out after hearing they had good Tripa Tacos.  I already had a feeling it wasn't going to be that great, but what the heck, I always pick where we go so I let him have it ;) The dining area is nice! Very clean and well maintained it definitely has that Mexican feel to it with the curios and Spanish tile layout on the walls. The girl working the counter was very friendly!  I ordered a carne asada burrito w/ side of rice and my husband had 2 tripa tacos and 2 chicken tacos. As we waited, we were given chips and salsa! Oh gosh! The tortilla chips tasted like that "fridge" taste, when you put something in the fridge and dont cover it up well! *barf* how hard is it for a Mexican place to get a dam tortilla chip to taste right?!!! The salsa however was really good! Chunky but NOT spicy! Not even a kick! I asked the girl if there was a more spicy salsa and said they dont have any!! What the He11!! A mexican place that doesnt serve HOT salsa?? That is just WRONG & UNAUTHENTIC!! We finally got our food, pretty quickly. I looked at my husbands tacos and they just looked so sad and empty. Barely any tripa in the dam taco! Then his chicken tacos had lettuce and tomoatoes!! WTF!! Lettuce and tomato?? Thats some crap you see at Taco Bell! We were expecting cilantro, onions and cabbage! Not this crap! Then my burrito was kinda small, the torilla was really good it tasted homemade and was warm. The carne was super small cut up it looked like lengua. It was upsetting! Right on the menu it says AUTHENTIC. Bullcrap! Your better off going to Filibertos or Los Favs which arent even authentic but better than this!
