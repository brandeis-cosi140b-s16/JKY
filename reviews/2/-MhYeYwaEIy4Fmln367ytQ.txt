I'm a Chipotle person, so for whatever reason, they were closed early, and decided to give Baja a try.  I ordered some spicy chicken nacho burrito thing that was suppose to be full of zip.  They hand you a small bag o chips and then you wait for your number to be called.  I got the burrito.  Flavor is lacking, and the zip is suppose to come from the peppers in the burrito-- that's it, the problem is there is more rice and beans in the thing than anything and the chicken had little flavor.  To make matters worse, the place has 4 or 5 televisions playing Fox news.  Yuckoo, I wonder what political party this place caters too.  Politics aside, I don't care for the food, the business model, or the decor.
