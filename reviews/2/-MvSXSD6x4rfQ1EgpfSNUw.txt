I got to say this is probably the most accurate 3 star overall rating I've seen on Yelp in some time. I'm proud of you Phoenicians!
This place was simply meh, especially given the huge amount of delicious mexican food places in AZ where you can get a kick ass margarita for a whole lot less than $10. We ordered a couple drinks and were disappointed with all of them; consensus was that they were all too sweet and not enough tequila, the sangria tasted like juice for peets sake. The chips are a nice thicker version however the salsa is thin and flavorless. Roast those tomatoes or something, throw in some heat! Their guacamole, although a decent flavor profile, needed a lot more lime and was super blended to the texture of those nasty avocado 'dips' you find next to french onion and ranch plastic containers. We all ordered tacos of various types for dinner, I had the roasted veggie ones with a hard shell. Man these were no good. The veggies were really oily from their saute and were used sparingly; the bottom of the tacos was cabbage. Honestly, the only good thing I ate tonight was the black beans, abet a bit salty. I will say our server was very friendly however the food just don't hold water to the prices. Try Tia Rosas in Mesa for some excellent mexican food and margaritas worth their $8 and more in tequila.
