It saddens me to only give Macayos 2 stars but other than chunky salsa and customer service, there is just no point in expecting decent Mexican food from here. 
My last 2 experiences have severely disappointed me.  The food comes out pretty fast, so fast that you question when it was cooked. 
On my most recent visit I ordered the enchilada sampler. This comes with a green spicy chicken enchilada, a ranchero enchilada, and a plain cheese classic one. 
I took a bite of each and was pretty much ready to leave. 
There is just no authenticity to this food at all. I use to come here as a kid, but I wouldn't even bring my own kid here these days. It wasn't the worst, but I think all and all this place just needs a makeover. Their days may be numbered on the east side if they don't figure it out soon.
