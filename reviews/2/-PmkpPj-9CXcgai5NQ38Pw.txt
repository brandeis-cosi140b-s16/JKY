Not sure what all the rage is about this place.  Probably one of the worst margaritas I've had. Also the food portion is HUGE! No one can possibly eat all that. And in terms of taste, thought it was bland.  Didn't even enjoy the chips and salsa.  Overall I would say sub-par in my book. Kinda of a hole-in-the-wall, maybe that's the draw for some people.
