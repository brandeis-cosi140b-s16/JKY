This place is right around the corner from Gangplank, where I work. A few of us will go there for a quick and cheap bite to eat every now and again, but I usually regret it.  The food is extremely salty, beyond being "over seasoned". The employees aren't especially friendly, although there is definitely a family owned atmosphere. 

I get the impression that this is the kind of place that people in the area have been going to for a while and after so many years they are able to explain away its flaws.

From other reviews and talking to co-workers it sounds like they've got good breakfast burrito options, but I've never been for breakfast so I can't comment.

The one redeeming dish is the shredded beef taco combo, however it's not too consistent so you have to get lucky.
