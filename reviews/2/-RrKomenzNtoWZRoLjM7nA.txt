Located in Downtown Henderson, ok so not the swankiest joint in the Valley. And would it have killed the woman behind the counter to stop yapping on the phone for 10 seconds to answer my question? And maybe a little salsa with my quesadilla? everything here was ok, just ok, but they seam to be winning a one man race as there were no other restaurants in sight. Life's too short and the Vally too big for ok Mexican food. Live it up you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!
