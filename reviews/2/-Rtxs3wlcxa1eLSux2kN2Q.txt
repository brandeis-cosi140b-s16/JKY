Not really impressed. Food was below average, in my opinion. Chips were just extra greasy, salsa watered down, meals without much taste. Yes, the patio is pretty cool and I imagine that on a busy night this is the place to be, but really, not impressed.

Could be because I had a 13 hour workday, still had food poisoning, and just wanted to be home instead of off for business, but this didn't really make my mood change for the better. Guess that if I was boozing it up it'd be more fun, but then again, what place isn't more fun while boozing it up?
