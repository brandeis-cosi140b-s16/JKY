We had a restaurants.com gift card and we saw this restaurant listed on their website. We decided to try it out. The food was good although I ordered a chicken burrito and I was given chicken enchiladas. I was too hungry to send it back. When it came time to pay we were told we couldn't use the restaurants.com gift card because the lady that knew how to redeem them wasn't there. Lucky for us we had money to cover the bill. We tried to go back another time to use the gift card and we were told they won't accept it. They are still listed on restaurants.com that they accept it. I exchanged my card to use at another place and I won't be coming back here.
