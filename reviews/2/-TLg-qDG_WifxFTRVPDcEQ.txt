Where do I start?  With the jarred salsa?  The crappy overly salted, thick chips?  The plastic plates?  The fact that they ask you when you order how you'll pay and then take your credit card up front?

NOTHING in this place was made here, it was all from a can, jar or bag.  Plus I had to listen to and watch Motley Crue the entire time.  What a total waste of calories.  Although it was happy hour and 3 of us walked out for $30 I'd much rather have better food.  WOW - this Mexican place really knows how to suck the flavor out of food.....
