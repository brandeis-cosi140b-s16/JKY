My husband and I had a Groupon for this restaurant and decided to give it a try since we were new to the Vegas area. 

We were sorely disappointed when everything we ordered was significantly lacking in flavor. I don't even think salt was used on any of the dishes. Tapas are supposed to be packed with taste-bud tickling flavors and that is definitely not what we received.

I will continue to go to Firefly on Sahara instead.
