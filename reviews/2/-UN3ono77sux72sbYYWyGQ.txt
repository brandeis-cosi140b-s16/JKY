I love Three Amigos, so I was excited to try Sabor.  The location is nice, but I have no reason to go back.  If a Mexican restaurant doesn't have good salsa, I'm not confident about the rest of the food.  At Sabor, they have a Salsa Bar, a la Phat Buritto, which I abhor.  For the salsa, they only have tiny paper cups, which are near impossible to dip chips in.  For dinner, I was eager to try their version of Mexican corn on the cob,  but they had run out of it earlier in the evening.  (It was only 7:30-8pm when I was there)  I ordered a Papusia instead, only to be shot down again, as this menu item was 86 as well.  I was able to get 2 Carne Asida tacos authenicos.  I assuemed wrong that I would be able to get them just as I like them at Three Amigos, but once again had to lower my expectations.  I like Queso Fresco sprinkled on my tacos, but the man taking my order said they "didn't carry any cheese" except for parmesian, which last time I checked was Italian?  How does a Mexican restaurant not have cheese?  
The counter staff were all very friendly, and the man taking my order was very apologetic for the items I ordered that they were out of.  No need to go back, Three Amigos is closer to me, more charming, and heads and tails above their new sibling restaurant Sabor.
