Aunt Chilada's s simply put, just OK.  They have a pretty big menu, but I don't know that I would say they have a speciality.  The nice thing about AC's is that they have a big patio area and they are great for larger groups.  So if you are looking to sneak away for a long lunch in the sun on a spring day or if you have your office lunch (we take our new hires here) and need the space, then come here.  

Now, if you are looking for some great full flavored Mexican, then keep on looking.  The chips and salsa are good here and after that, everything kind of blends in as the typical mexican.
