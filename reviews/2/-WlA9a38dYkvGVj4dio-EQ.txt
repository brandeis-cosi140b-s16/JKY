Loved this Joint... Love No More... !
They have changer everything, the only Buffet they have available now is the Hot-Dog Buffet, with only ONE choice of Dog... they used to have at least 8 choices of Weiner's, Brats, Smoked Sausages, Dog's from New York, Chicago...etc... it ROCKED..!!!  they still have Sandwiches a-la-carte... No more Prime Rib or Crab Legs... 
they used to have a soft-serve Ice Cream that was part of the Buffet's, no more, now thy have a glassed in Ice Cream freezer with scoops you can purchase... 

Hey it's not bad but it's NOT G's anymore..!!! call it something else...
 
I'm not going back ...they didn't honour my "Yelp Deal"  that I bought for $10 that buys you a coupon for $20 worth of food from G's... I believe that legally they have to take the "Yelp Deals"...
we paid the bill with cash and said Adi√≥s to the Cook... 

I don't expect them to survive for very long unless they go back to the G's we all know and Love... 

If it Ain't broke don't break-it... :(
