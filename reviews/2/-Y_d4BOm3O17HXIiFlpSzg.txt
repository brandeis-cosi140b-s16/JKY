Spotty.....While I find their menu good to explore, the service doesn't meet the standard.  We have been on numerous occasions and it is the continuous downside.  They are friendly, for the most part, but just not prepared for the rush. We waited extensively for every portion of our visit from being seated to paying the tab. To get their attention we actually stood up and waited for someone to bring our check and box for carry.  I also think $36 for two adults and one child at lunch (two appetizers and one child's meal) is a over priced, but we expected it beings they draw from the Boulders Resort crowd and is priced at that rate.  If you go, know they are not open for lunch during the week. Maybe only on Sunday and it would be in your best interest to have a reservation, especially if you want to sit on the quaint and small outdoor patio.  We like their gau and the chicken taquitos are incredible.
