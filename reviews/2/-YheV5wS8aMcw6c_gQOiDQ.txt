The only thing that this Los Dos Molinos has in common with the Los Dos Molinos in Ahwatukee is the name. 

The decor in this location is far more upscale - like a day at the ranch meets Dia de Muertos. We sat at a nice table in the back and immediately received a basket of fresh chips with green and red "holy f#%k that is hot" salsa. The other location served us bag chips but with a lot more palatable salsa.

To make a direct comparison between locations I ordered the exact same thing, a chicken burro with a side of rice. The difference was huge, literally. The burro I received in Ahwatukee was the size of a swaddled baby whereas this one was at a minimum half the size. It was still a big enough portion for a typical adult, but I sure didn't need a doggy bag. My rice on the side was over cooked and crunchy. Because the salsa was so unnecessarily hot I did not want to use it on my food even though it kind of needed it. My husband's adovada ribs were delicious but he did not receive too much meat on his plate. We ended the meal with some sopapillas which were quite tasty. 

Service was extraordinarily attentive at times but then we went through periods of being ignored. I am not sure that this place is worth a revisit. 2.5 stars.
