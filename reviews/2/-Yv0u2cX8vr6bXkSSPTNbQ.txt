I have been here a few times and it was just ok. The last time I went it was horrible. It was a slow night and they sit us all the way in the back, the table was so short after we were done bumping are legs into the table getting in the booth the table is right on your lap, we asked to be moved and we got a table an inch higher. The food was substandard. The service was non existent. I prefer the old Rio Mirage for sure.
