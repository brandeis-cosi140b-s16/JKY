Food was decent, chips and salsa were good! The bartender was an ass though, we are waiting for a table for 7 so sat at the bar while waiting. I put my players card into the video poker machine, order a maggie and am getting ready to put money in when she puts the drink down and says $8.50? I'm gambling, isn't the drink free? No, you haven't put your money in yet so you have to pay for it, I said no thanks! I will put my money in and order another, she says whatever and gives me stink eye the rest of the night? Oh well they should hire cute friendly bartenders rather than a skanky short hair bleach blond with a bad attitude.
