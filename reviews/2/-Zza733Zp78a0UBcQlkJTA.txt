Compared to Chipotle it doesn't hold a candle. There was no option of brown rice, only white rice. Also less topping options than Chipotle. Ordered chips and queso, cheese was a yellow-ish colored queso which I don't like and the chips were incredibly salty. Service was slow seeing how there were only 2 people ahead of me.
