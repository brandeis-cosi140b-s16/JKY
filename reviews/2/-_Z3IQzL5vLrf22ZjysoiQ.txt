Service was great, food was so-so.  I always order the same thing when I hit a new Mexican Food restaurant.  Chicken taco with rice and beans.  I figure that its easy, but easy to mess up.  If they get that right, its worth a repeat visit.  The only good thing about the tacos was that the veggies were fresh and the taco shell wasn't store bought.   The "shredded chicken" actually resembled chicken mush.  It was wet, which made the taco fall apart and the chicken itself had no flavor whatsoever.  The beans and rice were ok.   I will come back and try something else, just nothing with chicken.
