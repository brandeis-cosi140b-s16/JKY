Order: jade red chicken, chile relleno, jerk fried rice and black beans = $8

Looked good in pics but not tasty. The only item that was hot off the grill was the chile relleno. Chile relleno crust was too thick (took it off) and just ate the small chile stuffed with cheese in the middle. Rice and red chicken was dry, tasted like been sitting out for awhile wasn't even warm.

Not sure if the quality has gone down since food network gave it all the hype...but as a first timer I don't plan on coming back, nothing stood out. I would rather eat Panda Express and Taco Bell together
