Chicken tacos were okay but oh man  the steak tacos ,smelled so weird and tasted disgusting, I had to throw my tacos away :( haa. I called in to complain about my tacos and the manager said they probably smelled because if you don't ask they always cook the steak medium rare.... still don't get why they would smell but okay... so people if you must eat a steak anything from there make sure to order it fully cooked. Good luck !;)
