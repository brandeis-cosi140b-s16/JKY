Why thank you Luxor, I would love to have 2 for 1 Dos Equis!
Why thank you bartender, for getting our two tasty beers!  Can you tell me how much it would be for just one of these for after our coupon beers are done?  I'm sorry, what?  You can't have said $7 for a Dos Equis, I surely misheard as we both know that I could buy a full six pack for that, and that's one hell of an up-charge even for Vegas.  Oh....that is what you said.  Whelp, I guess we're out of here and we'll see you back at happy hour when you have $5 sangria.
