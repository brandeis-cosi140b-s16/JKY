Went for lunch today and never got my order.  After 20 minutes of waiting and watching three groups after us get their orders, I went up to ask about my food.  My colleague already got his order (we ordered together and I paid for the entire order), but mine somehow "disappeared".  I was told they were really busy and that one of their employees had left.  Usually their food is pretty good, but they didn't seem to care about service at all.  I never got my food...my colleague had finished and we had to get back to work.  I asked for my money back, and when I got back to the office realized they shorted me 57 cents.  I WILL NOT GO BACK!!
