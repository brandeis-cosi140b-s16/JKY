I went here last night slummin'.  Uh huh, that's right, I said it.  

This is not the go to place for authentic Mexican food, by now most people know this.  It's what many would call "Americanized."  I had the enchiladas suiza.  One with cheese, one with spinach.  The flavors appealed to the "fat American who likes cheese" in me.  The freezer burned spinach with crunchy leaf stems was not so pleasing however.  

I wasn't overly offended by anything, because I went in here knowing it would be mediocre Americanized Mexican food complete with kitschy  decor.  

Bonuses of the night included well, not much, but hey, the waitress was hot.
