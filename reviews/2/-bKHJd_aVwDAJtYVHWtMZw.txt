How anyone can think this is good Mexican baffles me.  The food was mediocre at best.  The server highly recommended the guac dip so we got it.  When he asked how we liked it I told him it was just barely "ok" and he didn't know what to say.  A professional in a class restaurant would have tried to fix our concern.  Most mom & pop Mexican restaurants in the Chicago suburbs would blow this place away.  The food is nothing special and is over priced.  The service was poor.
