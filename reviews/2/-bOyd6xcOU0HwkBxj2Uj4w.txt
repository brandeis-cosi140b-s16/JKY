I grew up in Phoenix and used to go to Macayo's on Central a lot  for special occasions.  it was an event back then. So I was excited when they built one out in Surprise.  We used to eat there a lot when they first opened.  However, over time, the service, cleanliness and quality of the meal decreased.  We haven't been back in more than a year now.
