The night before we were to leave on vacation, we decided not to cook dinner. So, we thought of Chipotle on Shea. I used the Chipotle app on my iPhone to order two burritos.
 
Drove over and picked up our dinner and headed home. When my wife cut into her burrito, it wasn't what she ordered. I wasn't going to drive 13 miles to have it changed. She couldn't eat the rice and sour cream. She scraped all of that stuff off.

I called Chipotle and talked to the manager he was gracious enough to make up for the mistake the next time I showed up. I just want to make sure this doesn't happen to anyone else.

I love their food and the only reason why I'm giving them two stars is because 'I've experienced better' from them.

The next time I go there, I'll watch them make my meals.Forget about ordering on the phone.
