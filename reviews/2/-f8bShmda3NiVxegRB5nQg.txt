Since we were in the area, my friend and I decided to eat here again. This time I tried the Chicken Enchilada Nachos. They sounded like they would be tasty from the menu description. My expectation was that the chicken would be shredded, since that's how it always is in enchiladas. Instead, there were little cubes of dried out chicken. I expected some enchilada sauce to be mixed in with the chicken, but instead the nachos were a wet, greasy mess. Enchilada sauce had been dumped over all of the chips. I ate about a quarter of the food. That was all I could stomach. I ended up having a "sour" stomach for nearly three hours after the meal.

My friend had what she always has - the Big Daddy burrito. She loves it. When it came, it was obviously smaller than what it had been in the past. She stated that they must have changed the recipe because it just didn't taste the same. In the past, they always had brought a small plate with sour cream and lettuce on it, too. She asked to speak to the manager who came over after we had completed the meal.

The manager insisted that there hadn't been any change to the recipe and that the burrito had never come with the small plate of lettuce and sour cream. She seemed uninterested in inquiring why most of my food was still on the plate. Eating here really seems to be a crap shoot.
