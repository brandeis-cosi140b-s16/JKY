I tried the giant carumba and it is a huge b3ef burrito enchilada style. The beef is watery and lacks flavor but sure looks good. On previous visits they usually gibve a smsll bowl of chips for the wait but maybe they have cut back. The service was not friendly but fairly quick. Hope it was just a bsd day for them and not a new trend. Bring back some flavor and ease up on the salt
