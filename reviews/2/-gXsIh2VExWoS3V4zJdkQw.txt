First time eating at Caminero. I figured it'd be good because it has been at the same location for years and thought it'd be good to try as I was walking out of my hair salon. Got a shredded beef and cheese burrito and a chicken enchilada combo with rice and beans. Overall, the food was okay. First couple of bites tasted good. My boyfriend was a bit disappointed in his burrito, being that I expected it to be just beef and cheese - but they cook their beef with onions, tomatoes and peppers. My combo platter was okay but the meal was so hot temperature wise (which is good..) it melted the styrofoam box they put it in. The rest of the meal tasted like styrofoam and I ended up throwing it out. Decently priced but they need to better describe their food on their menu and put it in better packaging for take out. Might try again and dine in instead just to give it a fair chance.
