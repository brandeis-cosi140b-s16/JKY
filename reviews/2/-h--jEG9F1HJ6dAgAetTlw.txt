We had lunch and drinks here when we first arrived in Vegas. The service was lack luster. The waitress obviously didn't want to be there and didn't want to serve anyone. 
The margs were terrible, pretty much it was mix with a splash of tequilla, if you drink more than one you WILL have a stomach ache. The salsa bar was pretty good, and we enjoyed getting to have all different types. 
I would skip eating here and save your money for something more delicious, maybe go to the food court instead.
