Not sure what all the hype is about. My food was okay but nothing that I'd go back for. A little pricey and the service wasn't anything to rave about either, unfortunately. No refills on the salsa and chips or drinks. Was with a party of five and we all were bummed that we couldn't back the high ratings Mariscos Sinaloa had received in the past.
