Meh is right.  Why is Mexican food (and hipstery, slightly upscale Mexican food) so mediocre in Pittsburgh?  

Went for brunch a few weeks ago and was less than impressed.  Just not much flavor in the torta I ordered, and my girlfriend's brisket hash was bland and dry.

Service was okay.

I might go back for salsa and chips - seems like it'd be a decent place to grab a beer on a summer night on their porch, but I'll pass on ordering anything else food-wise.
