New Mexico Grill in Gilbert is now closed on Sundays which was the only day we ate there. Why did they close on Sundays when they were busy? We drove all the way over to the Chandler location and we were the only customers the entire time we were there. The food seemed to be the same, but I'm not driving out of my way again. We discovered Tacos n More on Higley which has better food and ambiance, but we do miss the green chile.
