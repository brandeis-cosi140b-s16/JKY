I was not a fan.

They used an anaheim chili in the relleno... BIG mistake. It is poblano or nothing, people!

I also tried a green corn/green chili tamale. Too sweet. Not enough green chili. Just meh.

They did have a good habanero based salsa by request... unfortunately, like most Mexican joints these days, the chips you used to dip in the salsa sucked by all measures.

Another Mex restaurant disappointment. A pattern has definitely developed.
