Not impressed at all and a little disappointed. The red salsa not spicy or flavorful and the green one was sweet which I was not aware of until I took a huge bite , it took forever to get a waiter and the food not so good I make better tacos at home but, I did like the happy hour price of $2.99 for the margaritas
