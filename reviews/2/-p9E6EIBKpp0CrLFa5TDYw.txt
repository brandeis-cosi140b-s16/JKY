The food is ok but the staff is always SO rude. Just ate here and the girl making my burrito just rolled her eyes at me because I dared interrupt her conversation with her coworker (not about work) to ask for sour cream, even though I had already asked. The workers are more concerned about talking to their other coworkers than servicing customers. Had to tell them 3 times it was not a to go order. I feel like they just don't listen at all or pay attention.
