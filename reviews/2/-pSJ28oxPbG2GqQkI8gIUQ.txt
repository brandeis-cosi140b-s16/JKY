Met a friend for Dinner and it was an ok experience. The positive is the hostess came to us at the bar across the way to let us know our table was ready. Our waitress was pretty attentive. The only draw back on service was that it took them awhile to bring us some silverware. We ordered and as we were waiting we hit the chip and salsa bar. There was no chips but crumbs. We had to wait for that. The salsa bar was pretty messy. After going up a second time you would hope they cleaned it up. No, it was still messy. The salsa was pretty good. A good selection to choose from from very mild to hot. Well, what they think is hot lol. More like spicy ketchup. The menu was ok. Very pricy for the types of selections to choose from. I just ordered from the appetizers because it just seemed tastier. I ordered the Cholula Boneless Wings. They were pretty good. The flavor was cholula blended with butter. It was a star. The spicy chicken flour taquito thing they had, I don't know the name but was made with flour and looked more like an egg roll. It was flavorless. Im dipping salsa and cholula on it to get some sort of flavor. The other thing i couldn't figure out is that it's owned by station casinos, why is beer pricier in the restaurant when the bar next the it was cheaper. It made no sense and we would have to walk out to save a buck. Hopefully fix some things and revamp the menu. I don't know if i would go back unless I hear some positives. Till next time...Let's Eat!!
