The menu on this place sounded great, until we received the food. I gave it 2 stars only because the waitress made somewhat of an attempt to take care of us, although she seemed more interested in taking care of the large group that were drinking next to us. If you go to this place, get drinks and chips only. It is obviously a place to have a few tequila shots, I guess if you were really drunk the food would taste decent. It was pretty gross, my ground beef taco somehow had the same consistency as my pulled pork taco, everything was mushy and old tasting.
