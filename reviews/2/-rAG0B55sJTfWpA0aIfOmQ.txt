I am disappointed to stay that they have changed their sangria.  I had previously wrote how they had the best sangria I have ever had in my life. I had pumped all my friends and boyfriend up about getting sangria and after a month, we finally made it. 

The original sangria came filled with plump black berries and was made with basil which added the perfect twist to the sweetness. 

However, this has all changed. No more plump black berries. No more basil. Their excuse was that basil is out of season.  I am pretty sure that you can still get a hold of it.

I think the real reason is that the person who created the menu has since left.  My bet is that the new chef thought he could cut corners without realizing the impact it had.
