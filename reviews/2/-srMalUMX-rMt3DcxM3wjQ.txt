I really like the chicken at EPL but I seem to have the worse luck being able to get what I want.  Only thighs and legs available the last 4 out of 5 times I visited.  The amount of time you wait in drive-thru is crazy as well.  Today I ordered a 10 piece (had to get legs and thighs) and one of the legs was smaller than a drumstick you would receive at Buffalo Wild Wings.  I'm really trying to give you all my business, but I'm starting to question myself.
