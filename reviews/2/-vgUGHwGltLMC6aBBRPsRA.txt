I can't believe it :( 

I have to take this location off my places to take people to eat... for the these reasons:

- Poor service
- Cold food
- poor service

Our group actually thought that Super Mex wanted us to leave. 

I don't know who to blame for this...well the waiter for one, but I don't know if they needed more cooks, or what but I wanted to walk out after waiting 30 minutes for a torta. 

Good thing there's Super Mex's else where.
