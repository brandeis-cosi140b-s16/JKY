Viva el Taco is a small shop located in a strip mall off of Ft. Apache and Tropicana. I stopped by last week at about 11:30 on a weekday and it was completely dead. So I had no trouble getting a quick lunch to go. The order: one carne asada, one carnitas, and one al pastor taco. Each taco was a single tortilla piled with plenty of meat, onions, cilantro, tomatoes, and guacamole. The carne asada was tough and chewy and the al pastor was lacking a depth in flavor or any bit of kick. The carnitas was the best of the three but hardly anything to write home about. They're a little pricier than some other taquerias around town, with each taco being $2.40.
