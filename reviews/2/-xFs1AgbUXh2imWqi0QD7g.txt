Stopped-by for lunch today, and once again, the theme of the visit was, "more please."  (or, if you'd rather: Mas por favor)

Ordered a chicken salad bowl... one micro-handful of lettuce, a tiny scoop of chicken, a shot-glass of pico, and a huge ladle-full of hot salsa does not a great $7 salad make.  Or maybe they know I'm trying to drop some weight this month?

And it's not just me... the guy in front of me had to ask for "more" at least half-a-dozen times.  When he asked for guacamole and they told him it was going to be a $1.80 charge, he said, "fine."

The kid dropped a "spot" of guac about the size of a 50-cent piece onto the guy's burrito and started wrapping it up.  The guy in line looked at the kid and said, "Wait - that's it?  That's $2 worth of guacamole?"  

The kid said, "Did you want more?"

The guy said, "You didn't catch on to me asking you for more the first 5 times?"

Ugh.

I think this location has permanently turned-me-off to Chipotle.  It's too much work...
