Just small changes could make a BIG difference at this restaurant. First let me say the staff was very friendly and attentive. And I wish to thank them for their service on a busy night.
Now if they would concentrate on these few things. 1) have a hotter salsa such as habanero, something with kick. 2) provide fresh jalape√±os. I asked for fresh and what I got was canned! 3) flavor up the rice!

That's it! Do this and the stars may go up!
