I was excited to try this place as I was enticed by the local Phoenix street art and authentic Mexican food. I was not impressed with anything I had there- the guacamole was just okay, the margaritas were not worth $13 apiece, and I had a mango shrimp "salad" that consisted of just sliced  fruits on a plate with just 3 shrimp in the middle. Definitely underwhelmed by the food and drinks, and definitely not worth the money.
