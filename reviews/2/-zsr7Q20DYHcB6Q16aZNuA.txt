I was there with a group of about 12 for a birthday. I've always had marginal service and food at Ajo Al's, so I wasn't that thrilled.  I just ordered something that they couldn't screw up, and it was OK. Here's the problem; I  found a hair in my food. Some of the folks that I were with would have made a scene, so  I just picked it out and had some more chips. 

That night, they had a full house and the service was marginal again. Everything too fooooorrrreeeeevvvveeerrrrr!
