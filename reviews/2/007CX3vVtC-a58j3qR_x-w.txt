Awful drive thru experience. I've not visited a Filiberto's in years, and this does not make me want to start up again. I spent nearly 30 minutes in line for food- with only 3 cars ahead of me. Not sure what the deal was, but oh man, it was frustrating to watch each car ahead of me take 10 minutes to pay/receive their order. And there were numerous mixups during the order process- I had to repeat my order several times but they did get it right in the end.

The food is still "alright" - great homemade tortillas, and plenty of options. They have just about every conceivable combo order you can imagine. The sides (beans & rice) are below average with not a whole lot of taste. My carne asada burrito was dry and I forget there's really nothing in it. I had to douse it with their red sauce to add some sort of flavor. My wife got the supreme chicken quesadilla and she seemed to have liked it. As always, portions are incredibly large. We barely finished 1/2 our plates in the end. Oh yeah, the diet Cokes were completely flat- zero carbonation. 

So between the extremely awful drive-thru and the sub-par food I'm throwing 2 stars their way. The girl that took my money was very nice so that at least took some of the pain out of the overall deal. But in the end, I'm staying away from Filiberto's Gilbert. The 24-hour operation is probably a bonus for some of the patrons.
