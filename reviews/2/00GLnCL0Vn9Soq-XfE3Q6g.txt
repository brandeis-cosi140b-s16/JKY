Love the atmosphere, loved the staff, but the food was lacking. 

We got there for Monday Night Football and grabbed a great seat by the bar. We immediately ordered the Mexican Corn and the Spicy Shrimp Nachos. The corn was okay. Definitely over cooked or had been cooked and sitting out a while. The nachos were horrid. For $17 you get maybe 4-5 medium shimp cut up into smaller pieces. The chips were SO greasy!!!! For $17 I was expecting more. The worst part is that I've been up since 3am with food poisoning from the under cooked shrimp. I should have known by looking at them. 

The staff is the only reason I gave two stars. Attentive and genuine.  I so badly wished the food was better. I'll gladly go elsewhere, pay half that price and get 5 star nachos.
