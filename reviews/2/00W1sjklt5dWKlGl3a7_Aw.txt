I live 2 mins away I will come back when my orders wrong and have now 3 times, and today going back did nothing for me. I always get the same thing bacon breakfast with extra bacon and potatoes and that should ensure a bite with bacon every time. And when yall don't put extra bacon on it yall end up making me two burritos to replace the first. I DON'T WANT TWO BURRITOS JUST ONE WITH TWICE THE BACON. If I need to order extra extra bacon I'll start it's not about the price it's about the bacon!! Egg shouldn't be the most used ingredient if I'm asking for extra bacon. Ur too close for me to stop coming but please make my food so I only have to show up once
