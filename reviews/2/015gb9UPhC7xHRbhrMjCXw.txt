Pepe's is not all that and a bag of chips. This is another place that's not far from where I work and it had some recommendations from people that I needed to try it. I'm just not impressed. 

Parking, especially at lunch sucks. If you end up parking behind the place over to the West it stinks, a combo smell of grease and sewer that will blast you the second you open your car door. Once you step inside to what looks like an ancient IHOP from the outside you'll find a busy kitchen, ample seating, serve yourself drink fountains, and 2 places to stand for the staff to take your order. And that's where things go South. I've had my order messed up 2 out of 3 times here due to it being lost in translation. The lunch special with 3 chicken tacos somehow ended up as beef tacos, not the lunch special, and at a higher cost. 

As you wait for your order you can check out the duo-salsa bar. 2 types of salsa and the typical pickled Jalapenos and stuff is all you get, and the tomatillo light salsa is the only one I like. It's great for pouring all over the greasy tacos that you'll get. Crunchy yes, but dang, sometimes they just don't taste good at all. 

I've been here a couple of times for lunch now but don't plan to keep them in my lunch rotation. Lindo Michaocan is not far away drive time wise, and they kick Pepe's to the curb in so many ways. If you happen to be driving down Fremont and are just dying for Mexican food this place won't kill you, but it ain't all that either. 

2 Stars. Sorry, that's the best I can give it.
