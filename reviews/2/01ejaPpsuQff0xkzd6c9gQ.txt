This was my first visit to the restaurant. Everyone gave me a huge welcome and was very nice. I placed my order,Elizabeth rung me up (I had to ask for a stamp card, which I wasn't pleased about because everyone knew it was my first time, she should've offered it to me) I ordered a pork enchilada with black beans, red sauce and asked for it to be covered in sauce and cheese (I chose the green tomatillo sauce on top instead of red). When I got it home a few minutes later and had my first bite, something was sugary sweet all throughout the burrito. Since the pork and black beans were mixed I couldn't distinguish exactly what was causing it but my only reaction is YUCK! When I eat mexican food of any type from anywhere, I don't expect anything to be sugary sweet. Ewwwww  

So I've said it before and I'll say it again, I've tried this place now too, I've tried Chipotle (which is just ok) but my heart will stay with Rubios. I've eaten there no less then 50 times (at the same location) over the past several years and I've never had a mistake or bad food there ever.
