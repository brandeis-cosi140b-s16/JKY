I love El Pollo Loco chicken. This location is hit or miss if you get good chicken. The lines in the drive thru are always super long during lunch time and in the evening so be prepared to wait. On this particular trip I was especially peeved because they did not give me salsa. I don't know if I will come back to this location.
