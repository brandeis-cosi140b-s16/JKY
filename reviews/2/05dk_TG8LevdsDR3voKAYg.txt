My husband and I have been wanting to try this place since we moved to the area.  We didn't have a reservation so we went for an early dinner at 5:00PM.  The hostess asked if we had a reservation and we did not and she said she could seat us but we had to be gone by 6:30.  I understand her concern, but the place was 25% full, and who takes more than 1.5 hours for dinner?  We didn't start out with the best experience.

Then we ordered the fresh guacamole and it was probably the best i have ever had - i highly recommend it!

I had the Grouper which was great, but my husband had "the chef's favorite dish to make" the pork shoulder with chorizo and it was below average.  Dry and lacked flavor.

I had to ask for another glass of water because my glass had a huge crack down one side.

The couple next to us ordered the salmon (i think) and it smelled awful when they brought it out to the table.  Everyone in the restaurant turned to look to see what it was and my husband and i almost decided to leave, but stuck it out.

I don't think we will be back except for the guacamole maybe.  I've also heard the tacos are good, but we didn't try them.
