We passed by the Sandbar & it looked cool & fun so we decided to stop by for dinner with our family. The previous reviews are right, it's more of a bar than a restaurant. It has a great beach bar atmosphere. It would be a cool place to hang out with friends if you are just going there to have fun & snack a little but if you are going for dinner I will advise you that it is more than just 1 $ in rating. My daughter wanted to get just a taco & it was going to be around $10! I usually get mini chimis from other restaurants so I thought I would try theirs. The mini chimis I get at other places come with 8 mini chimis & a side of jalopeno cream cheese. There was only 4 mini chimis on the plate & the jalopeno cream cheese was inside the chimis & no side. They tasted ok but but we were very dissapointed & won't go back.
