Average food and average service .... nothing more and nothing less.  I do have to say that I eat here 3 to 4 times a month due to how close it is to were I live.  Yet, I have never gotten the same tasting margarita ever, so my suggestion is get the cheapest one to save the money --- inconsistent at beast -- and what a shame it is a Mexican Restaurant.  I ask for corn tortillas and I get flour every time I guess their POS system does not communicate with the kitchen properly.  The main issue is with me, I spend $50 to $70, without tip for a single diner and never get an experience worth it.  I guess I keep going because it is so convenient.  If you live more then a mile away I say go someplace else.  Sorry, but as a diner that eats there often, I feel abused and not appreciated as a regular .... so I guess it is a time for a change and for me to find a new Mexican restaurant that will meet my expectations and meet my needs.   I will drive the extra 5 miles for good food, good service and a good margarita.  For those of you who venture there and want corn tortillas make sure you let a manager know when you order.
