Way too heavy handed with the salt!! I wanted something light so I ordered vegetarian - Enchilada Verdes. The black beans were so salty they were inedible. The enchiladas were drowning in cheese and didn't feel light at all. This felt like horribly processed chain restaurant food but cost about 50% more.
