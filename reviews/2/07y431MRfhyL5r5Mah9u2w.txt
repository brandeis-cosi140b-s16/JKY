I have a group that meets a few times a month and we thought eating in Downtown Mesa for 2nd Friday and seeing the vendors would be nice. So I called a night ahead and reserved a seating arrangement for 8 people on the patio for 6pm. I arrived 15 minutes early and they had no idea what I was talking about. Nor was the seating arrangement made for the group. I had to move the 5 tables and 10 chairs MYSELF b/c I was getting no help from the staff. Camyn was very helpful for the first 4 people who arrived with orders and drinks, but  became overwhelmed and neglected the second 4 people of my party. They waited for 30 minutes to get refills on their drinks at one point. Restaurant was busy so we were trying to be patient. But once it was time for the checks the restaurant was dead, I told Camyn we were ready for the check twice and a busser told her three separate times. We FINALLY got our checks once we came in the restaurant and blocked the floor space until we got our checks. This process took 45 minutes to get the 6 checks. Several of the checks didnt agree in check price when compared to the menu price. Manager, who was bartending, and other servers didnt seem fazed. So I take that this treatment is par for the course. Food was good, but not good enough to be worth this hassle. I wont be returning or recommending them to anyone.
