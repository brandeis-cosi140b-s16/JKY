Located in a nondescript strip mall, I have been here a few times. There was really nothing too exciting about either the tacos I have ordered or the nachos I had the other day.   I find their menu to be very limited.  

I find Filibertos, Los Favoritos, and the many other Mexican restaurants in Chandler to be better.
