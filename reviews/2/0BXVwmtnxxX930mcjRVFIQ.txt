This place used to be Los Favoritos and at that time it was awesome. The customer service was also fantastic, they were fast and accurate. 
I came in last weekend to order about 20 entr√©es and it was ridiculous how much I had to argue to get sauce.  Even after we determined that they typically give 3 per entree the front lady and guy in the back refused to give me that amount. She was being so slow too... our food came out and got cold by the time the older guy agreed to be reasonable.  They even shorted us on the sides of Pico de Gallo I ordered and paid extra money for.  Seriously displeased. To add extra fuel to our displeasure that night, one of our bean & cheese burritos had chunks of meat in the middle; for the vegetarian family member who was eating that, it was a barf-worthy experience. 
We have had numerous issues with them getting our order wrong but we kept going back.. thinking it will get better. The food has been fun to eat on a weekend night when we have the family over. But the customer service needs a serious upgrade.
