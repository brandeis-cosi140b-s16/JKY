I need to start out by saying I RARELY eat what I consider "junk" fast food but my husband craves it. We are both in the midst of studying for big exams for our work and my husband wanted junk food to fuel him. We went through the drive through. The service was friendly but it's was very hard to hear the girl over the speaker. Occasionally a guy would talk and it seemed like his headset or whatever worked MUCH better. When we got home one item was missing from the bag. We called and they were pleasant but said we had to come into the store for refund or replacement but could come another day. 

As far as the food - my husband said his crunch wrap was all lettuce with a tiny 
 bite of meat. His (much cheaper) tacos had far more meat. 

When I went back a few days later for the refund on the nacho bell grande they were pleasant but only offered to replace the item. I probably could've raised a stink but it's not worth the grief. 

The nachos were "ok" but I wouldn't order them again. We miss the Taco Bell of days past when the meat didn't seem like it was more fluff than protein and the nacho cheese wasn't mildly spiced yellow goo. Eh, but that's why we stopped coming here, we'd rather eat actual food than "food like products".

Oh and if you want Long John Silvers, much better deal to go to their other store. Here the coleslaw is pre-packaged and much smaller than you would get at a solely LJS location.
