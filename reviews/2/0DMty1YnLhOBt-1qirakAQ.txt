Eh. I wanted to find a place where I could get a couple of cheap tacos and a beer so I gave it shot with the family. It wasn't bad, just nothing special. I would give it 2 1/2 stars if that was an option.

The food is okay. I had an al pastor taco and a carne asada taco, and I tried a few bites of my wife's chicken burrito. It was all just okay - can't say anything bad, but not really anything good to say either. I'd honestly rather hit Taco Bell, and I can think of 10 Mexican restaurants/taco shops in Vegas I would rather go to.

The staff was friendly, but a little unorganized. We were one of 3 other parties in the place and it kind of took awhile to get the food. Maybe the staff was new or something.

I get the whole graffiti thing and trying an alternative casual look, but it's a little over the top. Sharpie marker written all over the walls, rails, seats, and everything else that seems to be written mostly by teenagers wanting to be hard-core by dropping an F-bomb via permanent marker. Whatever.

If I happened to be in that shopping center and felt like a taco or burrito I might try it again, but not going out of the way to go back.
