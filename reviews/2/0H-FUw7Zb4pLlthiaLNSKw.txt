My husband and I used to go to the location on bell rd. We would go at least once a week. That placed closed down. We came to the one in Scottsdale thought this place would be top of the line. I don't know if their recipes are not the same or if they just completely changed chefs. My food was served cold. Waitress forgot one of our orders. This place had no A1 sauce or Tabasco. I'm definitely disappointed . I thought this place had a great start here in Scottsdale. I guess not.
