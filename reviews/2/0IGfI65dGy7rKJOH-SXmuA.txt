It's Taco Time. Yeah, right!.  Just letting you know right now, not my idea to come here.  But it was a co-workers time to pick lunch and he swears by this place. Why you ask? I even wanted to know.  Well, this is the only Taco Time in Las Vegas and he grew up on this stuff back in Utah. Big deal...now let me eat.  

Nothing on the menu was appealing to me, both taste wise and calorie wise. I ended up pulling up the myfitnesspal app and found something decent.  I ended up getting their Crisp Chicken Burrito.  I know, their known for their burritos. I just didn't want to indulge knowing that a big dinner was within a few hours.  Their Crisp Chicken Burrito is basically a large deep fried taquito in my opinion.  Tasted okay, but that's about it. 

As for the ambiance...yeah right.  This Taco Time is located at a truck stop off Blue Diamond across from from the Silverton Casino/Hotel.  When you're in here, you almost forget you're in Las Vegas.  For a minute, I thought I was in Barstow or even Baker.  Service wasn't the best and they didn't even have forks.  Good gravy...I doubt I will stumble back in here.
