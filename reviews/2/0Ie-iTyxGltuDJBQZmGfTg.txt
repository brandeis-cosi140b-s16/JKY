Well I'm going to make this short because I have mixed feelings on demoting this place... But truth must be told.

We were met by 2 friendly chefs(because they are 'out of servers'... not the best sign either I guess). The service was very genuine and kind though it really was.

The food on the other hand, while it was fresh it was very pedestrian. We had the salad, a veggie burrito and 6 empanadas. Everything basically tasted like it could be made at home.

The food is fine, just don't expect much or anything special. 

That is all. =)
