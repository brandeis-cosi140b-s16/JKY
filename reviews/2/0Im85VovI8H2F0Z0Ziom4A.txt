Had a chance to check out this new Barrio concept at The Yard last week.  The food was definitely the best part, however took longer than normal, and was not very busy.  The service was below average, and no one even came over to take a drink order for 5-7 minutes after we were seated.  The server did not know they had Sol beer, even though it's on the menu.  Great ambiance with a ton of potential, but need to work out the service issues and timing with the kitchen.  The servers should memorize the menu if they know what's good for them.  Will give them another try in a couple months to see if they can work the kinks out.
