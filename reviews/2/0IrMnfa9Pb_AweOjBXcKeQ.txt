I liked the fish tacos I got. Also got 2 beef taco combo with rice and beans. They also messed up and gave me a 2 cheese enchilada combo with my takeout. Didn't really care for flavor of shredded beef with beef tacos, won't get those next time.  Cheese enchiladas I ate the next day, not bad but not my cup of tea.  Nice guy at counter taking order/cash.  I gave them a 2 stars cause if 2 not likes, could have been my order that missed the 2 cheese enchiladas. Wish I could give more... Maybe next time.
