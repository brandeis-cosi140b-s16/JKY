I was at Z Tejas with a small group, 5 people total. I was excited to go to Z Tejas because it has been about two years since I was at the original in Austin. I was a frequent flyer at Z's in Austin, it was walking distance to my brother's house and it was fantastic. 

This location is certainly not on my list of places to revisit. 
1 - Very slow service, my water glass was empty more than it was full the whole time. Plenty of empty tables around us. 
2 - 25 minutes to find out they had no Moet, no alternatives offered other than " we have good frozen margaritas". 
3 - Portions are small, come on... this is a Texas restaurant. My Mom finished her whole meal and that doesn't normally happen. 
4 - Food wasn't really good. Baked seafood enchiladas were more like canned tuna quality. The Santa Fe Smoked Chicken Enchiladas were meat and sauce layered on a tortilla. The Spicy Baja Shrimp Skillet had four shrimp total, yes four. The one decent dish of the night was Green Chili Barbacoa Enchiladas, it was like a chef actually prepared this dish!
