I am a fan of taco stands in general, but....
This location consistently ruins my beloved bacon, potato, egg and cheese breakfast burrito.  Every now and then they get it just right, but most of the time there's something missing from it.  The bacon is frequently burned to a crisp, and the eggs...OH the poor eggs.  They are browned beyond all recognition and sometimes just a thin layer of bubbly burned stuff.
