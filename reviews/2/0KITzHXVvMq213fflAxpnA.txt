On 4/7/15 I stopped by with a coworker.  He had the Carne Asada tacos and I had the Asada plate(15).

Long story short, what we were served was not Carne Asada.  I don't know what kind of meat or animal that came from, but it was thick, chewy, and fatty.  It was disgusting.  On the upside the chips were good.  Disappointed they are passing off "mystery meat" as Carne Asada in AZ.
