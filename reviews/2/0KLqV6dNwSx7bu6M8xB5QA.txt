Blah, blah, and more blaaaah. I thought there food left much to be desired. I did like the shabby, but cute atmosphere. Our waitress forgot about us and we sat for about 15 minutes before my boyfriend had to go ask for our check.  I got the shrimp fajitas. I always order this at mexican restaurants and it's never so so. It's always really bad or really good -- here, it was really bad. My boyfriend liked his food, but didn't looove it. The salsa was bland, but hot and I've had better chips at chain restaurants. I didn't get to tried the fried ice cream because our waitress kept us waiting too long and we would've been late for a movie. As a side note, True Grit was quite good.
