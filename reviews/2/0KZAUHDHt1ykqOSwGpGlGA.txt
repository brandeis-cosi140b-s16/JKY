I went to this airport foodery with thoughts of getting a great Oaxacan meal at Sky Harbor Airport. But that was a fantasy. Not sure why I ever thought that, maybe it was just the Oaxaca name.

This is burritos to go. I ordered a Machuca Oaxaca burrito, Machuca being shredded beef mixed with onions and chilis. 

The Burrito was surprisingly small. I agree with Eli's first review. It was not that tasty, and it was real watery or wet. I went through 10 napkins, because everytime I squeezed the burrito by taking a bit, a puddle appeared below the burrito. It got to be irritating, as I didn't want greasy stains on my clothes, so I was trying real hard to wrap up this burrito so it wouldn't leak from the bottom. 

It still leaked. After every bite. A little puddle I would wipe up with yet another napkin. 

The chili sauce was spicy, and was perhaps the best thing about the food. 

Machuca Burrito and drink totalled $8.53.

I hate to admit it, but It made me crave for Chipotle!
