I went to Border Grill the 1/30, but was full from House of Blues earlier in the day.  This probably had an affect on my review, but nonetheless.

Ordered: 
Ice Water-  Nice touch.. they pour it from a bottle.  Felt very classy!

Tortilla Soup -  What the hell is this.  I don't believe its $9 !  I rather have Campbells soup than your Tortilla Soup.  It must have came from a can!

Chips w/ Guacamole-  mmm-Good!  The Chips are complimentary and you have to pay for the Guac, but it's totally worth it! However, if you do not favor chucks of white onion; I must advice you to stay away.

The soup killed it for me.  I'll be back to review this place one day when I'm hungry and I have no choice, but to eat here (this will never happen).
