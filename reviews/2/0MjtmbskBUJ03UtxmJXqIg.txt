Years ago this restaurant and Gardunos required reservations even on weekdays, but the evening of our visit the place was relatively empty.  In fact, for the first 10 minutes there wasn't even a chef.  Our waiter took our orders - house margaritas and combo pan roasts that include crab, shrimp and scallops.  The chef finally made an appearance and both his demeanor and facial expression suggested he would have been happier having a root canal.  Prices have increased since our last visit.  There was a lot of seafood in the pan roasts, but we agreed these just aren't as good as in the past.
