Food is average. Playing Hispanic music in the lobby doesn't mean you serve good Mexican food. Burrito was sloppy and over packed with potatoes and hardly any meat. Shredded Beef is horrible. Poor mixture of meat with onions and tomatoes. Looks like dog food. Enchiladas were below par. Not sure how you mess enchiladas up but this place did it, way to GO Se√±or Taco.
