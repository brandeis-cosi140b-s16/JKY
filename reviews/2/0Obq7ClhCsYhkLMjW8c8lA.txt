"I have never gotten sick from this place" shouldn't be a positive review. I haven't...but still. I stopped going here the second time I got an incorrectly rolled burrito. I mean c'mon! The name of the place is Filibertos and the entire staff is Mexican! Incorrectly rolled burritos? TWICE!?!?! WTF?

It'll work for me if its 230am and I am in a car that is already going through the drive through. I have often made the decision to go to Denny's across the street for late night grub. They've never f'ed up a burrito there!
