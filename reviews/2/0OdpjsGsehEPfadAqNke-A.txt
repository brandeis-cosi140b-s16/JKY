High prices, small portions and poor food quality. They don't even have real fresh brewed iced tea. Everything very salt heavy to make up for being poorly seasoned. They nickel and dime you for everything and don't offer much in return. This place piss poor customer service. Save yourself the grief of his place and go to chipotle.
