I went to Los Dos Molinos with high hopes, having heard great things about it.  The service was decent, though the wait staff just brought the check without asking if we wanted anything else.  The salsas (both red and green) were easily the highlight of the visit.  I may go back just to buy the salsa.  The chile relleno wasn't bad, but the rice was clearly yesterday's leftovers and the beans had a funky vinegar taste.  The sopapillas were also not what I was  expecting.  It wasn't bad food, but it certainly wasn't the best ever, either.  The decor was cute and fun.
