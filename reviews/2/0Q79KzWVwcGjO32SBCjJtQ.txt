A place for happy hour and a spiritied atmosphere but that is about it!

Ordered some grilled shrimp tacos - and the shrimp was cooled - probably just taken out of the frigerator. Mentioned this to the waitress and she took my dish back, waited a while . . and came back with heated up shrimp -  not grilled.  Will probably not go back - there is definately other Mexiacan influenced restaurants with better happy hours and definately way better food.
