I read reviews on the food at Diablo's here on yelp.  I should have listened to them.  The rice, beans and salsa were some of the worst I've ever had.  You have to pay for chips and salsa.  The guacamole was decent but was $12 and they don't give you very much. I had the rock shrimp tacos which were on the bland side.  Considering the price of this restaurant, you can find much better alternatives.  Try Pink Taco or Diegos instead.
