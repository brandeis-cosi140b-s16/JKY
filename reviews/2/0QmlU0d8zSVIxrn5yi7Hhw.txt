Z has been my Go-To place for girls' weekend brunch, happy hour with coworkers, date nights with hubby...but the last THREE times I went there, it was really disappointing. I think it just comes down to poor management and bad communication between the manager and staff. Thing is, I like the food and drinks a lot, but unpredictable service, poor attitudes from management, and lack of commitment to happy customers isn't worth it. 

First time, they served me badly undercooked eggs, corrected it with badly overcooked eggs, all the while the manager was a mix of disinterested and annoyed. Raw eggs? I didn't even end up eating because by the time they got it right, my friend was done with her entire meal. Second time three different employees (hostess, server, manager) told us something different about a dog being allowed on the patio only AFTER we'd been seated, making it extremely awkward and unpleasant to try to enjoy the birthday we were there to celebrate. The third time, just this past weekend, they put charges on my bill that were supposed to be comped. I didn't notice until I left so I had to write and call and leave a message but more than 5 days later, no call back or email.
