Got a dose of "Montezuma's Revenge" a while back. Makes me wonder what got me, now I have doubts about the place. Sometimes the tongs that you use to pick up the spicy carrots is submerged under the brine. There are some construction worker types that eat there and they are not all that tidy. I've seen a few of them make a total mess as they fill up the little cartons with salsa. They drop stuff on the floor like gorillas at the zoo. Maybe stuff like salsa should be prepackaged and not self service? Gosh, should I go back to see if I get sick again? I may have to stick to bean and chesse burritos and use bottled hot sauce from home. Oh well.
