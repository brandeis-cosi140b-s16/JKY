Ate here for the first time last night. My husband and I were meeting some friends for dinner before a concert and we picked this place to meet at. 
In my opinion I think the prices are kind of high for what you get. 
My husband and I are on a bit of a budget right now so we choose to split a taco plate.
The tacos were decent and the sopapillas that come with the meal were good. 
The restaurant is very nice and our server was extremely nice and helpful. 
I probably wouldn't go back as I can get cheaper and better Mexican food elsewhere and also I don't live in the Glendale area.
 
The place is definitely good for large groups.

Our server and free sopapillas was the best part of the experience.
