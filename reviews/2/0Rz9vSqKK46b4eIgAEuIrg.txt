Beef rumba salad is light, refreshing and somewhat healthy. Dressing optional as it's so tasty with salsa only. Oh! and don't forget to squeeze lime on it.
Flavors are great, serving size is a bit small for the price paid. Seems a small salad like this one shouldn't be close to $7.00, I'd think more around $5.00. 
Ambience is sort of beachy if you use your imagination.
