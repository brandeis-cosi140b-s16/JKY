Wow, what a sense of deja vu coming here and reading these reviews.  I have to parrot much of what has been said.  Customer service at this location is sorely lacking.  Try ordering a bowl sometime without rice but with extra beans.  After repeating yourself several times you will likely be treated to "extra" beans in the form of two miniscule scoops.  This has happened to me several times at this location.  

Also agree no one here has ever asked if I want the veggies/green peppers, and when I order an extra like avocado...serious skimping occurs.  Honestly I don't like going here for all these reasons but I do like the food sometimes.  Note to manager - I'd eat there more if it wasn't such a pain for the above reasons.
