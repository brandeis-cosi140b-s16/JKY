With limited options in Campaign this weekend, I suggested Chevy's. I remembered loving this place in college -- The whole "Fresh Mex" thing did it for me. 

Well, where to begin..... The guac was bland,  food was luke warm and my steak taco was ground beef. Also, the service was mediocre. She wasn't even bad, she just lacked a personality. Not that I wanted her to do card tricks or something, but  a little smile goes a long way.

You've been granted a 2nd star purely because of that wonderful corn mush you serve with every meal.

Bummer Chevy's... I wanted to like you.
