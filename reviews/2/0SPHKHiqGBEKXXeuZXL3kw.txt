A few weeks ago, got two soft shredded chicken tacos that were awesome.  Came back today...totally different.

Got a carnitas burrito that was definitely subpar. It was--literally--80% rice and very little meat. Totally dry, hardly any pico, and the little meat that was there was not carnitas.  Also had rolled tacos...which are actually taquitos.  Fried to the point of very, very well done. Did not come with the avocado that was advertised. 

The regular $3 tacos are solid, but the other stuff is overpriced and barely mediocre. $25 for two meals, thought we might get chips or salsa as well, but nothin. Maybe kitchen was having an off night? 

So disappointed...was looking forward to some quality mexicali street food
