Pros: 1. Hot salsa was pretty good
            2. When I called to complain about my burrito being wrong they did offer me a          
                  free burrito.

Cons:
1. Burrito was super small. I like a burrito that is the size of a small child and puts you into an immediate food coma. This was not that place. The only thing hefty about these burritos was the price. $7 for a burrito and I expect a loooooooot more. 

2. The food was cold. 

3. I paid for guacamole and opened up my burrito and there was a little guacamole smeared on, but not much. 

4. They got my order wrong. I wanted rice in my burrito and they left it out. 

Ok, so I have high expectations. But I am super loyal once a place makes me an outstanding burrito. So, for now Blue Burrito I'm not smitten, but I will give you one more chance. If you impress me an update will follow.
