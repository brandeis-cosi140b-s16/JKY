Not that great Mexican restaurant...in an airport.  The server was really friendly though.

I ordered the mahi mahi tacos, the fish was overly fishy smelling, and it was not served with all the stuff the menu said, no mango salsa, no fresh tomatoes, no cilantro....the best thing was the guacamole I ordered on the side.
