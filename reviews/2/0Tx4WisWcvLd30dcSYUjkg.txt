Two words: Hell. No.

I have never been to an El Pollo Loco, but I've heard good things, so I went to this location to check it out last night. I ordered the kids pollo bowl with tortilla chips, which is essentially rice, beans, and chunks of chicken.  As soon as I took the lid off, I knew something was wrong.  Was it supposed to be a soup? Because my bowl was SWIMMING in liquid.  I assume that it is from the container they keep the beans in, but it's like they didn't even bother to drain the liquid before they threw the beans in there, and now my bowl is more than half-full of bean water.  The tortilla chips were on par with Taco Bell.  

I might go back to try their chicken on the bone, but never again will I order a bowl from this place.  Gross.
