Liked the free chips.

This place is packed at lunch time with business men.

As a vegetarian there is little to eat as the refried beans are made with lard.

The veggie burrito then has spanish rice, lettuce, some salsa fresca, a bit of sour cream and a bit of cheese.  Blah.  The tortillas was DELICIOUS though!
