friendly service, but very disorganized. Took them over an hour to serve us our dinner even though they weren't that business. I don't think they had any designated server to look after our table - so it all depended upon one very harried guy remembering to come by every half hour to check if were doing ok.
Chili Rellenos was subpar and the special that my wife had (mahi tacos) was over done.
The staff were really trying and seemed to care , but totally mis-managed and dis-organized or perhaps understaffed.
That was kinda disappointing since the food and service at the Los Dos in mesa used to be pretty good.....
