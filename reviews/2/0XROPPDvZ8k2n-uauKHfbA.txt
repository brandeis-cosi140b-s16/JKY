I had been to the Mesa, Arizona location a few years ago, and it was good, so I was happy to see the expansion.  I came to this new Chandler Arizona location on opening day.  That day was busy, but I came at a good time, so it wasn't bad at all.  I brought a friend and came back a few days later.  The staff was all very upbeat, with the exception of the cashier.  I handed her my stamp card and she gave me one stamp although I purchased 2 meals.  I questioned it, and she snapped back "You have a coupon, you only get a stamp if you pay full price".  Seriously?  $3 off of my nearly $18 order ($9.49 salad and $7.99 tacos) so I don't get the stamp? And what's with the attitude?  Nearly every other person in the building that day got a free meal because they knew about the deal that I didn't, and she was concerned about a single stamp.  

Today when I went, it was like a completely different restaurant.  There were just 2 other customers in the place when I walked in.  The employees barely said a word to us the entire time we were there, other than trying to charge for an additional side of salsa that should have come with the chips.  Chipotle would not charge for that.  I would swear the employees were in mourning for all of the dead chickens, pigs & cows they were serving up.  Seriously, if one employee had even attempted to crack a smile, I probably would have fallen over.

To the managers of this location:  If you want to be here a year from now, I would definitely retrain your employees on customer experience.  Clearly, the customers that took the survey from Sandleman and Associates and rated Cafe Rio number one, did NOT deal with any of these employees!

Chipotle, here I come!
