Decided to give it a try based on Yelp reviews. We will not be going back. Red and green burrito's are very bland. No flavor at all. As a matter of fact has a lot of flour added. Rice was mushy. Beans, tamale, taco, chips and salsa were ok. They only have a carne asada plate. No carne asada for tacos or burritos. Never heard of that before. Wow! That is just strange. They are very clean. That's was the only good thing.
