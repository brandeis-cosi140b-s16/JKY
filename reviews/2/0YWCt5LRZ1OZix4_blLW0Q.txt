As my family will tell you, I tend to lean toward more bland food and can't do spicy.  However, I ordered the chicken enchiladas and they were too bland for even me.  The chicken had no flavor at all and the corn tortillas had the same flavor as cardboard.  The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because the lettuce was good.
