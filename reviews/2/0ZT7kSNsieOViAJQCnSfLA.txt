2 and a 1/2. I hate to give it a 2 but I could not justify it for being nice and clean and friendly. One thing I will say is that I expected a lot more from them based on location and a friend's suggestion and that might be why I am so underwhelmed.  

We started with the cilantro mousse since it was shown on the menu that you did not receive complementary chips and salsa. (Boooo Hisss). The cilantro mousse was not a mousse it was whipped cream cheese and it was poorly whipped. Big chunks of cream cheese in it that made it hard to dip. The chips came without being salted??!!! 

I had to order the Obama Burrito. I say I "had to" because that is the only thing that I was interested in at the time and felt stupid ordering an "Obama" burrito. There was nothing in the burrito that justified it being an Obama Burrito. Just a jump on the, lets be hip and political band wagon name. I did let the server know this and he did agree it needed to be changed. So that will hopefully change with a new menu.

The burrito was ok ,its' flavors all melded together and besides the hot peppers that they had in the saut√©ed onion and pepper mixture nothing really popped. Pork was meh. It had huge chunks of fat in it and not in a good way. These were large inch cubed pieces. I think I found over four in the burrito which I think is a problem.

The place has potential a great location nice staff and owner. Just needs some work before I would go back. Oh yea ...And if that is the owners Smokey and the Bandit Trans Am in the parking lot we are soooo jealous!
