Let me preface this review with the fact that I go to Chipotle a lot.  I went there for lunch today and got a steak burrito and put the usual rice, beans, Pico, cheese, sour cream, and I get guac on the side.  The steak had barely any flavor and was very chewy.  It was like half of my pieces were gristle.  The guacamole I put on the burrito with a fork because they slop it on otherwise; it had no flavor and the color was off as well.  I pretty much go to Chipotle for the guacamole and this was the worst I had.  $10 for this burrito was way overpriced and I ended up throwing much of it away because of the lack of flavor.  The line was so long I didn't want to complain but this makes me think twice about visiting this location.
