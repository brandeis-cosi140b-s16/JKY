This place just sucks.  We used to come here regularly, but we haven't been for a long time.   Couldn't remember why.  Now I remember.   The food is marginal AT BEST.  To make up for the poor food; they charge outrageous prices 

This used to be a very good,  although never;  great place   

The place on Camelback is much better.   The prices are the same,  but the food is much better. 

While Taco Bell is Taco Bell,  the food is consistent and far better than Arriba.   What a shame. 

Based on my experience;  however,  we strongly recommend Valle Luna.   A little less expensive,  but the food and service is leagues ahead of Arriba in Scottsdale.
