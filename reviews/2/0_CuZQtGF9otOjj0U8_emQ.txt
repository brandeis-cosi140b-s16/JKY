I should have followed my own pat advice I give time and time again:  If you want to go the best authentic ethnic restaurant, you have to go where the ethnics go;  so that should pretty much sum up the experience here.  
 
Waaaaay overrated, waaaaaay overpriced.  I was waaaaaay disappointed after hearing all the fabulous reviews from the Anglos.  Don't we live close to the border?  
 
Home cooked or authentic?  Put it this way, go where the Mexicans go to eat if you don't mind being stared at.   How do I know?  I treated my staff, a party of home grown Mexicans, to this gourmet mexican;   we were seriously the ONLY ethnics there.  The ONLY other authentic mexican ethnics we saw there were the guys clearing out the plates.  When my girlfriends spoke to them in spanish and asked what THEY thought about the authenticity of the food, we got a smile;  that was enough---I hope we don't cost the poor guy his job.  
 
Pork dish:  drowned in sauce that all taste was gone.  
Beef:  do you like beef jerky?  

Repeat after me:  ask where all the ethnics go to eat if you want fabulous authentic ethnic food.
 
If you want a cute place to bring a date and to impress by shelling a lot of money for a little payback afterwards, this is the place for you!
 
Not for the gourmande.  Just because a place is expensive doesn't mean it is fabo.
