I went here with my girlfriend. I ordered a steak and shrimp burrito. She got avocado shrimp tacos. When we got our order, they accidentally gave her chicken tacos. I brought them back to the counter with the receipt and they apologized. It took a little bit, but they brought out a new set of tacos. This time, they accidentally added mango instead of avocado. 

2 Stars because my burrito was pretty good.
