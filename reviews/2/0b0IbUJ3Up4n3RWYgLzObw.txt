me and my boyfriend used to go here alot for lunch since its the closest to work. we did the drive-tru and the meal i wanted to get had the price messed up. it had the combo price for the quesadilla and the price for the quesadilla for the combo. so the combo was cheaper. i ordered the combo anyways and when she gave me the total at the window i told her that the price they had displayed was less than what she was telling me. she didnt believe me. i asked her to go check, she said "no, i dont have time to go check are you gunna pay or not?". we were the only ones in the drive tru! i told her never mind i'll take my buisness somewhere else. i wouldnt have had a problem paying for it but she could of at least checked and fixed it. we went again recently after not going to that taco bell for awhile. we went inside instead and ordered to go. it took forever! and they werent even busy!
