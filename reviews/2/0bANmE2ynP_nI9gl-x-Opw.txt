Don't get me wrong... I LOVE Senor Frogs. In Mexico, but not here.. The fun was great, the dancing and the view off the patio was great. Service was okay, but took a while to get our check. The prices were outrageous, and the free "shots" were only mixers with no alcohol. The Yard is priced at $24 BUT it's almost the same size as the $10 drink which the only difference is you get to keep the cup. Would I go there again? Probably not, the only thing I would do is go there to watch the Sirens show when its going on from the patio. I was sadly disappointed as it was my 30th birthday. And I have to say that both the Senor's I been to in Mexico (Mazatlan) and Ensenada and this was nothing close to either one of those...  I did not have any food, so I can't review that. Save yourself the cash and go somewhere else... And I have to add the drinks were just okay. My friend got one drink that tasted like it had too much syrup in it.
