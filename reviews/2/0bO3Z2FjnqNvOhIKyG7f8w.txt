I agree with everyone else lately. This place is going down hill mainly because of the employees. The food was good (even though the price went up a little) 

I came in tonight at approx 6 pm (10/16/14) with a family member to place a small to go order for 3 people.  The place was completely empty, The horchata drink machine was empty, there was nothing to put cucumbers and the sliced onions/peppers in. I used a napkin. There were only 2 employees. 1 was definitely new and didn't know how to ring in a create your own carne asada burrito (I chose my 2 toppings and wanted to pay for 1 extra), I chose my fillers and she didn't know how to do that either.  She had to tell the customer in drive thru on the radio, twice that she'd be right with him (holding him up outside because she was inexperienced inside),  Your ice tea machine and 2 soda all had tape labled out of order.  She didn't know how to give back change and didn't count it back to us (which could've caused her to be short in her drawer)  It's ok to only have minimum staff on, but your minimum staff can't be new/inexperienced and left alone. Food was made correctly and was good (thankfully)  but it's important this company reads their yelp reviews. This business is going down hill quickly !!!!  I unfortunately agree because I too have noticed the change from when you opened last year vs now, It was MUCH better when you first opened.
