I really do dislike writing bad reviews for anything, but I feel this experience merits a warning. I just moved here from south Texas, was really craving Mexican food, and felt too lazy to go sit in a restaurant, so delivery it was. I ordered a cheese quesadilla (with onion and tomato for a sad attempt at pico de gallo), and chips and salsa.

The quesadilla was incredibly greasy, the tomato chunks were quite large, and the onion was far too overpowering for my taste. The chips and salsa were another matter. The chips were edible, but they weren't my favorite. And warning with the salsa, if you order the spicy salsa, expect green salsa. I'm used to red, so the possibility of green didn't even cross my mind. I'm not a fan of green salsa, so my dislike is likely an artifact of my dislike of green salsa in general, not this specific salsa.

Plus side? The food was delivered about half an hour earlier than estimated.

Looking at the rest of the reviews, it doesn't appear that Cactus Grill is ALWAYS bad, so maybe mine was just a bad experience, but still...

TL;DR: greasy quesadilla, hard chips, green salsa, searching for another Mexican restaurant
