Whhyyyyyy?? 

Why do I get dragged here at least 3 times a year? The former location off of Shea was a little better but not by much.

Drinks way overpriced. Douchebag factor high. Bartenders and security are rude. 

One time I went to the DJ for a request, for some fun 80's hip hop. He gave me a dirty look then ignored me. 

I had the food once, and I totally regret it. It was bad, bad, bad.

Ugh.
