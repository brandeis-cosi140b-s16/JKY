The way I feel about Rubio's is pretty much the way I feel about Panda Express - if you have to eat there as an alternative to the real thing, you'll have an acceptable meal but wish you had gone somewhere spicier/more authentic/less greasy. Their chips and salsa bar isn't bad, and some of their food items (like the new grilled veggie tacos) are decent, but many other items just fall short. Also, anything that has shrimp in it features tiny, bland-tasting shrimp and will cost you extra. If you have to, go ahead, but in this neighborhood (and in the rest of Phoenix), you'll be able to find better Mexican food for lower prices.
