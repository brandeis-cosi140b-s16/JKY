With a name like America's Taco Shop, I had to check the place out.  

Got the "homemade" ceviche and the carne asada taco.  Thought the prices were a bit high for the quality and amount of food that I received.

The ceviche and tortilla chips that came with it were a bit bland.  The carne asada taco was good but not spectacular.

What got me though as I sat indoors in their dining room was I started to notice how dusty everything was.  There was a grimy layer of dust over all the decorations on the walls and the tops of the condiment bottles were frankly disgusting like they had not been wiped in ages.

So I decided to check out their bathroom.  Sure enough, the ladder they had leaning against the wall had a layer of dust on them . . . . 

and I felt a little grossed out . . . let's just say, if the public areas like the dining area and bathroom are not clean and well care for, I don't really want to imagine the condition in the kitchen . . .
