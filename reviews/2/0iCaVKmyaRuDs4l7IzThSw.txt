While there are some good items on the menu, the short answer is dine with caution. I would suggest dining here only out of convenience or perhaps happy hour.

Nachos appetizer is great! They include generous helpings of everything you would want. 

Steak Fajitas are abysmal. The quality of the steak was so low, that they should finely chop the steak Filberto's style (pre-chewed). For the price your paying, you will feel robbed.

The service was poor. The only person who seemed to care about what was going on was the Mexican in charge of chips service. I saw him frequently checking the dining room status. Unfortunately for us, the same attention was not paid by our waiter to our water or beer service. Waited 10+ minutes after chips to receive drinks. 

The ambiance - well decorated and remodeled from what it was prior. Good looking interior. We unfortunately were sat by a group of stay at home moms listening to a sales presentation for a weight wrap. While slightly hilarious, I would have expected any self-respecting business owner to realize how destructive to other patrons dining experience multiple 40 year old women standing and giving weight band sales testimonials would be.
