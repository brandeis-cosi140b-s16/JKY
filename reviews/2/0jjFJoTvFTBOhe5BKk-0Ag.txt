If you want the real thing, take the time to actually drive to Miami/Globe. This place is nothing like the food you get in Miami/Globe and just because they are extended family doesn't mean that you are getting same quality of food. While service was friendly, the food was not worth a first trip. Tostada was soggy and dripped liquid, they charge for chips that come in a bowl no bigger than the salsa bowl, and cleanliness was questionable. I truly do not like to write bad reviews, and generally don't. But there are so many better choices for both quality and value.  If you want Miami/Globe style, then take time to drive there. No extension comes close.
