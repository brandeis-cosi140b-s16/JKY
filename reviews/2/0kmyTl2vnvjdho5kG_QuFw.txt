Went here last week for dinner. We frequent the 44th and Indian School location and have been to another location in the west Valley. LOVE their food. 

But this location was probably one of the dirtiest restaurants I have ever been to or I can remember going to. Trash everywhere, spilled food all over the floors, dirty tables...I'm honestly not very picky and understand being busy, messy customers, etc. 

But I was preoccupied with thinking about how dirty everything else might have been the whole time I was eating. 

There were two or three other people in there, so it wasn't like they were swamped. 

Food wasn't great either. I won't be coming back.
