I don't understand why people would give this place 5 stars, as a matter of fact, I don't understand why people give mediocre places 5 stars.  5 stars is for the best thing you've ever eaten.  This place is no better than any of the other barf-o-berto's.  The parking lot smelled good and gave me hope, but as soon as we walked in, the smell instantly became something comparable to body order.  This place is pretty gross on the inside, about as gross as all the other berto's.  I ordered a #13 chimichanga with carne asada which is $1 extra.  They set the chimi on a bed of lettuce which, anyone with any sense would know, caused the lettuce to start weeping it's water out into the container.  So my chimi was going for a lettuce water swim.  We also got the two beef tacos, which were advertised as $5 on Monday special, but were charged full price anyway.  The cashier was not friendly, not unfriendly either, just kinda there.  We won't be coming back here.
