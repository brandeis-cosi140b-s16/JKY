I love Robertos. Always stop for rolled tacos. That comes for eating them in San Diego way, way back. We stopped at Roberto's on Russell today. Very disappointed. The rolled tacos were okay. Had a tostada and shell  tasted burnt . The salsa was empty (both kinds) and not brought out until we were ready to leave. We told the girl behind the counter that the ice machine was not making ice and nothing was done.  The pop machine looked like it needed a good cleaning. The area around the condiments was messy and looked bad. We did not eat any condiments. We were going to order some other food to go when we left but the service and appearance of many things left a bad taste in our mouth. I will still go to Robertos but will not come back to this one again.  I come from Wa State for these tacos....have never had an issue before and hope not to again!
