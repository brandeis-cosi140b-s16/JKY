I have been going to Cilantros since they opened.  The food is good, the reason for the low rating is because of an employee, actually I found out today she is the owners wife ( no wonder she still has a job)  this woman is so rude, she has no business working with the public, well, maybe as a bill collector. She never says hello or smiles just walks up and asks you what you want, her attitude is horrible!  The owner needs to seriously consider removing her from the position she currently has as I am sure she is hurting the business.
