This is the second time I've been to this location and they've been out of guacamole!! Like come on what's chipotle without quac!! The soda machine was also broken this time which was so annoying and was also out of ice so we were forced to drink room temperature water and wait 10 mins for our guacamole. All of these things I could've over looked of the staff hadn't been so rude. The cashier seemed overwhelmed and inexperienced and I felt like someone should've been there to help her. All of that being said I will just drive a little further from now on and go to the location on mill ave.
