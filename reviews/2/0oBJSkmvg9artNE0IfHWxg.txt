I came here for the express breakfast prior to a flight to Atlanta. It was pretty underwhelming. There were a few patrons here and there, so I can't speak about crowds, but I was craving breakfast and got the Huevos with bacon and potatoes, and it was served with a couple of flour tortillas on the side instead of bread. Huevos is spanish for eggs just so you all know. 

The meal was adequate. It wasn't horrible. But it wasn't too good either. The best part of the meal was the eggs, which were fluffy and buttery. They were delicious. Everything else was horrible. The bacon barely tasted like bacon. It was more like crispy salt sticks. The potatoes, which are hard to screw up, in fact were tasteless as well as soggy and mushy, and the tortilla, well it was hard, dry, and stale. In fact, that four tortilla was the most disgusting tortilla I had ever eaten in the 10 years I lived in AZ, and I had been around college kids who had no inkling on how to cook who knew how to properly heat up a tortilla.

However I must say that the customer service was great, and the food arrived in a timely fashion. So if you are craving breakfast and want fast service and good customer service, but do not care about the quality of the breakfast food, then look no further than this place. I will not be coming here again myself, at least for breakfast.
