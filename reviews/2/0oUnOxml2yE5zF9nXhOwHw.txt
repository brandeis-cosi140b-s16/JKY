My family and a neighbor family arrived at 8:05PM on Mother's Day, 8 of us total. Here on Yelp stated they were open until 9PM. They told us they were closed and turned us away, rather than get another good sale. I bet we could have eaten and been gone, still before others that "take up camp at a table".
