I've seen this place on Durango for a long time and finally decided to try it.  I hit the drive thru with one car in front of me.  I ordered the cheese enchilada combo and a large diet coke.  The car in front of me waited at the window for about 10 minutes before receiving their order of one to-go container.  I drove up and the gentleman at the window apologized for the wait and took my money.  I waited at least another 7 or 8 minutes for them to finally get my order.  I then had to ask for my drink and some hot sauce as none was offered.

Now I sit at my computer at work with my order......that is wrong!  They gave me chicken enchiladas instead of the cheese.  In fact there was almost no cheese anywhere on or in these enchiladas!  There was almost no sauce on them either.  They were practically dry!

Overall, a pretty bad experience from slow service to getting the wrong food that was not very good.  Next time, I will go to the usual Robertos.
