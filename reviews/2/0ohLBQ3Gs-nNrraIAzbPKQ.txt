I have been in the industry for years and I really don't like giving reviews like this. I really enjoy the food and have been here many times over the years, but the service I received tonight was bad and it was only a to-go order. I understand the restaurant was very busy for a Thursday night, but I tried calling four times and never got an answer. When I informed the manager who took my order once I arrived he just shrugged and said 'It's busy'. The food came out in a timely manner. When I arrived back to collect my order, there was no hostess/host at the front door for at least three minutes. Once I was greeted, the service was very impersonal. I am just disappointed with my experience and I am glad I took the food to-go. I really enjoy the food here, and I really hope that this review doesn't fall on deaf ears. Service really needs to improve, even on unusually busy nights.
