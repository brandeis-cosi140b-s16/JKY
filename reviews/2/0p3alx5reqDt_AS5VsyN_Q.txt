Ordered the Pollo Fundido and it wasn't what I expected at all. The description made it sound like an amazing and delicious dish but what came to the table was four squares of dry chicken with a slice of American cheese melted on top. If I knew this was what I was getting I wouldn't have ordered it... Especially not for 12.99. The free chips were great and the salsa was good but that was a disappointing meal. Would not recommend. The reviews definitely were misleading.
