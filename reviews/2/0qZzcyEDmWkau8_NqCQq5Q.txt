My friend and I went out to eat for a quick bite to eat- we both had nachos- I ordered mine with chicken and she ordered it with steak. Despite the large portion size, the nacho chips were dry and therefore texture wise felt stale. The cheese dried out and wasn't melted - in addition Both of our meats were dry. I would prefer to go to Emiliano's next time and get better nachos there.
