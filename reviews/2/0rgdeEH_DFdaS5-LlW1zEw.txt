The margarita, our server, and the queso appetizer are the saving graces of this review... The actual dinner entree portion of our meal was terrible. The dining room is a weird combination of what looks like old conference room furniture with little other decor or ambiance. Nothing I can't overlook if the meal is great, which unfortunately wasn't the case on Saturday night... Both the steak burrito and the vegetable fajitas were bland and nothing worth paying for. The fajitas were just a steamed plate of vegetables without any seasoning whatsoever and included an odd mixture of produce. We both left our dinner eating only the appetizer.
