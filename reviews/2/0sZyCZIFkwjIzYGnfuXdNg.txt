Pretty confused about the hype surrounding this place. I can appreciate the non gmo claim to fame and the vegan options... What I can't appreciate is their staff. I've never been here before and had no clue how anything worked. I mentioned I've never been and that I was vegan and no one explained anything to me. I chose the salad... They threw lettuce in a paper container and told me to choose from the options in front of me... I put some black beans, peppers, pico, salsa, guacamole. Yeah nothing fabulous... They were rude and sloppy with the food preparation. I will advise everyone to put the salsa and guacamole on the side because the over do both tremendously... Picture below. The company I was with made up for the shitty service and lack of appeal. The first bite you take is with your eyes... Get on the ball chipotle. I will give it another shot after I get a regular to explain how everything works since their staff sucks.
