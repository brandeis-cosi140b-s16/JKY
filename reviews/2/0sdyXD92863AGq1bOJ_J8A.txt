I ordered the steak burrito today and placed my order at 11:08.  12:55 rolls around and still no food so I called the store to see what the holdup was.  The guy on the other end says he'd get in touch with the delivery driver and see what was going on; this after telling me it should be 33 minutes because his driver was on my side of town.  I hung up expecting that he'd call and give me a new more accurate time to expect my food but 1:10 comes without a call and at this point I'm ready to cancel my order unless they're willing to take off some of the price for the long wait.  As I'm on the phone with him the second time my food finally came.   I shouldn't have tipped the driver but I did after he said that he'd gotten lost.  

On to the food itself.  The flavor was good when I tasted it.  Very unevenly distributed throughout my lukewarm meal in what  should have been a satisfyingly large burrito.  The rice was very bland in many parts and the sauce was a far cry from what I consider spicy.  To be fair I grew up in Texas so they may have been catering to Midwestern spicy which isn't nearly spicy enough for a south/southwest pallet.  For the $12 I paid after the tip, I should have gotten much better for my money.  

Oh and how they justify a $2 charge for delivery (which I found out after the driver was long gone) is beyond me.  It's too bad because I really wanted to like this place.  Maybe I'll have a better experience dining in but I might not have the stomach or wallet to give them a second chance.  A free or largely discounted meal would go a long way in chalking this up to a fluke.
