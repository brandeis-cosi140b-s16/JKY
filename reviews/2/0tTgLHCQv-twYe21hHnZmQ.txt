Met up here with a large group for HH earlier tonight.  It was my first visit to this new location, and it was pretty busy for a Thursday.  While I might try it again just due to the location, the service was so horrible that it will be a long time before I consider organizing another large group function there.  

I arrived after my group's first round had been served, and I think it was almost 30 minutes before I could get a drink!  Furthermore, one of the guys in our group finally went up to the bar to get a round of drinks since so many of us had been waiting so long, and he was turned around and told to go sit and wait for the server.  Not cool after a long day at the office!  That combined with turning off the misters a bit too early on a hot evening = a one drink and bad first impression HH for me.
