The concept of this place is crazy.  It's also bordering on criminal to charge $4 and up per taco regardless of how good the ingredients are.  The Chinese food well let's just put that aside. 

The tacos are pretty good but seriously these prices are absurd even by Vegas standards especially the portion size.  I can get tacos in many places in LA or OC for $1.25 that are many times superior (2 Guys, Taco Leo).  Taking aside these huge issues the tacos are good but not as authentic - I don't care how many abuelas you have making toritllas in the front of the house.

The Chinese food is like a more authentic version of PF Chang but dim sum style.  Again the food is tasty but about 3x in price of much better stuff I can get in dozens of places in SGV. 

The Bazaar is great this place is just weird and expensive.
