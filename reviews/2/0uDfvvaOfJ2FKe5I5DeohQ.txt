Lindo - on DI used to be a great place.  But it seems like the secret got out, the business grew and quality suffered.  It kind of reminds me of going to a large chain style Mexican Restaurant in Southern Cal.  If that's your thing - this place is for you.  I leave here feeling like I have consumed 100lbs of salt, it's very loud and parking is tough.  But it does have the best view in town.
