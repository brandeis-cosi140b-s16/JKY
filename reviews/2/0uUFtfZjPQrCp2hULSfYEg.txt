From a gluten free perspective, they really could do better, especially since they are a mexican restaurant, it should be easier to have gluten free options.  They do have a gluten free menu but there are only about 5 or 6  things on it.  One was a machaca bowl and one a chicken bowl.  I asked if there is rice in the bowl and the waitress said no, the rice contains wheat.  So, I'm not sure what was in the bowl other than meat.  The other things on the GF menu included veggie fajitas or shrimp fajitas minus the corn tortilla (the waitress told me the corn tortillas have wheat but they were on the GF menu).  I ordered the ultimate nachos (which weren't even on the GF menu) and they were good.  I excluded a couple of items that might have gluten.  I did not get sick.  The waitress did not speak very good english, so it was a risk eating anything there.
