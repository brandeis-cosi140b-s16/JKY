Geezus I wish I would have looked at the reviews first! This TINY burrito just cost me $7! I asked the size and she Did say 7" but there is hardly anything in it! It might as well be called a rolled taco! SMDH I should have toughed out the line at Chipotle!! This is ridiculous. 
The guac in the carne asada burrito is okay. The salsa that comes with it is okay. The tortilla is pretty good - thank goodness it's not chewy like mission tortillas, but it could have been cooked longer or warmed up at the very least. Burrito wasn't even hot, much less warm. The meat had good flavor to it... Still WAY over priced for the amount/size of a cold burrito. 

Came in starving, left hungry.
