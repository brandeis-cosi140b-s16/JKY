I've been going to this place for years, sometimes the food is fresh and hot sometimes...not so much.  Really depends on who you get at the window or at least that's my experience, there's a dude whose kind of creepy the way he talks and leans in the window, always make sure your food is right off he's serving you.  Next time I'll get this guy's name because it's a real problem, the last order we had today was messed up so bad it's hard to believe someone could mess up that bad.
