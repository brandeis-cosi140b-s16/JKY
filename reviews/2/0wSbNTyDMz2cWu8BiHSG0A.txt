I've been here twice and this review is for my second visit. I came for lunch with a friend. They were no specials so I had the flautas with beans. Now a flauta is just a fried, rolled tortilla stuffed with something. Not hard to get wrong. These flautas were not very tightly wrapped and the beans were just laying in inside. The plus is that the lunch was $6 or so with rice, beans, and lettuce. I was just disappointed overall.
