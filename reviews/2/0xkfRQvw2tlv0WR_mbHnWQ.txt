I actually really enjoy a few of their menu items. The sheh-meh-neh burrito with sweet potato puree, chicken, rice, and pickled red onions is friggin delicious. The black bean dip stuff and several other items I've had from there are really yummy, and the food is in generous portions.  So on flavor and promptness I give this 4/5.
    However, now that I have ordered their food several times, I can sadly report that they screw up the order more regularly than I can tolerate, occasionally the people I speak to on the phone seem to have no idea what they have on their menu or how to operate the computer, and sometimes a burrito will arrive so badly composed that all of one item will be in one part of the burrito, another in the middle, another at the other end. Which obviously makes a much less delicious meal.  So on service and consistency, a 2. 
   I also had the misfortune to order the 'Goldenrod Tres Leches' the other day. It's $6.50, so I expected it would actually maybe be a real piece of cake, perhaps. To my HORROR  when it arrived, it turned out to comprise of 3 twinkies swimming in condensed milk and then frozen. ABOMINATION! KILL IT!  To be fair I even tried to eat it. This proved impossible.  I had half a mind to call and yell at whatever poor soul happened to be manning the phone that day and demand my money back for the atrocity they served me. How could they even justify such an item? Let alone charging almost $7 after tax for it. But then, all their items seem just a tad overpriced. So for price I give it a 2 or 3/5.  Its still affordable, but some items are much more overpriced than others.
   Overall, I may someday crave a certain heavy burrito again, but I wouldn't generally go out of my way to recommend this place.
