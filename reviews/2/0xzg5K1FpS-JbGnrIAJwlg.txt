Went to this restaurant for the first time today for lunch and it was a huge disappointment.  The prices were very high in ratio to portion and quality.  I ordered the half kale salad and it was very very small and almost $12 once I added chicken.  They charged $5.75 for 3 little chicken strips.  Then it arrived with a different dressing than listed on the menu and they told me they don't have the dressing it comes with.  

The salsa was warm and bland.  It's a personal preference, but I like cold salsa.  My father's salad was missing the tortilla strips and my mothers enchiladas were ver small.  Three little enchiladas.  We wanted to order fajitas, but the lunch portion was $16.95 and then they charge $2.00 each for a tiny guacamole, sour cream, and cheese.  

The restaurant was empty, only us and 1 other table the entire time we were there from 11:45 to 12:30.  I'm not surprised.  They did remove the charge for my salad which I appreciated.  We also witnessed one gentleman come to place a take out order and get frustrated because everyone was walking around like they didn't know what to do for him.  Then a lady came for takeout and was contesting her order because they charged her $1.50 for a teeny little cup full (the size of something that a hospital would put a med in to give you)

The flavor of the food was average, the prices were sky high, and overall we were disappointed.  I'm giving 2 stars only because the staff was friendly to us and tried very hard and it wasn't their fault the prices were too high and the quality wasn't up to par.  

We won't be going back.  It's sad because there hasn't been a restaurant survive in this location and we were really looking forward to having a Mexican restaurant in the neighborhood.
