This is the first time I had been to any Chipotle, and I was not impressed. The girl only seemed to half listen and kept trying to rush me. Now, despite it being my first time, I already had an idea of what I wanted, since everyone at my internship eats there. So I knew what they had, but when I told her what I wanted she would either start to mess it up and I would repeat it again (always before she had a chance to put anything on it) and she acted exasperated that I wasn't just willing to take whatever she was about to put on it. Also, it was ok food, I won't rave about it but I didn't dislike it either. Better than some and for quick and convenient not bad. So I may try it again at another location, but definitely won't eat at that location again since I do not like being rushed to the point where I don't get what I want when ordering.
