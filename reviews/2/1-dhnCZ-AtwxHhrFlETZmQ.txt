The service here was Awesome but the food was sub par. It honestly tasted like something one of my cousins who was a teenager would make when her mom told her to make dinner . The guacamole was horrible and we told them but still got charged for it. The salsa was watered down and the taste did not feel authentic at all. Through my entire meal i read and re-read the yelp revies wondering if i was at a different location or something because this does not taste better the robertos and I was searching and searching for these "great prices"??
