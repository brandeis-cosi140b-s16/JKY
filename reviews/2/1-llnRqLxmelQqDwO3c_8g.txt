Disappointing was my main feeling with this place. I wanted to love it and I was let down from the minute I realized.. no bar.. no beer.. nothing.. Aqua.. was tasty.. but.. I needed a drink! 

Best thing.. Chips and Salsa.. Really good chips.. big flaky chips.. really nice flavor.. the salsa.. kinda spicy and was very good as well. My anticipation climbed for dinner. Chicken Fajitas.. Well.  it was disappointing.. Nothing to it.. was . flavorless and really sub par. My girl ordered Carne asada.. like a piece of meat.. no taste.. just there.. 

Really nice treat was the Tortilla Soup.. really good and hd some spice in it so I was really expecting better food. It was served as a complimentary dish and was a nice treat!
 
Now I wish i had better things to say.. but I don't.. Employees were really nice and I had great service but the food was really plain. No imagination or spice introduced at all. 

Skip it for now.. let them get a real cook and a liquor license.
