We were here when there was a happy hour special on carnitas and carne asada tacos. The place was pretty busy so we were surprised that the meat was over cooked, as if it had been sitting out awhile. 

I ordered my taco without onions but it arrived with red onions on it. The cashier insisted there weren't onions on it. It went so far that I picked out an onion and put it up to her face and said "smell it! It's an onion!" (Meanwhile my husband is enjoying a good laugh) She did smell it, apologized and asked the kitchen to remake it. I know minimal Spanish but I could tell they were arguing about it with her. Then they smell it and agree to make me a new taco. Seriously - couldn't you SEE the red onions or at least look before arguing about it?

The hatch chile salsa is spicy but good. Red was typical, nothing special. My husband said his carne asada was dry and bland. 

Based on dry meat and arguing about what they're serving me, not sure we will be back.
