What a disappointment!!! Ambiance is one thing, but when the waiter has to hand you a mini flashlight in order to read the menu it's just too darn dark.  The music was so loud that we had to lean in to hear each other. The bartender seems to think that a cosmopolitan is just a vodka cranberry served In a fancy glass. The shrimp cocktail was chewy and tasted like recently thawed frozen shrimp. While we were still chewing our first bite of shrimp, the entrees arrived....within 90 seconds of the appetizer.  That is a huge pet peeve.  It's just common sense that you don't serve the main course until the starter is completed.  Never again, Javier, never again.
