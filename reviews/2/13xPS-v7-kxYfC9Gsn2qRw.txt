I have to say I was disappointed with the ambience - or lack thereof at Carlos O'briens. The decor is more "Cafeteria-Style". On our visit it was not busy so we were seated immediately and a large basket of chips and two kinds of salsa were promptly delivered to our table. I have had better salsa however, my lunch companion thought the salsa was good.

I ordered the chicken fundido as did my lunch companion. In what seemed like an impossibly short time our orders were placed in front of us. I have to say that the entrees served at Carlos O'briens are of very generous portions.  In fact,  there was enough there for two to share.  You definitely get your money's worth.  However, I really didn't care for the taste of the chicken fundido.  The chicken was very dry and the sauce didn't have much flavor.

On a positive note our server, was very attentive and wanted to make sure everything was to our liking.
