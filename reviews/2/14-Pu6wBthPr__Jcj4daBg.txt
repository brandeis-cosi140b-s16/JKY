I chose this place for a few reasons. 
1. I was craving Mexican food. 
2. I had a coupon. 
3. The yelp reviews seemed decent. 

Honestly, I should have known I wouldn't have liked the food when the complimentary chips and salsa were brought to the table. The green salsa was overly sweet and the red salsa had little, if any flavor. Yeah...moving on. I ordered the spinach enchiladas and the BF ordered the Crab relleno. The "crab" was actually imitation crab, which is fine, but it should be listed as such. The spinach enchiladas left something to be desired. 

Bottom line. I would have been more than satisfied eating Taco Bell. Yeah. It was that bad.
