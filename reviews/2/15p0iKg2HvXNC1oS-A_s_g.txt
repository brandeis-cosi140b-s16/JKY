I can't help but agree with Sean D. below.... I have been going to Tex Tubb's since it opened and have lived around the corner for the past three years, and everything about the place has gone seriously downhill in the past year. We keep going back in hopes that we'll land on something tasty off the new-ish menu, but there are really only few options that appeal there now.  

The last time we ate dinner there I ordered the "Big Bowl of Pork Chile Verde" and all at the table agreed that its color/texture resembled dogfood. It was a mushy, flavorless grey paste with tough strands of pork throughout.  I couldn't eat more than two bites. The accompanying blue corn muffin was raw in the center.  I've sampled quite a few of the new menu's tacos. Most are ok, but they all suffer from the new tortillas-- the old ones were really good and I think soft corn? and at least tasted house-made. These are more grocery store- chewy and flavorless. 

The chips used to be hot, crispy, and perfect! Now they taste like stale Tostitos.  Ironically, they also used to be free, and now there's a charge for them. It was a big letdown the first time we went after the chip change- we don't get them anymore. 

Tex Tubb's used to have a fun, kitschy vibe.  That's been replaced with grime, slow service, and cheap fixtures. I miss the old fashioned photo booth, but I miss the clean bathrooms more!
