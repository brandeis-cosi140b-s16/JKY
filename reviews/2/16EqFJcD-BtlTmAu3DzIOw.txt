Food was pretty good but read the menu carefully because there's some interesting little "surprises" such as pomegranate seeds in the guacamole. Unique... sure... but it made me feel like a picky little kid (pet peeve of mine btw). The Posole was really amazing but the place gets 2 stars because the service was unbelievably S-L-O-W. There were only 3 parties including us in the place and we still didn't see the waitress for way too long. At one point I had to get up to go find her. Plus... I overheard her giving much better explanations about HH pricing and menu options to other tables. Would have appreciated hearing that info before ordering.
Overralll... not coming back.
