Tonight was my first and last visit to this restaurant.  A friend had recommend we give it a try, so my wife, mother-in-law, and myself decided we would go on their recommendation.  There were very few cars parked outside the restaurant, which should have tipped me off.  In the end, the service was very slow - not sure why, but they may have simply been understaffed.  The waiter was nice and polite, but we ran out of chips and had to ask to get more, and then had to wait a long time for our check at the end of the meal.  All three of us thought the food was very subpar.  I had cheese enchiladas, which are kinda hard to mess up, but they were dry and had a weird taste.  The rice was not very good, and was also very dry.  The refried beans were the best part of the meal, which my mother-in-law agreed with.  My wife had the vegetable plate, and thought it was passable, but nothing to write home about.  We all gave it a thumbs down and agreed it would not be worth it to come back.  We had just gone to Arriba for mexican food just a few days ago, and found it to be a few steps above El Palacio.

in addition, they do not allow firearms into the restaurant, so if you are a law abiding concealed-carry kind of person, you should know that you are not welcome at this restaurant...another reason for a less then stellar review.
