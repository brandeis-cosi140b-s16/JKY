I've come to this restaurant once before and their food was amazing. Pricing is great and the service was so so. My last trip here, I was very disappointed. They had changed their whole menu and ingredients. I was also told that they don't serve burritos here. I was confused. I'm from California and the last thing a Mexican food place lacks is it's burrito selection. By the time you get your low quality food, you're not hungry anymore. Our sever didn't care that my group and I were dissatisfied she just rolled her eyes at any request from us. It's sad because we considered this little place a hidden gem. Boo!
