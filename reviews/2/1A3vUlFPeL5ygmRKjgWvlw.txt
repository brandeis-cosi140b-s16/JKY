VOMIT ... I give it two stars because it had food, and I thin I got drunk ... The salsa was horrible.. WTF was it .. it was tomato sauce and some tabasco mixed together I swear, the service had sucked, I don't know how they stay in business... I went on a bad date their.. so I ended up drinking I think that was the only thing good about the place
