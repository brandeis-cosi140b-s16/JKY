Well, let me start by saying that I don't claim to be a Mexican expert.  I enjoy Mad Mex and I'm not an expert on "authentic" Mexican food.  I can vouch that I've enjoyed Mexican places here, San Fran and also in the motherland (of Mexico).  What I will say about this place is that there is no excuse for stale chips....or bad side dishes...

So first impression doesn't start well if you've been served stale chips.  YUCK!  I also was SUPER into the Horchata drink I received in San Fran so I wanted to try it at what some people say is an "authentic" Mexi place in the Burgh.  It was really just awful!  It was like the Cinnamon flavor was WAY too strong.  GROSS....didn't even drink it after the first sip.  

For the entree I ordered the Mexico City Chicken Enchiladas.  I actually didn't mind these. The shrimp red sauce topping was fab (and I loved the shrimp) and the chicken was great.  It wasn't shredded, which I really hate getting in Mexi restaurants because I feel like they just take it out of a can.  Speaking of can, the side dish of Zucchini tasted like it was out of a can of Veggie Campbell's soup.  Really weird side dish.  Not a fan.

I was really disappointed with this place because I had heard so many good things from some trusted Mexi experts.  They will still be my friends...however this place will not be on my food friendly list ever again!
