2 Storey's of moderately passable mexican. The salsa is what pulls them down, along with the beans... they tasted like they wanted to be yummy and just weren't. 

ON the PLUS side were the plethora (tell me Jefe do you know what a plethora is?) of SUPER MEGA chips in my basket of chips... if you don't know what a super mega chip is, let me tell you:

It's a corn chip that has multiple corn chips folded into one another, often with the center being chewy because it's not fully fried. YUM

Thank you and goodnight.
