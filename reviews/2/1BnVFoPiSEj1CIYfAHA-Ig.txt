I'm use to the Favritos in Chandler and Scottsdale. This is Favritos isn't so good. 3 visits and each time I'm disappointed. Payed for food and drinks, so I set food down on table and go back to the cashier to ask for my drinks and she asked if I paid?? Really, I just gave you my money and you handed me my food.....really?? Argue with me some more....
The food was ok and isn't up to the quality of the other Favritos.
