It has gone downhill.  It used to be great food and  great service. Now it's just ok. The only reason we go is for Taco Tuesday. $2, 3, 4 tacos available.  I used to get the fish tacos.  We went last night and those were no longer on the Taco Tuesday menu.  Not wanting to spend a lot I decided to try a chicken taco and pork taco. I was very clear to the waitress that I needed a corn tortilla and not flour  (wheat allergy). She was understanding and said she'd make sure the kitchen staff knew. 

Unfortunately when she brought it back one of the tacos had a flour tortilla. The waitress was very sweet about taking it back to the kitchen and having the issue fixed. But it shouldn't have happened at all-they were not busy when we were there. The food was "meh". The margarita pitchers were  weak. I drank nearly an entire pitcher by myself and felt nothing.  Our waitress was the best part of the entire experience.  And the nice bus boy that was willing to take a family photo of us. We probably won't be back, we can make better tacos at home.
