It was one of those nights. Perfect weather for dining outside, good friends to converse with and time...lots of time. All we needed was a place to dine. It was a unanimous vote. Mexican! So we elected to get out of York Co. and head to Charlotte. Zapata's Ballantyne. Upon arrival we asked for an outside table. We were instead sat inside. Yes, there were plenty of tables available  both in or out. But that didn't matter too much to this gang. We were ready to grub so what did matter most was the food. The chips were hot, the salsa not. But they had green salsa, which is VERY hot and a big hit with the guys at our table. (Hint. You have to ask for it. Not on the menu.) The only complaint with the entree's we ordered was the Pollo Fundido has a slice of american cheese melted on the top. NO AMERICAN CHEESE should ever be allowed on anything...PERIOD! Will I return? Maybe. I think it deserves another shot. 
My lunch experience was 100% better than my dinner one. Just sayin'!
