instructions on how to properly enjoy a meal at eribertos:
step 1.
consume vast quantities of alcohol. certainly any spirit will do, however I find that the cheaper the liquor, the better. I prefer 40 oz of a nice malt liquor bagged in paper.
step 2. 
avoid items like lengua, tripe, or various organ meat. while these may certainly be delicious, they are not a great suggestion for pale patrons, those with IBS, or generally any restaurant with a drive thru window.
step 3. 
examine your food before consumption. and i cannot stress this enough, often times there are "stow aways" hidden discretly inside the wrappings of a tortilla. these may and have ranged in my experience (though not necessarily at Eribertos) from pieces of metal, bandaids, hair, hang nails, to the dreaded and unexpected forms of human excrement.
step 4.
leave the contents of your order inside you take away bag. consuming your food inside your vehicle is akin to texting while driving, and is not only dangerous to yourself but others. if you must eat in your car, please do so while parked. a word of caution: consuming eribertos inside ones vehicle can and will leave a stench that permeates the interior for days to weeks.
step 5.
procure yourself in advance some form of antacid or beano, if not properly followed vicious gas may wreak havoc on your stomach for the ensuing several hours of digestion.
