I was really looking forward to this place after reading an article about it in the San Diego Magazine.  Went here twice.  First had some Asian style tacos and they were just ok.  For $5.00 each though?  Way to much for what I got and what I tasted.  Came back a second day to try a noodle soup bowl, and it sucked.  It was a combo of Bak Choy and shrimp dumplings.  What was horrible though was the lack of flavor in the broth and the noodles were actually somewhat crunchy.  I really am sad to give this place a poor review, because the servers were actually decent.  However, I will  never come back here.  I feel like they won't be here too long.
