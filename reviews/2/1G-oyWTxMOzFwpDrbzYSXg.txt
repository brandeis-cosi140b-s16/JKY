Dined early on a Saturday evening. Service was fine, ambience fine, ran into friends--perfect neighborhood night out. Too bad the kitchen didn't deliver even acceptable fare. Appetizers: Why can't chips be warm, cheese dip warmer? Mains: the enchilada was okay but carnitas had too much cinnamon, green chili sauce was unremarkable. And why can't cook follow server's note on diner's choice of beans? Why can't fish tacos have more than an overcooked finger of fish? Why all that cabbage slaw I'm still trying to digest? 

Wanted to disprove other reviews but nope, have to join the chorus.
