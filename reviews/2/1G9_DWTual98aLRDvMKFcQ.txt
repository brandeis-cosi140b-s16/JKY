I still don't love this place - the food is pretty bad and, when sitting on the patio, it can take forever to get a drink (I think its understaffed out there) - however I went recently the night before Thanksgiving (busiest bar night of the year) and have to say the service was awesome in the front bar and my drink was super yummy (Pimms cup). I'm not sure of the bartenders name (it was a woman with dark hair if I remember correctly) but she was great. Also, I always appreciate when I get good service even though I'm not a heavy drinker. I recognize that the bartender could focus on people racking up a higher tab (and I do feel this is often justified...service industry is seriously underpaid and you gotta do what you gotta do to make more tip money) but I didn't get this impression here. Kudos to the bartender but still eh on Cantina.
