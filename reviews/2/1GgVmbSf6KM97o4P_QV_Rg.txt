I'll try to keep this to the facts. I'm from LA. We have good mexican food. Diego is NOT good mexican food. Maybe if you come from the midwest or east coast and you have little to compare it to, but I don't know how else people think this is good. I got the "pollo al horno con mole," which is supposed to be a signature dish. I couldn't even eat the chicken because there were chewy bits of cartilage and god knows what all through it. So I stuck to the rice. My boyfriend had some beef tacos, the meat was completely overcooked and chewy and gross and served with no guac or salsa, so they were bland. It took them forever to get the food out, One of the people we were with could tell her bland enchiladas were left under a heating lamp and forgotten since they were crusty. Every sauce tasted like Mole sauce, no matter what they called it. The tortilla soup was OFFENSIVELY salty. This was just not good mexican food. Mexican food is not BLAND food, yet they somehow made it bland oversalted crap. 

The reason I'm giving them 2 stars instead of one is that the chips and salsa beforehand was decent. As was my sangria. Not worth going to dinner there though, by any means. I was SO disappointed because Vegas is supposed to have so many excellent restaurants, and this was so crappy.
