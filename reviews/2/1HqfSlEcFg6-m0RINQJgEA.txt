Disclaimer: I used to work in LA where my lunch options were a line of lunch trucks everyday. I ate from the famous Kogi truck and the other copycats at least once a week. So this review might be a bit skewed because I already have a set expectation of what I want it to taste like. 

I ordered the pork taco and tofu & egg taco, along with a side of fries. I didn't see an option to order the famous garlic fries that everyone was raving about though. But, it's all good- I was there for the tacos. 

There were quite a few people in front of me but I didn't mind because I just made my way over to the Snow Ono truck parked next door. Plus, they had some great oldies playing- kriss kross (jump, jump) and sublime. 

Okay- onto the food.  2.5 stars.
*The seasoning on the fries was nice, but the fries themselves didn't taste fresh.  
*The pork taco had a nice flavor, as did the egg & tofu, but I was disappointed with the kimchi.  I appreciated the texture, but was hoping for more of that kimchi kick.
*I am also used to a soft corn tortilla- and these were enveloped by a hard, chewy flour tortilla. 

Regardless, I ate the entire thing and will probably return because it is definitely tastier than any fast food joint.  It is right around the corner from where I live so if I see a short line- I will definitely give the Nate dog and Sweet dough a try, with hopes to update this review.
