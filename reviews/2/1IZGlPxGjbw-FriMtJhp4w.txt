Here's the deal- As far as food goes, this place deserves 5 stars, its inventive, fresh, Mexican food and always amazing. The location is great and I would love to frequent it. However, the owner Azucena Tovar always comes off as a little ambivalent about her clientel, and I just can't get over it. We eat out a lot. My expectation and hope is an evening with great company, food, and service. Great company I can handle, great food Los Sombreros has covered...but the service makes me wince. The owner is the first person to greet you at the door and she is abrasive and has been rude (kinda sets the tone, it's her place after all). Not once, not twice, but several times. I try and support businesses that value and appreciate their clients, especially in this financial climate. So my compromise is take-out. We only (rarely) order take-out and on the condition my husband picks it up so I dont have to be reminded why we no longer eat there. Christmas tamales are to die for.
