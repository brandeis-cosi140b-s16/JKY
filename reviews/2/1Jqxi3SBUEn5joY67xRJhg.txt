I love the food, but this location is bottle necked at lunch.  We did an online order and I waited 20 minutes past the time the order was due to get the food.  Other Chipotle's have a second door and register with the food ready when you get there so you are not in competition with people ordering at the restaurant.  Won't get lunch there again.
