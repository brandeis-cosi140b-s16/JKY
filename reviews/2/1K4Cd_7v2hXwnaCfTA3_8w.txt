This is airport food so I did not have very high expectations. It is OK and the beer was cold but the food is definitely mediocre. Service was friendly and efficient so no quibble there. 
I ordered the  blue corn quesadillas and a Fat Tire beer. Let me just say the fact they had Fat Tire on tap helped boost the star up to a 2. The blue corn tortillas were nice and warm but rubbery. The chicken, while slightly flavorful, was dried out. The cheese and vegetables were very skimpy. The guacamole and sour cream served on the side were a necessary addition to help the palatableness of the dish. 

The service was pleasant and attentive so that also helped pull it off the dreaded one star rating. 

The food is pricy for the quality - $20. Again this was not unexpected as it is an airport food place and they do have a captive audience. 

It is an OK alternative to the usual fast food and it is a sit down waiter serves you type of place. Always welcome while in limbo.
