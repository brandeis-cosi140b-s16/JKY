I don't know why we have to suffer with a terrible Taco Bell so close to us. It seems silly that, when the Taco Bell craving comes on, we should drive past one to go to one better, yet I think I should start doing this now.

Though it's been through several changes in management in the two years we've lived in this area, this Taco Bell is almost always the same: lackluster, unenthusiastic employees and dirty surroundings. The tables are never, ever clean, and there is rarely someone at the front - the cooks have to call for someone to get to the register when someone comes in.

Last time we were there, there were no straws, the tables were dirty despite having been open only 5 minutes, and the drink machine was malfunctioning, spraying soda everywhere. Also, it made my tummy hurt.
