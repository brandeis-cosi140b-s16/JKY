I ate at this place today for lunch.  It was a group of 5 of us, we walked in and were immediately seated at a table. As soon as we sat down she took our drink orders and came back quickly with our drinks and 2 sets of chips and salsa. She then took our food order and without even writing it down she got everything correct on our orders. The food was ok. Nothing special, just your typical Mexican restaurant. Except my "crunchy" taco was soggy and wet. I mean really, drain the meat before you put it in the taco. My major complaint is with our waitress. Though she was quick, she was super lazy! Our table was in the middle of the floor with plenty of room to walk around us. However, she put everything we asked for (With the exception of main entrees & drinks) at one corner of the table and just walked away. Chips & Salsa, Straws, Napkins, Extras (Sauce, lettuce, tortillas, etc), a box(only 1 of us needed it and she sat on the other end of the table) and even our checks!! I mean really lady?? You can't even hand us our own checks? So the whole time we were passing things across the table that she was too lazy to hand to the person who ordered it. We're sitting there looking at each others checks trying to figure out whose is whose!! Absolutely ridiculous. The entire time she never even smiled! Not once! Not a thank you or anything! I will definitely not be returning to this place on my own.
