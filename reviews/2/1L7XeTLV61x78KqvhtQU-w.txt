I have eaten at this place at least 40-50 times over the past 2-3 years and the place has always been one of my top restaurants in town.  However the last 4 times I have been there, service and quality has really gone downhill.  

After last night's dinner experience, I probably won't be going back for some time. Prices have always been on the high side, but I didn't have an issue with that when the quality was good.  However last night dinner came to $148 for 2 people -- with no dessert.  Drinks were small and $14 for an average margarita. 

My friend and I each had 2 margaritas.  Dirty dishes and glasses were never removed from the table.  My chicken dish was way over cooked -- almost like rubber.  The dish was served with cold unseasoned steamed zucchini and bland mashed potatoes which looked burned.  My friend ordered a steak medium-well.  It came out almost raw on the inside.  When this was brought to the attention of the server, he never apologized and simply grabbed the plate away and later returned with the meat cooked to something that looked medium-rare.  We didn't feel like complaining again.  During the entire dinner I asked 3 times to the server to have our water glasses filled, but it never happened.  I know some places can have an off night, but again this was the 4th time in a row for poor food and service.  I am sad to say that Barrio Cafe is officially off my list.
