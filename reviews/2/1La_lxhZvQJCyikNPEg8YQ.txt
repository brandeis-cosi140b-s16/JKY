Burritos here overrated and expensive. Disappointed especially because it was about nine bucks for a burrito that should be about four dollars. Chipotle burritos are way better and cheaper. I got two different burritos, green chili and pork and carne Asada, both way overpriced. I'm thinking because they got popular on yelp and have a lot of Caucasian customers they will charge more. Well I think their popularity got to their heads. I don't think I'll come back. My burrito was too soggy by the way. Good salsa good chips.
