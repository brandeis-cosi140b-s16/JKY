Had some apps & drinks here a couple nights ago. They have a really nice patio & it's a pretty nice location.

I'm all about food though.  We had mini chimis, beef taquitos & spinach artichoke dip - nothing sexy. Seemed like the mini chimis & taquitos likely came frozen in a huge bag - have enjoyed ones we've gotten in the frozen section of the supermarket more. The spinach artichoke dip was kind of bizarre too. Tasted predominately of cream/sour cream without much flavor. 

Would go back for a social thing but if we ordered food here, definitely would try something different.
