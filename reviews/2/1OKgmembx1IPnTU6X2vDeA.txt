This place obviously was made for tourists to go to, so I had that in mind going in.  But, it was still not the greatest. 

I ordered the chorizo sopes (which is actually listed as an appetizer) and they were super bland. Someone else in their review said that it was authentic mexican food with a twist. I don't think that there was anything authentic about the food.  They looked authentic and had the title, but the taste was nowhere close.  Want Carne Asada?  You can't even find that here. I would've probably been better off just eating chips and salsa, which the waiter was nice enough to make sure that we had an abundance of and ended up bringing 5 baskets of chips and constantly refilling (there were 7 of us). 

I actually went on the mechanical bull, and while that was fun, I primarily came for food, not a mechanical bull.

I enjoyed the atmosphere (a wall of sugar skulls, paintings, and another wall of elaborate crosses), but the music was loud and terrible.  

The food was obnoxiously overpriced, hence why I went with an appetizer, but even that was still $16. 

Waiter was nice.  He's probably what saved the review to be 2 stars.

I don't really plan on coming back here.  If I get pulled into it again, I'm probably going to eat somewhere else beforehand and just have their Sangria.
