Not fusion. Not affordable. Not creative.

I could have done better myself for a fraction of the cost with better ambiance in my hotel room at NY-NY.

Mediocre service was the icing on the cake. (no water, no silverware... Until the tortilla line cook noticed we were just sitting there debating whether or not to use the dessert spoons left at our place settings -- not too handy for a meal mostly consisting or romaine lettuce.). I'm not Paris Hilton, but paying $50 for less than 750 calories is ridiculous. 

Otherwise the food was tasty given that we had no expectations of Jose Andres.
