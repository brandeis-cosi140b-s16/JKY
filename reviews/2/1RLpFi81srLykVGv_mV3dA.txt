We saw a great review in the  republic recently and decided to hAve our anniversary dinner here.  A big mistake!  it is expensive and the food is not good.  we ordered patron silver margaritas for $22 and they had no mix at all - just ice and tequila.  A watered down drink that I should have sent back.  it was the worst margarita I have ever had.  We could not have the happy hour price on our appetizer because we chose to sit in the restaurant section for dinner afterward instead of the bar.  This makes no sense to me because we were just a few feet away.  We ordered the soft rib eye tacos and guacamole.  The tacos were awful and full of gristle.  The guacamole was good and the salsa and chips excellent.  Service was very slow.  We ate two baskets of chips waiting for our dinner so needless to say we took half home.  Our entrees were the pork carnitas and seafood crepes.  The crepes were very good and the pork not so much - very bland with little flavor.  The rice side had been reheated many times and not fresh and was also bland.  The mixed veggie side was very good.  We sat near the patio doors and froze because they would not keep the doors shut.  Our server tried but could not answer even the simplest questions and ran off to ask someone else.  The ambience is good and so is the location but we will not be going back.  Our bill was $100 and for this amount it should have been better.
