Chips are too thick. Salsa has no flavor just kick. They need to add some garlic to it. 

Pollo fundito was all tortilla and barely any chicken. Spanish rice was just plain colored rice, flavorless. 

Table was was dirty, full of salt and debris. 

Expensive too. A place in QC has the same dish for $5 less and they are good!

Not coming back.
