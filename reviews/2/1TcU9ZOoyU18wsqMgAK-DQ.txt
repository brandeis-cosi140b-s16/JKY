I've been here many times over the years, but have noticed the quality and taste of the food has gone down. The waitresses are still friendly, but it takes a really long time to eat there due to the restaurant's skeleton crew. (The tamales have no meat in them, just FYI) The place is still welcoming and comfortable.
