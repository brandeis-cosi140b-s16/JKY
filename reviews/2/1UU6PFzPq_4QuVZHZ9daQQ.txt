Good food. Nice flavors. Although the last time I went the chicken was very chewy.

2 things:

They didnt have their health grade posted. They had it tucked away behind a counter. It was a B. And the last I went with my husband he waited 10 minutes to order because the guy taking the order was too busy talking to his friend and kept telling him, "ill be right with you." Unproffesional. Because of that, I will not be going back.
