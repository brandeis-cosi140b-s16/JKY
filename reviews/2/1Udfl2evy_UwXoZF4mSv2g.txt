I had huge expectations for this place and it just disappointed. The place is over hyped, the way people talk about I thought it was gonna be the best thing ever. It was mediocre at best. It's expensive. You're better off going to Robertos taco shop for the quality of the food. I would recommend Taco Y Taco over this.
