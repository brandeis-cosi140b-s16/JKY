If you like SALTY!!!!! Mexican food... This is your restaurant.  

I had a chicken burrito yesterday and no matter how much water I drank after my meal, I couldn't quench my thirst from all the sodium in the food. Come'on people in order to be fresh you need to remove the high sodium preservatives. It will cost you more, but your guests these days are much more educated when it comes to high sodium food.  I wouldn't go back!
