Reviews must be friends/family. Sat down (not seated) waited 5min or so to be greated. Server approaches and takes drink order. Returns a few minutes later and asks if we want menus. So, at this point we have now been seated for 8-10 min and have yet to see a menu. No big, can move on. Get menus (printed on xerox paper and stapled together) and begin to order food. Server informs they are out of Carne asada. No big, can move on. So I ask about the shredded beef and chicken. Server response, they are plain.... Really, plain? Ok, move on. Order tacos. They literally take at least 30 min. It's not busy by the way. Oh, and the entire time theres karaoke... like we are supposed to have a taco in one hand and a microphone in the other.. so, listen to terrible/terribly loud music while waiting for food. Tacos come, aaaand they are not even average. Why did it take 30 min for tacos with basically cold meat and cold tortillas? Just don't get it. Anyway, check comes. For what we got, def over priced. Grabbing a 6 pack and taco bell before coming back.
