What's the least you can spend for the most food at PHX?

I don't know, that's why I'm asking. But I do know that it's not at Oaxaca. 

My choices were slim and fattening. I almost just got cold stone for breakfast. There was a pizza place that was serving up wretched piles of eggs and ghastly meat type things. A nice green chili burrito sounded just right for 9am.

$5.95 after tax, that's what I got. Pretty small, very greasy and somehow simultaneously watery. Only saving grace was that the side of salsa was very spicy. 

Next time I fly, I'm just going to bring some power bars and eat cardboard.
