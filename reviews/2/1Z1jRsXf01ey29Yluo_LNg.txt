Well I tried Jalisco again because I had the Groupon. Not happy that they charged me an extra $2.75 to add a bit of rice to my Chicken Taco Salad AND this is after messing up my order when I said I didn't want it in a tortilla shell. Really?!?  The food has gotten a little better but I still miss my old Super Mex.. :(
