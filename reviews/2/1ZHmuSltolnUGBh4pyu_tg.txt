Ordered a beef and cheese burrito ( once the waitress decided it was time to saunter over) for my son- he got an all beef burrito and an eye roll from the expediter when I asked for a side of cheese. The carnitas ( bland) were to come with guacamole; no one mentioned they were out of avocado, and I only found out after I received my meal without it and over-hearing another table ask where Their's was. Had to ask for refills- from the expediter ( really another waiter who had to take up the slack). Really, really disappointing.
