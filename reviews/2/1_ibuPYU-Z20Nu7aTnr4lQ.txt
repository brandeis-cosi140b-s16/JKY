so now they have been "out" of margaritas abt 3 times .. by just 2:00-3:00 in the afternoon. This used to be one of my favorite places for a quick drink and lunch but after being told they are out so many times, I can't count on them anym ore. If I want Chipotle, I'll go to another one. And I'll read their yelps first to make sure they have higher ratings.
