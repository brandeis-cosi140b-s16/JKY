So I was in the neighborhood and needed something to cheap, quick, and easy to eat several nights in a row. Figuring this was a quick and easy take-out I chose this place as a path of least resistance option. However - one night I came a little later and tried to open the door. Nope. Wouldn't budge. Pulled a little harder. Then tried the other door. Then tried the first door again. LOCKED. What the? Holy mother of East Guadalupe Road! I stood stunned for a moment thinking OMGWTF and then I noticed the sign: Open till 10PM. Really? 10 freaking o clock? That's like a Denny's or 7-11 that closes before midnight. Complete sacrilege! The only real reason I go to any 'Bertos is because they are open any time of the day or night. This was the only choice in the immediate neighborhood at that hour since Tott's, Nosh, and Spices were already closed. Well, I could have gone to Zipp's but I'd end up having a few beers as well. But it actually turned out to NOT be a contender after all. No bueno! I prayed to the patron saint of burritos to for guidance to yet another Filiberto's that was actually open - even if only for another hour. Well I actually yelped and found one north of there on McClintock and Guadalupe. That's my Filiberto's of choice from now on. Guaranteed to be open and much more reliable. Also cleaner and with a bigger dining area and even a drive-through option. Why even bother with this place at all?
