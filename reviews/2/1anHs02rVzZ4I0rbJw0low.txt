Went here with a group of 20. The only reason I have it an extra star was for the decor and the service, both of which are excellent. Servers were very attentive and friendly. The food was awful. I agree with the prior review that they are trying to fuse flavorS that don't work well together. 12 hours later and my stomach is still upset from the sauce in the chicken enchiladas. No one in my party was happy with their entrees. The overall agreement was that this was not Mexican food. I wouldn't return.
