I came here for dinner based on the reviews posted here. I regret that decision. The customer service was great. But the food was absolutely sub-par. I got the crazy burrito and the meat was hella fatty. The tortilla was way thin. Almost all my bites had fat in it and with each bite I lost my appetite more and more. Totally sucks. I was way hungry after dealing with the devil's armpit that is this heat. Boo.
