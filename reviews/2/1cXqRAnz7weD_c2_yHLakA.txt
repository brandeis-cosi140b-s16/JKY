This place has the best food!!!!! But the eating experience is so bad. I have been here 2 times when they have run out of forks. Tip: don't run out of forks when your 2 biggest items are burritos and salads. Today they were out of serving trays. The tables are often dirty because they don't often come around cleaning. The line is super slow usually. The management does not seem to incorporate the Cafe Rio culture here. Normally they yell out things and keep things fun and entertaining. Not here. 

I come here because of convenience to my house and the food is seriously amazing. But I often drive past this one to go to Henderson. Long drive, but it's worth it to not have such a bad eating experience. I have even told their corporate office about the problems here but they haven't done anything to fix things.
