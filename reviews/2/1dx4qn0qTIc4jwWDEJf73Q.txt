I will give TeePee a couple of stars for having lardless beans and for the weird old-school style of the place (it is a serious throw back to a time that no longer exists), BUT i ordered (in my pre-vegan era) the "famous" chiles rellenos and what i got made me want to gag...
what they have created is a green chile, flattened, and then covered in some terrible meringue! how in the hell is that a chile relleno?!? 
"Relleno" means "Stuffed" in Spanish, not topped with French meringue!!

then they put some shredded iceberg on top and give you a side of some sort of mysterious red "sauce" that you are supposed to use as a topping. 
I am a native Tucsonan who has been eating Texan, Arizonan, New Mexican, Californian and Sonoran Mexican chiles rellenos my entire life and can honestly say these are the worst I've ever had. 

this is what Chiles Rellenos normally look like:

trust me on this one. don't go here for the food. go here to smoke cigarettes, wear copper and purple colored clothing, and drive home in a much much too big car.

I think i ate a Cliff Bar instead.
