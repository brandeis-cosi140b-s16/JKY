The two stars for Verde is for its food. I'd give it three stars for its drinks. This is my second time eating at Verde and the food just doesn't hold up. Tonight I ordered two appetizers for my meal. The Mexican chicken wings and the fried brussel sprouts. I had to send back the brussel  sprouts because they were burnt and tasted as such. I replaced this dish with the fingerling potatoes which came out overdone. The flavors didn't mesh at all. I don't know what happened to the caramelized onion puree, but what stood prominent were the chewy potatoes with a very saturated smokey taste of chorizo. 

I'm such a fan of chicken wings and was really looking forward to these because I also love chimichurri. I was also disappointed with this dish. The wings were overdone and very dry and were dipped in tasteless chimichurri sauce. You eat with your eyes first. The inattentive presentation of both dishes also dampened my dining experience.

The dining room is nice and the noise level was average and didn't interfere with normal conversation. I definitely will not come back for food. I was tempted to order the tacos, but when I took a peek at the tacos brought to the table next to me, they looked really small and not worth the price. I'll only come back for a cocktail.
