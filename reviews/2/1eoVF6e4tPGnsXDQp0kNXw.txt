I had the chili rellanos. They came in a swimming fajitas soup. It was really weird but edible, but that being said, i eat anything!  I managed about half of my food. as it left a weird after taste in my mouth (bad cooking oil?) Hubby ate even less of his. 
Service was quick as my hubby ordered it to go and was at my office in a snap. 
2 stars because it was quick and I liked the rice.
Recommendations: If you are in need of some Mexican rice quickly this is a great spot
