I wasn't too excited about trying Wahoo's, but we got together with friends last night and compromised on Wahoo's. 

You order at the register and then they deliver the food to your table. The menu is extensive, verging on too many options. It was a little confusing and ended up taking us a little bit to figure out what we all wanted. I decided on the basic two taco combination plate. I ordered the grilled fish taco with spicy salsa, tofu taco, white rice (they served me brown by mistake) and white beans. My fella got a chicken burrito combination and also a side fish taco. My friends ordered as well and we all got a cookie for dessert and found a booth. 

The food took a bit of time to come out and unfortunately our meals came out quite a bit of time before  our friends. Once we all had our meals, we dug in. The food was a little bland, even though I asked for spicy on everything. The brown rice was dry and the beans wet. The flavors weren't too exciting either. The fish was a little dry and the tofu, although nice was bland. The food was plentiful but I only ate a few bites of the sides since they were lackluster. 

Everyone else seemed to feel the same way about the food. The cookie was ok, nothing special. I don't think I'll make Wahoo's a regular on our food rotation.
