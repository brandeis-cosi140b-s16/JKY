Many of my friends rave about Chipotle but I don't go to one very often and I have to admit I don't understand the appeal. Anyway, I was in Pittsburgh for the weekend and there was a Chipotle in Market Square that I hadn't tried yet, so I figured I'd go there for lunch.

 First thing I noticed is the food line was long and slow-moving. This is not a problem unique to Chipotle though. It happens at Qdoba and Moe's as well. The bottleneck is when each customer has to pick the toppings they want. I ordered the burrito bowl with sofritas. This probably depends on the person scooping the rice and ingredients, but in what I got, the portion size was disappointingly small for the price. The dining area is small and cramped for the crowd. Even when I was seated, I had people bump into me a bunch of times, which was annoying. That's probably a result of limited space in a city location. 

And finally, restroom access requires a key code, which can be found on your receipt, so I hope you saved it.
