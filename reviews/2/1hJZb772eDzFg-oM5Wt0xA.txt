worst taco salad ever  I ordered this item every time I go this time stale tostado shell no beans to sour cream  no peppers no guacamole no lettuce all I got was tasteless meat  the cook was throwing things around fighting with the cashier . I pass at least three other resturants including one right in my near my home but have always enjoyed your salad  will not return as long as the cook is still there  will try another taco shop . he really  ruined  my day
