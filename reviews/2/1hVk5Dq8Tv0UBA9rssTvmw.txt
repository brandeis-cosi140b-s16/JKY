The atmosphere was awesome! The food was very bleh! I was so excited to eat here. The parking was terrible,I felt relieved when we got inside because it is the coolest place.We were seated in a church pew. The food either lacked flavor our had too much flavor it was very inconsistent. Ordered the bacon jalapeno guacamole and it was exactly that, bacon jalapenos and avocado.No flavor no salt no acid in the mixture.It's a fine balance when you make guac and this was just so bland. The tacos were just ok but I've had better from the taco truck at Charlie's. The "chicken" taco was awful, the meat was unidentifiable.I honestly could not tell it was chicken very soft but a weird soft, the shrimp was o.k. small pieces. Pork was o.k.I had hopes for the cherry blue cheese steak but it was a total fail. I get that these are more upscale tacos but you still need to have taco staples, you need the basics not just crazy tacos with a bunch of interesting ingredients.I feel the restaurant has a ton of potential but it's just not there yet. Better quality meat I expected grilled steak and chicken, nice pieces of shrimp for $89.00 for 4 people we left starving because we could not eat the food.I didn't even have liquor.Oh and I ordered the corn it was decent.The rice was bland, the red salsa was good I reminds me of Baja fresh salsa but better.  So, it was a cool place I'd go back for drinks but not the food. Maybe it's because I'm Mexican and I've had tacos all my life but some people say if there aren't people of the same culture as the type of food eating there it's not good. I must say the service was excellent! But still....I'm never eating here again.
