I really wanted to like Taco Migo, it's walking distance from my job and it would've been a nice addition to my lunch rotation. However, the food was disappointing. In an area that is already saturated with Mexican food options I was expecting this place to be phenomenal in order to compete. I won't lie this place does have some really strong points like a decent salsa bar and unlimited soda and Agua Frescas. Plus they sell beer (I don't drink alcohol but I know that any place with a liquor license usually has a leg up on other establishments). I ordered what I thought would've have been the simplest thing on the menu the "Migo Taco Combo".  Considering this taco is the restaurant's name sake I was appalled by how they treated the iconic taco. It was smeared with some weird messy bean sauce and very little beef throughout it. No discernment of cheese or lettuce. I don't expect for Tacos to be neat and dainty but I also don't expect them to be so messy that thy require a fork to eat. I like that the combos came with fries but I would rather have my combo with traditional rice and beans which is an upcharge here.  Just like the other reviewers mentioned the employees do go out of their way to ensure good customer service but it gets a little annoying when someone ask you "how are doing" every 2 minutes, for petes sakes I'm only eating a taco! The atmosphere is better than most Mexican food dives. Maybe I'll give them another try in the distant future but for now I'll stick to Salazar Bros or Vaqueros for my lunch time Mexican food fix.
