I usually try to stay away from places like this because the meat tends to be so dry and really bad quality. BUT on drunken nights...I just can help but crave my standard carne asada burrito with the works (+avocado, sour cream, and hot sauce).

  As for customer service, the man behind the counter was extremely nice eventhough he knew me and my partner in crime we beyond tipsy. Also the place is clean!  A plus was their selection of tasty fountain drinks: horchata, jamaica, & limon (the ones I remember).
