Another of Phoenix New Times Ten Best Tacos in Phoenix.

A MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT!  Another bare bones establishment that I approached with great expectations. Ordered the recommended Suadero Tacos and they came served in soggy tortillas (unforgiveable to my mind) to begin this less than fabulous experience. Very little taste to the Tacos so I found myself pouring on the hot sauce.

Will NOT return!
