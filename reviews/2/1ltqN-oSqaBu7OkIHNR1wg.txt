The definition of meh, Pasqual's specializes in thoroughly mediocre food in a bland ambiance. If they charged half the price for their food, I could accept that. But they charge way too much. Their salsa is something I could beat in about two minutes myself, and I'm no Mexican chef in training. Don't bother with the place -- either go to somewhere like Panchero's, for less money and more taste, or spend a little more at La Mestiza and enjoy yourself.
