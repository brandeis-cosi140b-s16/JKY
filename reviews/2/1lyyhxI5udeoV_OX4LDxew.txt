Came here for lunch to try out before my next appointment. 

As some reviews had mentioned, it was like a hawaiian Chipotle. 

Step 1 - choose one -  burrito, bowl, salad, or tacos - 
Step 2 - choose one - meat (chicken, pig, steak, fish, veggies)
Step 3 - choose any - seaweed rice OR brown rice, black beans, and grilled veggies
Step 4 - choose one- charged pineapple verde, mango & roasted corn, tomato w/ grilled maui onions
Step 5 - choose any - sour cream, cheese, lettuce, jalapeno, cabbage, lime, cilantro, bean sprouts, habenero, lava chips

My combination was a burrito with the huli huli chicken, seaweed rice, black beans, mango & roasted corn, sour cream, cheese, lettuce, jalapeno. 

It was $6.95 + tax .. pretty similar to chipotle in pricing but a different taste. 

To be honest, i thought flavor wasnt really there. It was quite plain. The only thing that really STOOD out was the jalepeno. Surprisingly spicy despite a lot of other places with jalepenos werent really spicy lately. Aside from that, not much flavor in the chicken, not the mango and roasted corn salsa. Was expecting maybe bright flavors from the mango and corn but not really o.O 

Heard it may be because they are opening another location in the north side and the owner wasn't there for QC? thats kind of bad if quality is only kept up when managed.... 

May give it another try but with first experience... eh Lol
