I don't recommend the chicken nortena.  It's cheese, cheese, and more cheese with some chicken that tastes like it came from a can.  The chicken enchiladas I got we're a little dry but the chicken didn't taste canned that time.  I would still like to try the mushroom enchilada.  If that's a fail then I won't be going back.  Everyone else seemed to like their food except for the kids.  So, 3 other adults liked it that I was with.
