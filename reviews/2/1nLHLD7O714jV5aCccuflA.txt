My boyfriend and I came here after we missed the lunch window for Wicked Spoon.  We were starving (which usually allows crappy food to taste a little better) and just went for what was close.

I should have known that a Chinese/Mexican restaurant would not be a good idea.  There is a reason why I've never come across this mix.  It's because it simply does not work!  This restaurant should either focus on making better Chinese food or better Mexican, not attempt to make both types of cuisines.

I had the dan dan noodles and some soup with wontons (the name escapes me now).  The dan dan  noodles were okay.  The soup didn't have much flavor.  It's only saving grace were the wontons.

My boyfriend ordered one lobster taco (because they are $10 a pop) and two chicken tacos (mole sauce on the side).  He said the lobster taco was good, but the chicken was just whatever.

Overall, the best thing that we ordered was the guacamole and the Mexican coke.  The chips and salsa were decent.
