I wasn't that crazy about this place. It is very spacious inside but they weren't very busy for dinner time. The chips and salsa brought to the table was a joke. The salsa was very sweet and thin. The chips were very hard, almost stale. The albondigas soup was the only thing worth eating. The soup had good flavor.  For dinner I tried the fajitas and the meat was tough and lacked flavor. The beans and rice that came with my fajitas was dry and crispy like it was heated up from earlier. When it came time for dessert our table shared a plate of churros. The churros were very dry and most of the cinnamon and sugar was at the bottom of the plate. Our server was good but the food wasn't. I can't see coming back.
