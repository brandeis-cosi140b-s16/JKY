The only reason I went is because my Dad wanted a taco.  The last few times I have eaten here it has been nothing but a greasy mess.  

I miss the days when Julio G's was down the street.  The quality control and level of care to the food has gone WAY down hill in the last few years, and it is really sad to see.  

With it being right next to the W, you'd think they would strive to be the best place ever.  If I was staying there, I'd walk to downtown and find something else.
