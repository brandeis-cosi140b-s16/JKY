Little mom n pop type of place...

I had high hopes for Huevos Rancheros ... but we got there too late (noon) to try it.
So, I opted for a taco / enchilada combo.... chicken was shredded but the overall flavor was lacking.  Really nothing special about it.  Came with rice and beans... pretty standard and again... flavors were flat.
Salsa and chips were complimentary... but chips seemed a little stale.. salsa was good and had a nice flavor.  
The guacamole was disappointing.... it was runny and seemed to be "canned".  

Service was really good, and I like supporting small places.  But they have to back it up with good food....
