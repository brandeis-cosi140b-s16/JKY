Stopped by one night for dinner and was seated immediately.  I was somewhat disappointed with the menu which was heavy on cheese and fried stuff.  I would have loved to have seen a mole dish. on the menu.

I ended up with the Southwestern Caesar Salad (super tasty dressing), which was okay.

I would not come back again if I were in town again.  I'd try the Sonoran hot dog cart on the corner of Baseline and Priest instead.
