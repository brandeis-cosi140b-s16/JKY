The food itself is no different from the other places but health was my concern. I came one night and the woman taking orders kept kicking at something on the floor. After a couple of minutes she pulled out a printed slip of paper, presumably containing an order. It was dirty, wet and had shoe prints on it. She placed it directly on the counter where the food goes, and that nasty ticket slid down the counter as the orders were made. 

I called the store to express my concern with the manager. The woman who answered changed her name when I asked to speak to the manager, and said SHE was the manager (same person- didn't even put me on hold) and when I described what happened, she didn't seem concerned. When I told her it was a hygiene issue,  she asked if I was calling for "free food for the inconvenience".  Needless to say, I won't be going back to this particular store.  

To be fair, this is the first time I've seen poor food safety procedures at a Chipotle. Hopefully this is isolated to that location.
