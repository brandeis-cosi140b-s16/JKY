Actually, the food was pretty tasty . . . room temperature, but tasty.  The first issue was there were a lot of other things going on there besides dinner.  There was some sort of fashion-show mixer going on so there were lights, cameras and lots of women in clothes that were too tight and wearing way too much make-up.  The second issue was our server.  She was nice enough and took our order.  My friend ordered the chili relleno/chicken enchilada combo.  When the food came out, none of meals were hot, but she got two chili rellenos and no enchilada. The server told her that "they" (not we) were in the process of changing the menu and they didn't have that combination any longer.  The manager ended up coming over and he said he'd bring her the enchilada, but it ended up taking 20 minutes and we had all finished eating my then.  Like I said, the food was actually pretty tasty, but everything else going on in there was a huge distraction from the enjoyable dinner we were expecting.
