I would give this place 4 stars because  the food is good, for what it is. But the service is horrible. Forget trying to get a specific  order. I.e. extra anything or hold the whatever. I feel like I need to speak  Spanish to order here, and when they don't understand  you they act like it's your fault. Not worth my money or time.
