My girlfriend and I tried this place because we had a groupon for $40. Unfortunately everything is just a little bit over priced. Not a lot of value here. The food wasn't terrible, although it was kind of bland. We shared the Fajitas for Two. We also got some margaritas and chips/queso for an appetizer. I was surprised at how little we got for $40.

The margaritas were good, best part of the dinner. The queso was $6 and was nothing special at all. Just cheese. The sizzling steak/chicken Fajitas were ok but they didn't include very many bell peppers, just a lot of onions. The chichken was decent, the steak didn't look very appetizing and it was pretty chewy. Overall I probably wouldn't go back, mostly because it's too expensive for what you get. If it was a little cheaper I might've considered returning. Going to try Popo's, I've heard it's very good.
