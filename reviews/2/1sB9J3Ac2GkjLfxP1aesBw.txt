Well I found this little place here on yelp and after reading reviews decided the fam and I just had to try it. When we got there only one table was occupied so I figured it would be quick. Wrong..we ordered a couple tacos a burrito, torta, and some chicos tacos everyone raves about. Took over 30 mins to get our food. The burrito was good the tacos soggy and bland and the sauce on the chicos tacos was more like a glorified fideo broth. And on top of that they forgot two tacos in our order and then had the nerve to get upset when I called to inform them i was coming back to get them. Overall a burrito isn't enough to keep us coming back. So disappointing!!
