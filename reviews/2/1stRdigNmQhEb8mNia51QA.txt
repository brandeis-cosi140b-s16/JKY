Though it is difficult to screw up mexican food--I can make decent enchiladas and I am nobody's idea of a chef--it is very easy to make it feel indifferent. That is the La Paz experience.

There was no sense of ownership from the kitchen to the food prepared, just rote work. If I want food without character, I'll go to Olive Garden, thank you very much.

I'll assume this restaurant is still in a state of transition and will make a note to revisit them some months from now. However, the meal I had wasn't a tremendous incentive to return.
