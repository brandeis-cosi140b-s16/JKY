Ordered steak fajitas which were very tough. Both the side servings of retried beans and rice were bland.  Overall there was a lack of favor as it seems their recipes do not allow for some spices.  A little cumin in the beans would make a huge difference   The rice was the most bland.  The  quantity was great but this is no trip to flavor town.
