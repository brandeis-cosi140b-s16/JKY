It's a shame that this place doesn't have better food. Chinese/Mexican concept is great because I'm a fan of both, but the execution just didn't work. The Dan Dan Mian didn't have much flavor other than an overwhelming taste of salt. The Gan Pung Ji chicken was dry, and the Lucky Sui Mai tasted like frozen dim sum that was simply heated. The only positive memory I have was that their guacamole was good. The ambience of the restaurant and its location inside the Cosmopolitan really has a lot of potential. If only the food didn't suck.
