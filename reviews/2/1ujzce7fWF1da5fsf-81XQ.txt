I have found El Pollo Loco food to be fairly consistent no matter the location.  This was my first visit to this particular one.  I went around 7:30 and the dining area was fairly full and so was the waiting area.  In fact, I was a little confused as to where the line to order started because of the crowd waiting for their orders to be ready.  And I wasn't the only one as someone that came in after me had the same problem.  Maybe they were short staffed that night but otherwise I would expect they know their busy times and should be prepared for them as far as staffing and having chicken ready.  The girl running the register was very apologetic about the wait, and I witnessed another customer receive free dessert for the inconvenience, not to mention a couple customers state that their orders were wrong when ready.  I ordered an 8 piece chicken only, no sides, and probably waited at least 30 minutes.  I don't think I will return to this location again.
