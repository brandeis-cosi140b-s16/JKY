While waiting for a show to start at the Marquee we came by La Fonda for a quick bite. Quick it was!  Walking in everything looked dirty- walls, booths- kinda cramped together. The service was good and super fast, we had our food within minutes. The downside was that everything tasted old. The chips tasted like old grease, the guac was brownish, and the tortilla from my chimichanga tasted like Mission brand.  I've had better at Filibertos. The worst part is they charge an extra $3 for beans and rice.  Hello! Beans and rice is a staple not a surcharge!
