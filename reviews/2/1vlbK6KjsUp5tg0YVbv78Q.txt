Not impressed with the service!  

We were seated promptly, chips, salsa and water were delivered.  Then we wait, and we wait, and we wait.  The chip waiter kept bringing us more chips and salsa, so we munched on those.  Kept asking for our waitress so we could order.

Finally about 30 minutes later, she came by.  My husband ordered the chicken burrito with red sauce, and since I had eaten all the chips I ordered the senior enchilada plate, beef.

Another lengthy wait.  Food was finally delivered, my husbands burrito had the crema sauce instead of the red.  Deliverer of food said that she could get him a new one, but we didn't want to wait another 30 minutes.  I decided to open my enchilada to make sure I had beef, which I did, but there were only 3, 1/4 in cubes of beef.  Ridiculous.  

Waitress came by and we expressed our disappointment, she offered to get me a new enchilada.  I took her up on it, it arrived in 5 minutes and was jammed packed with beef.

We asked her about the wait times and we were told that they were short staffed and apologized and apologized and apologized.  We felt bad for her, we could hear her apologizing all around us.

Finished our meal, which I will say the food was good.

Our waitress stopped by our table and comped our whole meal.  

Not sure if we would come back, there seems to be quite a few other mexican options in Casa Grande.
