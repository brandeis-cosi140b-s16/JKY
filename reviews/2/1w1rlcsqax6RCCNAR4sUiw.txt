The first location on D.I. was my husband and my favorite Mexican Restaurant.  We would drive down from the Mount Charleston/Centennial Hills area.  We tried this location once and really missed the atmosphere of the other location.  However, in March while on a 14-day Caribbean Princess Cruise we met two of our neighbors on the ship.  When speaking of Mexican food, they highly suggested a new place closer to home called Leticia's.  And we've been hooked ever since. GREAT home cooked food, friendly warm staff, great atmosphere in a quaint location.
