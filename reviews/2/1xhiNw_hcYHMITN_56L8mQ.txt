Nothing about this restaurant screams Mexican, except MAYBE the fact that they offer Tecate and a tequila flight. Oh, and they have pictures of roosters on the wall. . Lol.. but that's also a country thing.  You can tell the staff works really hard during lunch rush hour, but sadly, i don't intend to revisit.
