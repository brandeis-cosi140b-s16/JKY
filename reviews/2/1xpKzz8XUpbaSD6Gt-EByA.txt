I love El Polo Loco.  But this location is the worst!  It's like that ex-girlfriend you keep going back to, only to quickly remember she is crazy and might kill you in the night.


The service is so slow.  Like expect to wait 20 minutes.  Is this a gourmet restaurant - or fast food?  Maybe if the foot was edible it would be worth it. 

But alas, the food is terrible.  Not once, not twice, but the five or six times I have eaten here in the past 3 years.  The chicken is ok, and that's why they got two stars.  Anything else, beans, avocados, even the chips are gross.  My favorite item (at other el polo locations) is the avocado burrito.  Here no good.  Cold chicken and beans and grainy avocado is not what I wanted.  

Ugh.  I wish someday a new owner would take over this location and make it like the chain was designed to be.
