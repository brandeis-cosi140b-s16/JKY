This is a knock off of Chipotle.  The price is reasonable  for the location . The portion is resonably  large and more than enough  food for one person . The steak was not overcooked. The black beans were nice and firm same for the rice. Hot sauce was so bland. The  guacamole  was too sour. Service was ok
