The chips and salsa are the best thing here that I have tried. Their tortillas are like the ones you buy at the store and their beans taste like Rosarita canned beans. This is probably a good place to go for drinks and appetizers but not so much for a meal. The staff was very friendly. Ill probably go back just for the convenience.
