My food was served to the table next to me. The customer chatting away on her cell phone put her finger in my green corn tamale a few times complaining 'this isn't my food' and when she finally decided to quick playing with my food, told the server it wasn't her order the server attempted to then serve it to me! I told the server that the other lady put her finger in it a few times so I couldn't accept my food. She took it to the kitchen to be remade. My order came out on same red plate that was originally presented to me. The plate itself was piping hot with extra sauce on the tamale than the last one but food was room temperature. My boyfriend's food was also room temperature and his side of french fries a total of 13 were soggy. The server even noticed there were very few french fries on the plate and said she'd bring out another order. We were starving at this point so I ate around the end of the tamale that I felt to be still compromised and my boyfriend ate his room temperature overcooked steak but left the 13 soggy french fries. The second order of fries never made it out to our table...may have gone to another table and we were just ready for our check. While waiting we called a manager over to inform him (Brian) what had happened so it wouldn't happen to another customer in the future. Brian swore up and down he personally threw my food out and the food I now had was all freshly prepared. He apologized profusely about the second order of fries never arriving and the entire experience. Brian removed both our meals and my second untouched Patron margarita from our bill. I've come to this location several times and it has never been like this. We shall return after their remodel and give them another chance!
