I just wanted some steak tacos with no onions. My first plate arrived, onions obviously present in the tacos. Second plate: tortilla, steak, nothing else in the tacos. Asked for some cheese and lettuce...they brought it out...but acted like I was being unreasonable. Pretty sure I'm not the only person who doesn't want onions in my tacos. Not going back ever. It's too bad because the service was usually great.
