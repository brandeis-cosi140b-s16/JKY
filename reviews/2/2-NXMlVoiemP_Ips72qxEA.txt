I'm not a lover of their food, but the neighborhood location and two-for-one margaritas make up for it. Sort of. They have two good things on their menu, IMO: the nachos and one of their beef burritos.  

All in all, I'd rather drive a little further and get some authentic Mexican from Laredo's at half the price.
