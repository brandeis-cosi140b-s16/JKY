We were pretty hungry and didn't feel like cooking, so we made the short walk over to Burrito Drive for a late-ish night carry-out meal. 

The staff was friendly; the ordering process was painless. It seemed to take a while for our order to be prepared; I'd say we waited around 15-20 minutes before we had our grub and were heading back home.

I ordered the classic carne asada tacos with corn tortillas. Friend ordered a custom-made taco with chicken, black beans, and some other goodies. The order included complimentary chips and salsa (we ordered the Hot (roasted habanero)). And because I'm a glutton, I ordered the tater tots with a side of nacho cheese. The total order cost about $20 - more than reasonable.

The chips and salsa were great - the chips were fresh, crispy, and perfect thickness. The roasted habanero salsa was the real star of the meal. Smokey, a little bit of heat, and bursting with flavor - we loved it.

My carne asada classic tacos were meh at best. Actually, they were less than meh... each taco consisted of two tiny gristly, greasy, flavorless strips of "steak", a bunch of processed shredded cheese, and pickled red onion. I detected no guac; pico was served on the side. The corn tortillas were mushy and "clingy" - they tore easily.

Friend built their own taco combo with chicken, black beans, lettuce, onion, pico, and salsa. It was reported that it was tasty and really fresh, so perhaps I made a poor choice in going with my "standard" carne asada tacos... 

The tots were crispy, but coldish; the nacho cheese was your typical fake cheese goo that you'll find on most convenice store nachos.

So...

Value = 2 stars
Service = 3.5 stars (friendly staff, slow food preparation)
Quality = 1.5 stars (salsa was the best part of the experience)
MISC = 3 stars (seating area seamed nice; decent food containers for carry out)

Pros:
- They're open late, and they deliver
- The build-your-own option may be the best bet
- Hot salsa was excellent
