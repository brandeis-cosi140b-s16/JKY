I don't know if quality has gone down or my tastes have gotten better but there food is pretty gross. Del Taco use to be one of those late night, I'm drunk and hungry or I'm out shopping need a quick and easy bite, I think I'll get a taco kind of place. The last few times it's been gross. Meat is mushy and has a weird smell and taste. I even tried a milkshake recently, even that was almost tasteless.
I have vowed not to waste my money here anymore. It's been placed on my blacklist.
