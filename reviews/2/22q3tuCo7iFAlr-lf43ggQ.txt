A few years ago I had a coworker that loved to eat here so we'd come by often but I left that job and I hadn't been back until recently.   When I used to come regularly, I'd always get the Arroz con Pollo and it was so perfect.  The chicken was slow cooked so the meat was tender with so much flavor, the cooked vegetables and rice that accompanied were also delicious on their own without the chicken, it was a perfect meal.   I was excited to come back and I naturally ordered the same thing.  When it arrived I was so disappointed.   The juicy well prepared chicken had been replaced with long skinny strips of precooked chicken, it wasn't even edible.  The medley of vegetables had been replaced with just cabbage and the rice was the only edible item so that's what I ate.  We had ordered some guacamole to share and out came this mint green pudding.  It tasted like a tub of sour cream with a small amount of avocado put into the blender.  The margaritas were good though.
