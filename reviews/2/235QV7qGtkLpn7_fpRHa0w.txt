Enchiladas were hot and cheesey but not very flavorful. If you want average cheap Mexican food then this might be a place for you.  The most disappointing thing, especially for this area, was that the salsa was the consistency of watery ketchup and tasted like spaghetti sauce. The highlight was the guac was actually fresh and chunky.
