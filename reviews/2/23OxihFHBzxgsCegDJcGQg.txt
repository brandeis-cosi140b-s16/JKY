Not sure if this is new, but its cash only. It would have been nice to know that before I drove to it, sat down, and was ready to order. The polite waitress told me where the nearest atm was but it wasn't a bank and I didn't feel like paying a fee to withdraw $ and then go back. Two people were in there eating by themselves at the peak of lunch hour. For what its worth, their food looked pretty good. Maybe I will try again when I happen to be in the neighborhood with cash. Just wanted to post this to give anyone the heads up to bring cash.
