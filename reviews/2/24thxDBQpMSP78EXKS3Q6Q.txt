I tried this place for the first time for the raved about menudo. I had the white menudo bowl and it was good. Not spectacular, but it satisfied my pregnancy craving for menudo. The only set back was that it took FOREVER to get the menudo. My mom was already almost halfway thru her meal and the chips were starting to fill me up a bit. But I really wanted the menudo I came for so I patiently waited. That and the service was not good. The server barely came around or not at all to check on us. We didn't speak Spanish but that's all they really tried talking to us in. I could understand some but my english responses were still answered in spanish. I thought that was pretty funny. I may come back during the day although the time we went was at night, it really was not that busy or packed  for a Saturday.
