This review is a direct comparison of two restaurants: Fiesta Maya and Monterey.

1) they have two food lunch specials at Monterey compared to Fiesta's one special.  One of the two specials is only .25 off full price, but the other special is a 1.00 so on specials the two restaurants are tied.

2) loyalty card at Fiesta is buy 9 get one free.  Monterey has buy 7 get a free cheese dip.  The benefit at Fiesta is far superior, worth 8 00 vs 4.50 and that 4.50 is generous.

3) chips and dip, both have it free.  Fiesta has better salsa and better tortilla chips.  This is a moderate gap in quality and enjoyment.

4) entrees aren't as good as Fiesta.  I got the Chile relleno and my sister told me that it is the worst item.  I ate in and completely agree.

Wifey says she liked the flavor but the plate needed some lettuce and tomatoes.  It was a lot of starch and cheese.

The service forgot her torillas.  Water kept going empty.  Soda not refilled.  Service was horrible but was noticeably sub paar.

I probably won't return.  Sorry for even doubting the Fiesta Maya.
