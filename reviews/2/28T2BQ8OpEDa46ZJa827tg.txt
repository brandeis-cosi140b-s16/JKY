I don't know what has happened at the macayo's in Goodyear.  When you walk in there is an overwhelming sewer odor.  At one visit we just passed it off to possible plumbing problems at the time bit we have been back several more times and this gassy odor continues to be bad.  This used to be one of our favorites places to go, however until they fix this we won't be back.   We have also left the last few times with unhappy stomachs ... Don't know if the odor and the food are related ... But hard not to think that.   I hope the Macayo's management corrects this problem because we really do like the food, service, and atmosphere of this restaurant.
