I'm conflicted about my review. I would give it a 2.5. The parking is terrible like everyone says. The salsa was really good. The live music was a nice touch. The food was just OK. I have had better Mexican food and I've had worse. I'm always suspicious of a Mexican restaurant when it is chock full of White people and no, or very few Mexican-Americans. 

My husband liked his shrimp dish, but my pork dish was meh, unmemorable. I took home most of it and gave it to my husband. He will eat almost anything. I would not order a pork dish there again. 

I don't know if we will be going back again, definitely not at a busy time when parking is difficult.
