5 stars for their $1.99 fish Taco, I prob have them three to five times a month. I work at a neighboring business so it is convenient for me to order my lunch to go and not have to rush and eat.
I also like their Salsa bar that always has fresh cut limes for the taking (FREE)

NO STARS FOR THE FOLLOWING :

I have tried the Carne Esada Burrito and the Pollo soft taco and shrimp tacos....On those days I spent my lunch returning my food for  100% refund. I got my money back but had no lunch because I refused to eat slimy shrimp, gritty chicken and dry Carne.

I ASKED FOR A LARGE CUP OF WATER AND THEY WATED TO CHARGE ME $2.00 FOR A PAPER CUP!! REALLY? A PAPER CUP..... I think not.

I am not a fan of commercial guacamole so I asked to substitute sour cream (white sauce) instead of the guac and they wanted to charge me $1.00. really? Guacamole  is way more expensive to make and maintain....I'm saving you money buddy and you want to charge me a dollar to do that. Umm, NO.

NOT to mention the staff is less than patient with your decision making process, always on their cell phones and I am bilingual so when u talk about me in Espanol....I know what your saying.  BOOM!
