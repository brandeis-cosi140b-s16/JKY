I went to this place three times. I keep giving them a chance but I most likely will not come here again. The food is okay, I feel like their food had more flavor when it was still Roberto's. With all my three experiences I encountered really bad manners from the staff. One of the older ladies who took our order seemed like she didn't want to take our order. While she was waiting for us to order, she was scratching off a piece of food off the register counter with someones credit card.
