Being from a large city, I have experienced great Mexican fare, and I would have thought that being so close to Mexico and having a large Mexican population, there would have been good Mexican food around here. That may be true, but I have to be honest and say that this place leaves much, possibly too much, to be desired in the realm of awesome eats.

Maybe it's that I walked into this restaurant with too high expectations that they were unable to live up to. Maybe the food wasn't that good. It is possible that both are correct. I am thinking the second statement was more accurate than the first.

I had the combo plate with twp tacos and an enchilada. I asked for steak tacos. I got tacos with thin strands of steak, similar top barbacoa, that weren't very flavorful and were somewhat dry.  The enchilada was covered in a kinda bland mole.

Service was decent. The food was passable, but not very good.
