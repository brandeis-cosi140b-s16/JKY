I was expecting this place to be an order at the counter sort of place, but it ended up being a sit down restaurant.  We ordered the crab cakes, which didn't have that much flavor, although we did really like the tarter sauce that came with them.  My hubby and I loved the pinto beans that came with our beer battered fish and grilled shrimp tacos.  They are a little bit spicy and they have some crunch with the onion and green pepper.  Hubby also loved the rice.  It was moist and flavorful.  We weren't as impressed with the tacos.  I thought the beer batter would add flavor to the fish tacos, but the only thing with flavor was the cream sauce.  The shrimp in the shrimp tacos didn't have much seasoning at all.  If it wasn't for the sauces, the tacos would have totally fallen flat.  The service was great and our server was very friendly and attentive, but I doubt we'll be back because the food fell short.
