I was looking forward to going to Carefree Station. We found out about this restaurant from a friend. We thought it would be a nice place to bring our daughter for her graduation. So here is the review.
 My wife and I went to check out the restaurant for lunch to see if we would like to return for dinner with the rest of the family. In short NO ! The setting of the restaurant is nice enough to say it COULD be so much more then it is.
We asked to sit inside and the place was less then 1/4 full.. We were told we could sit on the covered patio...ummm WHY ? Ok we sat on the covered patio but would have much preferred inside. Our style of dining is un rushed. They got that so kudos on that ! We ordered 2 lunch entrees and they arrived presented very well. The eyes were pleased. The eyes were pleased the palate was like the street the restaurant is located on. HO HUM !!!
More then anything else, the restaurant needs an identity. Make up their mind as to what they are going to do. It misses the mark by a long way in this area. Next, use the suroundings to better serve the purpose. Lastly, the desserts were not good at all. Alot of hype with no substance.
I wsh it were better. Sorry CFS.
