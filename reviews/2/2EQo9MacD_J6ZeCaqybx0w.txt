I had an order delivered with the family's usual burrito selection.  The burritos were not as ordered and the rice was crunchy and under cooked. I called the location and was told, "Sorry, I'll tell the manager, goodbye! Apparently my repeat business is not wanted and will not occur. I have raved about this place to several friends. No more! I will steer them away from this restaurant.
