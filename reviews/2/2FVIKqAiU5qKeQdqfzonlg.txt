Stopped in here for breakfast this morning as my band and I were staying at the Days Inn so it was super convenient!
When myself and my drummer walked into Papi Chulo's and found the other half of our band already seated we quickly joined their table and waited for a server to bring us some menus. Although the restaurant was empty (aside from one other table) five minutes passed by and nothing happened- the single waiter didn't even acknowledge our presence. 
I got up and grabbed two menus and he finally turned around and signaled he'd be right with us- which turned into another ten minutes. I don't know what this guy had for breakfast but whatever it was he should stop, he was moving at a slower than snails pace and being overwhelmed by a total of two tables, though a third did join midway.

When he finally took our orders (30 minutes from original seating point) the food came out quickly and I was really impressed with my Huevos Racheros! Very large portion and absolutely delicious. Shame about the crap service.
