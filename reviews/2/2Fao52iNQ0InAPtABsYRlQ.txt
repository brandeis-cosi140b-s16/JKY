Wed: 1/2 price Margaritas.  Thur: 1/2 price bottles of wine.  Sun: $2 domestics.

I came here because there was a groupon and it was close to my house.  When walking in there was not a whole lot of seating.  The only place they offered to us was two seat high top next to the stairs.  There was some seating upstairs but it was definately out of the way.  My fiance and I chose to sit at the bar which was comfortable.  However there was no bartender.  The woman that was our waitress did not pay us a lick of attention even when near.  She served me the wrong beer and did not give it a lime.  I had to ask other servers for things a few times.  I was going to ask her for some hot sauce but I felt lucky I got another beer.  Enough about the service lets get to the food. 

The chips were fresh and the salsa was chunky.  I got a flank steak which was their "house specialty".  The steak was good it was marinated in some tropical fruit and came out quite nice.  The beans were average and the rice was a little dry.  My fiance got a chili rellano.  That was good too.  None of the food was outstanding but I left satisfied with what I ate.

The food is about a three and the service was a zero.  I hope we just got a bad server on a busy night.  If there is another groupon I may go back to check out the half price margaritas.  Other than that I have no intention on going back.
