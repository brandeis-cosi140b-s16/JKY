Wife and myself was out and about, spending some time together! We were actually across the street at totally wine, when we were a little hungry. Wife was told by her friend that Raul & Theresa's was a must try. Now here friend is a frequent customer at the Avondale location! So we ended up giving this place a try. Now when you first come in, this is not a restaurant that most people expect! It reminds me a lot like a fast food   atmosphere? Since we weren't that hungry, wife ordered their child's plate taco and cheese enchilada, I ordered the carne asada torta. I was happy their torta is small, since I just wanted to have a small meal! Their torta was all right! Wasn't that special at all, carne asada was not that great, just plain. Wife said there rice was great, everything else was OK. Now this is not the worst place we have been at, but it wasn't even close of being a great place to go! But if we are in the area again, we just might try it again.
