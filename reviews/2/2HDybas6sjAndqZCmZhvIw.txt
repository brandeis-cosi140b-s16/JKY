Not that good.  

- The chicken tortilla soup had little flavor and one piece of hominy in it (one!)
- The table side guacamole was weird.  The avocados were flavorless.  Almost like they weren't ripe and the restaurant had popped them in the microwave to soften them up
- The chips and salsa are great.  Nice flavor to the chips and the salsa had a little bit of heat
- The chicken mole is green, not red/brown.  The green mole has a nice flavor (tangy with a bit of heat), but the grilled chicken is dry, dry, dry
- The beans and rice taste like they came out of a microwaved bag
- The carnitas tacos were average.  The pork was bland, but the avocado salsa was nice

- Good service
