*pffffffft*  That's how you spell the sound of a fart.  And that's exactly what I did for 2 days this week, after my trip to Arriba.
It's basic Mexican fare.  We had a group of about 12 and they were great taking care of us.  I never had to ask for my iced tea to be refilled.  
The food?  We made a list at work ahead of time and ordered it right before we left the office.  I ordered the fish taco dish.  It came with a side of refried beans and rice.  The beans were nasty and then I realized they probably weren't vegetarian, so I only had a bite and put them aside.  The rice was...rice.  The only way it had any flavor was because I had doused it with hot sauce.  
The fish taco?  No flavor!  The fish was grilled, but I could barely taste it.  Everything was covered in some sort of white sauce and it was all that flavorful, but still covered up any flavor that *could* be in the fish taco.  I still prefer Two Hippies.
The service was great, but it was really the only thing memorable.  I doubt I'd go back there.  
*pffffffffffffft*
