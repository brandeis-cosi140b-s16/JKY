Sad to say I really did not enjoy this restaurant. I was very surprised that what I thought was a family run Mexican restaurant served bottled salsa with chips. The chips tasted store bought and the salsa was served on a plate, making it difficult to eat at all. That was not a good start. 

The food just has a very "frozen foodish" quality to me. I want my Mexican food fresh and flavorful. This just didn't do it for me. But then I really don't like Macayos either - so if you like Macayos you may like this. It's not for me at all. I won't be back.
