When I moved close by last year, my Mom, sister and I were doing a coffee run when we drove past La Fonda. 

A Flagstaff resident, she screamed, "Whoa that place is good Meg! You need to go." 

So a year later, I finally tried it. 

Let's just be upfront right now: This is NOT the same La Fonda near Northern Arizona University. No connection whatsoever. 

Now that that's cleared up, the food was just OK. Not the best quality.

Dude and I shared the Pollo Especial Fundido Burrito. Shredded chicken with spiced red and green sauce, topped with Fundido sauce and melted cheese. 

Not impressed at all, kind of like On the Border and lacking the promised heat (spice).

Delicious silver margarita though, and our server Priscilla took great care of us, so two stars for that.
