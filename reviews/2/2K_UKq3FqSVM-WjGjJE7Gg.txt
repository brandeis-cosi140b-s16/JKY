Heard about this place through co-workers who couldn't stop talking about this place. Decided to give it a try for lunch one day. The service took a lot longer than expected, but I figured since it was the first week, they were still ironing out the kinks. The food was all right. I had a carne aside burrito and some chips. The burrito was small, compared to what you normally get and tasted all right. I liked the grilled veggies inside. The chips tasted stale and the salsa tasted like canned salsa. For the cost, which was pretty expensive for a burrito and chips, I could have made a better meal at home. I will mostly give it one more shot, just to see if it's any better. But having a Mexican food restaurant is Arizona; you need to be on point, because there are hundreds of places just like you around the corner!
