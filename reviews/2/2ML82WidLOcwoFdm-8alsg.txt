First time visting this place.  Ordered the burrito with chicken ( had to pay extra 25 cents thought that was different and beef taco.  I was disappointed after reading all the positive reviews.  The chicken and beef had no seasoning that I could taste at all.

The refried beans was like sauce.  Well the service was fine.  I was hoping for more.
