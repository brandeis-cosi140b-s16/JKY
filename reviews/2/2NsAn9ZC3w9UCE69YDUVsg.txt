I got punished and paid the price for trying a burrito at a place best known for their tacos. It also kinda helps too if I did more researches on things to do and places to eat and avoid when I visit any city. "I know, that is why we have Yelp!"

This place is opened 24 hours and a drive-thru, which are the only positives. But my $6.00 "so called" super burrito wasn't what I was expected for a city best known for good food. 

First of all, I love all my "super burritos" fat, juicy, and wrapped tightly in a aluminum foil. But my burrito from here was small and wrapped loosely. Therefore, all the key ingredients fell apart on me leaving a fat mess. The meat, beans, and rice were also dry. And the chips were stale.

I'm an old man and still play with my food. So I dissected my burrito and noticed, "I got ripped off." The shop didn't give me any cheese, guacamole and sour cream. If I wanted those fillings in my super burrito, according to menu I have to pay extra. Now I got it.  

I ended up throwing 3/4 of that burrito away and left just finishing my Sidral Mundet sparkling Apple drink, which was refreshing.

To find a decent "super" burrito in another city continues.
