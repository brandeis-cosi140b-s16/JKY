Greasy beef taco ... So much grease running out the end I had to drain twice before I dare tried to bite it . Tamale was okay but drowning in red  sauce ... Once I uncovered it there wasn't much to it ... I'm sure there's good food here I just didn't get any if it. 
The restaurant is nice and wait staff attentive - hopefully I won't have indigestion from all the grease and hate them later ... 
Not too excited about the food choice ... 
Don't recommend beef tacos or sauce covered tamale ...
