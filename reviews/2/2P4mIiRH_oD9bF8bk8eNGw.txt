The nachos were great, the initial waitress needed an education on what a Top Shelf drink was (at a place called Tequila's - I am NOT kidding!), the manager saved the day by taking good care of us.
The nacho plate was huge. Decent flavor and huge. Reasonable price and did I say huge? 
So ... know your own drinks and talk to the manager. 
But we won't be back; too many other places in Vegas to have fun.
