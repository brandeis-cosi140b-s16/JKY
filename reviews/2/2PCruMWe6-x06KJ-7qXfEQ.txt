Why? Why do I do it? 

Probably because I just got off a six hour flight and when presented with a giant sign for a "Tequileria" my brain got the veto from my nerves. 

While I don't necessarily regret it, I ordered a house rocks margarita a and was presented with a martini glass full, plus an extra shaker. Somehow I knew this little extra on the side was not a great value, but was going to set me back. ($13.50, to be exact). It did, however hit the spot. 

The food however? I deeply regret. Dollar taco quality. I have absolutely no qualms spending $12 on a couple of tacos, but they'd better be the kind of tacos I want to rave about. These just motivated me to write a two star review even before I board my plane. Iceberg lettuce, ingredients that taste fresh from the can, and flimsy tortillas that rival only the packing material they use between dinner plates.

Consider this a public service announcement. I'd feel guilty if I didn't at the very least try to help people avoid this place - no amount of stress or hunger is worth it. Seriously - I'd rather you grab a Cinnabon.
