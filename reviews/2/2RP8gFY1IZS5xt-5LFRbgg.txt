So terribly disappointed- spent about $50, Friday night- 2 frozen house margarita's & 2 entree's.  I ordered Ropa de Vieja- consists according to the menu of shredded beef, white rice and black beans- a well known Cuban dish. However, delivered to me was shredded beef, Mexican rice and Mexican re-fried beans?!
After my meal is over, I ate my shredded beef the waitress finally returns to the table- oh she say's, Mexican rice is all we have- it changed over a year ago?! Like that's an excuse? Change your menu if it's been over a year- 2 of the 3 items on my plate were wrong- no apology, no offer to credit me for the error on their part.

Sad, I thought I'd help out the local establishment- $50 wasted, won't be back & do not recommend.
