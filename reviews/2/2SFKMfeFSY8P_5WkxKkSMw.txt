Okay so I was very excited to find a baja style "fresh" taco place in my neighborhood as I had every intention of becoming a regular customer.  On April 20, 2015 I had purchased a shrimp taco, carne asada taco, and a children's menu quesadilla with a side of rice and beans. Now everything and I mean EVERYTHING sadly, was kind of foul.  I took one bite of my shrimp taco and instantly I knew that it was rancid ):{  I pulled it out so I could take a sniff to confirm.  It looked so hideously disgusting as a slug ... Now how could you take something as beautiful as shrimp and mold it into a slug-ish worm looking thing? I wanted to throw up, but couldn't.

Then, the quesadilla was okay ... I mean really mediocre, but the fries were as wet and limp as spaghetti saturated in grease.  Clearly the oil had not been changed in days -- The fries were black!!!  Now how could I feed that to my child? 

Lastly, the beans must have been pureed because they ran about as runny as soup and I could not identify any beans there in. The rice was cold as if it were sitting in a fridge cooked from days before! I can't make this up o_0 I'm really not a mean person. I would never do that and I don't complain but today I have to because you could have killed me with that rancid shrimp taco!!! ; 0  So, yea thanks for not much. I would love to come back someday if the standards drastically change but right now I wouldn't be surprised if one day you file bankruptcy very soon for serving food like that to honest paying customers.  Two stars for the polite front desk service only.
