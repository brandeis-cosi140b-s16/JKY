Went on a Thursday night. Place seemed em;pty at first, but filled up during dinner. It took forever to get a waiter to take our order. The owner just stood in the front not doing much of anything. They had 2 staff taking orders. When our order finally arrived , the burrito I ordered was filled with dry little cubes of meat. The ingredients weren't mixed well. I ate about 1/2 of it,,before it became unappetizing.  I could't get it taken off the bill as I'd eaten more than 1/2. The food was all in all very poor, along with the service.
