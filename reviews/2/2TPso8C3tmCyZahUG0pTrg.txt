What a disappointment!

After reading these reviews and even hearing good (not great) reviews for a couple family members, we headed her this Sunday.  First off, I thought the service was mediocre to poor.  Not friendly, no smiles, and they never came back to the table except to take the order and deliver the food.  No water, no extra chips for the table of four, nothing.

My wife tried the Huevos Rancheros, which were okay, not terrific.  Congealed eggs versus over easy, but a big tortilla.  $6-7 bucks, so didn't break the bank.

I had the two enchiladas and shredded taco plate, about $10.  Overpriced, greasy, and just not very good.  Gut bomb was more like it.

My daughter had two shredded beef tacos for $4, filling.  My son had a $4 or so bean an cheese burrito, again just okay.

Re-fried beans were paste, and more lard than beans it tasted like.  Rice was good, not great.

Anyway, not even in the top 1/2 of mexican restaurants I've been to.  Definitely not in the top 3-4 like many reviews seem to indicate. 

I live downtown, so only about 5 min from here.  I really wanted this to become my favorite new place.  

But when a place is in a just okay neighborhood, dirt driveway, and mediocre to poor interior, man, their food and service needs to shine.

And they just don't.

I won't be back.  

By the way, If anyone wants to know my favorite Mexican owned and operated, not ritzy but excellent food place in Phoenix, head to Las Glorias south of Northern on 19th Avenue.  Better value, better food, better decor, and way better service.
