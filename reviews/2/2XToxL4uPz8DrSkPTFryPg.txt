We had high expectations about dining here, we arrived and parked in the rear, where we admired the interesting graffiti art that engulfs the entire edifice. We found it very interesting and it set our mood as we entered the restaurant. Upon entry we were met with the sounds of a lone singer belting out a ballad of not so sweet tones and were sat at a table for two. Hugo, our server, promptly arrived to take our drink order...water and iced tea, more like iceless tea sitting in a pitcher on rolling cart in the middle of the dining area that was bled down to a murky tea tinted water mixture. I ask Hugo to bring us a glass of full strength tea from the source not the openly exposed watered down pitchers on the cart. Low and behold, my wife received a glass straight from the pitcher! Arrg! I asked again for some undiluted tea and received a glass of just as diluted tea from a different pitcher sitting on the bar in the other room! Note...this will be last time we see Hugo at our table until our food arrives, not one refill is offered as my glass lays devoid of water throughout our entire meal. I ordered fish tacos and spicy fries, my wife ordered an omelet with zucchini. The tacos were literally the size silver dollar pancakes, the tortillas were not warmed. They encapsulated one inch long battered fish pieces that were 60% batter and mushy to boot. Appetizer portions at best. The fries were undercooked and limp. The wife proclaimed her omelet as pretty good but unremarkable. Not being much of Yelp reviewer, but a regular reader/user, this experience pushed me to change that...
