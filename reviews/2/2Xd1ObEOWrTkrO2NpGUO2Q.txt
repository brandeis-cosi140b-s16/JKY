Food: 2 out of 5

Below Chipotle standards, in terms of food, and the details are missed. For example, the fajitas are horribly overcooked and the line food just doesn't look good.

Customer Service: 1 out of 5

Walked up with no line and it still took 2 minutes for someone to notice me, another minute to find someone to serve me and another minute for that employee to put gloves on.

Cleanliness: 4 out of 5

Line looks clean and tables are regularly wiped down. Manager seems to be the only person doing it though.

Overall: 2 out of 5

Other than the manager, no one on the crew appears to want to be there and it shows. The problem is that the closest alternative location, SouthPark Mall, really shorts you on the portions.
