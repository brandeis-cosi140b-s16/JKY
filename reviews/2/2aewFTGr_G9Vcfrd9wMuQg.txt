First time here, told to come here from our friends ,it's ok but not the best . Looking around the place its ok looking , floor was a little dirty , chairs are cushioned , waiter was nice enough not really friendly . 
We sat down severed right away chips and salsa , green and red , both no taste ,asked for hot one. That was much better , added it to our first ones . The red salsa was to much tomato taste no salt , the green really sweet tasting .
When ordering asked the difference between green and green , sauce if one was hotter than the other , he said no just red green coloring . 
Food was brought looked good, tasted again like no seasoning . Not the Mexican food we are looking for , my Husband ordered Chili Relleno ,said ok , better with sour cream, I ordered cheese enchiladas, no taste but added their verson of hot salsa we asked for in the beginning , so that took it up a notch . 
Other people sitting around us complain about the beans and chips , saying something not good, no more big bowl just a few bean scoops on a plate, also asking for a new basket of chips cause really salty .waiter explain about bowls breaking .
Lastly chips tasted like out of the bag,maybe not but these are salty . 
No wifi
Prices are good
Bathrooms really clean 
Would be come back not sure , we will wait to see if things change from our friends .
