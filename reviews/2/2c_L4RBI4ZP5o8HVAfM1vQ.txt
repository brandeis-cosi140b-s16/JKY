I was quite excited to go here based upon all the reviews on Yelp and by friends but was a bit disappointed.  We only ordered the Fortas and there was very little meat compares to the bread sizes. While the salsa was tasty it wasn't very filling or satisfying.  Their "chips" we're Ruffles. Overall maybe would consider it if I had a coupon and would try something else
