Disgusting atmosphere.  Food was mediocre, but in my table of four, the other three people all received their food while I waited about 25 minutes for mine. No apology or anything. I didn't even want it by the time it came since everyone was already done eating. 
This was after about an hour wait to even sit down
The staff was rather unpleasant looking and acting, dirty carpet and just nasty in general. Go somewhere else.
