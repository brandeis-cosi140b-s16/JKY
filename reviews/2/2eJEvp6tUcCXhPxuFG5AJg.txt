Sooo... Ok. I live Mexican food. I grew up in Southern California so my standards for Mexican food are high. That being said I assume most places are gonna be bad so that if they are good I'm quite happy.... And if they aren't well... That's what I expected. 

This place made me happy and quite upset at the same time. I'll start at the beginning. The chips... Kinda bad. They were super dry and weird. Super weird consistency and zero salt. Our second basket was better, but still lacking. The salsa was ok... Not amazing but not bad. Margaritas were good and seemed to be on the strong side which no one should complain about....ever.

My burrito was actually alright. I had the carnitas burrito and it was good. It needed a bit of spicing up so it asked for hot sauce and another margarita when the waiter checked back. He said no problem. A few min pass and he brings my margarita and says he'll be right bam with the hot sauce. Ok... I'm eating very slowly because I want that hot sauce. It's now been probably 10 min since my margarita came. I don't like eating slow... And I finally say screw it and finish eating. He comes and takes my plate away... And then he brings me the hot sauce to the table. I mean really?

Bottom line, Drinks: Yay! Food: Ehh. Service: Booooo!
