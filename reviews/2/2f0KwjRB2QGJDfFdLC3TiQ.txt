Eh. Better then Taco Bell. That's not saying much, though.

You ask what motivated me to come here?  Apparently they arbitrarily decided that Friday (7/24) was "National Margarita Day".  In actual fact there is a National Margarita Day, and it's Feb 22.  But when they declare an all-day happy hour, fine...it's "National Margarita Day" as far as I'm concerned.

So we get one each of the two types of margarita they sell, plus they had $3 appetizers.  So we ordered the mini chimis, taquitos, and red chile beef cheese crisp.  Plus a side of rice.  

I did NOT like the cheese crisp.  Ever smell chili powder?  That's what the red beef tasted like.  Chili powder.  My wife was a bit more forgiving, but I stopped after about 1/2 piece.

The mini chimis were fine.  Nothing special.  In fact, less than nothing special.  "Underwhelming" leaps to mind.

The taquitos tasted like those Delimex ones at Costco...you know, the ones they sample in the store trying to get you to buy the 2000 taquito box in the case behind them?  Yeah, those.  Again, totally underwhelming.

But the rice was flavorful.  I liked that.

The margaritas were sad.  It's a good thing we only paid $1 for them or I'd be upset.

But, after years of seeing this place, I've finally tried it and proven that I was correct not to come here before.  I won't be coming back, either.  Better than Taco Bell, sure.  But why would you want to do either?  Even with "happy hour" pricing it's not worth it.
