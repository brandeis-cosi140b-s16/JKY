I tried this place because the filibertos near my house is so bad (mcqueen and pecos). The food itself at this location was pretty good but everything else was sub par.  My friend and I ordered five rolled tacos and a ham breakfast burrito respectively.  The cashier spoke clearly at first but when she said my total she very much mumbled it but I thought nothing of it in the moment.  Turns out the prices had gone up about a dollar but they had not changed the signs so I did not know. She explained and I understand situations change but it came across as dishonest. After the longer than usual wait for our food we headed home to eat. The burrito itself was actually pretty good but the red sauce was absolutely terrible. There was zero spice and just barely an attempt at flavor. Some folks don't care for sauce but i find it to be an essential part of any Mexican dish. Perhaps I just caught them on an off day but it was a disappointing first impression.
