You know that feeling when you go to a restaurant and you don't want to give it a bad review? Well, today is one of those days. The food was sub par. We had ordered the guacamole which was pretty good. My fianc√© ordered the carne asada tacos which were better than the al pastor tacos I ordered. Mine were bland and dry. 

Our waitress however was on another planet. She was one of those waitresses who tried to impress you by taking your order but not writing it down. I have to admit, I do get impressed when waitresses do that, but I'm not impressed when they swing by 15 minutes after taking our order to make sure she remembered it correctly (this was done throughout the night). I also got annoyed how they would offer to bring chips but never did and we also waited forever for our food that should have only taken 10 to 15 minutes to make. FYI: the restaurant wasn't even busy, 8 people were there max on a Monday night at 7:15pm. 

Being a foodie, I really dislike writing bad reviews but if I hadn't had such crappy service, or didn't have to wait forever for food that I had ordered, I think I would have had a better experience.
