After more than six years, I'm back to update one of my very first reviews. And it has not changed very much.

The food is still mediocre. Today, I chose the chicken quesadilla and found it bland and boring. Served with a small pot of salsa, a scoop of sour cream and a scoop of guacamole, it was only for the bottle of Cholula on the table that kept it from being tasteless.

I had a Corona with it and there is something seriously wrong with paying $6.79 for a bottle of Corona. Even at airport prices, that's simply absurd.

Service was good and I was not rushed. If you have a decent layover and a craving for bland Mexican, here's Tequileria. Though the burger joint in C is excellent and the wine place in the atrium is also excellent.
