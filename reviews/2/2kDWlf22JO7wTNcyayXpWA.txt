This place is below average. I ordered my food to go - Chile Relleno a la carte and a Chicken Chimichanga Plate Enchilada Style. Staff was friendly and my order was done fast, but the food wasn't very good. The Nachos were stale, my Chile Relleno was made with New Mexico Chiles and not the Poblano listed on the menu, lastly my Chimichanga was merely chicken - no sauce or flavor to substantiate the "enchilada style" designation.  I've sampled enough of this menu to know that I won't be back.
