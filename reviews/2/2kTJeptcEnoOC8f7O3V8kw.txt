A little pricy for the quality of food you are getting. We ordered Filet Steak Nachos as an appetizer. The nachos came out with just chips, cheese and the steak. Steak was great but the cheese literally tasted like the cheese you'd get out of gas station nachos. But service was good. The two stars is for it being pricy for what you are getting. No restrooms on ground floor. Uh..:just not feeling it.
