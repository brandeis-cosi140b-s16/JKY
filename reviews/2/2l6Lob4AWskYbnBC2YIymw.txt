I came here based on the recommendation from another yelper and I have to say I'm quite disappointed. The fact that the place was completely empty should've tipped me off that I wasn't in for a decent meal. I got the asada tacos on flour tortillas. The meat was a bit on the dry side and overcooked. The rice and beans were standard. The friendly cashier is the only thing keeping this place from getting 1 star. I definitely won't be going back.
