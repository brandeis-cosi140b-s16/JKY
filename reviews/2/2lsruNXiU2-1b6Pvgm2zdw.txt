I love tacos, so I really wanted to love this place. I tried, but the chemistry wasn't there. First off, dirty bathrooms. The shack was only open for a few hours this particular day by the time I used the bathroom, so I assume there was no way the bathroom became so trashed and smelly in such a short amount of time. Likely truth is that it hadn't been cleaned from the day(s) before. Same bathroom the staff uses? I hope not. 

Portions were small in contrast to price. The value was not there. The food was excellent. The cashier trashed my large order by getting it wrong. Then the order comes out taco by taco. Some in my party ate while others waited. The wait time from ordering to receiving the last taco was  greater than 20 minutes. 

They were very apologetic. As an entrepreneur myself, I am sympathetic to anyone starting a new business. Product was good. People needed additional training. Process requires some streamlining. 3stars mean I'll give it another chance. But they earned 2 stars. e.g. I will not be returning.
