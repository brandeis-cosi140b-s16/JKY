We ate at this place back in January but I haven't had a lot of time to write reviews. So I'm starting to review the places on my list.
We came here after trying the Raul Y Theresas on Litchfield. The decor in the restaurant really needs an update. I understand it's old and has been there a long time but it's kind of run down and needs a face lift.
We went with a sort of large group- my mom, stepdad, and sister were in town so we all went over there to check it out. I ordered shredded beef tacos because my sister had tried them at the Litchfield road location and they were great there. Mine were kind of overcooked on the outside and were not as good as the ones at the other Raul and Theresa's, so I was kind of bummed. 
My husband got the Chorizo Burro with egg and cheese. He had the same thing at the other location and liked it better the first time. He said it was overcooked at this location (Avondale). 
The waitress was nice but she kept calling everybody "baby" which was a little weird that she was saying it to my stepdad in front of my mother. Also we needed more drinks and I had to go get the waitress to order them because she was sitting down with her sisters chit chatting instead of checking on our table. The thing I liked about the restaurant was they brought some rice in a separate bowl for my baby without me even asking. That was nice.
Later on my stepdad got a very upset stomach and he thinks it was from whatever he ate. I am not sure what dinner he ate. 
I've had way better food. I don't know of any other decent Mexican places in Goodyear or Avondale. If you have any good suggestions please contact me.
