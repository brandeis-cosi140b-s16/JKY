The nachos looked awesome but wasnt going to wait that long to actually get them.  Service was slow here, beyond slow and zero vibe.  A tequila bar should be upbeat with young people serving and having fun, the staff was older and mostly philipino speaking little english and more interested in watching tv then clearing tables, other people didnt get silverware, and most people were all looking around for someone to help them, so me and my buddy said screw it and decided to just get some dollar shots THAT NO LONGER EXIST.  Two dollar margaritas of low quality is no deal, the shots are an ounce or less and cheap cuervo.  Totally dissapointed in this place.  I would have a better time at a dive bar in Barstow.
