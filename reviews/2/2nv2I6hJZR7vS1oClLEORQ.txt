Meat Is mediocre, nothing home made about this place, Tortas are small and why put egg in a torta? The tortas are SMALL for 7 dollars average, if you know good mexican food this place is generic food nothing special, it was also dirty I did not like it at all,,, Sorry maybe am too picky but spending 30 dollars on 2 tortas drinks and tip, is not worth it.
