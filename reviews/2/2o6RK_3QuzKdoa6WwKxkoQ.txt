I will start by saying great food and amazing salsa... However worst service and slowest wait staff I've ever encountered. It's not even busy in here. I ordered a beer literally 20 min ago and still haven't gotten it. Also the salsa is brought in a lil carafe and nothing to poor it in. Very odd and puts the patron in a difficult situation to figure out.
