I ordered the stuffed plantain and a pupusa. The pupusa was ok-good, and only left me craving a fantastic one from el pulgarcito de america. I didn't care for the meat in the stuffed plantain at all.  I also got a mango drink that was very good.

Service was very friendly, but also very inattentive, especially when it was time for the check.  If I were in my grandmother's little town with nothing, I would go back, but not in Charlotte where we have so many better choices.
