The food is typical for what you would expect if you are familiar with New Mexican style food.  Really nothing stood out beyond that because the food service was stupid slow and came out cold.  The waiter was nice but we rarely saw him and the meal took much to long.  Won't be back solely base on the service.

Btw - our booth was by the patio so every time they open the door myself and 2 small kids got a great whiff of second hand smoke.  Yum.
