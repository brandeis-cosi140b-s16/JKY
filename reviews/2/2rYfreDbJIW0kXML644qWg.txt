Tasty but pretty pricey. It's the same concept of Chipotle; choose a burrito, salad, etc and add your choice of meat and toppings. Basically lettuce and cheese. Tortillas and meat were very good but they loaded my taco with lettuce, taking up the whole thing. Side of rice and beans, which are mediocre. $13 for 2 small tacos and a small drink. Employees at McDonald's are friendlier than here too...
