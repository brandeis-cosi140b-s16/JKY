Had planned to dine elsewhere but when that did not work out, we had heard good things from family so ultimately came here for lunch.  It was surprisingly quiet, which perhaps should have been our first clue.  Our drinks came quickly and our orders were taken and we started in on the chips and salsa.  It was fresh but a little watery for me.  The queso dip was blah.  It seemed to be lacking flavor and quickly hardened.  Three of the orders came quickly, but the fourth came MUCH later (at least 5 minutes) without any explanation or apology.  Our waiter seemed scattered and even spilled a pitcher of tea (thankfully not very close to our table).  We would ask for refills or extra chips etc, sometimes they would come, often we would have to remind him or our requests. The combination I chose was mediocre.  The chicken enchilada was just OK but thankfully topped it with the Baja sauce upon the suggestion of a family member.  The chili relleno had the thickest batter and was tasteless.  The black beans were seemingly straight from the can topped with a little cheese.  The highlight of my lunch was the bite of a fellow diners chicken tamale ... sweet and savory and topped with the baja sauce ... I found myself wishing I had followed her lead and ordered that instead ...
