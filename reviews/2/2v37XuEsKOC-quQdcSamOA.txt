The food is pretty good, if you actually get what you ordered. I only get take out and as much as I try to check something is usually wrong when I get home. Ordered chips and salsa and only got chips covered in cilantro? I don't get it. The guacamole was a neon green and I decided to steer clear of that. Horchata is watery. I prefer Roberto's and will drive the extra distance next time.
