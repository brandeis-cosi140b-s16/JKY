Been here twice now and I must say I'm disappointed.  The first time I visited was for lunch and the line was so long, waiting over 30 minutes in line just to order, seemed a bit unorganized, but I chalked it up to being brand new.  Second time was even worse.  Waiting in line way too long again,  things go so chaotic as far as who ordered what as some things must be ordered from the kitchen, which means you are waiting longer than a person behind you....staff doesn't know who ordered what.  Utter chaos.  I probably will not be back, even though the food is really good, I can't deal with the chaos.  The food line was also really dirty yesterday, and I saw an employee take a huge scoop of something out of the salsa and throw it in the trash, and then use that same salsa to dress tacos.  No thanks.
