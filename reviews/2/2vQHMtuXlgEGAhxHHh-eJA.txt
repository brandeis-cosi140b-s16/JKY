The one thing I can say for sure is that this place was dirty! I walked in and the first thing I saw was flies. Immediately, I was turned off but I decided to go for it anyways. The girls working were very nice. One asked if I had been there before and when I said no she offered me a sample platter. The kalua pig sample she gave me had a huge piece of fat attached, but the flavor was decent. I ordered a kalua pig burrito and a keiki taco. The food was not bad. I can't complain about that and thats why I'm giving 2 stars rather than 1. However, the tray I was given my food on was dirty and had old food stuck on it. The table we sat at was sticky so we moved and that table was sticky too. The napkin holder was covered in grease and dust. The floor had food everywhere. The windows and soda station  were covered in greasy fingerprints and bits of food. The wall I sat next to even had food stuck to it. The flies, oh man the flies were the worst. There were 3 flies that I had to keep shooing away. It made eating really unpleasant because it kept landing on my son's food. If it wasn't 100 degrees outside I would have sat out there! It's hard to believe the kitchen is clean when the dining room was so filthy. I would recommend a good deep cleaning ASAP! I was really excited about trying this place and was very disappointed by it.
