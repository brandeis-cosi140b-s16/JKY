I HATE writing bad reviews,  but some things are what they are. Easy access from my office,  friendly staff, and the salsa was herbaceous and fresh. However, for over $7 a burrito and pubpar meat, I can't show much love. Shit, I grill and make badassery all the time and I KNOW that the cook wouldn't eat that gristle himself or service it tonhis family! Travel a minute south and order the same at La Rosita, much better quality and save $2.
