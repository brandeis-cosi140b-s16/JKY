Finally, North Scottsdale has a fast food Mexican restaurant!!! Not Sure if it ever really needed one?? Okay food, Nothing that stands out... I tried their Signature Carne' Asada Taco's and a Cheese Quesadilla with their Grilled chicken... Good choices.  I wouldn't drive out of my way to get there, I just happen to have to drive past it, at least twice a day during the week, and still have only been there on one occasion.  I would agree with another reviewer, the staff is indifferent, and does act like  you are intruding on their time.
