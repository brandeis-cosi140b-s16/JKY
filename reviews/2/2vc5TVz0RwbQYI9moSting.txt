We've been fans of the original location for several years. About a month ago we ate at the new one off Puma. The outdoor dining was awesome. A friend was in from Chicago last weekend. We made reservations at Pima. When we got there They had no reservations in our name. They called the other location (not sure why, either you have a table or not). No reservations there, We didn't call there. They said, oh this happens a lot. We were stuck upstairs in a plain, cramped loft. Service was slow and the food not up to par. It was a disappointing and embarrassing evening, as our friend is a chef and we'd been raving about the place. Stick with the other location for a more enjoyable meal.
