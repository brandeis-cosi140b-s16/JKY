How much salt do you need to put on the freaking carne asada?  Seriously, I hope you guys are using a recipe and not eyeballing it. The deep fried fish taco was good. Would have been netter if it was in a corn tortilla like I asked for. My server seemed a lot too confused.  I may go back at some point.  Also, I'm not thrilled about paying $13 for 3 tacos and a drink. The equivalent at Roberto's is like $9.
