I've gone here a couple of times since Filiberto's makes me feel sick every time I eat something there & I get a simple no meat breakfast burrito. The lady, who is very rude everytime I go no matter how nice I am, repeated it back to me & I confirmed that it was right. I get my NO MEAT breakfast burrito & SURPRISE it has bacon in it! I asked about it & she said I asked for bacon. Sorry, I didn't. I asked for it again for free since it was messed it up & she said flat out no. I love this food, it's good and their tortillas don't get hard after 2 minutes like Filiberto's but I will only go to the McQueen & Guadalupe shop now because their customer service is very nice and there is a girl there who has taken the time to remember my order. That extra step makes me feel like I matter as a customer and that they care about my experience. Not many places do that and it makes me very happy.
