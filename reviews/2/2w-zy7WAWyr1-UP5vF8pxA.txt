Thoroughly unremarkable but serviceable. I've eaten here a couple times when I was in a hurry. The food is filling but completely forgettable. I usually expect a little more out of a Food Fight restaurant.

What it boils down to is that there are cheaper Mexican or Tex Mex alternatives that are at least as good and in some cases far better.

Go here if you have a hankering for some Tex-Mex if you are nearby and can't think of anything better.
