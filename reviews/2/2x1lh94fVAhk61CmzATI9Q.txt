Stopped by for breakfast. Sat outside. Promptly served 2 glasses of ice water and a menu. Chose Bacon & Eggs for $8.95. Ridiculous price, but came with beans and hash browns and thick-sliced, very fresh, bakery bread toast. Ordered soda which came half-way through my meal. My server, Jesus, who was very hard to understand, explained it was due to "macheen broke".  Food came within minutes of ordering and was decent. Generous amount (6) thick-sliced bacon. Only complaint is, Jesus never returned to replenish my water, or collect the check. Employees do convey an "anxious-to-serve" approach, but seem rattled, confused and "tripping-over-each-other" for your attention. Nice and refreshing to see, but strangely executed. Friendly, and welcoming. Overall, just o.k.
