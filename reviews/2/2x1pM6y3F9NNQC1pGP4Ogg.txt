Came in for lunch about a week and a half ago and I kept putting my review off because i wasn't to sure how I felt about this place...

I had the Shrimp Fajitas they were a large portion and were served with rice and beans. Both the rice and beans were pretty gross nothing like I've ever experienced at a Mexican place :(  the beans left this gross after taste in my mouth and the rice just was blah! 

The service was weird they sat us right away and got us drinks right away, but when it came to taking our order they were no where to be found! 

All in all it was ok nothing special...
