The other evening I saw someone eating a burrito on Mill Ave. and it looked pretty good so I inquired as to its origin and was directed to Hippies Cove. I continued on my way with a burrito in mind for another day. Today, I got that burrito. 

Walking through the doors I felt rather awkward. There were no signs directing me where to place my order, just a worker and two apparent patrons huddled silently together. As I made my way towards them, patron 1 dispatched and quickly walked out the front door, perhaps to secure the perimeter, grumbling all the while. It was then that I was greeted by a pleasant woman who prompted me to give my order. As I glanced at the menu, I suddenly became aware of patron 2 again, who was making his best effort to look as menacing as he possibly could; was it possible that I had interrupted some important negotiation? I found him humorous and concluded that he only posed a threat to my appetite for he smelled a bit. Reenter patron 1. Patron 1 apparently found the environment of the restaurant more suitable than the outdoors; perhaps he was afraid of being picked up on an existing warrant. Upon receiving my burrito, I bid the menace, his counterpart and the pleasant woman farewell, exited the building and returned to my car. Once home I devoured the burrito out of sheer hunger; it was rather tasteless and I questioned the freshness of ingredients. Needless to say, that while the burrito wasn't as rich as I'd hoped, the characters involved certainly were.
