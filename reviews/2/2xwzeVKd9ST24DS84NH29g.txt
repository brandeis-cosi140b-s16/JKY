I've been expecting this place to get better whenever I go there, but each time has brought a bad experience. The first time, I had a horribly rude waitress and slow service. The food was mediocre. The second time, I had a great meal with the enchiladas and good service, but my significant other had to ask to take the food back once, and almost a second time, too! For a Mexican food place in the middle of Phoenix, one would expect authentic and flavorful cuisine,  but this place is far from it and overpriced to add.
