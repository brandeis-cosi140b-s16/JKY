I hate to say that I was utterly disappointed with La Mestiza. I had been wanting to try this for a long time, and had high expectation from looking at the menu so many times.

I ordered the sangria and I love sangria but this was just boring. Hardly any fruit in it and it came in a very small wine glass and was way too expensive.

The chips were stale and that was VERY disappointing because we were all starving.

The menu items looked so yummy and tasty, but everything was boring. I got the tamale and it was just a chunk of meat basically.

I won't be back.
