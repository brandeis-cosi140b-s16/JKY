This is not about the food but about the girl taking our order.

We were her on vacation and staying at the Cancun Resort. My son lives in North Vegas so I am a little familiar with Roberto's. I love the fresh cucumbers at the salsa bar!

We brought our three grandkids who all wanted tacos. I sent my husband in to order and the girl at the front just seemed annoyed with his ordering. He was trying to find the most cost effective way to feed our group of 5. He ended up ordering 3 combo plates for $22.38 for all 5 of us to share. All the tacos on the orders were different to satisfy the 3 kids preferences so she became extra annoyed at the special order for each combo. 

It was Wednesday and the place was very busy...why? Because it was .99cts taco day at Roberto's! This awful woman let my husband struggle with this order! We had 6 tacos to share for 5 people with beans and rice and it cost, again $22.38!!! We could have all had 2 tacos each for $12.00 and a much easier way for us to order to her!

We saw the sign in the window long after we ordered. What I can't understand for the life of me why this woman didn't tell my husband it was .99 cent taco Wednesday. I think it was a terrible thing to do to a family. 

I hope Roberto's will tell their staff that the decent thing to do is tell folks of the daily specials. Especially considering how many folks are from out of town in Vegas and don't know the specials offered.
