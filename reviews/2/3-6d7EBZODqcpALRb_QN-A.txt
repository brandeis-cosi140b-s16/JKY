The great thing about going out for Mexican food is that even if the meal is not good, you can leave full if you stuff yourself with chips and salsa.  I can only describe the food as flavorless.  The fried tortilla of my chimichanga tasted like an egg roll; how weird is that!?  On the plus side, the waitress was friendly and attentive... unfortunately, going out to eat isn't just about service, so I won't likely be coming back.
