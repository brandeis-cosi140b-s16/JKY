Hoping this is very much an interim review because my experience was so bad that I  managed a bite, waited for family to finish eating, and then went to get some bad food ( jack in the box) to cheer me up with the refund. 

The latter was  fast and hot ,the antithesis of the Bueno Burger meal.    I will stipulate that the results of the evening were heavily influenced by under-staffing and a first night on the job cook  regardless half an hour to be served a chill bun, with tepid meat dragged down by cold ingredients ,in a very cold restaurant , was unpleasant to touch let alone stick in the mouth. That it comes at a premium was just annoying. 

Side onion rings were not hot either  which is kinda a no-brainer to get 

Thankfully the manager ,in charge , probably the best thing about this place, has a clue  and  refunded mine and gave us a card for a future burger because there's a real disconnect between the reviews and our experience last  Friday and I wouldn't mind being proven wrong.
