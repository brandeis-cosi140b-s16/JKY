My husband and I decided to have lunch near his office and opted to try something different. I figured some of the best ethnic food comes from the hole in the wall places anyway. We walked into the restaurant and were greeted by the hostess and promptly seated. The interior looked classy and was quite spacious.  We decided to try several of their pupusas ($1.50 ea), in addition I had the chicken enchiladas and my husband had their carne asada burrito. The pupusas were very good, and a steal for the price. The rest of the food was not anything special that would warrant coming back.

The service was non existent after our food came out. I ran out of water and pushing my cup damn near off the edge of the table I guess was not enough of a hint that I would like a refill. There were no signs posted that you're suppose to pay at the register anywhere in the restaurant, and maybe that's not the standard procedure, but we ended up going up to the register to pay. It was a fairly inexpensive lunch with solid pupusas and non existent service. I would not go back.
