I really wanted to like Catina...but was disappointed.  We went on a Friday night and waited only 20 minutes for 2 people which wasn't too bad. The girl who sat us walk so much faster than us to the table and didn't even say anything before walking away. Our waiter was very friendly on the other hand. He brought out chips but they were out of containers for the salsa so we had to wait about 10minutes for salsa and I will say it was well worth the wait! The salsa is delicious! We ordered the house margaritas that was also really good and fairly strong! So the reason for the 2 stars, the delicious salsa and margaritas.
Now for the food.....I ordered the enchilada suiza. Very disappointing. The chicken was so dry and tough! I barely ate my meal. I was wishing for more sauce to help with the dryness but they were lacking in sauce as well....such a bummer!
