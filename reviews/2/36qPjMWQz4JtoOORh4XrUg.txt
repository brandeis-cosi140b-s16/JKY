We ended up eating here, only because Old Pueblo was closed for remodeling. The food was OK, along with the service. I had the carnitas chimichanga, meat was bland, no seasoning or spice. Girlfriend had the chile relleno, same bland taste. The total ended up being about $35 for the 3 of us, which IMHO was way over priced for the quality and taste and they charge you 50 cents to run any type of credit/debit card too, and that's always annoying.
