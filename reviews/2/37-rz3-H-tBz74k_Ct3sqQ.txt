Ok. So.... Being a Latina and living in AZ all my life, I know some good Mexican food when I see it/eat it. This place USED to taste good a few years ago, Well not so much of good food this time from My husband and I's experience. I ordered a bean and cheese burrito wet, aka enchilada style. First off, I don't think the cashier understood too well, however, she was polite and seemed like she did, anyway, didn't get it wet when my order was served,  but they fixed it at "no charge". Long story short, my beans didn't have any flavor and didn't taste "fresh", the enchilada sauce tasted as if it was from a can, my husbands fish tacos were soggy, no flavor, and chewy (batter). The red and green Chili/salsa was good though...I had to pour it on my food to give it flavor. Overall I felt it was a waste of money. Very disappointed :-(
