We went here on a Wednesday evening to have dinner with some friends for a birthday.  I was told that they have "the best food in town".  You have to remember that this town is very small and riddled with fast food and a few chain restaurants, so there is not much in the way of competition.  I was also told that they serve "authentic Mexican" food.  I had the ground beef chimichanga which comes with beans and rice, sour cream and guacamole.  My wife had the Carne Asada which came with beans and rice and tortillas.  The chimi that I had was very good.  Perfectly cooked and seasoned.  The Carne Asada, on the other hand, was something other than good.  It had a very weird flavor that I could not pinpoint and was very tough.  We also ordered the cheese sauce on the side to use as a dip with the chips and salsa (the salsa was very good and had just the right amount of heat).  The cheese sauce was, to put it plainly, gross.  It tasted like it had mustard in it, a very tangy and almost vinegar-like after taste.  It was just plain nasty.  The service was extremely slow and refills were hard to come by.  The place itself was dirty, stained ceiling tiles and stains on the walls, the restrooms are in need of an extreme makeover and I am not sure if the air conditioning was off or just set really high, but when you are sweating just sitting there and it is 113 out, something is wrong.  I just don't think that we will go back.  Oh, I almost forgot, we ordered a side of pickled jalapenos to eat with our dinner.  They were very dry and almost tasteless and no heat what so ever, they could have been pickled green peppers for all I know.  BTW no alcohol at all.  Not a deal breaker but I thought you might want to know!
