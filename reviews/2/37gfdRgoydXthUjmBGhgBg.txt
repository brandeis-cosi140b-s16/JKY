I think I'm finally over my addiction to Chipotle. I ate it all the time when we were in NY, but since moving to CA, theres not one near us. I was very happy to see it on the strip... but its just not as good as I remember. 
Seems like the employees work hard to keep the place clean and tidy but have trouble dealing with the volume of people.
