2.5 stars, but rounded down based on taste and value.

Basically, this restaurant was just easy to sit at yesterday, versus the over-crowded ESPN Center. 

The menu looked decent enough, but when the food came out, it was pretty unexciting and unimpressive. The taco/burrito/enchilada combinations will be sure to affect you later in the day (if you know what I mean). My steak salad had good steak, but sad salad. 

Free chips and salsa!
