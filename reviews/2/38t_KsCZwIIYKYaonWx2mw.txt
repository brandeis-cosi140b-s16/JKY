I do this not because of the food, it is excellent, but because of the poor operational execution of this place.  I order food here regularly so I feel like my opinion carries some weight.  Here is what needs to be worked on:
- Phone in orders.  Either get a second line or drop the program.  I've called in before and either been on hold for 10+ minutes or I've spent 20+ minutes trying to get through to anyone.
-Adequately fulfill the quoted order times.  I have yet to receive an order within the time designated by the call.
-Parking lot....well that's a complaint for another time.

The food is some of the best Mexican in the East Valley but my patience has run razor thin because of those aforementioned execution issues.
