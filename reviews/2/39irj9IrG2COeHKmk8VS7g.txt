Love. Love Chipottle but not this location.

The staff was not so friendly and they were speeding me trough the process like the place was on fire. Once I got my order, it was the smalls portion I ever got at chipottle and did I mention how hungry I was? Starving!

My boyfriend ordered his usual burrito and also was so disappointed. Salsa that he asked for was not even in there and it was the smallest burrito he has ever had at Chipottle. He said, it was mostly tortilla that was served to him. 

It was not a good experience for me second time at this location and the only reason I go to this one is becasue it is right by my office. 

Never did I experience this type of service at the Chipottle by my house....No bueno Happy Valley....
