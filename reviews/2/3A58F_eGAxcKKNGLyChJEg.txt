Most of the time it's pretty good. Today I ordered a mango Zaba Rita. When it came out red I asked the girl behind the counter if it was Mango and she said, no we don't have that. Wouldn't that be helpful before it was ordered. If you don't have something don't let people order it or take it off the menu.
