Okay I went WAAAAY out of my way to check out this place after reading the great YELPs about it, and when I saw that Food Network Star Guy Fieri covered it on Diners, Drive Ins and Dives.  Must be FAB, right?   Not so much.  First, the service - if it can be called that - is remarkably apathetic.   When you are standing directly in front of a cashier for 5 minutes or more, and you have to actually say, "um, could I order?" before they are aware you are standing there, I think this is a symptom of a service issue.   Second, it just doesn't seem CLEAN in there; our tables were dirty and there is an off smell in the place.   And third, the food was OKAY but not amazing or awesome in any way.  Now for the disclaimer - I'm not totally qualified to judge any restaurant that serves a majority of meat-based dishes because I am vegetarian.   And my date that evening, who does eat meat, liked his.   But yawn on all the things I could eat - boring, greasy, served waaaay too slowly.  And it wasn't even very busy.   So basically I would say I was disappointed and for those of you who live 25 miles from this place like I do, don't waste the gas! ! !
