The service was kind and friendly, fairly efficient. The restaurant smelled slightly like sulfur. The bean and cheese burrito was less bean and more liquid brown and some cheese flakes. Tortillas tasted stale. The guacamole was just chilled avocado with cilantro, fairly bland. Chips were good though.
