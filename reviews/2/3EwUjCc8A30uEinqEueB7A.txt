Good chips and salsa is about all the positive I have to say about Manuel's on this visit.  The food quality was lacking - oversalted and grisley steak, greasy quesadilla my daughter rung out before eating and wilted lettuce strewn about the plates.  All of the prices are REALLY high for the quality of the food and it seems like there are NO more affordable options.  Even the kids menu is high ($5.50 plus extra for juice) and their emphatic NO SUBSTITUTIONS is frustrating.  The happy hour menu looks more promising but for a Family, it's a NO THANK YOU.  Sadly we won't be back to Manuel's any time soon.
