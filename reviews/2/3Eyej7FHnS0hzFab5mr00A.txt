Just had the new breakfast.  The breakfast taco was lame. Tasted like something you would make a kid in the microwave. The steak and egg burrito could have been good but they don't use any seasoning.  Very bland even with hot sauce. The hash brown was mediocre, basically the same one u get at Burger King. If u r looking for an alternative to McDonald's try Sonic. They have a pretty good breakfast burrito. 
Swing and a miss Taco Bell.
