Worst experience tonight. Did not listen when the young man was working there to take my order. I asked for more than heard. Also he forgot another mans order, that was there 4 people before me( he got his money back) then he gave me my food with no bag and gave me my hot sauce in my hand. I asked for a bag and he said that they were to small for my food.. WTF..
