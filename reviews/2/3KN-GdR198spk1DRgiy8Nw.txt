This place it just O.K.  There was a wait to get in and when we got seated we got the high bar stool chairs and after an hour my feet fell asleep.  

The service was TERRIBLE.  The waitress was difficult to find.  My boyfriend never had his drink refilled.  The food was below average but the prices were NOT.  I had a super huge Margarita that was great though and that was the only redeeming thing about the place.  Still it has a good location on the strip...but if you are looking for quality food...keep walking.
