I heart Chipotle. I HATE this location!! There is always this little black kid chilling outside trying to sell stuff. Does this kid even have a business license? If I were the owners of this Chipotle I would shut this kid down asap! He is literally there all the time. It doesn't matter what time of the day I go or which day I go he is always there with his plastic container. He tries to look all sad so people feel sorry for him and buy whatever he is selling. When I get up in the morning and get out the door I feel pleasant, but this kid just ticks me off every time I see him. I don't want to be harassed by some sad puppy dog looking kid every time I want to pick up Chipotle. For the love of God people!

What is truly sad is I go to Chipotle at least once a week and this location is closer to my house than the one on Camelback, but I rather go to the one on Camelback! This location needs to grow some balls and get rid of loiters trying to bother loyal customers.
