As far as Mexican food goes, and especially Mexican food you can get in Vegas, Jalisco falls flat for me.

I set up a lunch meeting here with a client because it was close to her work. When we arrived at 11:30 AM the place was quite vacant - to be expected. But even as we sat for an hour+ it never filled up for lunch time.

Chips and dips came out quickly - a boring bean (but at least warm!) dip, and a watery salsa. Thus far not impressed. I ordered a hot tea, expecting, well a regular 'ol tea and I was brought out a Green Tea. Well, okay, I'll drink Green Tea, sure, but when someone orders quote, "A hot tea" - they typically just want a brown, regular 'ol tea - not GREEN tea. 

Being that I was entertaining le client, I ordered up some guac which came out and looked very pretty, but fell completely flat taste-wise. It had both myself and my client reaching for the salt shaker. There was not even any hint of lime which made me question just what the heck was going on in this place.

Entrees came out many, many minutes later (service was SLOW). I ordered a combination plate (1 carne asada enchilada, and 1 shrimp taco). Taco was filled with very good, plump shrimp. I enjoyed it - it had a bit of a sauce in it, but not too much. Filler/shrimp/sauce was very well balanced. Moving onto the carne asada enchilada - very sad little guy (SMALL ENCHILADA) with not enough sauce on the outside, and dry meat on the inside. Beans and rice were OK.

Overall this was a lackluster experience. Food was so-so, ambiance was meh, and service was on the BLAH side. 

If you're in the area and you need a place to go eat Mexican, this will do, but it is nothing special.
