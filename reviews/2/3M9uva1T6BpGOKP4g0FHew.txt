Very disappointed in the food. The food was honestly disgusting. We ordered guacamole & it was hardly mashed with chunks of hard avocado & very bland. The chicken street taco had this sesame Asian sauce on it which did not mix with the Mexican style taco & was nasty. The snow crab rolls were okay besides for the unbelievably spicy wasabi ginger sauce that came with it & did not taste good. The edamame was probably the grossest thing we ordered with this horrible sauce on it. Just awful. &the shaking beef was pretty bland as well with similar weird sauce the edamame had. Don't come here if you are wanting good food...
