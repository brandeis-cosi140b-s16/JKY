Maybe my expectations were too high, but i just didn't enjoy my food that much here. 

I ordered a carne asada burrito and it took a while to make. That by itself is no problem, in fact I prefer that they take their time and make the best meal they can. Run by 2 older folks who reminded me of my grandparents, the small building has a very nice homey feel.

So when it comes out, it is this tiny little thing and felt like where did the almost $5 worth of burrito goodness go? Guess it must taste amazing then.And it delivers here, the flavor was great. 

Unfortunately the textures, authentic as they may be, just seemed to clash too much. I thought the steak portion was too tough to easily eat. That combined with a starchy cold tortilla just wasn't that appetizing to me. Almost reminded me of taco bell tortilla's when they aren't grilled a little.

I think the grandma sent out the grandpa to grab more meat as I was leaving, so maybe they were out of steak? Either way, I probably won't be coming back again.
