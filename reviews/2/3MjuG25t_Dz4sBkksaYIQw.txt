Before coming to the Sandbar, I had read up on some of the other Yelp reviews and thought, "Okay, I'm going to give this place a chance!"

So I went with my family, my mom, dad, sister and brother. We were seated pretty quickly and had our drink orders taken. Which was probably the only good thing that really happened during our visit.

We ordered a plate of wings to start us off before we ordered the rest of our meal. Our wings came in pretty fast, but we didn't have any plates or napkins on our table, and our waitress was no where to be seen. So we just started eating and had TWO wet-nap packets to clean our hands. Ugh.

We ordered a ton of food, a chicken burrito, a combo ceviche, Shrimp tacos, nachos, fried calamari and mussels.

My mom didn't like the burrito too much, and said for the price, she could've gotten 2 better tasting burritos at Humberto's.
I really liked the Calamari plate, but the breading around the Calamari was soggy. It made me sad because it really did taste good!

The nachos were good, the mussels were okay... A bit too salty even for my tastes. My sister wolfed down her tacos with no complaints and my dad was pretty meh to all the plates we ordered but ate all of them anyway. 

My margarita was sub-par, for 8 dollars I could make a better one at home, but I'm lazy so I ordered one anyway to maybe challenge all the nay sayers here on Yelp... But that was a futile battle.
Our Waitress disappeared for long intervals of time and it wasn't as busy as it would be during a weekend. 

If you have money and like to drink, this is the place for you, don't come here expecting 5-star service for a restaurant experience, a bar is still a bar, even if they have food.

Probably never gonna come back here unless someone is treating.
