Wife and I had some some time to waste before daughters performance. So we had something small to eat at Anita's. 
1st) Chip and Salsa:
Chips were greasy and rubbery? Don't know how this is capable! But they did it!
2nd) Shredded beef taco, green chili tamale plate:
Rice tasted like a uncle Ben's rice out of the box. Beans were OK, didn't quite like the taste. Both were way to salty. I however did like their taco, beef was reasonable seasoned.
3rd) Water:
Now after sharing this plate I was drinking water. Now during the meal, I noticed the glass was dirty. All this time I thought it was from me? Turns out it was inside the glass.
 I will never come back here again, even though everyone was very friendly, and our service was decent.
