I wanted to like this place. I love all the other spots from the group who did Joyride. The fresh chips and salsa were good! But the salsa verde we ordered wasn't. I ordered the almond horchata aqua fresca, but they were out. Okay, fine. So I order citrus. Nope. Pineapple? Sorry. The waiter was great and comped the mango one I finally ended up with. The service really was good here, albeit the bar was incredibly slow. As in, took 10-15 minutes each time we ordered drinks. 

So, onto the food. I got three tacos: carne asada, crispy fish (server's recommendation), and the chicken tikka. The best was the asada. It had a really good flavor and had that same smoked salsa they'd served with the chips. Too many raw white onions. Sadly, it was cold, as were all of my tacos. The chicken tikka really could have been great, but it was cold. The flavors were there, though. The crispy fish: yuck. Fish was cold and flavorless, the sauces had no taste. Wholly disappointing. I had the black beans for my side. They desperately needed salt and some seasoning. My boyfriend got the Mexican slaw. It too lacked flavor. All in all, I was disappointed. I adore Federal and Windsor, so I had high hopes. I definitely see room for improvement. I hope they get better, but I won't be trying again.
