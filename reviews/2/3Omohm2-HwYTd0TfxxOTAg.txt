Meh. 
I'd like to give an impassioned thumbs up or thumbs down but it's really middle of the road. I enjoyed the Henderson location, and being a downtown denizen, I expected to love this location, which I do....sometimes. I say meh because this place is literally hit or miss. I've had times when I can barely touch the food they give me, and three times when I'm scarfing it down like Gabriel Iglesias on taco Tuesday. This applies to both food and the drinks. There are some bartenders that if I see working I immediately know that I need to stick to my cervezas since they can't mess that up. Overall it's not bad, but it's not great. It's just workable, I'd just like consistency. The Henderson location has always been pretty good, I've heard good things about summerlin, and I liked nacho daddy when they had a booth at LIB. Fingers crossed that this place gets where it needs to be
