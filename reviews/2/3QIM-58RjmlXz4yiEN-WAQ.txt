I have been going to La Hacienda regularly for about 5 years.  Within that time, the service has gotten to be deplorable.  I went in today, was seated and given a menu. About 30 seconds later, my waiter came to take my order.  I told him that I needed another minute. Three other tables then came into the restaurant.  My menu is now closed on my table, but the waiter gets water for all three other tables and takes their orders before even glancing my way again.  I left.  I doubt if I will be back. There are way too many other Mexican options in Madison to put up with this kind of service.
