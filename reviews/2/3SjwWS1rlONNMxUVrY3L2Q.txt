First off, I want to mention that I had originally thought to give this place 3 stars...but I'll get to that shortly.

The food was....well, it was food.  Definitely food.  No doubt about it.  The food was similar to the street vendors and hole in the wall places I've seen in Tucson, AZ....but noticeably more greasy.  But the spices were what I was used to.  I just don't think they were used in the best way.

I walked in hungry and walked out not hungry.  In my book that's enough to get 3 stars...as long as nothing else goes wrong.

I'm not going say that the service was truly awful, but it was apathetic enough to drop the overall rating to 2 stars.
