This was out first time at Espos and we tend to try many of the Mexican food places in town. I am on the hunt for good Mexican food, I haven't found a good place yet here in AZ. I would think it would be easy but sadly this place wasn't that good. I had a basic crispy chicken taco and my husband had a carne asada taco. We shared some rice, beans and chips and salsa too. The meat was bland in the carne asada, no seasoning at all. The chicken wasn't grilled like it says on the menu and the crispy taco was so soggy from the chicken juices it all fell apart. The rice and chicken was super salty and I am usually the person who salts stuff and this was way to salty for even me. The salsa was bland and no flavor a other than a red chili taste. I would skip this place if you are looking for good Mexican food, this isn't worth the energy.
