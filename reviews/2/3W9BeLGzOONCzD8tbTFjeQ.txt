I received a catered meal from here on Mon. night at a talk that I attended.  It contained a chicken burrito, a few chips and pico de gallo, and half a brownie.  While edible, the chicken burrito was nothing special--it contained mostly rice, plus some chicken and the standard black beans.  There were very few veggies, and no extras, included in the burritos.  While I understand that not everyone may want guac, sour cream, cheese, etc. in their burritos, it would be nice to offer a small portion of these as an accompaniment either in each meal, or a larger portion of them with the order for people to apply as they please.  I found the lack of extras especially ironic in light of Qdoba's recent ad campaign about extras not costing extra.

Based on past experience, I believe the quality of this meal is representative of the quality of product at this Qdoba.  I visited with my labmates for lunch a little over a year ago, and recall being similarly underwhelmed by the nachos and quesadilla, both of which are two of my favorite Americanized Mexican foods.  Way back in 2007, when I tried Chipotle and Qdoba for the first time in Fort Collins, CO, I recall preferring Qdoba, because I felt that the product was similar in quality, but I appreciated the greater choice that Qdoba offered (I'm more into nachos and quesadillas than burritos, TBH).  However, based on more recent experience, I feel that the product quality at Qdoba (at least, at this location) has declined.  If they want to remain competitive with the similar business across the street, they need to kick up the product quality a notch.  As it were, they won't be receiving my business again anytime soon.
