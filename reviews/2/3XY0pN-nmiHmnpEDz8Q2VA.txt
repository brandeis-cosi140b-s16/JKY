This place use to be great 12 months ago when it was under a different name and management group. Now it is just plain bad food. I ordered a polle asado burrito that was just plain old nasty. I feel bad giving this place 1 star so I'll give it 2 stars since a buddy of mine frequents this place. There are half a dozen better fast food Mex places with a 1 mile radius so don't even bother with this place.
