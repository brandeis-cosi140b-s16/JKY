I have had good and bad experiences here I typically have problems with cores or lettuce in my salad. They also can't seam to cut the lettuce correct it is to big or not cut at all. I really love the flavors but they need some work on cutting things better. I recommend the sweet pork can go wrong with it! Hopefully they teach the employees to not serve bad parts of lettuce.
