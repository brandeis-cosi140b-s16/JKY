While my friend Rand H. enjoyed his meal here, I was not impressed.  There are no Filibertos in Northern California.  When I moved to Arizona and saw them all over I thought I might want to try them.  Almost everyone I know said "noooooo, don't do it!".  But I did not listen.  And I do like to think for myself.  Not everyone has the same taste so I gave it go. The taco shell was a bit stale, the meat tasted over cooked and greasy.  There was only one good thing about the burrito, the tortilla was fresh.  Overall I doubt I will go back but at least I can say I tried it.
