On Sundays I usually have my choice on where to eat but when my husband adds on this little phrase" just as long as there is something edible for me"....I feel guilty. He 's pretty picky so I chose Mexican food his favorite ! I wanted to try Tony's because one of my friends said it is her favorite Mexican Restaurant. What she orders here is probably fabulous but I wasn't happy with my meal. I ordered my usual Carne Asada Fries and a Beef taco . I liked the fact that they used bigger fries here but it tasted pretty generic. I'm used to my fries being loaded with sour cream, guacamole, cheese and big chunks of meat. My plate had little dollops of guacamole and sour cream on the side, The meat was tiny and overcooked. I also tried the beef taco and the meat looked juicy but it lacked flavor and the taco shells looked store bought. The service was great though ! Our glasses never stayed empty which is a big deal when we are dining out.
