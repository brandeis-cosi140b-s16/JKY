I have mixed feelings about this place. I decided on 2 stars with the highlights being atmosphere, impeccable service, and delicious sangria. 

Now- the lowlights. The tacos were pretty good but not great. I tried the original carnitas (best), chipotle shrimp (decent, shrimp was obviously frozen), and the short rib (short ribs were dry despite the sour cream and pico de gallo). 

The absolute worst piece of the meal was the appetizer we ordered. We got the seafood ceviche which had scallops, shrimp, and mahi mahi. Sounds great right?? WRONG. It is a crime to serve this outside of a Red Lobster. The frozen shrimp was the least of the offensive. The scallops were rubbery, the orange segments (apparently what the chef thought should act as the main citrus) were CANNED. They were huge and uniform in size. Could it get worse, you ask? Let me assure you- it can. The mahi mahi was served at the bottom of the serving dish as 1 large filet. And it was cooked? Did anyone bother to be educated on what ceviche is? Not only was it cooked, it was overcooked to the point that it tasted like rubber. I couldn't even cut it with my fork. The only reason I went back in for more than 1 bite was because we waited 90 minutes for a table (wait time quoted at 45 min) and I was starving. 

I would give 1 star for the tacos and sangria, it's at least worth that, and honestly our server gave 5 star service. Too bad the food couldn't compete. If you go here, stay as far away from the ceviche as possible.
