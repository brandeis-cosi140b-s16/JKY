Normally I like Federico's but the last two times I've been on Taco Tuesday and had the worst tacos ever.  They must be using oil that isn't hot enough because the taco shells come out dripping with oil, hard (not crispy) and impossible to bite. 

Might just be a Taco Tuesday thing...I'll give them one more try on a non-Tuesday to see if its better.  If not, sad to say won't be coming back. 

The staff is friendly though!
