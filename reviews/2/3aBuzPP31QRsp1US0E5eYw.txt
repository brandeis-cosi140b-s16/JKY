If I have learned anything about places that are Southwest or Mexican with a unique style or menu, it is that if you do not have great salsa. Forget it. 

At least they have an awesome patio with a OK happy hour. Service was good, bartenders were gave service with a smile and were kind to separate the checks for all 3 couples. Did I mention the patio?!
