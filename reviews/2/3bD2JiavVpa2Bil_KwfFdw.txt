I was hungry, it was filling and I ate it.  Built my own tacos, chose the pork, also added beans & guacamole.  Overall flavorless, some spice but the cheese was barely melted and I've made better guacamole with avocado & salsa than what was on there.  Small selection compared to a real Mexican place, no taquitos or chile relleno, or even a boring old taco salad.  Pickled onions reminded me of the south if the border plate at the Weary.  Overall I'm not impressed and for the prices, won't order again unless someone else pays.
