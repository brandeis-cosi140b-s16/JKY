They brought us to a bench table to be seated and after about 30 seconds we noticed small ants on the table so they moved us to another table. We thought someone would go and look to see the problem but after 30 min they just sat another family at the same table without even trying to remove the ants.

The waiter took our order and seemed ok until the food arrived and he had the order wrong for two orders. He finally got it right but seemed totally confused with everything. We have been to this restaurant many times over the last couple of years and it seems to be going down hill.
