Seemed good-- but it wasn't that great. I ordered a taco salad, and it wasn't very authentic as advertised. It was pretty pricey, but what am I saying, it's Vegas! However, I thought it was bland and had less flavor than a Jose Ole frozen burrito! I'm from Southern California, so maybe I expect a little more from Mexican food-- but this was supposed to be authentic. With all the money they make in this city, would it kill them to have a professional-cultural-cook adviser?
