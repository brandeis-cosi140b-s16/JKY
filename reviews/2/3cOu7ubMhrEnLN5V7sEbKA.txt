Chipotle claims they have Gluten Free food. We've had good experience with other locations, but this one is repeatedly clueless when it comes to Gluten Free. Their staff is incompetent when you even say the word Gluten Free because they've never heard of the term or can't understand.  They have lost our frequent business forever. We love their food, but not if I can't get them to prepare it in accordance to what they say they can do.
