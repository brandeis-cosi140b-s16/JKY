In a two day span, I frequented this monument to lard, not once, but twice; making Federico's my defunct dinner for two days in a row.
How did this happen? Why did this happen?
These were questions I woefully pondered as I spent nearly 3/4 of a sunday perched upon the porcelain throne, evacuating my bowels like Anderson Cooper and his news crew amidst a chaotic Tahrir square. 
The only reason to my madness, that I could fathom, in the clouded and reeking haze I was brewing that sabbath day, was that I had literally drank or smoked myself retarded- so much so that my ravenous appetite overwhelmed my better judgement.
Friday night, my mistake was assuming that the graveyard shift would care enough to properly cook an Adobada burrito at 2 am. It honestly tasted like they doused some chorizo in red chili sauce wrapped it in a tortilla and threw it out the delivery window like an unwanted baby in bath water.
Saturday night for one idiot reason or another I ordered a green chili burrito, which I'd assumed would be hard to fuck up, apparently not. This didnt taste like green chili pork, perhaps It'd be more apt to label it as "boiled pork offal with a splash of tomatillo salsa" it was proabably the worst green chili i've had in a long while.
Sunday, Montezuma claimed his bloody revenge on this descendant of Spanish immigrants (had this angry aztec spirit bothered to scan my family lineage on ancestry.com he'd have realized that the spanish on my mothers side is hardly large enough to exact vengeance for atrocities committed by cortez and his cronies in the 16th century, but who am I to question undead central american monarchs) ahem. Lets just say I dont enjoy prolonged bathroom visits and this is what Federico's translates to in my vernacular.
