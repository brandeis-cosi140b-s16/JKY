I went here a few weeks ago as part of my taco-quest, and was very not-impressed, despite the good I had heard about it.  I got three tacos and a drink, and the tortillas were really dry and rubbery.  The fillings (pork, chicken, steak) all kinda tasted the same, pretty much like grease, and the dude slopped so much into the tortilla, along with a splash of pan drippings, that all the tortillas just fell apart into a shredded, wet mess.  If they had tasted good at all, I wold have used the plastic fast food fork from the counter to finish them, but I thought, "why bother?"

The interior is your basic, depressing repurposed fast food joint, with cheap curved (and uncomfortable) melamine seats and worn-down tables left over from some KFC or something.  A TV in the corner silently barfs CNN or Fox or some useless crap to distract you from the ennui of the place.  Yecch.

If I was a fair man, I would try them again to see if I hit them at a bad time.  But I have discovered other places that are SO much better that I really won't bother.  I have a feeling it's *always* this time at Habanero's.
