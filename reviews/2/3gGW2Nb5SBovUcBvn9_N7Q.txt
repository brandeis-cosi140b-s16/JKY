Our first visit.  Probably our last visit.  It wasn't "bad", but with so many other choices in town we would prefer to go elsewhere.  The chips and salsa were good, not great.  Service was ok.  I ordered the chicken street tacos and lost my appetite after biting into a grisely piece of chicken.  The refried beans were nothing special.  Their rice tasted like something out of a box.  Prices and portions were comparable to other Mexican restaurants.
