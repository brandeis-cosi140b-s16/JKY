This place is lacking in service. I've been here three times and each time it's the service I have issues with. The owner/manager/head chef (unsure if his exact title) talks to the staff so much that it slows them down, including the bartenders. It actually comes off a little flirtatious. Regardless though, the service is the problem. This place has lost my business.
