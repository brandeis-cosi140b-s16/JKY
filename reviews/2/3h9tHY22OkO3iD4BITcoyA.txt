I think I really have some bad luck with this place. I actually wanted to give 1 star.
The food is fine - if and when it ever comes out. The last two times here, I waited 45 minutes for food to come out. I have no idea why it takes so long. I wasn't here on a weekend either. The first time it happened, we just walked out after paying for our drinks. We told the manager and he tried to get us to stay but it felt like it was because he didn't want to throw away the food that was being made. Last night it happened again. I ordered the Chile Colorado which was a thick piece of pork chop. After waiting 40 minutes, we asked our server what was taking so long, and he came back with some excuse that this particular dish takes this long to cook. Five minutes later, our food came out and both of our dishes were almost cold. That just tells me that it's been sitting for a while and it was forgotten. We had the manager come over this time and he apologized and offered us replacement dishes. I wanted to leave, but my friend was hungry so we agreed. Magically, this time it took 7 minutes to come out. Maybe I was still pissed off, but it didn't taste that great after all. At least it was hot.

The reason why I'm giving two stars instead of one is because the manager ended up comping our meal for our bad experience. I still don't know if I want to come back again. At the prices that Javier's charges, I expect nothing short of exceptional service. Not poor excuses. Since this was twice in a row that this happened to me, I'm thinking that this may be a regular thing here.
