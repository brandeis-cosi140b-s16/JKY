They charge you for chips and salsa! We've never been to a Mexican restaurant where we had to pay for chips and salsa!!! Also, the salsa was very cold. It's supposed to be room temperature, right?

I ordered the Mahi-Mahi tacos. They were good. If you like beans and rice along with your meal, you'll be disappointed. The tacos came on a big plate with no side items. 

The drinks were great! I recommend the mojito. Yummy! 

Service was good. Our waitress was awesome. I didn't get her name, though. She was an African-American lady with long hair. She was quick to refill our drinks and came to our table many times. She was friendly and very knowledgable.
