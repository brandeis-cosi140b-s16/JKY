This is one of the worst Chipotles I've ever been to. Unfortunately my family and I do eat here often, but it's only because we like Chipotle food, we do not like this one in particular. The staff is less friendly than any other location, the often run out of items, they either have too few people working or too many doing nothing productive. I've witnessed the staff bickering with each other, so awkward. 

The portions at this store are ridiculous. They are less than other locations and if you ask them to add, they look at you with like you have completely annoyed them. Probably because they don't want to be bothered to have to make more,

Although I like their food, we have started eating elsewhere because I won't pay for mediocre service.
