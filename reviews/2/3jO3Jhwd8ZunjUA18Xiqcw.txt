Service is slipping, but food is still good. This past week my wife and I waited for 10 minutes at the hostess desk to be seated. This entire time nobody came to seat us while at least three servers saw us multiple times. I could not wait any longer as it was lunchtime and I had to eat and get back to work. It will be some time before we give them another shot, but the food is worth another attempt.
