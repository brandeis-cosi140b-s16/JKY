I have been here a few times as we live very close.  I have had a few different dishes here, the fajitas, the number 2 combo which is a taco, a enchilada and a tostada and I have also have had the taco combo.  We go here more for convienince than for the quality of the food. The service is usually good but the food is very bland even the salsa is bland to me. There are other better choices but they are further away.  Not what I would call top shelf.
