Before the fateful day in late March when Tacos Atoyac shut down, I lamented mostly the loss of their excellent fish tacos. Some of their other tacos weren't the best I've had, but they had the best fish tacos anywhere. So when I heard they had opened back up, of course I was excited.

My return visit came with some trepidation, of course. I heard Dan was no longer involved, and Dan was part of the experience.  The food should be the same, right? Same menu, same prices.

I got a smattering of what I consider the best offerings the previous incarnation offered: two fish tacos, a quesadilla with lengua, and the churro.

The quality of the tacos did not decline at all. I could've sworn they used to have more fish in them, however. Was I just imagining things? I don't know, it's hard to quantitatively compare something to a mere fading memory. But the fish tacos are still undoubtedly good.

The quesadillas, however, provided considerably more insight. Atoyac v1 quesadillas were packed with meat and cheese - so much that if you get the lengua quesadillas, you have a substantial pool of (delicious) grease sitting at the bottom of the tray. These things were so overflowing that it was sometimes hard to pick them up without the meat falling out.  Now? Barely any cheese OR meat. The meat was actually scattered around the quesadilla, with areas completely devoid of meat! And the cheese was spread extremely thin compared to the old quesadillas.

It's clear that what happened here is what is known as size inflation (as opposed to price inflation).  They raise the price by lowering the portions. And that just makes for worse food - give me the same food at a higher price, if you must.

Apart from the disappointing cheapening of the product, this place also lacks any charm at all without Dan's presence. And that goes a long way, too.
