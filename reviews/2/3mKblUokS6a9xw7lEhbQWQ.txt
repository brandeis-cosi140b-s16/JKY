You know whats really fucked up about this place? Its consistency. For instance, if you eat in the dining room you get a burrito so damn big that you cant finish it! Seriously, this thing was humongous and pretty much full on burrito madness. It tasted alright, very  in line with Chipotle or any other shitty corporate burrito joint, nothing special I assure you except for its girth.  

So on our return trip to there airport we deiced to get a burrito but this time ordered it from the counter instead and had it to go. We deiced that we would only order 1 since they are so damn big. I'm not sure if in the 2 days that we gone and came back they had some serious changes or what? This burrito was so chicken shit and terribly small we wondered if there was a problem, kids size maybe? Anyways of course I asked and was told that was the normal to-go size. 

That's pretty much bullshit anyway you cut it. If you're going to sell a burrito, sell the same one whether you dine in or take out. So if you're in a pinch like we were, order your food in the dining room from a waiter, NOT to-go.
