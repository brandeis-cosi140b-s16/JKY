I saw this place leaving Safeway and wanted mexican food, I checked my  yelp mobile app. and got really excited when I saw the reviews. I bought a few different burritos and brought them back to work. Bean burrito pretty good. I was really excited about the carne asada burrito, the meat was tough a dry no one actualy actually ate more than two bites. I am a mexican food snob but, no one was really a fan. 

It was a tough call between two and three stars but, after the carne asada I just couldn't give it the third.
