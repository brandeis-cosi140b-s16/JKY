Dos Gringos is definitely bringing trashy back.  And I think the whole trailer park theme has really gotten the best of them.  Two cases in point.

A) Drinks are EXTREMELY weak.  They give you tall glasses, but have very thin pours of liquor.  Thinking maybe it was the vodka, we switched to rum, but alas, the trailer park was just being cheap. 

B) The vomit stench wafting from the mens restroom really takes the trailer park theme a little too far, right?  After I reported to staff that puke was all over a men's urinal, it was still there an hour later.

Doesn't that make you yearn for the good old college days??

Granted it was a Sunday afternoon and all, and the DJ and crowd was fun.  A definite fun place to day drink, and bring the pooch.  Call me an old-fashioned prude, but the puke-fest and sucky drinks kind of killed the mood.  And believe it or not, I didn't have the appetite to try any of their award-winning tacos.
