I wanted sushi and was willing to drive my friends to PV for Yasu Sushi Bistro (highly recommended by me!) but they were too tired and wanted something within a block or two of the Hyatt. 

They asked the concierge, who recommended this place as very good! 

Has she ever had good Mexican food, or is she getting kickbacks?

The Matador Restaurant is across from the Hyatt Hotel, in the center of downtown. It has been in business since 1976, is large, and IMO, "Bleh".

It is owned by a Greek Family for one. All 32 years. All the Mexican dishes and specialites were mostly from one of their first cooks. Great, make your cook create all the recipes for authentic dishes and you make all the money. There is even a small Greek section of the menu which offers low end Greek dishes (Gyros Sandwich, Gyros Plate, Greek salad, Feta Cheese plate, and something called Shrimp a-la Mike!)

The menu has print so small, only a search light and magnifying glass can decipher it. 

They do have some authentic dishes, like menudo, carnitas, lengua con chile verde; and the basics like enchiladas, tacos, tamales, tostadas, chimichangas, carne asada, chalupas, fajitas and flautas. 

They bring you chips and two types of salsa. We ordered (extra) guacamole, and it didn't taste or look very fresh, like they mixed a jar of paste with a couple of avacadoes. The Margaritas were uninspired and weak. 

I tried the Machacas (sauteed shredded beef) which was moist but lacked flavor, and was supposed to be with green chilis, tomatos, and onions with rice and beans for $10.95). 3 others in my group were unimpressed with the food, and they were French Canadien (So what do they know about Mexican food, except when it isn't good!).

They also have steaks and chicken dishes, but why bother? 

The food was passable but would not entice you to come again, unless you got drunk at a ball game at the local Chase Field stadium and were starving.
