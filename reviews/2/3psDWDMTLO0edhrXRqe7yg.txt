had mixed feelings when i read the yelp reviews but now after this experience, I can honestly say that I was really disappointed. 

at first looking over the menu, the pricing on the add-ons threw me off a little bit. then when we were called up, the cashier already seemed annoyed with us. she spoke a blend of Spanglish (spanish/English) to us and confused my other half. luckily I was able to catch the translation and started ordering. 

I ordered the carne asada and carnitas tacos. I asked for no beans on them and she told me it would be an extra $1 charge for no beans. wait, WHAT?! since when does asking for one less topping COST you something? she told me they add more meat in subsitutition of no beans.. well what if I don't want extra meat? I had no energy left in me to argue with the miserable woman so I just said it's no big deal and to just give me the beans.

my other half ordered a burrito and the cashier asked him if he wanted cheese, avocado and sour cream which is listed on the menu at $1.50 extra for all 3 add-ons combined. he said yes, but asked if they could simply put the sour cream on the side. instead of charging him the $1.50, she charged him an additional $.50 for asking for sour cream on the side. we racked up a solid $17 for two tacos and one burrito. this started to become a sick joke until she tried to upsell us on "bottled water" for $.75 which was actually water poured from a jug into a Styrofoam cup instead of the water from the fountain/tap. NO THANKS. 

unlike tacos El Gordo, there is no pepper/lime bar. with how unhappy all the workers looked, I didn't even bother asking them. the quality of the food was mediocre. I'd rather walk 20 steps across the street for way better quality and better service. it's safe to say that we will not be returning.
