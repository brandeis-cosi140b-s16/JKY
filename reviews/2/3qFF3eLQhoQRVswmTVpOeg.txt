After reading some of the reviews for this place on Yelp I thought I would be in for a decent taco shop.  Unfortunately Lulu's did not stand up to the hype.  I had the fish tacos on the recommendation of the cashier - not great - I much prefer the fish tacos at Rumbi.  My husband had the beef tacos and the same thing -  very little flavor to the tacos - the one thing I did enjoy was the spicy chicken on my daughters quesadila.  

If we go back I would only have/recommend the spicy chicken.
