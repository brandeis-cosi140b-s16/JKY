Nothing to write home about, but I'll write it on Yelp.

I figured that I'd be able to get a better dinner at the mexican restaurant across the street from my hotel than at the hotel. Given that good mexican food is hard to come by in Washington state, I figured that I could get good mexican food anywhere in Arizona.

The service was friendly and the food wasn't very expensive.  But it wasn't all that good either. My carnitas were very dry, like they'd been prepared earlier in the day. I was hoping for something that was moister.

I don't think I'd eat dinner here again, but since my hotel has pretty poor breakfasts, I might give them a second try because I'm a sucker for chorizo.
