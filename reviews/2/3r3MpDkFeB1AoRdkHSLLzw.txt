We used to love this place.  99c ritas, good food, good atmosphere.....

My family had been going there for years...

But... over the past 3 years or so the service has gone down hill fast!

On our final visit to Via's we met our waitress when she took our order and.. then never saw her again.  I had to get us more forks, ask for more Chips and Salsa, go to the bar for more drinks ect..

Then we the bill came there was a 20% gratuity added!!!  We asked if we could have the 20% taken off so we could tip what we thought the service deserved.... that's when we saw the waitress for the second time of the night... She said that she could not change the ticket since there were 6 or more people on the check...  At this point we were very upset and took our check to the front to pay and never come back.  As we were paying and complaining to the manager the waitress takes cash out of the drawer and hands it out to us and says  "just keep the tip if you didn't like my service" in a rude attitude way.    We told the manager to keep the tip since we would never be back to their establishment again.


Our family is very easy to please and we understand that restaurants get busy and service can not be 100% all the time.  But we do expect basic courtesy even if its the busiest night of the year.

I do miss the old Via's
