Loved this place when it was Salsa's.  It was small, the food was delicious and the service was always good.  I have been to Cabo's three times now.  
The first, was a little disillusioned by the fact that they only brought 3 tortillas for for Fajitas (two of us splitting) and then charged $1 when I asked for one more.  This never happened when it was Salsa's. They either brought extra to begin with or happily brought another free of charge.
Second time was ok.  We were the only patrons as it was early for lunch.  The workers were preparing for the crowd so the service was good. Food was ok.
Third (and last?) time.  Just went a couple if days ago for lunch.  Service was slow even though there were only 5 or 6 tables seated.  The chips were old (one tasted like rancid oil-my guess is that it was left in the warmer bin.  Had to actually spit it out...yuck!)My enchilada came barely warm. Didn't eat most of it.  My daughter's food was ok. 
Cabo's is just not consistently good to keep going.  Just ok every now and then is not good enough.
Nothing special here that is going to keep me coming back
