I have been to this location 10- 15 times. At no point have I ever seen an employee smile or be friendly. They look disgusted at the food they are preparing. I actually leave the line feeling bad for having them make my salad. I took my mom last time and the kid was so rude to her she almost cried.  It's a shame because I love the food. Cilantro vinaigrette is delicious.  Started going to Moes where the staff is fun and friendly and they give you free chips with your order.
