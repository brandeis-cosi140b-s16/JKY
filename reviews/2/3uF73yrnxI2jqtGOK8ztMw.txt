Although this restaurant is constantly being praised by the people of this city, I see nothing worthy of such praise. The salsa is the saltiest I've ever encountered and accompanied by stale chips. When you order a chicken burrito, thats really all you get. It's a rolled up tortilla with subpar chicken in it. Where's the sour cream? Oh thats extra. Where's the beans? Extra. Where's the rice? Extra. Where's the guacamole? extra. By the time you build it into a great burrito, it has grown to double the price. 

If you like bare bones and bland food...go for it. At least it'll be cheap.
