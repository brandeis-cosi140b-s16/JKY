These folks are resting on their laurels. Or....perhaps I am spoiled by so many good Mexican food restaurants in West Texas. Nothing seemed that fresh or tasty. Spouse Dale says he liked his tortilla soup but could only choke down one of his mini-tacos. My combo plate had a taco with carbonized (literally) beef-like strands, no discernible enchilada and a dry litttle tamale. Yep, we're spoiled. OK magaritas.
