Just another of many cheap ass places to get overpriced kinda Mexican food the owner said it was the same family owned as salsitas as if that was going to help as I tried salsitas and I would much rather go to taco bell.  Well this is the first of a new franchise the owner said  hope its the last where's  the real food  anywho he left me talking to myself.
