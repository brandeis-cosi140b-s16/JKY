If you are looking for fast, fast food, continue on down the road. 
I keep asking myself why I come back to this place, average food at best, and deal with TERRIBLY slow service. And when I say slow, we are talking 10 minutes plus, you are the only person in the restaurant, slow. 
The wait was so bad one time that the guy at the drive-thru was gone so long that when he came back to the window he wanted to charge me again for my order. And it took 5 minutes more after that to get my food after he asked if I got my drink that he gave me 5 minutes prior. 
Go to Taco Bell if you wan fast food Mexican, this place is totally not worth the length of time you will be waiting to get your food.
