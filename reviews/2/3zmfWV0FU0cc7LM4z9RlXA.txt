Ah, Manuel's, what has happened to you?

What used to be a favorite place for dinner now is a disappointment and I'm not sure we'll be back. This review is written in hopes that the management will read this and take the steps to bring the restaurant back to what it used to be a couple of years ago.

Last night, we were taken to our table and when I pulled out my chair, rice was all over the seat. I pointed this out to the hostess, thinking we'd be taken to another table but she just brushed off the rice onto the floor which had pieces of napkin and crayons under the table. I had the steak fajitas but the top peppers and onions were warm but raw. The small bowl of refried beans were lukewarm--the cheese on top never melted. My water was never refilled, we-and other people at nearby tables-had to ask for more chips and salsa-the point being that we were never asked if we wanted more like they used to do. 

My dad is elderly and has a hard time moving around and that is why we stayed. The high point of the evening, however, was Ricardo, a busboy, who came over and thanked my dad for his service (dad was wearing his WWII hat). That gesture is what gave this review a second star, it was genuine and he didn't have to do it but he did and it made my dad's night. Thanks, Ricardo!

This is the second Manuel's that has disappointed me with the food and the service. I'm going to Garcia's...
