I LOVE chipotle. Chipotle is my life. But when I came to this chipotle I was sadly disappointed. One of the ladies who was working the end of the line literally threw everything on the burrito so sloppily and was the most careless wrapper I've ever seen. I know they're always in a rush at chipotle but this chick was moving at the speed of light. She made My friend's burrito and not only did it rip from her carelessness but it was half the size of ours. She ended up asking them to remake it which in they replied "you could have just asked for extra." But we weren't planning to pay double for what we should be getting... Plus the prices rose crazy here. $7.20 for Barbacoa and steak!? Idk if it's just this one or all the other chipotles but it's crazy that the prices jumped so high. 

I WOULD HIGHLY SUGGEST GOING TO THE ONE IN SAN TAN. 
it's worth the distance they are far better an way more consistent!!
