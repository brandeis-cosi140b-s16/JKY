Ok this is going to be my last update for Chronic Taco.

I really want to love this place.
I went back again yesterday before a movie, and decided to try the chicken tacos. 

Not only were they greasy, fatty, and tasteless, but I also found a chicken bone in my taco.  

If you go here, get the shrimp burrito (the deal with the free chips and salsa) or the potato taco, but I don't know how much else I'd eat here...

Very sad.
