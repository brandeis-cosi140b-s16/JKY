Been a while since I've ate a burrito. A very unusual adjustment considering that I lived on Mexican food back in LA. But since I'm in Vegas for school, I don't know much about the local joints for tasty food but this came to my attention and it had its share of good reviews, but also disappointing ones. I'm stuck in the middle but I would consider myself slightly disappointed rather. I got the chorizo super burrito for somewhere around six bucks. Not too sure of what the exact price was. But anyway, the burrito was good for a first try. But I don't see myself coming back. There was no condiments and the complimentary hot sauce was no bueno. There was also a bit too much salt in the burrito. If that's what makes up for their taste in a burrito, I'd rather head to taco bell. Save your money and drive down 2 miles south to Fausto's.
