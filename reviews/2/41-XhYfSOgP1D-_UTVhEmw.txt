I've enjoyed Azteca for the past 2 years. However, my past experience wasn't pleasant. For starters the Camarónes de Mexicano was loaded with salt and the Pork Carnitas had barely any meat (mostly fat). When I explained to the waiter that the Camarónes de Mexicano had too much salt and that people at our table suffer from high blood pressure. He replied "Next time let us know sooner so we can make the adjustment". I find that interesting since there was more than 3/4 of the meal on the plate and the food was on our table for only 15mins.
Needless to say our frustration was reflected in the tip. There's always room for professional development or customer service training.
