This place was a wannabe, lower quality, Chipotle restaurant.  Lower quality, meats NOT made to order, too pricey for the quality.

I ordered the fish tacos and when they went to put the fish inside the tacos I noticed that the food was NOT made to order. My fish was in a warming container- as was all the meat. Ew! I was worried that my fish was hours old and I'd get food poisoning. 

$$$ I thought the price was too high for the quality. If I'm going to spend $15 and only drink water the food needs to be better quality.  

The positive: they had several kinds of unique salsa (mango salsa was good). 

Skip it-- go to Chipolte, Baja Fresh or Rubios.
