You can pass on this one. This is a product of the gentrification of east liberty and should be treated as such. It's fake fake fake.
Went here for takeout with a craving for jerk chicken. I would have been much better served to drive a little farther to Impressionz on Broad street. The food was hotter than it should be to be so bland.  I ordered the jerk chicken but got the curry chicken by mistake. It was spicy but overall bland and overpriced. The portion size was also smaller than you would get elsewhere. The jambalaya was also very spicy but without real flavor. I also tried the avocado fries which could have been good but were too greasy. I didn't try any of the "latin" dishes but I won't go back. There is really good Jamaican food in Pittsburgh but you will have to go to the "hood" to get it. Don't go here for it.
