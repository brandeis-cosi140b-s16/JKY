This place reminds me of a fast food joint, quality of food isn't that great, but I'll still come here if I'm in the mood of mexican food and I'm at the red rock casino. Other than that it's not all that great, I'd rather go to other restaurants in the food court. Not much of a big fan here. Taqueria's blow this place away, but this particular place I'd settle for if I want a burrito or taco's of some sort. Ehhhh
