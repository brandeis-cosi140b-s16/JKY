Thought I'd try this place out after seeing all the hype on yelp =) 
.. Came to the conclusion that they are just OKAY.. Not the best. There are much better taco trucks out here. 2 stars for their decent closing hours, place to get food when you have NO OTHER OPTIONS. Either way, if it came down to that I would rather eat juliobertos or Albertos (Etc)
