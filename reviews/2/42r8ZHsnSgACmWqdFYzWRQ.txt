The chimichanga was good (mostly because they didn't automatically put pintos or other beams in it). The bartender when I first arrived was a very nice lady that made a great top shelf silver margarita.

Cons: the music is so loud, I had to wear my earbuds almost the entire time because now I have a headache. 

The bartender that arrived around 4 or 4:30 (think his name is Mike) is pretty rude. He snatched up a menu I had been looking at after my food arrived, wiped it down (why I have no idea) & put it away. Then, without any sort of interaction asked "do you want another margarita or no?". The lady that was sweet & made a great margarita before is still here.  

It's definitely about your only option on this side of Terminal 3 for drinks. Delta-we need a sky club in Phoenix!!!!
