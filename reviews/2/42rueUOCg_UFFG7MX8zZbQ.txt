I have been to Serrano's several times and had the same experience each time; ok food and not great service.

Each time I have gone I ordered an appetizer and a main course - the first time the main course came out before the appetizer, once the appetizer came out with the meal and the third time it came out less than a minute before the main course.   I get that things happen, but this is a clear pattern.

They also committed one of my largest peeves and made us wait for a table when there were a lot of open set tables.  I have heard from others this is standard operating procedure for them.

At best I would say the food is ok - noting particularly wrong with it, but each time I have been there  - I have left unimpressed by the food.

I am a Mexican food fan and really wanted to like this place (I had heard good things), but in the end bad service and at best ok food - make Serrano's in QC forgettable.
