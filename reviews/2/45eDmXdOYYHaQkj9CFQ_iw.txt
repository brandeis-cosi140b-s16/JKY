I live right by here so I had high hopes, unfortunately with so many other better Mexican places around town I probably won't be back. 

The carne asada burrito was very light on the meat, and it was a little dry and bland. At one point I actually spit some out because I couldn't chew it.

The service was good though. I hate to knock on new small businesses but hopefully you can use this feedback to improve.
