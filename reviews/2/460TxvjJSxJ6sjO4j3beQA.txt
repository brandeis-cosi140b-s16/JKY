I've been going to Manuel's with my family for years. They have very good chips and salsa, it's definitely their strong point. Unfortunately they no longer carry black beans and their refried beans contain lard. As a vegetarian, I cannot eat here any longer unless I want just chips and salsa or a cheese crisp.

Sad, sad day :'(
