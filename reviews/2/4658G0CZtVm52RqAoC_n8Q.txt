I have to concur on the weird smell... a little like sewage. Definitely not good for the appetite. 

I liked the friendly service, but while the food was cheap and edible, it was nothing special. The salsa is indeed pretty good, but not so amazing  that it's worth coming here instead of going somewhere with better food. I had a prickly pear margarita that had a nice flavor, but was way too sweet for my taste.
