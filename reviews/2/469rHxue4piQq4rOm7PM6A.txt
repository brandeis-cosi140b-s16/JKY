Giving 2 stars is actually being very kind... and both are for our waiter Myles. Walked in at 12:45 this afternoon, most places are PACKED at this time TG was NOT. We were met, not greeted by the rudest person ever! The African American YOUNG man who works at the host stand for this place NEEDS to find a new J O B!! Clearly he is NOT happy with himself OR his job at Taco Guild! It was a stare down between he I and my lunch buddy! Instead of smiling and saying hello he glared at us looked us UP AND DOWN and then after I STARED BACK and told him we were 2 people he HUFFED in my face and rudely seated us!! The food...save your money and go across the street to Gazooks or even America's Taco Shop. The food was cold, over priced and tasted VERY bland! NEVER AGAIN!!! That is all!
