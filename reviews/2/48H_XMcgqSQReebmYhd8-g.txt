Nice place inside and good service...

I scanned the menu and I was confused - the prices were way out of wack compared to other mexican places.  Beans and rice were alacarte???  I think they wanted $3 extra for beans and rice.  

I ordered the chile rellano and one rellano was $8 alone on a small plate and it was just ok.  A friend ordered a chicken tostada at $8 and some change.  It was ok but barely enough to feed a 3 year old.

There flour tortillas were made with canola oil.  Good if you are on a diet bad if you are in the mood if you want good mexican food.

You cannot call this place authentic simply based on the tortillas.  

I had high hopes but this place fell short - maybe I will go back for second chance...maybe
