If you're in the Southside Works area and you're craving Mexican, you're better off heading to Qdoba. Taco Loco was very disappointing -- subpar margaritas (definitely not worth $7), less than fresh ingredients, and inflated prices.  We received our food quickly, but that's because my friend and I were the only ones in the restaurant. Also, in addition to the tacky decor, there was a gigantic TV blaring what I assume was a Spanish version of Beavis and Butthead. To call the atmosphere "unique" would be generous.
