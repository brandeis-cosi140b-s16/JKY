Tucked in Promenade next door to the Macaroni Grille is On the Border Cantina.  It's a pretty typical Mexican place with a predictable menu.  

The decor is pretty cheesy with over-done Mexican theming throughout.  It really feels like some corporate big-wig in Chicago said, "If it's stereotypical Mexican, it's for us!"  The bright colored tiles, clay colored flooring, really is eye-roll worthy.

The staff was fine, and the drink specials they have are worth checking out.  $2 draft beers, and $3 house margaritas?  definitely the best feature.  Several patrons obviously had figured this out as the bar area had a little micro crowd of folks taking advantage of cheap booze and free chips and salsa.

The food unfortunately, is nothing to write home about and left our entire table with a brick in our stomachs for the rest of the evening.  The chips aren't fresh, and taste blah, my pork tacos, which were the special so they had to be fresh, right?  RIGHT??? were average at best.  They were topped with some sort of chili and supposedly some roasted corn and other veg... I had maybe 3 kernels of corn on each taco, and the chili stuff on top seemed awfully like it had been frozen at some point - it was very visually unappealing, bland, and flat-out disappointing.

Overall, this place is a step above a Taco Bell and should change its name to Mexican Applebees.
