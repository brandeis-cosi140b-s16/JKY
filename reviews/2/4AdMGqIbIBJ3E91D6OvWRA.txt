This location is not the best example of macayo's. My wife and boys love mexican food and I'm always game - usually macayo's puts on a good meal at decent prices and that's why this was a place we would visit once every month or two...not anymore. Service was okay - no problems there, however the food quality has fallen off a bit. Salsa was great - chips ehhh - dry and salty. Over the years I've had everything on this menu and it's hasn't changed - except for the smaller portions paired with a plate full of bland rice and beans...Chimi was small and I was amazed how little chicken was inside it...it was okay but, I was looking for more food and flavor.  The bill for two adults and two kids 50-60 bucks - too expensive for a marginal meal.

Not not impressed anymore with the food here, especially when prices are up and we want a bang for our buck in this economy...

Haven't been to the one in scottsdale in a while but, I was very happy there - much better than thunderbird...
