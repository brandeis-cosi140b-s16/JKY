I used to come here frequently a few years ago. Then the customer service really took a hit.

They closed their doors for a "remodel" recently, so I decided to give it another try.

The first trip back was overall a passing experience. They prepared the food I ordered. The tortilla on the enchilada in the combo plate was rock hard on the bottom. I had a very difficult time cutting it with the chintzy plastic knife provided.  Seriously, it's like one of those fake Halloween knives that bends in a stiff breeze. But the rice and beans were great.

Went there last night again. It was the same person taking my order at the window as last time, but all of a sudden she barely understood English.

I don't know what I paid for, but I didn't get my combo plate. Just the enchiladas. Same thing, bottom hard as a rock, only this time no rice and beans to make the meal worth while.

My wife's "chicken cheese crisp", oh I'm sorry she didn't know what that was, "cheese crisp with chicken" was dry and flavorless.

It's worth one trip here for nothing else then to experience the bathroom, which while much improved, is a great place to get mugged.

Try it, see if you get Dr Jeckle or Mr Hyde.
