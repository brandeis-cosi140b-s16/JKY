The food is actually ok. Margarita LITERALLY made me puke, had to order a beer instead. Service is AWFUL. Lol but for real. Had to ask a busboy for a water, he was nice about it and seemed semi annoyed. But then bartender seemed REALLY annoyed. Sorry bro. Tried getting a water for like ten minutes. Other than this place, vegas is awesome. 

Oh and there's like five people at the bar and haven't been asked once If we're ok
