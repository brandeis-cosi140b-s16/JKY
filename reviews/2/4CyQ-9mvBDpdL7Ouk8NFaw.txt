To say I was disappointed with Frida would be an understatement. 

We went here to that we could hear Jazz in the Square while enjoying some sangria.  The sangria mostly just tasted like watered down franzia.  There was no fruit or anything in it at all.  

After getting our pitcher of "sangria," we thought we should order something even though we weren't hungry just because we were taking the waitresses table for an unknown period of time.  We ordered some type of cheese appetizer that was so bland I can't remember anything about it besides that it was gross. 

The service was quite friendly and they weren't pushy trying to get us to leave so that is the only reason they are getting 2 stars instead of 1.
