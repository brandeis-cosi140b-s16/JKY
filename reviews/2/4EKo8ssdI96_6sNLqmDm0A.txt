This is in a different part of Guadalupe and was excited to try it. 

Empty on a Friday night but the service Ed very prompt and our waitress very nice. She brought chips and salsa and took our order back. 

Chips had a stale and almost plastic flavor to them; salsa was not spicy nor did it taste like much. Left most of it untouched despite being pretty hungry. 

My main course was the shrimp Veracruz with flour tortillas, sever with beans, white rice, and an iceberg salad. Oddly enough, the very English looking white rice (which included carrots and peas), was the best tasting. The peppers carrots and olives of the Veracruz was swimming in saut√© sauce and oil so it was mostly a mess. The iceberg lettuce had tasted like it had soured. 

Over all, not a good meal in a not great part of town for more than it was worth.
