Stopped here while visiting Chandler and ordered the 3 taco plate (2 chicken  and 1 carne Asada) and this is the saltiest Mexican food I have ever had in my life. I literally feel like I swallowed the desert. The only reprieve from the salt was the chips which had no seasoning whatsoever. The salsa is basically a glorified ketchup with red pepper and I'm pretty sure I used half the bottle and still haven't gotten a kick. (I do love my food spicier than most but seriously, this is ridiculous.)
