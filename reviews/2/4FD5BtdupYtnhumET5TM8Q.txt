There are a few things that I look for in a restaurant. Quality (taste), price, service and sometimes ambiance. These four qualities share a symbiotic relationship, but unfortunately La Paz only hit one of them on the head. Which one you say? Good Service. Everything else is atrocious. Now price isn't bad, but the food quality just negated it. Our waitress is the only reason they're getting 2 stars. Management should thank her. 

The King Crab Enchiladas were more than horrendous. The crab was extra old and just plain fishy tasting. I don't know how they could have even served it. The tamales were dry and the only thing that saved them was the sauce. 

Salsa is good though and at least they don't mislabel the pilaf as spanish style rice (Not that either was worth mentioning). 

Skip dinner and just do drinks.
