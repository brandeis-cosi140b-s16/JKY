This spot has some big pluses and some bigger minuses. 
On the plus side - the food quality is decent. Environment is cool The flavor of the steak street tacos was pretty good too. Server was pleasant but not trained to ensure customers concerns are addressed. 

On the negative - EVERYTHING has chipotle flavor. Even Chipotles restaurant doesn't have this much Chipotle flavoring. I do not like the smoky flavor of chipotle. My husband doesn't mind it but this was even too much for him. 

Guac - chipotle Tabasco (luckily we asked for no Tabasco so the guac wasn't ruined)

SW Caesar - Chipotle dressing. It wasn't listed as having it. We probably took 3 bites between us of the salad. Wasted $$. We did mention to the waiter that it was Chipotle dressing (which I'd previously told him I don't like so to keep anything Chipotle off the food). He said "Oh really?"  Didn't offer to replace or refund it either. 

Street Tacos: asked for no chipotle sauce but it came with it anyway. 

On a previous visit:
Shrimp and Guac Tostada bites. Asked for no Chipotle sauce but it came with it still on it. 

Red Chile and Mango Steak Salad- husband says it was great. No idea if it had chipotle sauce. If not - it's a minor miracle. 

Seriously!! ENOUGH with chipotle mayo on every dang thing you serve. Diversify your flavors please. After 2 visits, we are done. Tired of paying for food we won't eat. (We didn't ask for items to be replaced. The first visit I was with clients and didn't want to fuss. Second visit I scraped it off the tacos because my husband was hungry and the waiter wasn't around. Second visit part 2 (the SW salad) I told the waiter and he shrugged it off,saying "Its a Smoky flavor but not chipotle". Chipotle IS smoky. Argh. 

Could easily be a 4 star if they made orders right and tried other sauces on their food. 

OH! The salsa is chipotle too.
