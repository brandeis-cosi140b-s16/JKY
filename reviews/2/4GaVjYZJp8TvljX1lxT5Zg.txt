Trendy can always cloud our senses.  A cute place, WAY too loud music!! I want to eat NOT dance!!! (At the moment). We were celebrating a birthday and we were seated by the front door so the ambiance was looking at Gilbert Rd.  The menu was simple and the food overpriced and underwhelming for tacos...I had a burrito which came out burned....it was extremely tiny for $8.  It was black, plunked on a plate, with no other friends, embellishments or garnish,  except an itty-bitty cup for a tablespoon of sauce.  Honestly how much does a thimble of beans, rice or salad cost!???

 I sent it back and they graciously and profusely apoligized,the manager even came by and apoligized and brought me an unburned version of the same, tiny, burrito.   My friends had three tacos that looked ok.  Since I'm from California,  the Mexican, or trendy Mexican food in Arizona , is substandard to say the least and not even close to what I'm used to.  Mexican food is not expensive...

The manager took the burrito off the bill but with tacos, burrito and non-alcoholic drinks $48 with tip.  Plus, no  treat for the birthday girl and the desserts did not sound appetizing..

I will never return,  It didn't WOW me...there are bigger and better out there , without the hype, the trend, the crowded location and full parking lots on a Wednedsay night !  It's no big deal!

I realize this is a bar atmosphere but I'm beginning to be extra picky about a little bit food for high prices....and the quality better rock, to justify those prices...
