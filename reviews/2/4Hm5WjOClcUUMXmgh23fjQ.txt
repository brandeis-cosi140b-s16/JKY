Came on a Saturday around 2 as we're were wanting a breakfast/brunch option but not a buffet. We're told there was a wait when they're were plenty of open tables and no one else waiting. Not a big deal but just kind of annoying. 

The mariachi band was playing as it was part of the weekend brunch, they were funny and played different music. 

Chips came out and they were nice a fresh, salsas were ok. I ordered a Bloody Mary and it was also just ok. 

We each ordered off the brunch menu, the breakfast burrito and huevos with chorizo. They were both relatively tasteless and nothing special. The bacon in my burrito was more like ham with little flavor and soggy. We had to douse everything in salsa and hot sauce. We did like the tortillas and they seemed freshly made. Those and the chips were the highlights. 

Overall I probably would not return. With all of the good food in Vegas this was less than exceptional in my book.
