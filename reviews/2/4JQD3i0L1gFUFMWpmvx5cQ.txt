Debbie Downers:  Not flavorful from what I had
 
Conclusion: Came to this venue on a late night snack.  Problem is the food was just to hold you over til the next day.  I didn't think the chicken nachos that I ordered was fantastic.  It was bland.  Not to be picky but I kind of expected more knowing sometimes dive places have the best food.  This was not one of them.  But that's only going off the appetizer that I ordered.  It is adject to a bar.  Actually disappointed in some of the prior Yelp Reviews that made it seem like it was all that...this is on me though. A tad bit under sub par.
 
Overall: D
