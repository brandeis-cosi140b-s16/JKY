Out of all the eateries to go to Downtown -- I would not suggest this one.

My friend and I met up here after work for a bite to eat. The place is small and cramped, and I think they could have alleviated that problem by making the bar just a bit smaller and instituting some smaller bar seats, as the seats take up to much room in the walk-ways. 

Happy hour consists of $5 margaritas and $4.50 Mexican beers they have on draft. Not the largest selection for a HH, but not bad. There is food on the HH menu as well. I ordered the shrimp tacos and out they came as fried shrimp tacos, which I would have liked to have known and wish the menu would have pointed that out.

My friend and I also shared a nacho platter, ahem, since we were at a place called NACHO Daddy I had great expectations. They arrived in no time and were placed on our table. As I looked at this platter of nachos I questioned many things in life, "When a tree falls in the woods and no one is around, does it make a sound?"... "When I am at a place that specifically has Nachos in its' name and I am unimpressed with the nachos... are they really nachos at all?"

We got the Filet Mignon Carne Asada Nachos. I have reservations on whether or not the meat was actually filet mignon. I also have reservations now on ever ordering a $16.95 priced plate of nachos, which I expected to be bigger, and better.

Next time I want nachos I will go to Roberto's and ask for Carne Asada Nachos and I'll eat the &*&! out of those things and be happy I didn't pay $17 for them.
