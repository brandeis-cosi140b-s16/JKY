So I was walking out of REI after picking up some last minute supplies for a backpacking trip, and was about to get in my car when I remembered I hadn't eaten all day.  So I popped in looking for some quick grub.  There were a couple of people ahead of me in line so I expected some sort of wait for my food, but it took over 10 minutes after ordering for my order to be ready.  This isn't a nice sit-down restaurant, but more of a "fast food" type, order-at-the-counter joint.  For a bean burrito and a couple of cheese enchiladas it should not have taken that long.  And it was definitely not worth the $9.  The bean burrito was okay if that.  The beans had no flavor (compared to other Mexican food places of the same style.)  The red enchilada sauce had a good flavor and definitely tasted homemade, but the cheese enchiladas were enchiladas minus the cheese.  Seriously.  All I was given were corn tortillas rolled up with a completely hollow and filling-less center.  WTF.  Definitely won't eat here again.
