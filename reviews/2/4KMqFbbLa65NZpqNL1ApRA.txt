If your in the neighborhood, and have a craving for Fuzzy's take on Mexican food, this may be the only two reasons you could come up with to visit. I have tried Fuzzy's several times over the years, and while I like the food, it is a mostly hit or miss place. Good luck trying to find a parking space, as Starbucks shares a lot with Fuzzy's. My most recent trip was mostly successful; the big menu board above the cash register has the different menu items grouped by color, which it makes it easier to locate which menu item you might want. All of the sides were available on this visit, I can't say that for former visits. And I didn't have to wait for my food, again, unlike previous visits. But it still 'looks' dirty and still feels sticky, even if it isn't. You can sit outside the door on nice days at their picnic tables and you can bring your dog to hang out with you on the patio, if you want. They also have drink specials, if your into that.
