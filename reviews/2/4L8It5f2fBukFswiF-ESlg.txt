This place was recommended by one of the air hostesses via to our stop off in Charlestown SC Airport on the way to Costa Rica
This place has a lot of beautiful mexican, TexMex decor.
It was a go to place as soon as well landed, however the service was quite slow, and the food was not exactly what I had intended.

Chorizo sausage breakfast 2/5  I was expecting an actual chorizo sausage with my eggs, but rather it was all cut up and mixed with onions, and other spices... hmmm....

My gramps and brother had their typical GRINGO breakfast, bacons, eggs, toast, etc... nothing that WOW'ed me.

Mom had their jalape√±o eggs with bacon, again same score 2/5...... 
will i be back? nope, but if I ever land in the same aiport, ill be sure to try elsewhere.
