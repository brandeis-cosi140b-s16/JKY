First of all I love Chipotle. Eat there several times a week. This location however disappoints me. They are slow and rushed to make every order.

Today takes the cake. I should have paid attention to how they put my bowl in the bag because sideways equals a soaked bag  and car seat when I finally got home. The Las Vegas Boulevard location is way better.
