The server was very very nice, and did a great job checking on me. Everyone there was really nice, but the carne asada tacos i had, were not so good. Something about them, just wasnt right. Not very much taste. I also asked for extra onions and cilantro, and seemed to have gotten less than what would be normal. All in all, i wold not come here for carne asada tacos. Maybe something else is good on their menu....
