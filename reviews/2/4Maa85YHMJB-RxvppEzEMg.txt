The food was just okay, very small menu, the server lacked enthusiasm and never even told us her name. I had high hopes because I heard good things- but to be honest is was just run of the mill Mexican food.  The only thing I was impressed with was the homemade tortillas but that won't be enough to bring me back. Lastly, I am a wine drinker- only offering Barefoot wine (they have one wine on their menu) that alone was enough to keep me from returning.
