I've been dying to try this place and today was the day.  The place was bright and clean, always a good sign. The menu was clear and simple. I ordered the large carne asada quesadilla. The salsa, the guacamole and chips were delish! Sadly they do NOT offer sour cream at all. My quesadilla was $8 and def not worth the price. Not only was the meat burnt but there was hardly any cheese in my quesadilla.... Def won't be back
