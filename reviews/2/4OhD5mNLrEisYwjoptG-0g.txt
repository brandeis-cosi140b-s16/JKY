Nice place, nice decor, roomy/huge (empty) patio (with no service on a Friday night - we had to schlep our own drinks!!!) but...

Big large room - rather cavernous...with a small band playing in the main room, diners chatting, etc. it was way too hard to have a decent dinner conversation.

Wait and bar staff were friendly.  Host was kind of a cold fish.

We waited about 25 minutes on a Friday night and the place was certainly not jammed.

Food was average at best - small portions for the money.  No one in our party of 6 raved about any of their dishes.  Salsa containers (for hot salsa) are so ridiculously small you can barely get a chip in there to dip!!!  What's up with that?  The salsa was not that good either.

Good margs - especially the sangria marg but that's about it.

Nice place too bad the food does not live up the decor/vibe.  I get the feeling they could be killing a good concept unless they improve the food.

I may try again for lunch to see if it improves over time...but only if I'm in the area.  They did have nice clean restrooms which is always one of my barometers for how they operate...nothing worse than a dirty/disgusting restroom in a restaurant.
