Um, do people have no taste buds at all? Look, I give it two stars because it's a cool idea and because it's just fast food, so you can't expect much.

But this food is vile. I didn't finish mine, which says a lot. It's not even panda express quality. How hard is it to make a decent quesadilla and orange chicken (which I'm pretty sure they just defrost anyway)? 

Too bad. I think it's surviving entirely on its concept.
