This Del Taco isn't in the best place of town. It's also connected to a Circle K. As I pulled up there were various people on the sidewalk, just sitting (keep in mind it's 100 degrees)... a little odd, but to each his own.  Drive in window is locked down, so they had to unlock it to give me my food, and then promptly relocked it as I was pulling away. Interesting... Overall the food was eatable. Especailly considering it was Taco Tuesday so $1.09 for three! Score. If there was another del taco within the area, I would happily never come back to this location again.
