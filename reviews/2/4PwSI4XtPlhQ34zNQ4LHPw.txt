As a long time fan and customer of Barrio Cafe, I ate there tonight with family and friends. Food was so-so. Hard avocados in the guac ($11). No salsa with the chips (chef Silvana doesn't think it's really traditionally Mexican). Service very slow. No air conditioning, just misters. Horrible parking. The Yard is an outdoor playground for young adults. If you are looking for ping-pong, bean bag toss, beers and other twenty-somethings, check it out. A location for dining, it is not.
