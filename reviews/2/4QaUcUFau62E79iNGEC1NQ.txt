We were surprised to find this new restaurant in the place of Baha Fresh but I like to try new places and it looked busy and that is a good sign. We let the hostess/cashier know we had never seen the menu and she gave me a blank stare then said 'oh'. That was all we got. Did not tell us all about the menu or the place. Oh we'll, we order the taco trio, a bean burrito for one child and a cheese quesadilla for my other child-ages 8 and 7. We ordered 3 small drinks and 1 chip/salsa. This was $19 and change! No big deal if the food is good and portioned appropriately. We then waited 20 min for our food! And when it arrived it was tiny! My eldest asked if that was it for lunch-she thought the burrito was snack sized. When I let the food runner/mgr know we waited so long he told me they are a scratch kitchen. That was it. Not sure how a bean burrito and a quesadilla gets complicated from scratch and my tacos were so tiny it could not possibly take 20 min. His attitude was very 'tough cookie lady' and when I pointed out that the couple that order at the same time was 1/2way through their meal he told me he could not answer to that. We left and ate our food in the car. They seem like a group that is only interested in completing their shift and going home-quality must be someone else's job.
