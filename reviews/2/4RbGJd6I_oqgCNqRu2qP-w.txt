The service really was the killer here.  We got seated right away but didn't see our waiter for a long time.  When he finally showed up he apologized but made no improvement on it.  You know its bad when we got to know the bus boy's first name.  The food was decent, though I am not a fan of sweet salsa (green), the Pollo Asada was good, I especially enjoyed the chargrilled peppers with it.  We may try it again just in case but not anytime soon.
