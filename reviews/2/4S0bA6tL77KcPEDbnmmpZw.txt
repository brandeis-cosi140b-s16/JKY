Dear Chipotle,

Normally I love you but you hurt me this time.  You had no chicken made. Not a big deal, but you said just a couple of minutes. No problem. It was more like ten minutes and it was not that busy. I wanted to wait for my entire order but you made half and then had it wait. So it was not cold but not as warm as my freshly made chicken.

Also annoying? I bought chips and guac and my chip bag had half the amount of chips. I know the big cost is the avocados, but $3.25 and you were chincy on the chips?  Don't let me down like this.
