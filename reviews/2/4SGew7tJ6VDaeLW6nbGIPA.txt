Why the fuck would I review Chipotle, a delicious but slightly generic burrito chain? I had to echo the chorus whom can't help but laugh at the portion sizes. Of course some may say we're just being "Fat Americans," but I love the bang-for-my-buck gut bombs that Chipotle is famous for. The burritos at this location simply seem like a sample size compared to superior other locations; the employees seem to give less of  a damn than any other fast food location in the area. That's a great summation of this Chipotle.
