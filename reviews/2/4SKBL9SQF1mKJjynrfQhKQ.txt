I was interested in trying this place and was disappointed. The chips were stale. I ordered a berry martini. It came in a lowball glass with ice and tasted like punch. I really did not taste any alcohol. My bean and cheese enchilada was bland as well as the accompanying rice. And the portion was quite small for an $11 entree. My boyfriend thought his seafood combination was okay, however the portion was so small he ordered 2 tacos. This place has potential. I think the decor is interesting and the atmosphere is cool. They just need to liven up their food and actually put alcohol in their drinks.
