Please don't come here and expect top notch tex-mex or Mexican food; like the 2-star count says, 'meh, I've experienced better'. If you've got time to sit down while you're at the airport and you need a quick Mexican fix, this place will do in a pinch but the food isn't worth calling home about. Service, food and drinks get the job done, but none are over-achievers.
