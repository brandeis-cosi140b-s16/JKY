I am giving this a 2 star and not 1, because I went back a second time! I really really want to like this place. However, the food needs about a pound of salt, and I don't usually add salt. It lacks any kind of flavor.

However, I love the watery guac and at 25 cents a side mixed it with those watery beans and add some salt MMMM. The steak is cut to perfection, but lacks flavor. THe tortillas are soft, but the portions are also very small. Also the sodas are really expensive I think our bottle of coke was $3.00 granted it was a bottle but still?? I do want to go back though and try again maybe I will have better luck!
