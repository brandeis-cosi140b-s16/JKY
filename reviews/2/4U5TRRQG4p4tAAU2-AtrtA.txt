We've been to a closer La Parrilla Suiza before, so when it turned out that we could get diner miles by going to this one, we thought we'd try it, even though it's much further out.

Maybe they had an off night, but I had some serious issues with hygiene! I'm not usually too fussy on this kind of thing, but the tables were dirty, there was old crud and new food stuck all over the table and in the grout lines of the tiled table, the floors had clearly not been cleaned in a while (food from previous diners was still all over the floor) and the toilets were in a terrible state of disrepair!

One toilet was completely blocked, another was covered in excrement and the sink wall had some kind of damage too, like a chunk off the wall missing. There was water/pee and toilet paper all over the floor too!

When my daughter and I returned from the restroom, we told the waiter what state the ladies was in and he somewhat grunted in acknowledgement, but when my daughter needed to go again before leaving, nothing had changed.

The food was ok, but to be honest, I had a hard time enjoying it.

We won't be returning!
