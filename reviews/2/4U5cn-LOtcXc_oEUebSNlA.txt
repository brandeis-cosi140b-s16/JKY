Came in wanting tacos and a burrito to go, instead just got my tacos. Out of steak at 7:30 and  they weren't going to replenish it? Um, what's going on? And then apparently it's too hard to work on two things at the same time. I ordered both a burrito and tacos from the kid behind the counter, then he started scooping the meat onto the tortillas. He then had the flour tortilla out and scooped out some  white rice. The young lady next to him asks me for my choice of toppings. When done I look over so she can start on my burrito and the tortilla with the rice was no longer there! Yeah, forget it, I'm not going to spend my money on bad and incompetent service. There are too many restaurant options in Vegas to deal with bad food or service. My tacos, shredded beef and chicken were just alright. Chicken was dry.
