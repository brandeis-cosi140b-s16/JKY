An hour and a half to serve four people mediocre food? I think not. The mole sauce was delicious, but just putting chicken wings to swim in it on your plate does not make it suitable. The chimis were less than good, with absolutely NO seasonings for the meat. It should have been delicious, but honestly it was a let down. The food was mediocre (if not lacking) and the service was awful. Service was slow to pick up after people left, never asked if we wanted refills (after an hour and a half! really?) and honestly needed work. Along with all of the food. Only a few chips and out of the bottle salsa for starters? No thanks. 

Next time, I'll just drive all the way to Phoenix for some Mi Patio! Honestly, the only thing worth the money is the menudo. I won't be going back here again.
