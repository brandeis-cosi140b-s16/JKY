Went today for lunch, had been a couple of years ago for their fish tacos.  The fish tacos were good but everything that went with it was just ok at best.  Rice and beans were less than average and we didn't like the guacamole at all.  I would go back for the fish tacos but wish they had them a la carte because the food that accompanies was not good.
