The only reason why they get 2 stars from me is because the food was actually good... Prices was ok.. Didn't receive the chips and salsa that I've read about on here.. Wasn't approached by the cashier so we can order our take out for about 20 mins, even though she seen us standing there and smiled!! 

Once we finally ordered it took 45 minutes to get the food!! I had time to walk to food 4 less, get a few groceries, put those in the car, walk back to Tonys and I was still waiting!!! Once I got the food I went home and boy was I disappointed!!!! There was barely any food on my plate!!!! So.. I waited all that time for this small ass plate! I love mexican food and this by far is the smallest shit I ever seen!!! Once I ate it I was STILL hungry!!! I ended up eating cereal afterwards!!! 

To sum it up-- bad customer service, long wait (even though no one was in there), very small portion, no free chips and salsa.. Like I said the only thing saving this place in my eyes is that the food is actually good..
