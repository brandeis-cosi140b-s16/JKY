Tried this place last summer in an attempt to end a bout of Chipotle-going.  Yeah, I drank the Chipotle koolaid for a bit (I'm better now, thanks).  Anyway, I read all the great reviews of Poblano and went for some takeout.  Read that the owner came from Tex Tubbs (which we love) and hoped for great food in a more authentic Mex style.

What we got was little tacos made of dried-out tortillas, filled with dry and chewy fillings.  I was the only one in there, the dining room was totally empty, yes, right at dinner-time, and it STILL took them something like 20 minutes to put my order together.  The whole time, I felt like I was interrupting them by ordering, one of my real pet peeves about any business.

We had, as I recall, the El Pastor, the Chorizo, the Asada, and a veggie taco.  All the meats were rubbery and dry, and the tortillas tasted a week old, stale and lifeless.  Good thing I asked for hot sauce before I left.  I ended up using all of it just to moisten the damned things.

I highly doubt I will ever go back.  I gave two stars because the onions and cilantro were good!
