Although I love the food at Javier's I'm consistently disappointed with the level of service here . It's almost like the staff and servers are 2 busy for you when your there. Every time an item is dropped off its like a race to get away from the table. I'm all about working hard and hustling around but there is a level of customer service that needs to go into an expensive meal like Javier's.
