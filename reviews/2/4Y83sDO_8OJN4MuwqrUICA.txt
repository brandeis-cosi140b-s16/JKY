I used to eat at la Perla years ago and it was pretty decent. After my favorite Mexican restaurant  probably in the whole world closed, Lily's just around the corner (RIP Zip. We miss the hell outta you. You better be waiting for me w/one of your Sunday morning pork chops when I reach the pearly gates. It just won't be heaven w/o it) we decided to give it another try. Wish I hadn't. It was ok....but just ok. Like another yelper posted, things had a weird after taste. I can't quite place my finger (or tastebuds) on what it is but there is just something funky about it. I truly wish I could like La Perla but, alas, my search for a replacement to my beloved Lily's continues. Pedro's down the street on Glendale isn't too shabby. Great enchiladas but not the homespun ambiance of Lily's. Sigh.
UPDATE- I no longer have to search for a replacement to my beloved Lily's! The chefs of 30 years reopened in the same spot w/the same menu! Its call Fajardo's Cafe now and is the best homestyle Mexican food in town. Great family place. When I was there on Sunday morning there were little kids in their pajamas eating there. Too cute. I love a place I can go to and not have to put on makeup!
