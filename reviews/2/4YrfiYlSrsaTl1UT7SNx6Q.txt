Mexican food at an airport? YES PLEASE! Too bad it did not live up to Moes standards! 
The employees working that day were too busy eating chips, laughing, throwing things at each other, and just plain goofing off. 

We ordered a veggie burrito and it was barely filled, the employee wrapped things up before we could ask for cheese and cilantro. The burrito was not bad, but it was not amazing! 

Limited seating, which fills up fast. A couple customers were literally just standing up around tables eating.

They do give you free chips with your meal and salsa, but the worst of all is getting chips from an employee who has been eating out of that same batch. *gross*

& because this is an airport Moe's, they do not have a salsa bar like others, so you have to ask for whichever salsa you want at the cash. (I like the freedom to look at the salsas and try out a few without having to bug the cashier).

This is one of the Moe's that would have benefited from Undercover Boss! MOE, You should pay a visit to this location!!

Definite skip, there are better options at the airport.
