I wanted to like the place. The staff is very friendly and attentive, although they were disorganized (seemed new to the restaurant business). 

We came in on a Friday night with the Living Social deal which was $19 for two house margaritas, an appetizer, and two entrees. 

First off, the house margaritas which are six dollars were not good at all. Couldn't taste any tequila, obvious taste of cheap margarita mix and could not taste any triple sec. 

Next was the appetizer. We went for the cheese crisp. This was a flour tortilla with cheddar cheese and a small helping of sour cream and lettuce to top with for $7. Very disappointed with appetizer. 

As for the entrees, I got the parrilada with chicken and shrimp and my girlfriend got the Verde chicken enchiladas. My meal was $15 regularly and hers was $8 plus $4 more for rice and beans. Neither meal was impressive, and the prices were much higher than most other places in the valley, particularly in this area. 

Chips (flour) and "salsa" were a little different and tasted fine, but i much prefer fresh salsa made with vegetables. I am not sure what the orange sauce like concoction that they gave us was, but I would not call it salsa. 

Moved to Arizona from Texas almost 3 years ago and have yet to find a Mexican restaurant that is tasty and reasonably priced, and this one disappointed as well. 

I would not recommend, you will pay too much for something that you could get at one of the bertos restaurants. Also avoid the margarita at all costs. It was well overpriced for the quality. Head over to La Condesca if you are wanting to spend 10-12 on some tasty quality Mexican food.
