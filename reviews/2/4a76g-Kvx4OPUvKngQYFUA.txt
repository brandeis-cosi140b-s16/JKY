The interior is spacious and the winding vine plants that snake around the walls are impressive, but I wasn't too impressed with our to-go order. 

I had a pollo asado burrito ($4.50) and tried some of the chorizo plate. The burrito was filled with a lot of small pieces of chopped meat, pico de gallo, and guacamole. Unfortunately the meat was so incredibly salty the only way I could eat it was to get out some of my own homemade guacamole and smother the burrito with it to disperse the salt. I also got a few burnt hard black pieces in my meal and some bits of gristle as I ate. I had a bite of the chorizo plate which was better, but consisted of a lot of egg with a small amount of chorizo flavor. 

The prices are reasonable, they have a drive through and they are open late (Until 11 weekdays), but you could say the same thing about Filibertos, and they are actually open 24 hours and have better food. So for now I'll stick to Filibertos for my quickie fast food Mexican eats.
