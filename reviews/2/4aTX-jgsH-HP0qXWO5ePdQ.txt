Convenient location, but they didn't do the relleno burrito properly.
I'm sure you know what a chile relleno is, with cheese inside, then a battered bready covering on the outside. In this burrito there was no bready outside. When you take a bite you should see the parts, it's that simple.
What does that say about this place?
HALF-ASS.
And I won't stand for it.
I work hard and my job is a challenge, and if I did a half-ass job I would be SO FREAKING FIRED, and I resent others who do half-ass work.

The solution?
Go to Filiberto's on 16th St. and McDowell, they do it correctly and their salsa bar is TOPS. See my review.
