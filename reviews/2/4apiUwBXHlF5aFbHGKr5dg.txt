I am back in Phoenix visiting for the week and was excited to have some good Mexican food again. Well this wasn't it!!! 

I ordered a house margarita and it was AWFUL! all sour mix and no tequila. Just bad. The chips they served with salsa were on the soggy side with little flavor. Reminded me of the crunchy noodles you put into wonton soup. 

I had the taco salad. So very not exciting. The shell was soggy. The shredded beef lacked flavor. Skimped on the sour cream. Not very good.

The worst part was our waiter! He was a very snide nasty son of biscuit!!!! we used a restaurant.com gift certificate for our meal. He then very rudely to.d us we couldn't use it for lunch. NO where on the certificate did it indicate this. We asked him to show us, and he couldn't. Then he said he would accept it "this one time", and it was going to have to come out of his pocket. To bleeping bad. Cry to restaurant.com. Not my problemo.

Also...try finding this place....not easy. It's in the far back corner of a Bashas supermarket strip shopping center.
