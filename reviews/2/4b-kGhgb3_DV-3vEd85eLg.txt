Too much cheese is right...and it resembled processed cheese.  The place looked dirty and we brought it to the attention of a waitress after we watched all bus staff, when cleaning off  tables, push the left over food onto the floor!  Customers then walked over the rice and chips and yuck.  We asked a waitress who was using a floor sweeper why they do this and she said that is how it is done, she didn't know why "but the rice is hard to get up."  Well, yes.
