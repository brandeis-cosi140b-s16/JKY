I was a late add-on to my party tonight as I got an invite to dinner after the rest of the party already sat down. When I arrived, I sat about 10 minutes before anyone came to the table. I was not offered a menu, or asked if I wanted a drink, and it was not acknowledged that a 3rd person was now sitting at our table. After those 10 minutes passed, one of the other girls got up and retrieved a menu from the un-manned hostess stand, and brought it back to me. It was at this moment that a server asked me if I wanted a drink menu. He handed it to me, and left me to pore over it for about 5 more minutes. I finally stopped him to ask him for a glass of water and a sex on the beach. The water came out, and he began to scurry away. At this point, the other two members of my party were receiving their plates, and while he was setting their food down I asked if I could order. I ordered a taco salad. The food came out only about 3 minutes after my drink, which I ordered long before. The service was slow, the plates were dirty, and silverware/straws needed to be requested before you received them. I was overall unhappy with the service and the food at this establishment. The beef was bland, the pico had an awkward taste to it that I couldn't pinpoint, and it was nothing that would make me come back a second time. I guess it's time to try another Mexican place in Ballantyne.
