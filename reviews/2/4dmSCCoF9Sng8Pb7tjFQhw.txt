Mehhh.. Not bad, not great.

Stopped by for lunch today and ordered a Cajun fish taco and shrimp taco. Came out to be a little over $6.00. The tacos had more tortilla than meat so a bit steep for the price.

Restaurant was spacious and clean. 

The only other time I've had wahoos was in Cali and we enjoyed our meal then. I'll give one more shot. Possibly try something else before completely giving up on it.
