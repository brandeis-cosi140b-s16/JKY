There was a time that this was a great Qdoba location. Went in today with my family and was overall disgusted with the level.of service & food. The place was a mess. The drink area looked like someone was setting it up and just walked away. An open container of sugar was sitting there with the lid to the sweet tea open as well. The trays that the food are delivered smelled awful. I don't think they have been actually cleaned since the place.opened, most likely just get wiped down by a dirty rag. The food was even tasteless. The only redeeming quality left for me is the chips & queso. Otherwise Chipotle knocks Qdoba to the curb.
