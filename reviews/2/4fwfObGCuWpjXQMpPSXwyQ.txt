Very bad service tonight!!! We are coming here, on and off for the last 9 years were living in this neighborhood and it use to be one of our favors!!! But.... tonight??? Terrible!!! I can't figure out how you Manuel's Management hire this waitress??? She doesn't belong here!!! Not at this location anyway!!! Even tough we called and made a reservation, she acted like she was doing us a favor... her services was lousy and her attitude terrible!!! No class! No customer service! No comments!!! Were most likely think twice before were coming back!!! Very sad :(:(:(
