Located at the Venetian food court, casino level.

This is like Chipotle/Cafe Rio style with the "fixins' made in front of you."
$9-10 for 3 tacos with your choice of meat + lettuce + cheese + salsa.
They charge you extra for almost everything else. ie. sour cream, guac, extra salsa, chips, extra meat.

This is really 2-3 stars but the price does not justify for the food. Def not worth it. But...if you're ever in the mood for something else BESIDES Italian since it seems like that's all they have here at the Venetian/Palazzo...then this is a good alternative. Also less expensive than Taqueria Canonita which is the only casual style Mexican restaurant here on property.
