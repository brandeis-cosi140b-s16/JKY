Man... I want to like this place so much more than I do, but... It just falls short of so much.

- chips. Ugh. Horrible. Bagged. Not good.
- slasa. Bland. No real flavor. Had to add a boatload of the special hot sauce to extract any discernible flavor.
- $1.99 for refills of chips or salsa - really? If you're going to gouge me, please serve me something that didn't just come from a cellophane bag. Please.

+ Victoria beer available
+ Margarita on the rocks aren't half bad

- Tacos. No flavor. None. Completely devoid of taste. Texture? Spot on. But that's it. The cilantro and onion may as well have been made from paper mâché - that's how lifeless they were.

+ helpful service
+ decent interior

I really should rate this around 2.5 stars, but I just can't raise it to 3... the meats are nicely seared, but I can't figure out how they managed to remove any hint of flavor from them. Salt, season, sear, serve - it's not that difficult...
