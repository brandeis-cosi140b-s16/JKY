Ajo Al's, I don't know why I keep coming back to you. Perhaps it's because I've eaten at the 90th Street location since I was a pre-teen. I've had good experiences and horrible; guess this is a trait at all Al's locations.

This is the second time that I've visited this location, last time being a year ago and the food was ok. This time the food was mas o menos. We ordered Sangria, however, the sangria served was unlike any other I've had. The server told us it consisted of watermelon juice, brandy and he couldn't remember what else. No wine in sangria? Hmm... Anyways, the appetizer of guacamole was great with a lot of garlic and lime to it; the entrees, at least mine, was downright nasty. I ordered the Garden Fajitas light oil, to be served Garden Fajitas swimming in oil. So much oil I think that by consuming my entree it might serve as a laxative as well as a meal. I didn't eat the fajitas, or the rice because I'm sure it contained chicken broth. On the bright side the Mushroom Enchilada I had was good. Now I know why I visit Al's on an annual basis, if that.
