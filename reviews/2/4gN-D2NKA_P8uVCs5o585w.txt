Nice spot, much better than the seedy former Cocomo Joe's.  In walking into the restaurant they wanted to seat us by the door..we asked for another table more out of the way..(the place was largely empty)..the gal vanished to find a table (how hard is this in an empty place)..almost 5 mins she came back and said she found a place and asked if we would like the table to be cleaned!! No, I'll just eat the garbage left from the folks before me..geez!! The server was very nice and accommodating however. Food was so-so..the two of us each had food that tasted somewhat 'odd' although couldn't put our finger on it--had almost a somewhat 'chemical' flavor to it. Anyway, we asked for the check and left a large bill ..the server then asked 'would you like change?'.. No I think I'll leave a tip that FAR exceeds the cost of two lunches!! Please ..this idiotic staff needs some training, the cook/owner needs to taste some of the food being served. If you can't get it 'right' in a local place you are DONE..this is a local trade place, please do some 'secret shopping' and see what you diners will be dealing with. To be fair this is also fairly new so I'll give it one more try in a couple of weeks, hopefully they will 'get it right' the next time.
