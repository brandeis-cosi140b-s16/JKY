Little Mexican place run by some nice Mexican nationals.  Very friendly and good service. Food is authentic.  Small with only 9 tables and most only seat 2 people.  Place was crowded.  Some chips and salsa arrived immediately and they were good.  Had a Eggs and Chorizo Burrito,  the tortilla shell was good with a nice soft texture but the chorizo with egg had an odd taste..not a chorizo taste.  Guess I should have tried something else.

Oh the name is actually Mendoza Express, not sure why Yelp has Mendoza Abraham.  Added website and set note to Yelp about incorrect name, hopefully it will be changed.
