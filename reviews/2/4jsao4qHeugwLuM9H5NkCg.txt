Came here today for the first time. Food was descent and good value but will not return due to horrible service. Our waitress was very rude, cold, and nasty too us. Made us feel like we were bothering her just being there. I was really looking forward to trying the crispy fish taco and she delivered the grilled fish taco to our table. She argued with me back and forth saying I ordered the grilled fish and she wrote down grilled fish. First, I know I ordered the crispy fish - I was looking forward to it. Second, I'm the customer and I'm always right, I don't care that she wrote down the wrong order. Anyway, she finally agreed to bring me a crispy fish taco. She never came back to the table, someone else dropped off our check and she charged me for both tacos!! Didn't want to argue with her again so paid the bill and decided to never return. Your in the hospitality business, learn to be hospitable.
