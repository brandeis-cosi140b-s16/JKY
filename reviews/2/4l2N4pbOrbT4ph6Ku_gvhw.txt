Lo siento Texano's!  Quieria te gusto mucho, pero you didn't treat me right.  You have too much competition in the taco shop circuit to get along by your interesting looks alone.

Between a sloppy tostada with tons of fatty dark meat chicken, and an overcooked carne asada California burrito, I just wasn't impressed.  This was one of those taco shops that I drove by and went 'oh my God...I am going to love that place!'  When I went inside I thought "oh my God...I am going to love this place."  When I got my food I thought "oh my God, I am not a huge fan of this place."

Final thought - It would have been three stars if the Jukebox would have let me spend a dollar and play the Mana CD that was on the last page of CDs.  Lo siento Texano's.
