Boring. The waitress bored us with her lack of interest. This is my 3rd visit and the thrill has gone. Next time I will save the money and hit the drive up at Taco Bell. I am sorry I bothered to ask for more tea. I know you we're busy texting or smoking or discussing what you did last night. I won't bother you again.
