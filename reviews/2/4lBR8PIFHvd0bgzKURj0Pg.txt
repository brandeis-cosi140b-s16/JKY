We came here late night since this place turns into a wannabe club of sorts after hours. Thankfully, we were able to avoid the college crowd and have seats in the side room. The bartenders were a bit slow with everything from a simple beer to their Coco Loco drink that I was suggested to try. The drink was $4.50 and took the bartender a short while to make, but I was satisfied with the pineapple, coconut and rum flavors. My favorite part was late night taco bar! $2 cash for fresh tacos that you essentially make yourself. You can't go wrong with this sober or not. They were hands down the best part of my experience here. (Chorizo and carne asada..add the avocado sauce!)
