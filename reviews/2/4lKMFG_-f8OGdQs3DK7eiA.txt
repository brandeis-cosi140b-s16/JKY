The good news is that they have Negra Modelo at 2 for $2.50 at Happy Hour, which has to be some kind of Scottsdale record.

The bad news is that it's a Mexican restaurant that seems to want to be a titty bar when it grows up.   The other reviewers aren't kidding when they say that every girl working here has implants.  Big humongous ones.  Not that there's anything wrong with that but it did confuse me on the concept somewhat. Friendly servers though.

The food - at least what I had - was barely edible.  Stick to the $1.25 beers.
