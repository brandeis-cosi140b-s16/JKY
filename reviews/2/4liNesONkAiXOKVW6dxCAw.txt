I don't see what the fad is here...maybe I'm not drunk or it's cause I'm from SoCal so I grew up eating deliciously cheap tacos (for like 75 cents). I thought this place was ridiculous expensive for tacos. Sure, they put on a show, and it's a popular place for locals. I tried the asada, lengua and adobada. I thought the adobada was the most flavorful out of the three. The others, didn't really stand out. The food tastes decent (I'd give it 3-3.5 stars at most) but I just can't get over the price! (hence the 2 stars)
