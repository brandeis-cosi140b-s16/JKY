Rosa's--Just okay.

The opening chips and salsa was tasty and bottomless, but the salsa was definitely on the sweet side.  The food overall wasn't that bad, but nothing distinctive.  You get a fairly large plate of Mexifood in a pleasant atmosphere and pretty good service, but the taste is only average.  Frankly, there are a LOT of Taquerias, even Filiberto's at times, that have had better tasting grub than this, especially at the prices that they charge.  They don't charge an excessive amount, but dinner for three here cost over $60 with tip.  The taste of the food wasn't commensurate with the price--just to compare, another meal at the Filiberto's drive-thru in Tempe provided a similar amount of food with a better taste for $25.

Worth the 35 extra dollars to eat in?  No.
Recommended?  No.
Crappy?  No, but why not get food you really enjoy for less money elsewhere?
