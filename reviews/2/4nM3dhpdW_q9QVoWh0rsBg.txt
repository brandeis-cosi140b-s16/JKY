The ambiance and drinks are something worth coming back to. On the other hand , the actual food doesn't have an authentic taste and the flavored aren't rich. The corn had this sour cream , mayo, lime that didn't taste like the traditional Mexican  street corn I've had before. It was sour and inedible. We sent it back. Our server was great and attentive. My rating is mainly based on the food taste. I'm from California so I just have high expectations for  Mexican food. FYI.. Pinches Tacos is Wayy better in terms of authentic taste.
