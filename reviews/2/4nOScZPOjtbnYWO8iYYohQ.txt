Alright, so I've been here twice.  The atmosphere is ok, seating is a little awkward and the lighting could be better.  The service is decent, or about as decent as you can expect.  As for the food, it could be better.  While my dish (the steak quesadilla) was pretty good, some of the other dishes weren't so hot.  When I took my family, I was the only one who liked mine....everyone else ended up leaving half of theirs behind.  And considering the price of the place, it could be a whole lot better.  If I were you, I wouldn't put this place on the "must go" list.
