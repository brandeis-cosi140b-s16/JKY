Sunday, late afternoon/early evening  - around 5:30pm. Place was largely empty; maybe 2-3 tables of patrons.

+ Definitely authentic and locally owned. Seems like a mom-n-pop kind of joint.
+ It's not that hard to find... turn west onto Independence lane, go two driveways past the McDonald's entrance, and it's in a strip mall almost directly behind Mickey D's.

- Interior feels like an old Office Depot/Staples. Super harsh lighting, "big box" white floor. Booths and tables are standard issue - very utilitarian. I get it; it's a taqueria, and not an Abuelo's.

- Very unclear what to do upon entry. There's a cashier station that looks like you should place your order at; stood near cash register for a few minutes before someone asked what we needed. Expressed interest in getting dinner and were told to take a seat and that someone would take our order. A sign would go a long way here.

+ Simple menu; the basics. 
+ Decent selection of beer
- None of the beers are listed anywhere, and all are $4, which is a bit steep for a Miller Lite bottle
+ Good selection of tacos - tripe, lengua, pastor, asada
- Didn't see chicken listed; server wasn't sure if they had it
- Upcharge of $0.50 for shredded cheese to be added to a taco

We placed our orders - 3 tacos each (lengua, carne asada, pastor, with cilantro & onions). Also requested waters and a bottle of Victoria. Waters came in beer mugs; Victoria came in a bottle. Asked for a lime, which never arrived.

- About 5 minutes after we ordered, our server came out to ask us to remind him what we ordered. He had written it all down at the time of the order. Seemed odd.

+ Food arrived shortly after; the tacos are *mounded* with meat. Picture a standard-sized corn tortilla, but with a 3" high mound of chopped meat on it.
+ $2.99 per taco, regardless of filling

- Unfortunately, the meat wasn't all that great. The lengua was boiled but not seared, and lacked any seasoning. 
- The carne asada had a nice sear but zero flavor. None.
- The pastor was very oily, fatty, and tasted only of salt. I *love* salt, but this was like chewing on a salt sponge. So fatty, so greasy, and so salty.

- Never saw server again. Had to go up to pay at the register. When you pay, they type it in on a calculator and show you the calculator, rather than show you the bill or tell you the amount. I was a little surprised that the meal was as expensive as it was... 

So... while I'm a huge fan of taquerias, I'm not sure I'll race back to this one.
