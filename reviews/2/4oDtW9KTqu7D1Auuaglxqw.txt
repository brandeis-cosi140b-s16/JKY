After visiting the other locations with clients, I'm sorry to report that this is the worst. I order the same thing every time. The mini appetizer substitute fundido instead of guacamole. Apparently at this location that isn't allowed. A side of fundido is $2.25 they say. So what is a side of guacamole? $2.25. Doesn't make sense. Three other locations have made the substitution without hesitation. If you want to check out Serranos I would not go to this location. Service and quality at the other locations have been top notch. Here, blah. Don't waste your time.
