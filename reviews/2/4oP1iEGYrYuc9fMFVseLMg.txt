Decided to try Garcia's restaurant based upon other reviews.

Upon entering I decided to sit at the bar which was quite large however I was the only person sitting there which seemed a bit odd. The bartender was friendly enough however there seemed to be a lot of staff just milling around doing nothing.

After ordering a Sol I placed my order to have the Carnitas tacos served without onions. Chips, salsa and a bean dip were served prior to the meal coming out. The  salsa was amazing and some of the freshest I've had but the bean dip just basically tasted like refried beans.

The Carnitas tacos came out and looked nice on the plate however the plate felt like it was about 150Â° which likely means it was flash heated to melt cheese. The result was the rice was dried out and the tacos were lacking any real flavor.
