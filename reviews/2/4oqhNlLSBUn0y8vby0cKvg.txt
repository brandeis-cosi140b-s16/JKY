We were excited for this new little Mexican addition to the south side.  The service here is inattentive at best. We were left sitting at our table forever. No one seemed to know whose table was whose, nor did they seem to care. We finally asked for wait staff to bring us water, cutlery and a menu. Not good for a new place.
