Always get the fajita burrito with extra rice. My chipotle experiances have always been great except for this chipotle. The service is not super friendly, and when then put the meat on your burrito, they don't put alot. There is always a long line, which is usually acceptable except when the line has to fold into the eating area. This chipotles burritos are usally 3/4 the size of the ones i get made for me at other chipotle places. Still this chipotle is able to fix my chipotle fix.
