We used to live in the Melrose District off of 7th Ave and must be spoiled from 7th Ave's America's service.  7th St has only treated us right the first time we came in.  Since then there have been no greetings, just a long wait and "will this be for here or to go?"

This review has been a long time coming, with the hopes that service would improve, it has not.  One Sunday I waited 20 minutes for 2 breakfast burritos, mind you it was breakfast time and I was the second customer in line.  The only thing good about America's on 7th St is the food.  I would much rather ride my bike to 7th St, but will instead drive to 7th Ave for your food based on service alone.  I love the story behind America's and your product, but just because you have a strong following doesn't mean that service should not be present.
