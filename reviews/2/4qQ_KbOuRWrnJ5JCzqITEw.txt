We wanted to love this place but didn't.  The food was really pretty solid.  What blew the evening were the poor, sad, $12 "top shelf" margaritas.

There was no selection of recommended margaritas.  Instead, we were asked, on the spot, to choose which tequila we wanted for our drink.  We chose and lost.  They put the lovely Don Julio tequila in w/ triple sec and whatever other over-sweet mix thing they had going on, and charged $12 for a cocktail that obscured all of the fresh elements that you look for in an ambitious margarita.  I would have preferred a lesser tequila mixed with a better orange liqueur, and great fresh citrus.

The seviche was pretty darned good.  Same for the queso fundido.  We shared the pesca Veracruzana.  The fish was freshly crisp and the sauce, a nice compliment, offered a balance with acid, brine and savory warmth.

The service was on the level of Olive Garden.  Whatevah.  I can abide mediocre service if the cuisine is worth it.  

Given the insulting drinks, the Starbucks-esque ambiance, yet better-than-decent food, we still won't be back.
