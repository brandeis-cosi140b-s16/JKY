First and foremost, I LOVE mexican food!  I eat it at least once or twice a week.  I have had the pleasure of enjoying many home-cooked mexican dishes with my mexicano friends and I have traveled deep into the heart of Mexico experiencing many different flavors and styles of mexican food.  My love affair with mexican food is well-developed.  To be quite frank, the food at Amado's is BLAND for the norte√±o style.  Especially when compared to Filiberto's, which probably explains the usual Amados crowd.  This place is always packed with drunk highschool and ASU jocks every Friday and Saturday night, complete with the occasional highschool spar that draws police.  So the late night bar crowd should beware, this place is a night in jail waiting to happen.  This is why they have security cameras aimed right at you as you order.  The best thing going for this place is the little salsa bar.  I am staying loyal to the near by Filiberto's which is much more relaxed, more flavorful and has a drive-thru.
