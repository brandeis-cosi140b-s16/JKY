BF and I wanted to try this out instead of the Chipotle in the next door shopping center. I wanted to like this place and heard such good things, but did not hit up to par. 

I liked that they had fish, shrimp and so many sauce options, brown rice, wheat tortilla, etc. Options are nice. 

Got some fish tacos- they were pretty good, but not anything fantastically different than what I can get at like a Rubios for $1. Good if I want that and it's right there by my house, but I'm doubtful about other offerings.

Where it fell short was the carnitas burrito. Though the sauce, beans, etc were good, the meat itself was disappointing. It was finely shredded and was sitting in juices so it wasnt dry (not technically carnitas if its in au jus but whatever, its not "authentic" ), but the flavor was off...I could say it was almost dog food like quality in terms of it's flavor....we did not eat more than a few bites. 

Off day maybe? I don't know.
