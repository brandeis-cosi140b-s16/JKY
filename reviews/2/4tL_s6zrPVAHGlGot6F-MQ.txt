Slightly offended by the person representing this place. I came shortly after opening ( this review has been a long time coming)  a guy came brought us our food and began to give us the low down on the place since it had just opened. I think he was a rep, hell maybe even  a manager at the LA location. my husband who is full blown Mexican struck up a conversation with him and he told us how this place differs from others in the area. One reason being the "Not Nacho's" I asked why they are called that and he said "well, what do people think of when they think of nacho's?" A little dumb founded I paused for a while and he said " chips with processed cheese on top" I realize this place is also a chain in LA with plenty of Mexicans so what makes him think that's what people think Nacho's are? I know I don't think that and I'm white. So what "people" is he referring to? Get a life bro, your tacos suck compared to REAL tacos at Tacos El Gordo!!!!
