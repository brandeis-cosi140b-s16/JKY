Scored 1 to 5 - 1 is worst / 5 is best

Also, for those that say "This is authentic" ... yes, they are right, Authentic for Disneyland ... dont get me wrong, it's decor and looks and feel of the establishment is great and yes it is located to a Mexican Market but that doesnt make something authentic in my book.  I have traveled all over in Mexico and this doesnt cut it.  It is a great place to take a tourist... In regards to the food, yes, they have "authentic" choices, but it's not stellar.  

My opinion of Authentic is that the FOOD tastes like you are in Puerto Nuevo, Cancun, Mexico City and the flavor and smell is something you remember.  Only the environment here was memorable.  If you didnt grow up with mexican food then I am sure this will be fine for you, but if you know what a carne asada burrito should taste like then keep looking elsewhere.

(Carne asada was your typical Phx gummy and tough meat that is passes off as carne asada at most restaurants here in this city.  The carnitas was link some pork tenderloin, and too salty.  Shrimp was very good, chips and dip was average, corn tortillas were excellent, beans and rice were average.)

**Mariachi trio: 5 
(we have family that played for years, so we know good mariachis, and these guys were awesome.

**Price: 3

So Carne Asada in Phoenix is teh suck... I have yet to find something good...
