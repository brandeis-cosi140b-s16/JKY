I'm giving it two stars for the customer service, the staff was super friendly.  There's a fast food Mexican restaurant (with drive thru) I can get better & cheaper fish tacos from. The taco was dry and I didn't care for the red sauce on it (I guess it was salsa?) I'm surprised by all the positive reviews.
