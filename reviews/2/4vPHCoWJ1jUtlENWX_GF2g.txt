We three went last night and all had great meals withe excellent service.
Great wine and draft beer list.  We will be back often and tell our friends
To also go.
We have been back three times and I take back my original review which was 4 stars.  My wife's cheese enchiladas had no cheese, and I mean none.
My tacos and quesidelas  were mostly over fried with almost no filling.
The last two visits were similar.  They also have a weird wine list, a Pinot was 
$50 for a bottle and 25 for a glass?  Also the glasses of wine are a third the
Price of a bottle for a very small pour.
We had high hopes for Los Sombreros but will go back to our favorite,
the Spotted Donkey for A Mex fix.
