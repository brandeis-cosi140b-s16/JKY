I've been looking forward to trying this place since it opened....sadly I was not pleased. The lady at the cashier was so nice but that's about all I have to say for nice things. The tamale was small, and just eh tasting. Tacos were alright. The enchilada....was not an enchilada at all. No meat, flat, and almost like a quesadilla with enchilada sauce on it. Honestly, Frank and Phina's Caucina and Roberto's has bigger, real portions and prices are good!
