Chips are stale and some were quite rubbery. I think they are cooking them in too low of a temperature oil. Salsa is delicious though. A great chipotle flavor to the hot salsa.
I had the two taco meal. One chicken and one shredded beef. They were ok. Nothing to rave about. Overall, a solid 2 star place. Worth the money I guess.
