Came here after watching a show, and the fact that dela hoya came here was a little inspiring too.  The ambiance is pretty nice, very red, nice tables, fountain inside - very modern and slick.  Once again, the hostess was nice, but the waiter was a robot.  No personality, just got the job done.

I ordered the cochinita (i think it's called).  It's basically a huge chunk of pork on the bone, cooked in banana leaves.  it was really tasty and fall off the bone tender.  But obviously, this was a guy kinda dish, since there was barely anything else on the plate.  A few grains of rice, and a veggie or 2 - that's it!  it was basically just a big chunk of meat.
Hubs ordered the pork tacos, which just looked way better than what I got.  it came with all the fixin's and tortillas on the side.  I'll admit, I was jealous!  And of course I helped him eat some of it.  =)  The pork he got was super bland, though. Maybe cause he got more sides to make up for the lack of flavor...?

Overall, after being wow'ed by the pretty decor, I wasn't too impressed with the food.  They served chips with salsa and flavored salt - which I kept eating all night.  The green/lime salt was my favorite.  I don't know if we'd come back - there are so many other restaurants just across the walkway that I'd rather try.
