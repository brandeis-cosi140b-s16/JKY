Not sure if Chipotle has gone down the tubes or if it is just this location. The people were nice but the food was terrible. Not the typical taste. They gave you very minimal portions and it didn't taste fresh. I was really sad about that because I lover Chipotle. So Moes has been my go to until I feel like trying Chipotle again
