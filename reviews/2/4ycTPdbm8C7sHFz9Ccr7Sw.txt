Random thoughts - My Yelp friend Daniel B. has reviews from GA, AZ, & CA within the span of a week.  World traveler?

Anyway, me being the world traveler myself (if you consider U.S. the world which many Americans do), stopped by the Tequileria for lunch before my flight back to L.A.  By the way, Southwest boarding system is awful!!  The Tequileria is, like many airport spots, overpriced and underwhelming.  It's not uncommon these days to find pretty good food at airports these days.  I've gone to a couple spots in Dulles that were quite good.  This is not one of them.

I ordered just a plate of carne asada tacos, which comes with 3 typical food truck-size tacos.  Beef was tender but sauce was not great, and the tortilla was too dry.  Not enough cilantro and chili that would really make the flavor.  I've gotten used to a particular style that makes this dish very predictable and quite satisfying, but theirs is different and not for the better.  A good size Dos Equis is always good, so that helped to wash it down.

The service is again typical airport; not rude but not necessarily pleasant, not slow but not in a hurry.  Decor is sufficiently festive, with lots of TVs.

Table-for-1 Factor:  If you can't feel comfortable eating by yourself at the airport...
