Terrible! Terrible! Terrible! In what used to be part of Carson Street Cafe the Golden Nugget put this. This place has an identity crisis. Is it a sports bar, nightclub or restaurant? The margaritas were okay, I guess. Although my husband order a Coronita (Corona and Margarita) and there was no Corona. Maybe the waitress didn't hear us because the music and football game were at ear splitting volume. The food was ehhh. I had the Baja Shrimp Salad and my husband had the Mexican burger. They lacked any real flavor. The food wasn't filling either (I ordered a pizza when we got home). I wanted to love this place but I don't.
