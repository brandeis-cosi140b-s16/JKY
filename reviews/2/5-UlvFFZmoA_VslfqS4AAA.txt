This place is bush league.  Did I have  great time? Yes-but it was only because of the fun people we came with.  There are so many better Mexican restaurants in Madison/Middleton with better food and better Margaritas.  Best margaritas in Mad-town are: El Dorado Grille (and great everything else!!) and of all places PF Chang's (I know, crazy).  btw, the "Mexican Embassy" Abuelo's right next door to PF Chang's makes a terrible margarita. Consider yourself warned.
