So sad, I remember eating at this place when they had a location near ASU and had fond memories of it- perhaps it's just the expertise of that location or the lack of maturity in my taste buds. This place is not good and a disappointment with the memories I had of it and how easy it is to get to from my new home. 

The chips and salsa was the first sign that this isn't what I remember. They give you two salsas in which both had not a lot of flavor and I ended up mixing them. The mix helped but overall if the chips and salsa at a Mexican restaurant are bland it means the rest of the meal will be. And I was right.. 

I ordered a red chile burrito and upon cutting it up the phrase "canned meat smell" went through my mind. The sauce lacked that smokey heat you expect in a red chili sauce, it had little to no flavor and had an overcooked texture to it. I kept eating because I was hungry, but then my BF said it looked like dog food and I had to stop eating. It did remind me of dog food because his not polite table etiquette connected with my first initial thought about the meal- canned smell. 

My BF ordered a mix of al carte tacos and he had the same unimpressed feeling, and stopped eating halfway through his meal. 

The two stars was for the service, our waitress was awesome and let us know that ordering a pitcher of margaritas would save us a few bucks. The Margarita, which I would consider the 'House Margarita' quench my craving for a margarita. It said it was award winning, which I don't think it was anything amazing, but it did it's job. 

Overall, I won't go back as the food was overall not good and there are too many other great Mexican places to go to.
