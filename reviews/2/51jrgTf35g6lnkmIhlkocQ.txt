Not a fan.  Couple reasons why, one the food is mediocre at best.  It's certainly no better than your run of the mill Azteca, Monterrey, etc.  Keeping that in mind, my second reason for not being a fan is that I find that the dishes here are priced a little on the high side for a standard Mexican restaurant.

I like the decor of this location a little better than the Park Road location but that didn't make up for the lack luster food and the barely acceptable service provided.

If I'm looking for a quick Mexi-fix, Loco Lime or Azteca is still my go to choice!
