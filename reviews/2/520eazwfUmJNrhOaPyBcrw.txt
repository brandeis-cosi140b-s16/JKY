Mi Amigo Ricardo is a local favorite.  Evenings find the parking lot  filled to capacity  so, I was excited when my husband surprised me with an early dinner.
Entering I was impressed with the friendly staff, lovely hand painted murals and overall cleanliness.  We were seated immediately (early Sunday supper), chips and salsa also delivered pronto.    If you ever had Mexican food in the Midwest c. 1968, or your mother attempted Mexican from the Time Life cookbooks this is the fare served at Ricardo's.  Absolutely nothing wrong with this, it is Mexican cuisine  for the timid palate with portions verging on those of most American restaurants.  The salsa (served in little carafes) tasted tenuously spicy (definitely not homemade) and the chips were served in something akin to a child's salad bowl.  We asked for a hotter salsa and were given a delicious jalape√±o sauce similar to a cooked pico de gallo: yum!   My husband ordered the Chihuahua plate; shredded beef flautas, rice and beans and I ordered a simple bean and guacamole tostada.  Both plates reminded me of something my mother cooked at home when we lived in Minnesota (c.1968) with no access to authentic Mexican comestibles other than copious amounts of Iceberg lettuce.  I'm not by any means dismissing Ricardo's food. Sometimes a bit of zeitgeist is good for the soul. Also, you cannot discount the friendly, warm and welcoming atmosphere.
