I normally like this place but it seems like they are going downhill.  Went there today for lunch.  The outdoor patio was full so we sat inside which was not packed.  There were 2 servers and one trainee. The female server and trainee took our order.  Shortly after that, the bar and tables got full and other patrons inside got food and ours never came.  The cook has stopped cooking and was cleaning up.  Once we complained all 3 servers went to check tickets sitting there. The male server offered a very piss-poor apology indicating we did not have to pay for our drinks.  OK?!  No offer to get what we ordered, a free meal for next time, nada.  We walked out at 12:45 no lunch.
