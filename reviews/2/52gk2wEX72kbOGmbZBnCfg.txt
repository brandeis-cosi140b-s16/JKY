Went here with a party of six for a friend's birthday. We made it for happy hour and picked up coupons for a free margarita with purchase of an entree. That and three free shots for the birthday boy were the redeeming factors of this meal. I ordered the cheese enchiladas with sides of rice and black beans. Plating of the food was nice, but taste was mediocre. Plus, my meal was served nearly cold. Everyone else in my party seemed to think the food was good, though.
