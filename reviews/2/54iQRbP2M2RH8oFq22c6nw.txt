This place is a terrible value.  For $9 my burrito better be good, huge or both.  At La Loma it was neither.  There is no kids menu so I even over paid for my children.  Top it all off with an order at the counter and eat off Styrofoam experience and there's no reason to go back.

I really liked the owner's old place, Arturo's, but La Loma has none of Arturo's great qualities.  We knew we had to try La Loma, now that we have, we'll never go back.
