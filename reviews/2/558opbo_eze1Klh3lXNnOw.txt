Went here to #Ontheborder, directly after work recently...and I have to say that although the food is consistently great, the service is hit or miss at best, especially during the times between lunch and dinner.  

I don't know why, but I have a penchant for visiting this particular O.T.B. in the early afternoons usually between 3-6pm.  I ALWAYS sit at or in the bar area.  The last few times I've been here, it was like the bar tenders and other employees were too busy fixing, cleaning and organizing  things; things like the margarita machine, changing the Dos Equis keg, cleaning the liquor bottles, etc to provide good, attentive service.  

If the staff needs time to organize and prepare for the nightly dinner rush, I TOTALLY understand. Perhaps they should consider simply shutting down from like 3-6pm, plenty of establishments do it.  I rather that, then patronize this place and be forced to play second fiddle to a margarita machine...
