Don't get me started with this place. If you've been here before you already know! I was here for a business meeting and the nachos were just horrible! What is that? Velveeta?! It sure does beat the nachos at the movies but I would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant. I'd say it's slightly better than the nachos at taco bell/del taco but if you don't try this place, you're not missing out. Trust.
