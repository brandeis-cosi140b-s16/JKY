I've been to Chipotle before many times and know what to expect, and am a repeat customer because of the combination of tasty, healthy food at a good price and fast, friendly customer service.  

Not tonight.

Tonight there was a nice family of four in front of me in line.  One of the gentleman was on crutches.  Immediately after he placed his order, but not before his burrito was complete a girl who I presume is role-playing as the "manager" walked over to the line and ordered food for an employee, herself, and one of her friends.  

I was told to "hold on" even though it was my turn to order, and the family of four--including the man on crutches--was left standing there while the line was tied up making the "manager's" food.  

I didn't see the manager or anyone else pay for her order. 

This situation is completely UNACCEPTABLE!  How is it possible that the customers who buy the food and keep the business running were forced to wait while the "manager" and her friends eat first!?!?

In what bizarro world is this scenario possible?  

Oh, and there wasn't even a single "sorry" or "we appreciate your patience" forthcoming from either the employees or the easily-replaceable manager.  

I'll take the guys over at Roberto's any day because they at least *pretend* to care.
