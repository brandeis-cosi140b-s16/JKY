Tequileria Grill is located next to the C-5 terminal, next to the Jose Cuervo Tequileria. Please keep in mind that this is a review of the food, not the alcoholic drinks here, so I'm coming from a slightly different perspective than the other reviews below mine.

I ordered the Carne Asada Corn Tacos (3 for $11 + tax ~ $12 as of 08/30/2014) and was treated to a fairly yummy mix of red onions, barbecued pork, some guacamole-like sauce, and what I think is cilantro. To be honest, i was pretty happy with the food, but am still wincing about paying $12 for it. I attached a picture below, which makes the tacos look bigger than they actually are. What was even weirder is that they (or at least my cashier) did not give water cups.  She told me to wait in line at the Burger King next door (which would've been another 15 minutes)!  Common!

Keep in mind there's not really seating at the "Grill" area and the Tequileria attached to it is dim and more designed for lonely flyers.

I would probably recommend it over your other options at Burger King and Sabarro next door, but I am pretty peeved about their tourist-trap pricing and the way they try to force you into buying an overpriced beverage.
