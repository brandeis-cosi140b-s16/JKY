Not a fan. Heard so much about Barrio Cafe and finally tried it for my birthday. I did enjoy the guacamole. The margarita was also very good until the bill came- I never would have gotten a second drink at nearly $14 each! The waitor said it was their "special" today.  Although tasty, the drink was small and did not have much tequila. We both ordered from the Tortas menu and neither of us were happy with our choice-very bland. I know that  they advertise that they don't do hot and spicy food, but we did expect flavor. Over priced and over rated. We won't return.
