Ummm HELLO this is Vegas, you're right out on the strip and you lure people in to eat at your establishment. But tell me as I'm crossing the threshold, outside drinks aren't allowed. 

REALLY?!?!?!?! Ok, well I damn sure ain't buing one from you now. I'll have water with my meal. Thanks!

**food wasn't all that, I've had better down the way at Margaritaville...ijs.
