We had a party of 13 on a quiet Saturday noon. Sure they have the Salsa Bar but the food doesn't measure up to what I have been reading. We had everything from Burro's to Street Taco's to SPECIAL Taco's.  The overall opinion was just OK. Let me speak on my 3 Carne Asada street Taco's with beans and rice. Taco's were not even close to being hot. Not even warm. Meat quality and tenderness was poor. Beans were GREAT. What the hell is white rice doing in a Mexican restaurant? Had better at the same price. Had to ask for chips and more water. Poor teenage waitress was worked. I realize they add 18% automatically but then don't ask for another tip on the check. Service and food was not worth 18%. Would we go back NO. Too many Mexican restaurants in the valley to have poor food. Oh well you go you might enjoy it. It's your money .
