It was faster than a Filibertos. Which means, their stuff is probably all frozen and just deep-fried before serving. 

I've been here for lunch a couple times and its OK at best. I mean, cheap, fast, Mexican food and its close by. Chips and salsa are okay. I usually order off  their lunch menu and went with a lunch-sized chimi. 

Our food came out so fast. I think it took us 20 minutes to have lunch since the food came out so quick. I cut open my chimi and noticed a lot more "juice" in it than normal and when forked some of the shredded beef out of the chimi to have a taste, it was kind of gamey. 

I've had better experiences here but today's lunch made me gag and I never do that! =)
