Maybe I've just had worse experiences than the other 3 reviewers, but I feel like in the 4-5 times I've come to this location, the food is worse than average taco bell. I mean obviously the food is worse than average based on the fact that it's taco bell haha, but this location always seems to screw something up. Last time, my wife ordered a grilled stuffed burrito with chicken and there was no chicken + they added in fried potatoes... weird.
