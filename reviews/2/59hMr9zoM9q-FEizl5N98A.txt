I was invited by the owner to come since I gave a negative review when they were under different management and the name Taco Caliente.  Plus, I had a 50% off any entree coupon, so I gave them a try.  Well, they are better than Taco Caliente was, but not by much.  I ordered corn tacos with chicken, carne asada, and shredded beef.  The shredded beef was actually quite good.  The chicken was the worst--it was dry and crusty in parts.  The carne asada was so-so.  Not much flavor.  It is nice that they come with guacamole and sour cream for no extra charge.  The salsa bar was not there.  Another customer came in and asked when it would be back and the owner/worker said something about not being sure.  I am guessing it is not homemade salsas.  
Unfortunately, I won't be going back.
