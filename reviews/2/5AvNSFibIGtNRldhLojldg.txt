Only getting 2 stars cause I love their Mexican gumbo.....normally. not this time.  Went in tonight. First of all...they let a boy who was about 5 years old sit on the counter where you receive your food and pay. The girl ringing them out never told the boy to get his butt off the counter.  He sat there for a long while touching all the cups and stuff by the register. Gross. Then he finally jumped off after his mom had finally left the restaurant.  As he stood outside waiting for him and then he jumped down and ran out.  The worker never wiped the counter down. Yuck! Then as we were placing our order, the shredded beef was all dry...what was left of it and it was crusty looking. He still served it to us. Then, they went and got new meat. The guac was brown, the tortilla strip were stale. Ordered chips n salsa too. SUPER STALE. drove 30 miles just for the gumbo.  What a waste.  Would love my gas n food money back. Won't be back.
