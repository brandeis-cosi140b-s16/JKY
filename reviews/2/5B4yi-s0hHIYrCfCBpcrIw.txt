So, I understand that this is an airport restaurant and that you don't have much competition in this terminal (In retrospect, I would have much rather had went to Wendy's), but it is inexcusable for the food to be this bad, in my opinion.

Nothing to really comment on here.  Nothing bad or anything really remarkable.

Wow!  Where I do I even begin?!  I ordered the shrimp, chicken, and steak fajitas and everything about this dish was lacking.  The steak was rubbery and tasteless.  But for a twist, the chicken and steak weren't tasteless at all... They were incredibly salty instead (what a great trade off!) !
The guacamole was just downright disgraceful.  It didn't even look like guacamole, just some watered-down, green paste!  The rice seemed to be of extremely low quality and was just as low in the taste department!  The tortillas were pretty awful as well.  This is definitely one of the worst fajitas meals that I have ever had the displeasure of trying to eat!  I spent a good portion of my plane ride hoping not to get sick!

Service: 2
So, let me get this straight... You serve subpar food and then have the nerve to charge an arm and a leg for the privilege of trying to keep it down?!  The prices are ridiculous; even for airport food!  The one saving grace was that our waitress was nice and she checked up on us in a timely fashion.

Overall: 2
 On the whole, we received decent service but, ultimately, the horrible food and high prices led to a very disappointing experience.
