With relatively few fast late night options in this shopping center, we decided to drive through the El Pollo Loco for a late night meal. They were out of breast and wings, so we ended up ordering a family meal with legs and thighs. Upon opening our package, we were immediately annoyed that they didn't include plastic silverware with our order. Famished, we decided to just use the tortillas as makeshift utensils for the beans and sides. Upon ripping open a thigh, I noticed that it wasn't quite cooked inside. I moved onto a piece of leg, only to discover it was nearly raw inside as well. Nearly every piece we got was not suitable to eat due to being undercooked. With the risk of food poisoning,  you'd think that a place that specializes in chicken would be extra careful in making sure their food was fully cooked. I threw everything in the bag and drove back to the restaurant.  The only reason I gave this review two stars instead of one is because they gave us a prompt refund with no questions asked. This will surely be my last time at this location, which is a shame because I generally love El Pollo Loco as a go to place. (This was my first and Last time to patronize this particular location)
