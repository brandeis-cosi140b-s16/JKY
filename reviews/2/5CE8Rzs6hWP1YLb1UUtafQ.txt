We just visited weekend. The location is convenient by the mall but overall just an ok place. Be aware weekends are packed, it was going to be an hr wait but we got lucky with a bar table. The service in our opinion was slow, maybe due to how busy. Server was super nice when we got grab her. We ordered cheese dip, I got a chimichanga and my husband their trio option. Dip was fine, salsa was pretty hot they served. My chimichanga with beef was ok, it honestly tasted more like a cheeseburger! My husband said his was just ok and for the price we won't return. It was over $50 for two dishes, queso and one beer...we feel we can find really good Mexican for about half that price. I'm not sure if this is a chain but felt more like that than a local place.
