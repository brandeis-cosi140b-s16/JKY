I'm not impressed at all. I don't get it. The tacos are nothing more than a tiny bit of meat on a tiny corn tortilla. That is it. I can make that at home and the tortillas I use are way better. My son had the chicken taco. The chicken was bland. I had the barbacoa and it was ok. I've definitely had better. My husband tried the Al Pastor and that was acutally very good. That was very flavorful but he said the fact that it was served in a tiny, not even cooked corn tortilla made it less than impressive. Nothing comes with sides. Those are extra.  So, if you're hungry, order more than one taco and sides. The taco comes with zero toppings. If you want salsa, or any kind of topping you have to visit their salsa bar. There was no cheese. I guess if you want cheese you have to ask for it.  We've been in Las Vegas for four years and have yet to find really good Mexican food. Leticia's is the closest we've come. How is it that Western Nebraska can have sooo many good Mexican restaurants and Las Vegas has The Taco Spot. ???
