So, something has happened in the last few weeks. I don't know if there have been ownership or management changes, but quality has changed.

First and foremost, I received all my food correctly the first time! Gasp! Shock! Awe!

Ok, the second point is not so good. The quality of the food has changed, and no longer tastes fresh and. homemade. The menudo tastes like the kind that comes out of a can, and no pata!  My Erick's Special breakfast burrito didn't taste like anything. Even adding salsa roja did nothing for it. The size was also considerably smaller.

What is the same? The prices, the building and decor and the feedback in the drive-thru Mic! 

I don't know what the change is, but now there are no good burrito places close by in E Mesa/AJ. Disappointed.
