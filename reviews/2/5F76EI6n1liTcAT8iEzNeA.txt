We used to come here a lot before we moved, loved it!! So last night I was extra excited to go for dinner, but it was a disappointment  :( not the same. The Carne Asada tasted different like it was not the same. The dips all seemed to be watered down too, my fav bean dip didn't have the kick it normally does...The service wasn't great, I asked a waitress for more bean dip and she looked at me like "it's not my job".. Then she said ok and just never came back! They also raised their prices. I had 2 michelada drinks and they where $9 each! That's crazy!!! For a beer? Not sure if we will make that trip/drive again for what used to be one of our fav places. :(
