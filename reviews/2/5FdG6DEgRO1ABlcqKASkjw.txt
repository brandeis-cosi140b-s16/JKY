The food is great. Unfortunately, many of the menu items have hidden extra ingredients you can choose from. The employees have a difficult job to do. Tonight, I ordered the Doritos taco..on the display it has sour cream. The cashier asked me if I wanted the nacho cheese Doritos taco..I said yea..I guess. Everything I ordered had Nacho cheese on it ..no sour cream. I can't fault the cashier, because she can't be expected to tell everyone..everything involved with each menu item. There has to be another way to make this easier for the consumer.
