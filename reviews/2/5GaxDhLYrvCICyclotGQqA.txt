Ive been to 1511 a few times before and had much better experiences. I will say that the service was fine, the guacamole is awesome as everyone says. I still hate paying 10 bucks for guac knowing the ingredients cost nearly nothing but hey what are you going to do? 

My gripe on this trip comes in the form of a steak chimichanga. I love chimichangas and I had never had one from 1511, so I ventured to my comfort meal. What came to me was more like a burrito the size of a football. It was not fried, which is why I am calling it a burrito. When I cut into it all I saw was rice, corn and......peas? YES PEAS. There was hardly any steak in my chimichanga. I was very upset, so I only ate half then brought the rest home hoping it would be better the next day in the fridge. That was not the case. 

I will be back to 1511, the gf and myself have enjoyed it many times but I will NEVER order from the tex-mex side again.
