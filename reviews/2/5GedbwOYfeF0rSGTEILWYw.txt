Let's see.....

Apparently, this place is a pretty big deal in the downtown area of Vegas. Mostly within the legal field due to its location by the court house and all the law offices. Was invited to El Sombrero for lunch with some coworkers and figured, well, why not. 

Pulling in, I thought maybe, just MAYBE we were cutting through  a parking lot as a shortcut to El Sombrero ......nope. Parking lot is tiny and creepy. This is a door ding, side swipe and car theft area of high risk! Luckily, i wasn't the one driving. 

Finally, we make it out of the car and into the restaurant....During lunch hour on a weekday and of course the place is super busy, however, we manage to get seated within minutes. The place was hot (as in humid and no air conditioner) and service was very slow. The server was friendly and helpful in answering our menu questions. The items are all simple mexican dishes but for some reason priced pretty high. I ordered tacos and exactly like some of the other Yelp reviews mentioned, I got hard shell tacos with ground beef?? Seriously?! Someone in my group ordered Enchiladas and they were super runny, almost as if they used pre-made canned sauce that you purchase at Food-4-Less....Was not impressed AT ALL.

I would say this place needs improvements on their menu items, and/or lower prices. The clientele is there, they need to make some changes before Dona  Maria's and Casa Don Juan takes over.
