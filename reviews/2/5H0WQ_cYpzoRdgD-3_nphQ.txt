Disclaimer: I'm from Vancouver and have not been immersed in Mexican food my entire life. But, I do know good food from bad food, and our last meal was not good food.

I ordered the vegetarian quesadillas. On the menu, it states they are grilled vegetable quesadillas. I love smoky grilled veg and was really excited for my meal. 

Yeah... they weren't grilled. They took a cheap, mixed bag of generic veg (carrots and celery, REALLY?), sauteed them in some butter, and popped them on a tortilla with cheap, nasty cheese. They didn't even cut them all the way through.

Service was good once our server got to us. We were left at our table for a solid 10 minutes before our server came by to grab drink orders and bring chips and salsa. I like the patio with the water feature out back.

Overall, disappointing experience that doesn't warrant a return visit.
