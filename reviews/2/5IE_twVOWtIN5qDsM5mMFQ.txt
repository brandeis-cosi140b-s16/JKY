I had a hard time giving this place even two stars. I know La Perla has been in Glendale for 60 years or so, and I sure as hell don't know why! I ordered the Chicken Mole and this was by far the worst mole I have ever had. It was very thin, and a light brown. The flavor nor the consistency were even close. The chicken was on the bone, and the fatty skin was still on. The rice was OK, but the beans tasted like they came straight out of can. The one, somewhat redeeming factor of my meal was the tortilla. It was pretty good, but still a little dry.

My mom ordered a combination plate with a shredded beef enchilada with green chile sauce, a red tamale, and a ground beef taco. The enchilada was actually good, and definitely the best thing we had there. The tamale was decent. The taco was terrible, whatever they call ground beef seemed to be some sort of unrecognizable mush. Most closely related to dog food. Shit, I don't think I would even feed it to my dog. 

Overall, this was a disappointing experience. I cannot recommend La Perla. Its too bad Lily's closed down. It was by far the best Mexican food in the Downtown Glendale area (as far as I know.)
