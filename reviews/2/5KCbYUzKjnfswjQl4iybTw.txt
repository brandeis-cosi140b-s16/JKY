My wife and I came in on a Sunday at dinner time, the restaurant was pretty full and lively. The server was prompt, our drinks, chips, salsa and bean dip came right out. My wife loved the bean dip, the salsa was just spicy enough. The margaritas are nothing special, too much 'sour' but that is nit picking - they are okay... The entres were average at best. My wife had the shrimp tacos - some of the shrimp looked grilled, others, not as grilled - like they made them in different batches. After eating one taco my wife couldn't take any more and left the second one - just not very good. I ordered a beef burrito - what came out was a rice burrito with a couple tablespoons of grey meet. I got the green chiles and cheese 'inside', the chiles were very good - the cheese was one lump in the middle of the burrito, not even melted. To their credit, they took my aweful burrito off the bill... The food is overpriced for what you get as well. After numerous 'luke warm experiences, we sadly decided this was our last trip to our local restaurant. SE Chandler is a 'black hole' when it comes to dining out - we will drive further north from now on, sorry to see this place continues to underwhelm.
