The 2 stars is mainly for the service.  They were extremely slow!  I have visited other Chipotle locations and even when there's a line, they are fast and friendly.  When I finally got to the register, the girl at the register had to ask me 3 times what I ordered and even though I told her 4 times that I wanted a large drink, she kept handing me the small drink.  Maybe it was because she was more concerned with a co-worker (who had either just gotten off of work or was on break) telling her a story about a friend of his who was having a baby.  It was pretty ridiculous considering the growing line of customers behind me. 


The food as usual is delicious! Can never go wrong with a chicken burrito bowl!  However, the guy who was taking the order was in a huge hurry (there was a long line as usual during lunch) and put less than 1/2 the amount of rice and beans than what is usually put into the bowl.  I had to ask for a little more of each.  When I asked for extra lettuce, the girl putting it on gave me a look like "Really?" and begrudgingly gave me extra lettuce.  

I think I will be heading east to the Chipotle in Avondale next time.  I've never had a problem at that location.

P.S.  Parking is not the greatest here!
