I first started going to the original Hussong's in Ensenada in '73.  I was amused to see that they had opened a place at Mandalay, but my expectations were low, given Las Vegas's tendency to do recreations that are skin-deep at best.  Nonetheless, not having been to the real thing in a few years due to border violence, my wife and I decided to check it out.

As far as the decor and look of the place, they did about as good a job as can be expected.  It has a lot of the touches of the original...albeit with a lack of the grit and wear of years.

The service was pretty good...a young lady named Yolanda was attentive, and friendly, as was the hostess who seated us.  In fact, Yolanda recommended an excellent tequila (although it would be much better if they had a printed list from which to choose).

The food was another story.  (I've eaten in restaurants all over Mexico from resorts to baja joints to Mexico City).The salsas were pretty good, but everything else, the beans, rice, lobster tacos, and carne asada were  bland, and the presentation was weak.  Speaking of presentatioin, the "toreados" (jalapenos stuffed with cheese) were sitting on a plate with some mysteriouis brown liquid swishing around the bottom...not very appetizing for an appetizer.  also, the jalapenos should have been deveined and seeded better...as a result they were inedibly hot.

Based on our experience, it was a typical case of another Las Vegas restaurant that knows they don't have to rely on repeat business, because there's a new load of customers coming into town every day.
Overall a big disappointment, but I have to give credit to the designers who did a fairly credible job of recreating the look of Hussong's, and the wait staff who were friendlier than a lot of LV restaurant staff.

I seriously doubt we'll go back unless I hear that there have been dramatic changes in the food.
