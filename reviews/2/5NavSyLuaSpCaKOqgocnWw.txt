I normally come here on Wednesdays after I get out of school for their 99cent bean burritos. I've had some decent luck with this location but it's all at complete random chance.  Tonight I ordered a couple of bean burritos and a quesadilla.  When I got home the tortillas were stale and hard as a rock.  You had to peel off half of it because it was just too dry to eat.  I personally think that it's unacceptable for a cook to make multiple burritos and wrap them in tortillas that are obviously meant for the trash can and not for customers. 

There are also days when I go here and order the same thing and they are fresh as can be.  Super soft and taste like they were just made.  I don't know what I expect from going to a berto though.  It's always a chance to get really bad food or really good food.  

You know you can't call and complain because odds are no one there will care enough to do anything about it or they won't be able to understand English over the phone.
