UGH, I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1 star b'c of my husband's persuasion.  This place is TERRIBLE!!  I am by no means a picky, mean, or rude customer.  They guy behind the counter just treated us like we owed him a big friggin' thank you for making us a sub par meal.  I had the chicken mango chipotle (or something like that) nachos.  Blech.  Hubby had a burrito which was also blech.  I will definitely not come here again.  When someone says "thank you", you should say "your welcome" back or something to acknowledge your customer.  These people need retraining in their customer service skills.  To boot, the food was terrible.
