I used to love Roberto's (aka Maria's) because I could walk there and they had decent, consistent Mexican food at a good price. However, the last couple times I've been there, the food has not been decent at all. My husband got a carne asada burrito and pulled out a chunk of fat probably one inch by one inch by one inch. No exaggeration, there was zero meat on this chunk. Sick. After that, we decided to give Roberto/Maria one more try since we had had so many good times in the past. Once again, the meat was gristly and neither of us finished our meals. Instead, I'll be going across the street to 100% Natural for my takeout Mexican food from now on. It's a little more expensive, but at least I can actually eat it!
