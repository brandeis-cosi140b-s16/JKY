ok so this place is nothing new to me i have been going here for, i would say 7 years give or take and i am sad to say the changes they have been making are not makin me a happy little pumpkin (?) anyway, i LOVE LOVE LOVE my chips and salsa i mean LOVE. I am sad to say the main reason i went there is to get my "fix", because of their amazing salsa and chip bar, 2 kinds of chips and it USE to be 3 kinds of salsas that they had! i made my very own concoction with 2 salsas they had that i mixed together with lemon juice... the taste was beyond words..MMmmMM..

it hasnt been the same since this happened i am heart broken and am now in search of this new salsa out there waiting for me to love.

other than that this place loves to nickel and dimes the change outta ya. ugh! i dunno why.. every time i go its always packed and am sure that the 50 cents they get for refills or the 5 cents for a to-go cup!! can be easily resolved by giving me my salsa back... well i dont think it would help that situation, but omg! seriously? sad. 

dear sylvia's,
please make me happy again so i can go and admire your lovely and amazing pictures of clinton and the pope that grace your walls.

thanks,

love always.. me.
