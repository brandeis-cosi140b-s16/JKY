Cheap drink specials, and tasty margaritas but this place is not for me.  I'm not into fog machines, laser lights, way too loud club music and a bass beat that made my head throb.  I'm not a fossil, but certainly way too old for this place. Table-made guacamole had way to much onion in it but the chips and salsa were decent.  Pretty bland chicken quesadilla.
