Total drunk food, haha! They have cheap, huge portions available 24 hours, which is awesome, and I urge the drunkies to go. Unfortunately, if you haven't been knocking a few back, this is not a place I would recommend. (Make that quite a few!) From the meat, cheese, beans, rice, and sauces,  everything was just so bland! It was actually shocking how flavorless tgd food was.
