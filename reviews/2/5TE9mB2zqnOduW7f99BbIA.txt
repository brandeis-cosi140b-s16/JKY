My cousin's usual "hole in the wall" Mexican  restaurant does not serve beer, so we decided to try Nando's because it was close  and we wanted beer after a 6 hr drive back from LA.  Lucky we were not in a hurry because the service was slow considering the restaurant was not busy. We had to ask twice for our beer and three times for additional salsa!

Fortunately the food was better than the service. I had Alfredo's Green Chile Pork.  The Hatch green chile sauce was great. However, the whole beans were a bit "crunchy" for my liking. 

Next time I'm in town I'll go to the "hole in the wall" and have a Coke.
