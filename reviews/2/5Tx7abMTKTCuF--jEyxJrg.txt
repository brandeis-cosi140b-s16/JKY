Don't bother booking a party because they will not plan properly either way.  We called ahead 2 weeks in advance, verified the reservation the night before and still had to wait 30 minutes for our table.  We were so spread out for our party of 12 no one could talk to each other.  Food is good and waitresses are very sweet. So for a small party, you're fine. But not the place for a big party.
