Food was decent, but it took over 40 minutes to get it. It was a busy Saturday night, so I expected as much, but then our food arrived cold. Mine still tasted alright, just not warm at all. Our waitress was incredibly stressed, and let us know it. 

It was just so incredibly disorganized. The flow of the place was so scattered, people were huddled in groups waiting to use the computer or waiting for things to come out of the kitchen, it severely lacks any kind of management.
