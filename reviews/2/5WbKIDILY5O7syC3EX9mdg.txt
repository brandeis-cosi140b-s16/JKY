My wife and I have been going  there for 26 yrs. Has always been great. However, the  last several times dining wasn't what we expected. The beans for some reason have been changed and lost the authentic taste. The hot salsa wasn't as hot or tasty either. 
 We have always raved to our friends and relatives about Pedro's but not now until we try it again. Seems like garnish etc. has been cut back. Large portions without the taste is just that a large portion!!
