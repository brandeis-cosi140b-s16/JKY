Ok people, you want a real review from a real mexican from southern cali? Here's the scoop....... this is very very mediocre mexican food!!! I'm giving it 2 stars only because it was ok & not disgusting. I was there a couple wks ago for the 1st time & was dissapointed :-( I had cheese enchiladas wth rice & beans. Let's start wth the enchiladas, the sauce was ok, I think they use las palmas canned salsa, which is definitely not 5 stars. The rice seemed to come from a pouch that reads "spanish rice" and the beans were merely edible. I don't c the hype about this place at all. Also, the service sucks!!! I wanted to sit wth my frnds at a little side table next to the restaurant so the hostess told me to order my food to go frm the bar. I walked over & waited while the bar waitress chit chatted wth a couple of guys. The heffer completely ignored me 4 a few mins till I waved at her. She clearly saw me but didn't want to be bothered while she flirted wth the guys. Anyway, its way overpriced (mine was compd wth my mlife points luckily), food sucks & the portions are actually small. Don't eat here! Instead go to a buffet, they have better mexican food there & u get what u pay for.
