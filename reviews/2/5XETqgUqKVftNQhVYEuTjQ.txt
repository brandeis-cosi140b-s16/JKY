Food was excellent but don't call yourself "fine" dining and serve your salsa in plastic to go cups. Service was terrible! Food was so good hope they figure out how to staff a restaurant properly. Had a very hard time finding the entrance too needs to be marked more clearly. Not sure I'll go back. Table next to us had been waiting for a server when we got there and we had our food by the time they finally got to order. Manager apologized to them and offered 50% off but as far as I'm concerned that's not acceptable and meal should be comped.
