This location used to be my go too whenever I wanted a quick lunch. Unfortunately the last few times I have been here there have been multiple issues. I usually get a bowl because I got sick of how when you take a bite out of the burrito one side is all rice. (Yes I am aware you can ask them to mix it up). Well today I decided to get a burrito because the last few times I got a bowl it was so overfilled you couldn't eat it without spilling stuff everywhere. Not neccesarily a bad thing, just annoying. So back to the burrito. I asked for less rice and beans but they still have me a lot anyways. I got steak, salsa, sour cream, corn, lettuce, and cheese. He guy rolling it seemed like he had never rolled a burrito in his life. I couldn't even unwrap it without it falling apart and even if I could there were multiple holes in the tortilla from him trying to roll it tight so the outside was covered in sour cream and stuff that leaked out. Chipotle should really take all the extra money from their ridiculous price increases recently to train their employees how to roll a burrito. Needless to say I ended up dumping everything into a bowl anyways.
