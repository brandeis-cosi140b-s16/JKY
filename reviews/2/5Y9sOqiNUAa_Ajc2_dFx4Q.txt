Salty Senorita has awesome atmosphere, easy location w/ tons of parking and is probably best for a happy hour and drinking spot. Their menu leaves a lot to be desired, and their restaurant appears to be infested with flies... I didn't have the best experience, but did have an OK time since the atmosphere is cool. I would go back with a big group, but I won't be back for dinner or lunch, specifically. 

TIPS
Great cheap happy hour
$1 shots
Queso dip is good
Lots of parking
