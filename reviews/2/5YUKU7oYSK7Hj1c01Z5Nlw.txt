Sub Par experience but food tasted good.  We visited here for lunch.  It was not busy but I had to track someone down to seat us.  The waitress sat me at a dirty table that was dirty from the night before.  The service took a while even though there were only a few customers.  The food did taste really good but was served to us just warm so it was cold before we could finish.  I may try it again but probably not
