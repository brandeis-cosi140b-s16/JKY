Sorry but I've had better burritos at Filiberto's at half the price and twice the size.  $14 for a Burrito the size of a mini taco.  You gotta be kidding me.  The $7.60 Macho Margarita should be called Watered Down Fruity Margarita. The complimentary chips were so thin they break into little pieces as soon as you touch them.   Very very disappointing.  However I did like their salsa and the service was excellent.
