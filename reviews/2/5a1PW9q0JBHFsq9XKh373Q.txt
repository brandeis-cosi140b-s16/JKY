I don't know how many stars to truly give this place.  The food was AMAZING! However, service during the day was sooooooooooo unbelievably slow.  As soon as our food came out we had to immediately ask for to go boxes because it took that long to get our food.  We then had to walk our money up to the bar to cash out and that still didn't help the situation.  Not a great place for lunch for people who have to return to work.  Will try to order ahead and pick up next time but will not recommend dine in during the day.
