Ever since I moved to Tempe 2 months ago I had driven past this place numerous times and kept wondering what their food would be like. My family and I finally decided we would go try it out. Definitely was not the fanciest place and inside it was full of smoke. Not a problem...at least I know they are cooking the meat right. I ordered the bean and cheese burrito with guacamole inside and America's way which meant it would have diced roasted jalapenos inside. They didn't have any sour cream which I thought was strange. The drink choices were also slim. 

Upon receiving my order, the XL bean and cheese burrito, I was a little disappointed because it didn't seem much bigger than a regular size burrito and yet it was like like $2 more. My burrito was just lukewarm and although I dont want it scalding hot it would be nice to have it warmer than what it was. By the time I was done eating it was definitely cold...quite disappointing again! My GF ordered the Chorizo burrito which she was very pleased with. Her only complaint was that everything was blended together that it was hard to distinguish the tastes of the ingredients. My dad ordered the Al pastor burrito and that was cold as well. :( My mom's carne asada burrito was lukewarm, but she seemed to be ok with it.

I'm hoping it was just a bad day for the crew as the place seemed like it would be good based on some of the reviews. It was slow and perhaps the crew was just slacking off that day...
