We went here because we were looking for another restaurant and couldn't find it. The parking was a little weird. We accidentally got on the highway trying get into the parking lot.

To start, the hostess a flat out cunt. I honestly think calling her a bitch would be giving her credit.

The server didn't arrive at the table for close to five minutes. The complimentary chips and salsa/dip didn't arrive until after he took our order for nachos. He recommended we try the new New Mexico Red Chili sauce on our food with chopped chilies if we like spicy food. We took the bait. I'll admit, the niceness of the server almost redeemed the cunt hostess.

The food was bland, however spicy and not bad, but not good either. We drove way out of way to find a restaurant we couldn't find and ended up here instead. Needless to say we won't be returning. The cunt at the front door and the food left a bad taste in my mouth. The server is the only reason I give Arriba a second star.
