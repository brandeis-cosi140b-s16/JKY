**Graphic TMI Alert**

OK, so basically this is a Chipotle type restaurant.  If you aren't familiar with Chipotle, where have you been for the past ten years because it is the greatest place on Earth?!  Burritos/tacos/taco salads.  S.R. is basically the same besides the fact that the food is much worse.  Bad guacamole, bad queso, and gross meats.  The only good things about this place were that it was clean, relatively cheap, and you don't have fiery "aftermath"  (Think about that one).   Honestly, I will pay the "Montezuma's Revenge" price for the deliciousness of Chipotle rather than going back here again.  

All that being said, I still ate my whole burrito and chips & guac.  It was only good because I was starving.  All I'm saying is... Use your cool new smart phone device thingy and type in C-H-I-P-O-T-L-E and drive to that dot instead.  Trust me!   Enjoy :)
