They are always slow. I can be the only person in the store and it takes twenty minutes to get my order. Yesterday I asked for a tostata and they gave me a tostata without any red sauce. I don't have a car so called to complain and asked to have the replaced and delivered to me they said no. They said to come in and they would replace.
