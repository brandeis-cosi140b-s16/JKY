It's Chipolte, which should mean good food at a reasonable price, but this location wasn't great. The service was okay, but the three people at the counter seemed easily overwhelmed, and only one seemed to know what she was doing. Plus they didn't really give me enough food in my burrito bowl; it was half full of lettuce by the time they were done.

The space is nice and big, but the bathrooms are resoundingly meh. The faucets on the sinks were confusing, and my cousin said the one in the ladies room was broken. I was not thoroughly impressed.
