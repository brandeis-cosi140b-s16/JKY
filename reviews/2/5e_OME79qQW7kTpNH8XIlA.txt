Not sure how long ago they moved but i went to the location on : 3202 South 40th Street, Phoenix, Arizona

* Barg's Red Cream Soda on the fountaiun !!!! Awesome = 1 star
* Machaca Chimi / Meat, excellent flavor well shredded with only one huge chunk,, = 1 star
* Machaca Chimi Tortilla barely crisped on the outisde only, inside doughy from the meat = 0 star
* Machaca Chimi toppings, had a Dusting of cheese :-( = 0 Star
* Country Music in a mexican restaurant = -5 stars (minus 5)
* order or sit down, not clear on a line process to order or go seat yourself not well orchestrated = 0 stars
* CHIPS 1.50 ? Little tray of chips to munch while you wait, seriously 1.50 = 0 Star

If I go back i will try something else, but probably for TAKE OUT, so i dont leave all miserable from the depressing ass country music.
 
Conveinent, definitely not a place to go anywhere out of your way for. Price was reasonable
