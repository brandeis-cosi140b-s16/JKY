The Rokerij is/was my favorite restaurant in town.  That is until recently...  a couple weeks ago I made a reservation mid week for one of the tables downstairs.  When I got there I was told it wasn't available.  The hostess wasn't rude but wasn't about to accomodate.  I reluctantly agreed to sit at a teable up stairs.  I ordered the usual, beef toasts, The Rokerij Steak - All winners in the past and the food I most brag about with friends and family.  Unfortunately the beef toasts were over cooked and the cheese wasn't melted.  Very disappointing as expectations are always high when eating here.  The food has always been great.  Worth the long wait to be seated.  But the steak, the item that frankly I compare all other steaks to, was another disappointment.  It came out at least a couple ounces smaller than normal and frankly just wasn't that good.  I'm willing to pay for a great steak.  Not sure what happened here but this meal fell way short of "great" status and was not worth the money spent.  Guys, I love this place and often take friends, colleagues from out of state to dine here.  But something is slipping.  Please get this under control.  I don't want to look for another favorite restaurant.  (but I will )
