This was our first visit to Federico's.  We were in the shopping center for something else but got a whiff of Mexican and decided to go in for a try.  Hadn't heard of this place before.  

We ordered a quesadilla and a tostada & enchilada combo.

Food was meh really.  Had to pay extra for pico de gallo, salsa bar was empty, no chips provided.  Wife's tostada was skimpy on cheese and the quesadilla should've been more I'd think for paying almost $4 for it.

There are a lot of Mexican food options in the valley, this one could definitely step things up in my opinion.  We decided we won't be back here when we could go somewhere else that has better flavor and prices for the portions.
