On my first visit to Chronic Tacos, I tried their chicken tacos. The meat was pretty salty and I was pretty underwhelmed by the meal. I had some coworkers rave about this place so I decided to give it another shot. Second visit, tried the carne asada tacos. Salty and dry. I think my coworkers were smoking some chronic when they ate here. That's the only explanation I can think of.
