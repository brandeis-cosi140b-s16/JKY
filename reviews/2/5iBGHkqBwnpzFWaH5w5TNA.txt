I was walking back and forth through downtown over a series of days and saw Madonna's. I made it a point to tell myself that I should stop in and get myself something to eat. I love Tex-Mex food and am always looking for new places to patronize. 

I stopped in during lunch and ordered a steak burrito with guacamole to go. When I received my order I immediately opened it to take a bite. I was immediately underwhelmed. I saw that they had some Tapatio and added it to the full course of my burrito and took my leave of the little corner store.

The best part of the burrito was the Tapatio that I added after the fact. The issues with it were myriad. My biggest issue was the utter lack of any taste. That's right, my burrito had no flavor. How do you make a steak burrito with guacamole and pinto beans without any flavor what-so-ever in any of the components? Not far behind that question was the fact that my steak burrito had almost no steak. It was all beans and guacamole. Don't get me wrong, I like beans and guacamole when they are properly made, but I ordered a STEAK burrito and not a bean burrito seasoned with a few pieces of meat.

I might try this place again to give it another chance, but I would stay away from the steak burrito and would most likely eat vegan that day just to see if the lack of flavor was situational.
