This place is a cluster f@*#. We got in the Adobada taco line because my husband wanted those. I wanted Carne Asada, So then we had to get in the Carne Asada line. How lame is that!? So while we are waiting for the Asada, the Adobada is getting cold. Thank God we didn't want a different type of taco that was in the third line. We asked if the same red sauce that is on the Adobada is on the Asada, we were told it was. Then we get the tacos and walk over to yet another line, the Pay Line. Turns out they did not put the same red sauce on my tacos. They put on some chunky ass tomato stuff on top. I can't stand that stuff. NO WAY I was waiting in that line again so I didn't get to eat. My husband ate my tacos. I did however taste the Adobada taco, not bad but it's not worth all the praise this place gets.
