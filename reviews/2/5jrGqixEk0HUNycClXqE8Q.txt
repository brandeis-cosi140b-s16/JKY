We had a Groupon that had to be used at this location. A little out of our way, but we like Don Pedro. Unfortunately it will probably be our first and last time there. The restaurant was very nice, and the staff very friendly, but the kitchen wasn't on their game. Hubby ordered 2 Burritos - one beef, one chicken - both came out chicken. I ordered the ground beef burrito - also came out chicken. Maybe they were out of beef and thought we wouldn't notice.
