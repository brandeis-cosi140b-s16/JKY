I eat here from time to time because it's close to my house.  The last time I was here I ordered the carne asada super burrito, it was good, filled with meat in every bite, not today!  This place is as so unpredictable with the quality and quantity of the food it's ridiculous!!!  The middle of the burrito had NO MEAT!!!  Seriously! !  Not sure if I will be coming back because I don't know what to expect.   What is really sad is if the owners actually read these reviews,  good and bad, they don't give a shit about the bad ones, because you never hear from them.......
