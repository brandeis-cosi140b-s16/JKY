Ate here the other day.  The food wasn't bad but it wasn't awesome either.  Mediocre at best.  Slightly disappointing based upon the other reviews but I guess we're just spoiled from all of the good taqueria's in Cali.  

We tried a few different tacos.  Tinga was like soggy pulled pork, Carbon and pollo tacos were okay.  Guacamole was delish but the chips tasted like they were fried in old oil.  I won't be rushing back.
