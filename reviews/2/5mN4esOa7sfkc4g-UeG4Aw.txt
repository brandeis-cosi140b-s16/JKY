I eat 3-4 times a week at Chipotle, so not new to Chipotle. But at this location, the staff are very inconsistent with the quantity of meat/chicken, I have had times when i barely got 2-3 oz of meat in my bowl/burrito. Went there today and i had half a spoon of chicken in my bowl. If only they would not be so stingy about meat/chicken, i would have no complaints about this place. Please get your staff to read the quantity to be served from the Chipotle website and help them understand it (if they can).

For now, might just skip this location and go to the one on Maryland.
