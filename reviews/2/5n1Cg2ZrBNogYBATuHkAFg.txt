The food here as okay, nothing incredible, but average Mexican food here in the suburbs of Charlotte.  Our main issue was the waitstaff which basically was non-existent the late afternoon we dined in.  We waited about 45 minutes for our dinners, and before that about 15 for drinks/chips/salsa.  We only ordered waters so it wasn't a difficult drink order or anything.  We almost got up and left but we noticed the people next to us were getting attention so we figured our service would change, but it did not.  It was not a busy rush time or anything either so it was incredibly frustrating.  When we mentioned how long we'd been waiting and were curious to why the waitress looked confused and walked off.  We waited about 15 minutes to get our check and left.  Other than the horrible service we experienced, the food was fine, we may or may not go back here.
