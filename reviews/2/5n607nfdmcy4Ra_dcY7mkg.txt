Maybe I should have had the fish!

My friend and I stopped by for a quick bite and a rest from the Black Friday shopping frenzy. I had the carne asada tacos and a Mojito and she had the chicken tacos w/ a Margarita, we were both disappointed with the quality of food. The chicken was dry and bland, the carne asada was more like a thick medium rare steak chopped up into pieces, soooo not - what I was expecting. The rice and beans were okay but the chips and salsa were the savior of our meal. The Mojito could have been better, it was strong and not enough mint. Don't get me wrong, I love strong drinks, but I am not looking to get drunk of one drink in the middle of the day. The Margarita on the other hand was "delicious".

I am liking the decor, it's like a place you would see in Miami or anywhere by the ocean. They have a few walls that are garage doors with glass, I am assuming they will open these up in the summer. 

The service was excellent and since they have only been open a couple of months, I am definitely going to keep my eyes open on this place, I think or hope they will improve their menu.
