I'd like to give a couple stars for the quality of the food but it's hard to judge the quality when they can't get your meal right....

This location is super busy & it looks relatively clean, that's about as far as I want to dig into it..... You ever get that feeling like your not wanted- well thats the impression I got from the lady at the counter. Felt like I was bothering her with my presence. Ordered a beef chimichanga and she confirmed my chicken chimi order so I had to specify beef. Ordered a couple rolled taco meals & sum hard tacos-all with rice & beans. With every item she asked "is that it" NO, we would like to continue ordering if possible..... read back the order and somehow we had a chicken chimi at the top of the list. had to revise that for a 3rd time. We specified rice & beans with all the meals. "OK, in come with it" A couple minutes later we received our order and good thing we did a quality check. Only the Chimi had rice & beans..... So of course we went back up to the counter and the lady then said-"you want a side of rice & beans? That will cost you....." REALLY??? We asked for rice & beans with every meal. Promised we would get rice & beans, got our order NO RICE & BEANS! Now we have to pay for it. 

I like a Filiberto meal every once in a while but this place JUST PLAIN SUCKS! You know what else, I showed the lady my phone with my whopping $.50 YELP discount and of course she blew me off and didn't apply it. Why offer a cheesy .50 discount if your not going to honor it. It's only .50 but the snowball effect of their epic customer service entitles me to cry a little about everything.
