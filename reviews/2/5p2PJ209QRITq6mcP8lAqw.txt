We were in on Thur night.  2 other tables around 8:30 pm.

Decor is rather strange for a Mexican Restaurant.  Didn't feel very authentic.

Price, the $5 margaritas were ok but a michelada served in a wine sized glass and you didn't get the rest of the beer.  We did tapas and they weren't bad.

Service was really slow though.  Took 10 min just to get water and remember it was slow.

Overall, the experience was ok at best. Too many other good places to eat.
