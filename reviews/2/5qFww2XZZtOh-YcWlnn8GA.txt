Based on previous Reviews here, I had high hopes of something unique and different.

Felt wonderful and warm  inside with strolling Mariachis and a festive mood. Service was impeccable!

Unfortunately, the food was only okay. It seemed that much of the menu is served "Fajitas Style" (my words, not theirs) and the Shrimp, peppers and onions were nothing special, plus the portions I thought were small (eight medium sized shrimp). No "knock you over" flavors in this dish and the best thing about the meal was the wonderfully done rice.

Won't repeat as my disappointment will not go away any time soon.
