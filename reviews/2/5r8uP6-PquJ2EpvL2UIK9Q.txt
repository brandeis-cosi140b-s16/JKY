I went here Sunday night for dinner, I have been here a number of times throughout the years and I guess I go back because of the convenience. However, whenever I go back I just can't find myself impressed with the food or the decor, the restaurant feels like a cafeteria.  The tamales are decent, pretty good for Las Vegas. I had the two tamale combo for $11.99, including rice and beans and soup or salad. I chose the albondigas which was homemade meatballs but a bit salty. Drinks were refilled promptly and without comment as to how many ice teas were drunk, which I appreciate but just overall I think that this definitely falls into the "meh..." Category as far as the food for me. I would probably rank it more of a 2 1/2.
