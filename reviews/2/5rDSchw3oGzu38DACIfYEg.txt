Had the fish tacos and would rate them a 4. Queso for an app and it was ok. So food a three or four overall.

I was dining alone so I sat at the bar. Once I received my food attention time was over. Couldn't get a beverage refill. Couldn't get my check to pay. I was paying by credit card or else I would have just left cash on the bar and left. Since I'm in the service industry I always, always, always tip. This is the first ever that I've even considered not tipping. Still left 15% but I don't know why.

To many other options in the area to ever return. Skip it and enjoy good service by going elsewhere.
