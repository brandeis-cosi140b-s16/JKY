I can assure you that there are much better places to eat Mexican food. I can also assure you that there are places with much better service and real authentic food. It's too pricey for its service and variety. It took them about 45 minutes to bring out the food my family orderd and when they finally did bring the food it turned they didn't have what I had asked for and asked me if I would order something else witch took a another 20 minutes to bring out. The quality of the food was good but this is not authentic Mexican food. (I'm Mexican) If you want 5 star service and real authentic Mexican food go to "The Original Lindo Michoacan." If you don't have a better experience I'll have to bite my own finger off.
