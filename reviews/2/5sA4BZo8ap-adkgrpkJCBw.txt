Good start and has potential, BUT I was only halfway through my soup when the waitress walked up and took it away. It was my main course. When she came back and I asked told what happened she went back to the kitchen to get me more and brought me a bowl of broth that looked like watered down salsa. My original soup had chicken, rice, and avocado. She charged me for it and I left hungry. Hopefully the place gets it's act together because the soup that I ate was quite good.
