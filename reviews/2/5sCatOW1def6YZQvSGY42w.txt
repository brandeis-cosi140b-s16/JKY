I love Macayo's but not this location.  Went in the other night and the service was terrible.  The food was so so and the whole environment just seemed like we were bothering them by being there.  Every staff member we encountered was rude.  We sat outside on the patio which is dirty for being a restaurant especially.  Happy to go to many of the other locations but won't be returning to this one.
