Um, usually I do not have any challenges at any Chipotle, but I guess theres a first for everything...  I went there to pick up something for lunch on my way to work.  The people behind the counter were not on their A game that day.  I just got there in time, minutes before the lunch crowd came.  First gal was nice, second gal that did the salsa/condiments seemed like I was ruining her day by having her work, and finally the cashier gal was frazzled (and it wasn't busy yet).  I ended up getting charged double and it took about 8+ minutes for a manager to come refund me.  Now, given I really wasn't paying attention to the total when I gave her my card, but realized that the total was too much (it's what I pay when my husband and I go to lunch there, so I think that's why it didn't phase me at first).  

Now enters the manager/supervisor of some type.  She was ok and not very communicative, by now the cashier was super frazzled and about 10 people had already came and went.  There were also about 10 people or so in line waiting.  Manager takes my card and proceeds to train the cashier on how to do a refund (still did not say a word to me)... DURING LUNCH RUSH... I would have done the refund really quick (if I was the manager) and told the cashier that I would show her AFTER the lunch rush.  Refund done and no apology or anything.  Then I started to walk away and the cashier hurriedly says "I apologize," half-heartedly.  Still nothing from the manager...
