So, we received at $20 off coupon in the mail and decided to give it a try.  Let's just say...it's been some months since then and we haven't been back...the only time this place has popped up on my radar was when a co-worker was talking about their lackluster experience, too.

The service was fine.  It was the food that got me.  I ordered cheese enchilada's and my girlfriend ordered the chicken enchilada's.  Now, I expected cheese...but I didn't think I was going to have to go on a search mission to locate the tortillas. My girlfriend was equally displeased with her meal. The sangria I ordered was the only saving grace...not good enough to return, though...
