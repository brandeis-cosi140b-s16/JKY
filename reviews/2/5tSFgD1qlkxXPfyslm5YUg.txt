We had a little extra time during our layover to grab some dinner but couldn't go too far, so our options were pretty limited.  I was in the mood for Chinese, but the restaurant didn't look like it had much for vegetarians.  Wendy's is out of the question.  So that left us with El Bravo.

I want to thank them for having several veg options on their menu (although I forgot to double check if the beans were really ok for vegetarians).  My husband and I both ordered bean burritos, one with red sauce and the other with green.

Sorry, El Bravo, but it really wasn't very good.  Nothing was fresh and I didn't care for the taste of anything.  I was so uninterested in my burrito I didn't finish it (a rarity for me).

Thanks for the veg options, but the bean burritos and sauces can use a little bit of love.  Also, you might want to get the airport to invest in more seating- it's uncomfortable eating in that tiny space.
