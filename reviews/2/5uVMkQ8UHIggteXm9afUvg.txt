This place kinda sucked. We went araound lunch time so it was almost at full capacity I fig it would be ok since it was full and all. It looked like there was 2 people working here. I give props to the mex girl cooking all the food. It's cafeteria errrr um Subway style mexican food they ask you what you want and add it to your burro or w/e you get a tray and sit. I had a veggie burrito which was basically rice and your choice of black or pinto beans they did have 3 tortilla's to choose from. It was a pretty big burrito and fairly good but nothing special. The kid had a chicken quesadilla which was tiny they put like maybe a tablespoon of chicken in it with a side of cinnamon chips they gave her like 4 chips and a small ftn drink not very much for the 4.25 kids meal if you ask me. Their Salsa bar was disgusting with wilted cilantro, salsa's, limes and lemon's. The only plus here is the drinks! They serve good beer here Modelo, dos XX, Cuervo rita's, and even 99 cent margaritas everyday which I did not try. They also had fountain jugos. I may go back next time but more for the drinks.
