Classic example of people thinking that a hole in the wall place that is super ghetto must be good because it is a secret from everyday society..... NOT.  Tortillas are good but that's where the praise ends. I had a burrito and I swear I could make a better one myself with a can of chicken and enchilada sauce. Throw in microwave. Served! Next time I'll save the 6 bucks.
