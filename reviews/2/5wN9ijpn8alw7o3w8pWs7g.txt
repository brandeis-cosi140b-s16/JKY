I was very hopeful for this place. I ordered the carne adovada and my honey ordered the stacked enchiladas. He said I should give it a one, but I have definitely experienced worse, overall. The waiter was good, he brought us everything and it was all correct. He only forgot to bring me an extra tortilla, but later remembered toward the end of my meal. And on the topic of that, the tortillas were pretty bad. Definitely mass produced right here in the factories of the good ol US of A. My adovada was chile-y.. is that a word? It tasted just like chile powder. And the enchiladas were nothing to brag about. Honey hated them. No one was overly nice, although the setting was cute. Kids liked their chicken quesadilla. But they're kids. And it's a quesadilla. 
I can't bring myself to giving this place any more than a 2 star. Maybe I just had too high of hopes for this place... eh...
