YUCK!  The Baka burrito was COLD!  It had mole sauce instead of ranchero sauce and they just can't seem to find RIPE TOMATOES!  Even though the meat was cold the bite or two I had the meat was pretty decent. Maybe Baja Fresh will get their act together. If you can do that I will be back. I won't patronize this establishment again until probably July.  To be fair, they did refund my money for a second time in as many attempts.
