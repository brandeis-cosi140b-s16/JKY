I should have read the recent bad reviews before stopping in for lunch today. I used to be a big fan of baja fresh but this location is disappointing to say the least. First, I ordered a baja burrito bowl (which I've ordered many times before). It's basically a burrito without the tortilla. I received a salad - no rice! I didn't check my order until I got back to my office (ugh).

Second, I usually love their baja salsa. But the one I had today was literally 4 times as spicy as usual. I could barely eat it! 

My entire lunch was ruined. Won't be going back to this location. As others have said, it's no wonder they were empty during the peak lunch hour.
