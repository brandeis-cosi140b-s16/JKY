I know I know is not Gallo Blanco but..... not happy...the  food huevo con chorizo it was good but the coffee tasted burned...service is really bad they didn't offered us more  drinks we ordered our favorite flapjacks  almost 20 mns after we finished our food the flapjacks still didn't arrive to the table..... not sure if I'll give it another chance.....I expected too much from it :(
