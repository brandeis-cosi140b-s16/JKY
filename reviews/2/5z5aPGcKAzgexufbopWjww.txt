Food was great, but the wait staff left much to be desired.  The man at the register (long-time employee, been here for years) was very unfriendly, even seemed bothered to have to take our order.  I'd rather visit a restaurant where the food isn't as great than feel as though I'm unwanted.  Won't be back for a long time!
