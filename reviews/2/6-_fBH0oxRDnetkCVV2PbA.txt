While the food wasn't bad...but not real good either, their drinks were VERY weak, probably because it was happy hour. My friend and I had 2-3 margaritas each, a shot each, and a beer each and never felt buzzed or anything. I'm guessing they give you about half the regular alcohol during happy hour. Tasted like we were just drinking Margarita mix and fruit punch.
