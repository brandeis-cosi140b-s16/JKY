I have eaten at a few other locations in the past and never thought that is was great food. This location pops up and out of convenience for a quick salad I stop by. 

I will tell you one thing about going here...Check Your Order before you go. I don't even bother with drive thru anymore. The two times that I did I had to go back because my order was missing an item and my order was wrong and just plain awful. 

When going inside be prepared to be there a good 15 min no matter what. Service is slow and I'm not sure they have a groove yet being that they are only a couple months in. The staff discord is almost embarrassing at times. They argue with each other(it happened last night) and they seem lost when I've asked questions regarding their products. 

Like I said, I go for a salad and it's super close when I don't want to cook. The store is clean because it's brand new. We will see if that stays as a standard.
