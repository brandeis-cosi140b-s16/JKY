Have been here a bout 6 times in the last month. I order a bowl with white rice, black beans, onions/g pepps, chicken, cheese, sour cream, a side of their vinaigrette, and sometimes a sprinkle of lettuce, depending if I'm pretending to be healthy and eat a salad. The first time I ordered, I couldn't believe how good it was. Each time I have gone, it has gotten slightly worse. This last time I was thoroughly disappointed. The bowl wasn't even filled. There was only 2/3 of the bowl filled, and the vinaigrette was not 'right'. It had a chemical taste to it and was really spicy. Normally I can get two meals out of the bowl, but this time I ate the whole thing and was still a little hungry. The bowl isn't too expensive. I understand they need tokens profit, but besides the meat and cheese, the other ingredients literally cost almost nothing. The most expensive cost to them is the container. At least fill the bottom of the bowl with the rice, a cheap filler that gives the illusion that it's a full bowl. I understand if you are trying to save $ by skimping on the product. Pinching pennies here or there adds up I guess. But if you ultimately lose that customer, your idea backfires on you.
