The food is eatable, although it tends to fall heavily on your stomach. Fairly mediocre overall, although not disgusting. 

But why, why do the waiters feel the need to clean the table in the small space with very strong cleaning products while you are eating? why? This says a lot about the way they view the quality of their own food.
