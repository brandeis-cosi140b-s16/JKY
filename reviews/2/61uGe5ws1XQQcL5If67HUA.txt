I just can't get pass eating off of Styrofoam or paper plates. It ruins any experience for me unless it's a picnic, BBQ, or at the beach. Otherwise, give me a plate and some silverware! I ordered the cheese enchiladas and the cheese was not melted. I did enjoy the shredded beef burrito I had to go the next day.
