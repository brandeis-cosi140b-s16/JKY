La Condesa, I give up on you. We try and try to excuse the terrible service, but no more. It's not worth it. It's too slow and inattentive and they just don't give a damn, so I'll take my $33 elsewhere.

This time we were disappointed by the food, too. We returned our horchata for being too thin and tasteless, and you brought us new ones after we finished eating. You drizzled a pretty crema all over the top of my torta (sorry, lonche). How do I pick it up and eat it? 

In the past we forgave the dirty tables and loudness because your cochinita pibil was pure bliss. But not even that makes up for the service. :(
