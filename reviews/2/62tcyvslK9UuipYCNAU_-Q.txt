Let me start by saying I live near this location.  After about 2 years of visiting there on and off I am finally going to right a negative review.  While the food itself seems to taste okay.  Getting your order correctly and being charged the right price seems to be and on going problem.  I realize because most of their business seems to come from travelers that they sadly have no desire to fix these issues.  If you do eat there always check you order and make sure you have everything.  If you need forks, napkins, sauce,make sure its in the bag before you leave the parking lot.  Also check what they charge you, verse what is on the menu you board!  It has not been the same on several occasions.  In one case I questioned why a $5.00 item was $7.57 she told me tax!!  Finally I was told the price had been raised but not changed on the menu board and no one else ever asked them about it!!! 
My last visit I drive thru and ordered exactly as it states on the menu- The 500 calorie Chicken Mango Grilled Tostada.  I tell the girl again its from the 500 calorie menu, to double check she understands.  She tries to upsell me on the meal, I say no.  I get to window, and she hands me a salad(no tortilla on the bottom).  I thought she was accidentally handing me someone else food.  So I said I that's not mine, I had the Blah, Blah.  She snipes back at me "That is what I ordered!"  I ask for the manager.  Manager comes over and we have words.  Girl is yelling in the background "That's what she ordered!"   Manager tells me they don't make what I ordered any more, they only make those new salads now.   He gave me my money back.  
That is my last visit to this location.  There is another one not to far from me, I don't have any trouble there.
