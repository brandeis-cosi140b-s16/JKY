Papa Chevo's was a quick stop from an outing night for me.  Though I was still coherent so no excuses on my part.

Place was dead, but being the night was still young I'm sure this place can get overwhelmed.  I ordered the beef Sopes with rice and beans.  Overall, nothing to special in my Mexican food repertoire.  I thought it was pretty simplistic and what I would expect; Fried corn tortilla, topped with refried beans, lettuce, tomatoes, sour cream, and cheddar cheese.  

In the end, I thought it was nothing out of the box, but something I can ingest if I was really hungry. - Enjoy!
