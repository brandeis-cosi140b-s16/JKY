I visited Habanero's on a Sunday afternoon with a party of four.   We were surprised how busy they were at that time and that's usually a good sign. Not so much this time though. 

What we ordered:  two carne asada burros, one enchillada style.  One bean/cheese burro.  One carne asada taco and one carnitas taco. 

1. We weren't really greeted when we came in, but people were waiting at the counter to order so we followed suit.  Turns out that you can also sit and they'll come and take your order.  It was very confusing and we weren't the only ones feeling this way.
2. We awaited over 30 minutes for our food!  That is not acceptable at a place like this.  They weren't THAT busy.  
3. Those that say that the carne asada is the best they've had need to get out and try some other places.  It was some of the worst I've had.  There wasn't any real flavor in the meat and it was very tough.  There also was very little meat compared to the amount of other stuff they filled the burro with.  
4. The "enchillada style" burro had something red (maybe enchillada sauce, who knows) smeared across the top (spritzed on may be a better term) and a dab of cheese.  Where I come from, enchillada style means it's swimming in sauce and melted cheese. 
5. The carnitas taco was very good, but they REALLY skimp on the filling (as another review has also pointed out).  
6. The carne asada taco was pathetic.  It was just a little carne asada meat covered in lettuce....and that's it.  No pico or sauce or tomato or avacado.  
7. The beans in the bean burro were actually really good and seemed home made.  It could have used a little more salt, but I'm just being picky now. 
8. The girls that brought out the food and cleaned up our plates were very friendly and they apologized more than once for the long wait.  They even provided a 15% coupon for next time.  Unfortunately, due to the quality and value of the food I won't be back.
