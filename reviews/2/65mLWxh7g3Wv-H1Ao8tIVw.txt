The employees were very pleasant & service was prompt. The carne asada burrito was pretty good. I little too salty but overall pretty tasty. However the rolled tacos had no flavor at all. The meat & guacamole had no taste, the beans it came with didn't have any flavor either. The only thing that tasted decent was the rice. Even the hot sauce was tasteless. I really wanted to like this place but my food was too disappointing. Unfortunately, next time I'll have to stick with my original plan of going to Del Taco, haha.
