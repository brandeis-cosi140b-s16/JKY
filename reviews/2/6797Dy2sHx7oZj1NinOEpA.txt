I love the food, but I've had it with online ordering; which is why I'm not giving them 4 or 5 stars. DO NOT ORDER ONLINE!!!

This is the 5th time they screw up mine and my friends' order. My friend Pre ordered his Steak Bowl from Chipotle this location on 54th street. Which always has a line out the door. 

Order:
White Rice, Steak, Blk Beans, Pinto Beans, Veggies, Medium Salsa and Cheese (simple)

What he got:
Brown rice, Blk Beans, Medium Salsa.

As it was a to-go, we did not notice this until after we got back to the office.
