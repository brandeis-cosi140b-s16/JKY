Food was cold. No chicken or steak  had to wait for employees to finish their conversations before giving the lady making the food the meat. Wanted chicken but didn't feel like waiting another 5 min fir my food. Had to wait longer since the front end ran out of cups then employee decided to have a conversation before bringing out the cups
Update still bad service. maybe they need to train better. employees prefer to have social hour then help the guests in their store
