I would like to start off by saying the food is amazing. Great variety of salsas and the food has a nice twist compared to a normal robertos . But ( there is always a but ) the service is awful . Very rarely do they get my order right and it always takes forever to receive your order. The thing that makes me the most upset about this place is that they are never open! There is a huge sign outside that says " drive thru open until 1am" . We go there multiple times a month after work at night around 11pm and they are never open . Sometimes the lights are on but they will tell us they are closed. If they are closing earlier they need to take the sign down . Very misleading and rude to customers.
