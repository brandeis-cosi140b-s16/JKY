We kept our menu simple, started off with chips and salsa, main dishes were carne asada and a veggie burrito.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good.  The seasonings were lacking or salty, the beans had the too smooth lardy texture, and salsa was a bit weak.  I've only tried the restaurant once, so I'll give it another try and leave it at that for now...
