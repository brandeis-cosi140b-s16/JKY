My family and i usually go to the one in Tucson but when my husband heard they opened one in Phoenix we thought we'd try it . It wasnt what we expected we waited for our food for about 35 mins they're customer service wasnt good either they werent friendly at all . at least the hot dogs were good . we'll give it another try this weekend.
