A few weeks ago, I was on a nacho kick.  I came here for lunch one day and decided to try out some nachos.  I ordered the Caramba Super Nachos with Chicken.  I had a water to drink.  Total was right around $8.00.  They give you a little bowl of chips with your order.  I paid the lady my money and then took a seat.  A few minutes later, my nachos were up.  Here is how they were............

Caramba Super Nachos-  Before my nachos were even ready, I was really digging on their chips.  They are thin, crispy and pretty darn delicious.  I soon realized that these were HORRIBLE chips for nachos though.  They were too thin and broke apart way too easily.  These nachos were topped with the usual toppings like cheese, beans, pico, sour cream, guacamole etc.  They came with 2 types of cheese....shredded and nacho.  I'm not the biggest fan of nacho cheese on taco shop nachos.  I prefer just shredded cheese.  The nacho cheese tasted ok though so it wasn't nasty.  The chips were really a killer though.  I probably only had about 5-10 chips that I could actually scoop stuff up with.  The rest of the chips were too flimsy, broke in half, or were covered with toppings.  I gave up pretty quick and grabbed my fork, mixed everything together and ate it like it was a nacho salad.  The chicken they use is a little funky too.  I'm pretty sure its boiled.  It didn't have much flavor and was too "wet".  I picked around most of it.

Overall, not the least bit impressed.  I doubt I am coming back to try out any of their other offerings.  It wasn't gross/disgusting food, and I did eat most of the nachos,  but for the price and taste, I will be heading elsewhere in the future.
