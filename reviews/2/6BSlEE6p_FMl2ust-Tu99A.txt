I love Taco Bell. I'm a Taco Bell freak. I live very close to this location, and they have never gotten my order correct. I ordered a bean burrito, I got a potato burrito. My taco had absolutely no meat in it. My taco salad had no beans. All of these were never resolved because I go through the drive through and by the time I get home I do not want to travel all the way back. They should take more time to get the orders correct and make sure they are giving out better quality food.
