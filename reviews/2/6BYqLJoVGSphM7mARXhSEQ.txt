Meh. The place is good.  Their salsa is no good though and that is the main reason I never crave this place.  Their California burrito and breakfast burritos are good though.  I hardly crave or request this place but it's edible and I wouldn't turn it down if someone wanted to go there.  There's better is all.  Casual inside and you order at the counter.
