I'm not a fan I'm trying to figure or what I didnt like.  Could be the quality of the ingredients. Maybe not the freshest. Like chipolte it tasted very salty.  I think I prefer chipolte.  I had a beef burrito. Maybe I like fresh carne asada.  Even filbertos has better flavor beef. The diet coke was very good.  I hated the hot salsa.
