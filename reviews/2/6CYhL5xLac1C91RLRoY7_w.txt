The food was delicious (had the sauteed shrimp and scallop), but the food was overpriced.

The waiter was rude. He made a side comment, and I told his manager. The waiter came back and apologize and saying it is a joke, but we know it wasn't. He made plenty of excuses making it sound like it was our fault for wanting bread and that they did not expect a big party. Hello, big party means business. Extremely upset.
