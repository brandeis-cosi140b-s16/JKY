Food is average, not the best, not the worst.  Promptly seated, chips, salsa, drink order taken right away.

Two different visits, two different servers, months agpart - both forgot to place 1 of the 2 orders that my party of 2 placed.  Not overly busy either time during lunch, so really no excuse for it.
