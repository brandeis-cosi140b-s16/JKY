N/A. Or, María. I'm betting someone somewhere involved with this Roberto's Taco Shop is named María. Let's just say María. Yep: María.

In A Sentence™ 
Do not -- under any circumstances -- get the maximum permitted twelve [12] dollar tacos on Taco Wednesday and try to eat them yourself.

I used to live near this Roberto's. (Don't ask.) How is this germane: I used to come here habitually. Never had a problem; however, I also never tried the chicken tacos at all. Fast forward two leap years: I find myself on this side of the valley one night and I figure why the fuck not. 

Well: I'll tell you right here why the fuck not!

You might end up on your knees begging for, oh forgive me please, when you're a non-theist.  

Don't do it. Don't get the maximum allowed (per customer) dozen dollar tacos and attempt to consume them all. You'll be sorry. You'll also lose more than a dozen U.S. pounds. That's several kilos for those on the world's system.

Don't do it. 

Get a burrito or something. 

Don't say that no one warned you.
