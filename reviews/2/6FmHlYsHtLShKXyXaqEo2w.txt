Don't waste your time.  This was quite bland for Mexican food and I was so disappointed.  I got a carnitas, carne asada & pollo taco and none of them warranted more than a couple of stars.

Also, my grandfather had the fish taco and it was very "crispy." And by crispy I mean burnt to a barely edible level.

I'd recommend another joint.
