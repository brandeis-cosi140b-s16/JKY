Stopped by here for lunch on my way through Charlotte international airport. I usually stop at the Chili's Too which is just a few steps away, but wanted to try something new.   The service was quick and friendly, but beyond that there was very little else that was good. I ordered the Mexican Chopped Salad with Grilled Chicken. It was basically a pile of very old, wilted,  turning-brown lettuce with a bland, unappetizing-in-appearance chicken breast on top.  I asked for Ranch dressing instead of the creamy tomato dressing that comes standard with this salad, and got two to-go packets of Ken's Steakhouse Lite Ranch (which, now having tried, I do NOT recommend). Beverage was unsweetened iced tea with lemon-just on the ok side of stale.  I am very picky about the freshness of my iced tea.

Atmosphere was crowded and loud.

Check came back wrong, and it took a manager to come fix it which they did quickly and cheerfully. 

But sadly an overall below average lunch. I won't be back. :(
