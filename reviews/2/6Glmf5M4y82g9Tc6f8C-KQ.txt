If you like grease, check it out! They serve grease in all forms at this fine establishment -- glistening on the surface of shreds and slabs of quivering meats, whipped into a slime and drizzled atop grilled-flesh-covered french fries, plastered on walls and windows and employees' faces...you can even get your grease as a sort of lacquer coating on grilled onions and jalapenos! They serve ALL FOUR grease food groups here!

If you're an unhealthful, grease-lapping fatass, you'll dig it. But if you're a fitness-obsessed health nut who happens to be drunk and stumbling down the street at 3am, you'll like it too... shamefully enough.

The best thing here is the people watching. It's ALWAYS packed with an amazing assortment of Mexican families, couples, kids, chunties and cholos. Even at 3am, there are familias with little kids sitting around eating and laughing and bullshitting! 

Since I find the food so abhorrent, I prefer to do my watching from the street, looking through the giant plate-glass windows at the hordes of obese people shoving greasy strips of meat into their greasy pieholes. It's like watching the Mexican version of Caligula, without all the Penthouse Pets.

On the plus side, the staff is VERY friendly, even to drunken gueras like me. But even that won't really get me to come back here...unless I happen to be stumblingly drunk and starving in the immediate vicinity. And I live right down the block....

D'OH!
