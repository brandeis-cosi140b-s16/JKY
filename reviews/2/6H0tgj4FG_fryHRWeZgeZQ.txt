There's a pretty large parking lot at this location so you'll always fine a place to park. However, this place is always packed and understaffed. The line is always backed up because service is so slow! Be prepared to wait a while during lunch and dinner hours. This Chipotle location is also pretty stingy about their portions too. Ask for extra of everything when you can!

TIP: If you don't want to waste your time waiting you can order online and skip the line. Just go to the cashier to pickup your order. 

I would recommend going to the Chipotle on Baum. The service is MUCH faster.
