I expect a lot more from Chipotle. I don't know if it's because it's so near a college campus, but the quality here is pathetic compared to every other Chipotle I've been to. The meat is often cold, the rice is hard (likely leftover) at lunch time. The chips are stale/hard/thick and not the light freshly-fried taste that other stores have. The guacamole is just avocado, and nothing else; I've ordered it three times and got only avocado.

I've made complaints through their corporate office and the quality continues to disappoint. I wish there were another Chipotle close to me that I could eat at instead.
