Oh, Cinco. What a disappointment. I went on a Friday evening with the boyfriend. The restaurant was full of older couples dining and high school kids working. It reeked of booze and cigarette smoke. Although I didn't see anyone smoking inside, there were some patrons with cigarette packs, so I'm not surprised at the smell.

We were seated at a table awkwardly set in front of the hallway to the kitchen, so people were walking past our table constantly--not very intimate. The hostess was nice enough, but she handed a menu to my date first--isn't the rule "ladies first?" Maybe he looked hungry.

Charging for chips and salsa? Super tacky. My strawberry margarita wasn't bad, but it started tasting very salty about halfway through. The meal was good--no complaints about the food. It was nice and uncomplicated. We spent about $50 for chips and salsa, two entrees and two margaritas. That price would be appalling back home in Texas, but that's another conversation. Sorry, Cinco, but I won't be back!
