I read in the paper this morning that La Palapa was supposed to be minimal and authentic but it is really just the opposite. The staff was very friendly, and yes they are mexican but I believe they truly want to please the American palate. 

The food was not authentic whatsoever. I ordered beef tongue tacos. The tongue itself was really delicious and tender. However, an authentic taco only comes with onion and cilantro on it - this taco had fucking rice on it, as well as cheese, sour cream, and pico de gallo. It was really excessive and unappetizing, especially if you have ever experienced authentic Mexican food.

I also ordered a chorizo and potato quesadilla. It was hot and crispy, but it wasn't even chorizo - more like some ground meat seasoned like chorizo.. not even that spicy which was also disappointing - and I know it is a quesadilla but the cheese was really heavy.

As a Mexican-American restaurant it would be really good, but to call it authentic is bullshit.
