While the food here is pretty good, the customer service is lacking tremendously. Just went in today and ordered Two LUNCH combos @ 5.99. The lady charged us 7.99. I told her that we ordered the lunch menu combos and she said yes they are 7.99. Even though that is NOT what the drive up menu says. So I asked for a take out menu. Confirming the prices, I took the receipt and menu inside and told them what happened. The cashier proceeds to tell me that  I might have heard wrong but they'll fix it anyway. Then he says in order to get my what, $5 refund, that I need to go out to my car, get the food and they need to take out the extra amount because the lunch specials are smaller portions. Are you kidding me??? Any good service skills know that that is unacceptable. And you lost a returning customer.
