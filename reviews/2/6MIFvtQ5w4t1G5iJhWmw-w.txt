I have been coming here every Friday to happy hour and listen to  the live band. They always have the tables outside reserved and the place is empty??? WTF? Went there for Cinco de Mayo and paid $5 for cover, went to the outside tables, which were empty and reserved for 2 hours later and we could not sit there? Pissed me off and left and got our money back. Not going back again. What a joke...
