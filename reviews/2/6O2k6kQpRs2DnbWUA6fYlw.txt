I've been here many times before and I usually get the Carne Asada Fries/Chips. They are the bomb when you're drunk!

Today I stopped by to get a Carne Asada Burrito. The cashier asked me if I wanted everything on it. I said yes. I asked her if it came with cheese and sour cream. She said no, it comes with guacamole pico de gallo. I said everything and I want to add cheese and sour cream. 

I get home and start eating the burrito. It only had carne asada, beans and cheese. I guess I was suppose to ask for rice, but they did forget my guacamole, pico de gallo and sour cream. 

I should have just ordered the Carne Asada Fries/Chips like I usually do.
