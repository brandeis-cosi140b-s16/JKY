The food here is fairly tasty and the service is good.  Mainly, I lowered the rating because of the ridiculous pricing.  I am from a border town in Texas where just about anything on Lindo's menu would sell for $12 or less.  A plate of chile Verde shouldn't be 20$.  We aren't on the strip and there is no valet parking.  The only way I would consider going back is for lunch, where many of their plates are nearly half price.  The portions aren't extraordinary either.  If you're a tourist from the midwest and Mexican food is scarce, you will love this place.  Personally I'd go across the street to the restaurant in the La Bonita grocery store and stop by the bakery on the way out.
