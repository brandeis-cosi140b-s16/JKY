Bad service, always dirty and usually out of the vegan tacos I stopped in for anyway--but I still like coming here.

What I don't like is that in response to YET ANOTHER C health rating, instead of cleaning up, the owner posted an intense nonsensical conspiracy rant on ktnv's facebook after they featured him on dirty dining.

So I will be truly sorry if Yayo's cinnamon-y sweet black bean dip is gone from my life... but it won't be because he's getting 'picked on' by SNHD. It's because he's too lazy to keep things clean and in good repair. It's just the truth.
