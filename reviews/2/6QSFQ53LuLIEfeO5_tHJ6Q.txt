My wife and her family love the margaritas here, but only because they are strong.  They are but NOT cheap.  My chimi was ok.  The shrimp fajitas were also just ok.  Frozen fairly small shrimp.  The options around this area are limited.  The chimi (luch portion) 7.99, fajitas 12.99 and two margs each ran $46 bucks.  Yikes!

If you can, go somewhere else.
