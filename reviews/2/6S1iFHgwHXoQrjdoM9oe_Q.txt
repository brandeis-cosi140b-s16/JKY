Am I taking crazy pills???!!!!! Four stars???? Really????  I think there needs to be some sort of quiz before being allowed to write reviews......  It could be as simple as: How many fingers am I holding up? Who was the first president of the United States? Or, have you ever eaten Mexican food before?

So based on its proximity to my home and the four star reviews from yelpers, we gave it a go. Was it completely terrible? No. But come on guys, call it what it is. This place is no better than an El Torito. Frankly, you are way better off to go to Baja Fresh, take it home, make your own margarita and save 50 bucks...

I had the carne asada fundido. Basically its like an under-fried chimi with steak and sauteed peppers and onions inside and sour cream on top. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't shitty, but there just isn't anything to sing about. Utterly average... 

Traveling for work a lot, I get to eat in a lot of great cities. The only reason I mention that is that in many cities, if you open an "ok" restaurant, it is closed inside a year. You just can't survive if you are this average. I have had better mexican food in Seattle for god's sake....SEATTLE!!!!!!! There are more mexican americans in this town that the entire population of Washington State.... Is it possible that the only good mexican food in this town comes from place where you have to stand in line to order?
