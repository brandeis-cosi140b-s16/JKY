Ok, when I feel like having fast food and maybe include a fish taco or something, this is a place that comes to mind. I've made the drive here many times but honestly, their service is horrible lately. You can be the only one in line and they'll forget numerous items! It's gotten so bad that I've actually made an effort to contact corporate about it and have received no response. Seems like it's not a big deal but in the past 6-8 months I've given them many chances and have been disappointed 8 times out of 10. We'll see if they make any changes...as for now, it's true mexican food at one of the 'berto's for me...
