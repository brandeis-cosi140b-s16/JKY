2nd time here was today, first visit was okay, however today was not. The kid working the register, Brady, was friendly and helpful. Once our order was in we had to wait a long time while most of the employees wandered around. The place was basically empty, and a bag was placed on the counter but they never said it was ours and there was no communication between the employees about it, because they were busy having conversations about other things. Once someone realized an order was sitting there a shorter girl brought it over to us and we asked for extra limes. She went back to get them, put them in a container, but on her way back decided to join in on the conversation going on, which included a guy who I'm guessing was a manager since he was in a blue polo. The cashier came over since we were standing there waiting and asked if we needed anything and we told him we were waiting on the girl to bring the limes, so he walked over and grabbed them and brought them to us. Once we got home we got a great surprise that a single taco was placed under the container with an entire meal, which caused the container to leak black bean sauce all over everything in the bag. Then my wife was gifted a piece of fish in her taco that had bones in it. It's really unfortunate that apparently most of the employees don't care about their jobs, customers, or the business owners investment. I will definitely be writing corporate because this experience is completely opposite of the experiences I had at the Torrance location in California which were always great.
