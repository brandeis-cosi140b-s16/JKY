Top reasons to go: Great drink bar with horchata and some other interesting options. Tortillas are good. Steak was tasty. Ingredients nice.

Reasons not to go: Overpriced and nickel and dimes you for everything. Food is decent, but not exclusive. And parking in this center is awful.

Used a BOGO for a steak burrito ($9.50), got a kids meal ($5.99) and 2 drinks and the bill was still $22. For that price, I can go get sit down Mexican and a better carne asada burrito 2 miles away.
