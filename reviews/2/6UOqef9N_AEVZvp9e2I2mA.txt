I am giving two stars mostly because the people that own and run the place are so wonderful...but sadly...and I am soo sorry..the food is horrible.  I have had breakfast and also have had dinner and it was just awful.  I do not feel bad writing this because there are plenty of people, my own family..who think this place is the bomb so pretty sure they won't lose business  The breakfast was greasy and quite frankly no where near as good as Sunrise Caf√©.  And dinner...bleh.  I ordered the #9, crunchy tacos.  I am pretty sure the taco shells were at least from the last millineum or were just plain cardboard.  HORRIBLE.  I had shredded beef...tasteless, not seasoned.  Frijoles were good..but you really can't ruin those, rice was dry, tasteless.  Salsa was more like taco sauce, not bad..just blended into a sauce.  No.  Never again.  Like I said..the people who own and run this place are really really good people, but I am just not a fan of the food.
