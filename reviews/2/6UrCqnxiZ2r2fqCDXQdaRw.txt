Villalpando's is an ok place to have Mexican food. My lunch buddy and I go there often when we want a home cooked mexican meal. It's not spectacular, it's not bad. It's just ok. I usually get the green chile dinner. The meat is tender and it comes with rice, beans and 3 flour tortillas. My friend usually gets a chile relleno. She likes theirs because they aren't breaded and fried. So if you want simple, no frills, non-chain mexican food, hit up Villalpando's.
