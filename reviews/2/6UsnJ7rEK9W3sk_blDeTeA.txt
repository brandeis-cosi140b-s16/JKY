I have eaten her for lunch at 4 am every morning. ( I love Mexican food) they where good then I orderd a taco salad with chicken and it was undercooked. Got sick the next day. I gave it another chance I found some brillo pad shavings in my enchilada. So I had enought went to robertos. If you just like burritos and tacos it's perfect, if u want something more go somewhere else.
