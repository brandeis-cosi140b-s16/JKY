We were hungry and everything else was closed near our gate (except Wendy's, which doesn't count as food in my book), so we ate some chips, salsa, and guacamole here.  My expectations were low, so I wasn't surprised to be unimpressed.
The chips came in three colors - Yellow #5, Blue #1, and natural corn color.  The salsa was completely pureed - no chunks at all.  It was more like hot sauce.  Ugh.  The guacamole was pretty flavorless.  This is not my kind of food.
The service and atmosphere were quite nice for an airport, however.
