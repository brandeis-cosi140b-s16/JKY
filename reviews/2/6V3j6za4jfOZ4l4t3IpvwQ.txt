Not Very Good

The staff at Kingbertos Mexican Food are warm, friendly, and extremely accommodating, which is why I feel terrible for calling out their Mexican food as bland. I really wanted to like Kingbertos  so badly, especially after reading so many positive reviews. However, the food in my opinion just isn't good.

This was my first visit to Kingbertos Mexican Food Restaurant, and for me the food  just isn't good. On this visit  I choose the shredded beef taco, tostada, Refried Beans, and Mexican Rice, both of which had very little taste.  In fact the refried bean almost had a somewhat grey appearance, and the shredded beef was very greasy.  The meal was just very disappointing.

Kingbertos isn't the worst but I'm not in a rush to visit again
