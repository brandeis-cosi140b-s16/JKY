I went here tonight with my friends/coworkers and while we did come mainly for margaritas, we were also hungry so decided to order food initially. Our server was new and not at all knowledgeable about the food (yet didn't pretend to be either).
Our drinks were delicious, but that was it. The complimentary salsa had a decent flavor, but was very watery.
I ordered a simple burrito with avocado which was not bad but nothing to write home about either. My boss ordered tamales which she said were very dry and chile rellenos which I tried a little bit and they were just drenched in oil causing it to be very soggy and you could tell that the oil had not been changed in awhile. She was not too happy.
There seemed to be a lot of employees yet service was very slow. 
I may return since they are open very late, but I will probably only get simple things like drinks and chips with guacamole.
