The good: 1) A great all you can eat chip bar with some pretty decent hot sauce. 2) A big patio to take a relaxed lunch at. 3) These crazy good green corn tamales with a strange cheese filling that is more like Kanufa then anything I've had at a Mexican restaurant.

The bad: pretty much everything else. The food is around (but below) drive through Filberto's quality at near restaurant prices. They even have the gaul to charge 2.25 for their crappy iced tea you serve yourself.

The worst part of this place is the meat they serve in their dishes which is absolutely horrid except for their machaca. I stick to bean burritos, cheese enchiladas, and the aforementioned green corn tamales if I go.

All of their tortillas and such taste store bought even though I think they make them themselves. And the horchata needs to be avoided at all costs as well.

For counter service Mexican, you gotta go with  La Tolteca if you are downtown. Or Caramba if you are on the west or north side.
