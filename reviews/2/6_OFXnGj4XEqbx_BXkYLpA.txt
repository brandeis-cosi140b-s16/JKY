This location is extremely slow. It seems like the drive through takes precedence over the dining room. We waited twenty minutes for "fast" food. If I intend to come back, I will remember that the drive through is faster. Quality and taste of food is adequate to corporate Taco Bell standards. Doesn't seem like the staff moves quicker, even when customers bring up how slow they are in regards to service. Team member discussing service with customer behind me right now....location doesn't have enough staff? Hire some more!
