I'm personally a big fan of Cafe Rio love their food. But this specific Cafe Rio always gets my order wrong. My wife and I are vegan and we just ask for no dairy and no meat. I come to this place frequently since it's a 5 minute drive from my apartment and I always order the same thing but they always get my order wrong. Something is always missing and when I tell them the problem they take FOREVER in fixing it. I've had to wait 45 min for them to fix a burrito which is pretty ridiculous. If this didn't happen so often I would rate it higher but it just happens way to often.
