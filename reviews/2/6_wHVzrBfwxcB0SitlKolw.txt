The girl at the register was nice enough but the kitchen behind her was in worrisome chaos. She called my order back about five or six times before anyone heard her, and even then the workers seemed more interested in jawing than in making my food. The food itself was undersized and bland, though with the salsa and Tapatio, it had a little flavor and heat.
