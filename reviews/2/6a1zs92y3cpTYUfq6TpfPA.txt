Beats Burger King any day. 

I should've manned up and just told my growling belly to quit being a whiny baby and waited until I got home to eat. But, noooooooo.

10 minutes and $11 later, I felt gross. I should've listened to intuition, instead I was stuck on my flight back to San Diego regretting every minute.  It wasn't that the food was bad, it was totally edible, just not very good. I would suggest Paradise Bakery if you must eat and if you decide to be brave-stick to something like a cheese quesadilla. It's almost impossible to ruin that...almost.
