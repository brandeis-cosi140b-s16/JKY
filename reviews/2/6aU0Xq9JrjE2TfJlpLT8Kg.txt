OVERRATED. Nothing against this Chipotle location, just Chipotle in general. I have eaten Chipotle twice and can say that it would not be my 1st choice nor my last choice to eat here. I don't know if its the fact that I have had a lot of hispanic food in my lifetime or if the food is truly just mediocre. Either way, you will never hear me say I want Chipotle.
