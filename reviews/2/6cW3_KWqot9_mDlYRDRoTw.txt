My husband and I decided to pop in for happy hour. It was really early like. 4:00 pm and we were the only people in there. The bartender /server was very nice and attentive.  We asked her for a Happy Hour menu and she said none had been created but they had Megaritas for $4.00

We ordered food off the bar menu and it was awful.  The street tacos were dry the fish lettuce wraps were boring and it felt like the food was a last minute add in and no effort went into it. 

We definitely won't return but it was worth a try.
