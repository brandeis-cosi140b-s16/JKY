Heard about this place so decided to go to lunch on a Monday afternoon. First when I walked in I stood there waiting for someone to say Hi or even notice I was there but that did not happen. Asked the lady standing there too if she could seat me and she laughed and said she was hoping I could do that as she was a customer too. Finally saw the sign to go to the counter and headed that way. 
Server at counter said Hi then I asked her to explain this concept and she did. Somewhat I got from her was basically this is a cafeteria  with a bar. You order from service counter then get a long stick with a number of  it and then go sit down. Some drinks come from  the bar and some they give you before you leave the counter where you also pay before you leave there. Sat Ã t the bar and bartender served my beer then the counter person brought our food out on a tray and took long stick with number. Really felt very cafeteria  style  and had ordered the steak nachos. Not the worse I have had but then again not the best. While at bar I kept noticing how people kept walking in and just looking lost like I did. 
Probably will not returned as the experience was not anything worth a second visit. The concept is not what I would describe friendly,  warm or even welcoming.
