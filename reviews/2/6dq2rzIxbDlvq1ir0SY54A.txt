Every Chipotle I have ever been to has always had a line out the door, so it's expected every time I go. Despite the long lines, service is usually pretty quick. This is the SLOWEST Chipotle I have ever been to. The employees had no sense of urgency at all. I have never seen anyone scoop beans or rice that slow before. 
When it time to pay, there was no cashier... She was refilling napkins that didn't need to be refilled at the time. After she rang the guy in front of me, she turned and jumped to bring bags of chips down from the top shelf to the bottom shelf.. There were already chips on the bottom shelf and she completely ignored me and the huge line behind me. Employees don't seem to know how to prioritize!
Also, the parking lot is huge, but the way it is laid out provides hardly any spaces and makes it really difficult to drive/park in.
