I feel like I must have gone to the wrong place.  First, the map and location here on Yelp is wrong, it's not on Southern/48th it's on Baseline/48th, they moved.  I had the carne adobada plate, after reading the rave adobada reviews here and frankly, I don't get it.  The meat was essentially flavorless and the rice/beans forgettable.  The only good part was the corn tortillas and they weren't even great.  I think this place's reviews are a direct result of Phonecians having very poor taste, in general, and for food.  Not to mention it was gross inside and the outside was ghetto as fuck.  I double-locked my ride and dropped the switches so fools couldn't run off with my 13".
