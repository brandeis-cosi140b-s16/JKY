just had a carne asade burro for lunch with guac, sour cream, and pico. wasnt anything speiclal at all. I prefer my burro's to not be cut in half considering its a burrito not a PB&J.

The salsas didnt have a lot of flavor. The hot salsa had a good heat to it but just not much flavor. I found myself using the green salsa the most. 


On the upside i had an ice cold Victoria that made up for it all. I would go back and try the fish tacos i suppose
