The food we had was decent but the prices are high and the service is very very slow.

I have to wonder if they're understaffed and if they're a union house because the people here were unenthusiatic about their jobs. 

The room is beautiful as one other reviewer mentions but I would sooner go to El Jefe's for this kind of Mexican food than come back here.

Thank god we had a gift card. I would have been really upset if I had to pay full price.
