This place is close to my office, decided to go for lunch today with my fianc√© and didn't have that great of service. We both ordered a sopes comb plate, I had asked for double rice rather than the rice and beans. Instead he charged us for two extra sides of rice and also gave me the rice and beans that came with our comb. When we received our order I brought it to his attention that I didn't want two extra rice just substitute the beans . He took it to his cook and told him in Spanish that's not what I wanted, cook in Spanish said "if I have to remake anything, I will take long on this". I brought it to his attention that I heard and understood so to just give me the plate how it was and refund me the two extra rice he charged. I was on my lunch break , never apologized or even made eye contact when speaking just looked annoyed with us. Food was okay, most likely wont come back even if its close to my work office.
