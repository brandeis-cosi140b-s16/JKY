80% of the workers here are very rude. Usually the female teens who are mean for no reason to customers. The condiment counter is dirty usually around night, which is kind of gross, but most of the time it's clean. The food is always so good. I haven't ever gone back to this location though, and don't really plan to because of the employees.
