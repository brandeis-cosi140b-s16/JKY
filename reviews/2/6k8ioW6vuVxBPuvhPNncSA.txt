I got the beef machaca burro enchilada style.  The prices are pretty cheap which is nice, but I'm not sure it's worth the calories.  The meat inside my burro was burnt on some pieces so every bite had a strand or two of "jerky".  The flavor isn't terrible but how do you mess up tortilla and enchilada sauce right?  The burnt meat really cut into the enjoyment of my meal but also some pico de gallo or even just some onions/green onions would be nice to cut the heaviness of the dish.
