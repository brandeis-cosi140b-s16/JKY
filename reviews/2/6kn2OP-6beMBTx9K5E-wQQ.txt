My first time (& last time) visiting round corner cantina was not what I had expected. Food (most of it) & drinks were amazing which is why I'm so disappointed. My husband, friend & I were there on a fri night so I understand it's going to be busy, however, the wait was well beyond what it should've been. Once we finally did get some of our food, we were so hungry we just dove in. I ate about 1/3 of a taco, wasn't too fond of it, my husband took it to eat the rest of it. He turns to me & says, "this is pork". I'm a 20+ year strict vegetarian. I almost burst into tears right there. We had ordered all vegetarian food for our table. I understand mistakes happen but this one was a big one. My husband told our server we got someone else's food & said we would pay for it but she said she'd take care of it. Needless to say, we won't be going back.
