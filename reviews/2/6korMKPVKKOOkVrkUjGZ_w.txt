Okay, not great, server was friendly enough and certainly easy on the eyes but this is more of a happy hour bar place than a restaurant.  Food was not the focus of the business.  Had the burrito with pulled pork and it was somewhat bland.  Won't return since there are many other options in the Desert Ridge complex to choose from.
