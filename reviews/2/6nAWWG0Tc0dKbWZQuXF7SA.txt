S'okay

Was happy to see the old Costa Vida place get a new lease and the chicken concept sounded good. 

Have visited their drive-through twice now-- tacos once and burrito the other time. Okay on both visits. Nice service staff, though a bit slow. The meats are moist enough but are bland to my taste. The big turn-off for me are the avocado and cabbage/lettuce mix they use. Neither taste fresh.

I saw that they have chicken basket type meals. Will try one of those if/when I go again and update my review.
