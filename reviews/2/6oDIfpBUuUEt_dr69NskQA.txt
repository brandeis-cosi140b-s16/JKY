Unfortunately, not memorable. At least not yet. Atmosphere was seriously lacking, service was prompt--too prompt--and not genuine in the way she talked.

Food was good! Mango cilantro margherita was unique and tasty. Guacamole was exactly how I would have expected it to be. My mother kept raving about the chips, though I didn't think they were anything special. The Hucheco from the appetizer menu was REALLY good, the vegetarian enchiladas were just ok. The dessert menu sounded great, didn't try anything.

I would definitely give this place another shot in a few months. But if you're looking for a place that has authentic Mexican food nailed (as well as service and atmosphere, meaning not fancy but real), go to La Mestiza.
