Food was good.  Service very slow, even on slow monday afternoon!  Had 4 Cabo Wabo Margaritas & not pleased w the fact that i dont even have a buzz.  $80 bill & no buzz=2 stars.  I mean u shld really kno how to make a descent margarita for a "sandbar.".  Ambiance was ok.  Expected more sand.... & shade.
