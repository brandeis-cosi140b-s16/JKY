Stopped in for lunch today as a backup to another place we were planning to eat that was closed for lunch.  I had read the mixed reviews, but was just looking for some stable decent pseudo-Mexican fare at this point.

The short list of deficiencies include burnt tasting tortilla chips, boring salsa, dry rice, and extremely bland al pastor tacos.  The canned pineapple chunks that were added for garnish were the most exciting ingredient.

The guacamole wasn't bad, so props for that.  The service was good.  Our waiter was prompt and stopped by frequently for refills and to check on us.  He earned the 2nd star for them today.

I guess my expectations weren't too heavily skewed.  Definitely doesn't trump any of the taco shop chains or the massive corporate competitors.  I think this will be my first and last visit.
