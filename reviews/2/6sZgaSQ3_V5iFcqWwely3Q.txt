More soggy Rolled Tacos - five of them for $4 bucks. Slightly crispy on edges, but a mushy mess in the middle. This was through the drive-through at about 11pm. These were not good, but they are the kind of item you eat anyway if not good and regret it later. Will probably order a Burro here next time, since thats the name of the place, but they should know how to properly deep fry a rolled taco. Decent red sauce is available also.
