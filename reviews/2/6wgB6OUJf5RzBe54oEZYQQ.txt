Overpriced. $11-12 tiny street tacos aren't worth it; you can get several better ones from Tacos el Gordo for that price. We got the carne asada; it was way overcooked/tough, and the house salsa was about as inspiring as Pace. The trio of salsas app is $7 and includes a "hot" one (which really isn't, but regardless, the flavor isn't that impressive either and doesn't differ much from the house salsa), a tomatillo (which is a bit unnecessarily sweet), and one made with avocado which was really quite nice. We also ordered the pozole, which was unlike (and fell short of pretending to be) any pozole that either of us have had in Mexico or New Mexico. The broth was decently tasty at the end once we'd already added in enough salt from all of the chips we dunked in it in the beginning, trying to improve the flavor. Then you need to take into account the ~$13-15 tiny margaritas and $7 XX beer (even the PBR is $5), which then convinces you that you definitely should have gone elsewhere. Well, unless you really like being jostled by people's asses brushing against your dome every few mins; then definitely go and ask to be seated at the one doesn't-belong table nearest both the door and the bar, where everyone is trying to get by. On the plus side, the waitress was very nice, but took forever to come back each time, which, to be fair, is probably because this place just opened and is still working out the kinks. I'd give them another chance in a month or two, but the prices just aren't worth it. Oh, it's also way too loud to be able to talk easily with your dining companions, if you like that sort of thing, FYI. I'd give it a 2.5 if I could; we'll go with 2. Meh.
