1 1/2-2 ish star. Only been here a few  times in the late wee hours. The graveyard shift crew is a little iffy. Most of the time they look at you like you interrupted a game of freeze tag. The plaza it's in is uber creepy at night. I usually go for a late night breakfast burrito. I asked for sauce and napkins they said ok but behold none were to be had. The dude at the drive thru was too busy bullshitting with his pals. I'm surprised I got my change my back.
