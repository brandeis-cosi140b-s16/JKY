I'm giving this even two stars because of the friendly wait staff, the fun environment, and a few items I did really like.  I ate here twice while working on a production at The Joint in the Hard Rock.  

The items I do actually like a lot: the salsa, the ceviche, the guacamole, and the fruit salad.  Those are all worth snacking on if you're there for a few drinks and light food.  
The tuna tacos are okay but a little bland, and the fish tacospretty flavorless too.  Mostly the rest of the food is bland.  When I say "bland", I don't mean salt-free; I mean just cardboard-flavor-like.  The refried beans taste canned, and the rice is just run-of-the-mill "blah".  None of the entrees really tasted that great, and other than a fun atmosphere and snacking, I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there again for the prices they're charging vs. the quality. 

Honestly, I'd rather eat at Mr. Lucky's inside the Hard Rock any time over Pink Taco.
