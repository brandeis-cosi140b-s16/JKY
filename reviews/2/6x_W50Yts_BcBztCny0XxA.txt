I used to come here all the time, as I grew up in the area and always stopped in for the free chips and salsa as a teenager.  I moved back to the area and brought my bf and he was pretty skeptical until he was greeted by the host.   The host was amazing, very friendly and welcoming and funny!  We made the mistake in sitting in the cantina though.  That's apparently where all the staff congregates to talk about personal situations and after hearing about how homosexuals lose, a girl went to a friend's house for a "quickie," the bartender thinking he's the fonz of serranos, i almost never want to go back.  The bartender alone was reason enough for this review.  The worst human I've encountered in at least 3 years.  Offensive, tacky, and unprofessional.  From now on, always go through the dining area or your dinner experience will be ruined.
