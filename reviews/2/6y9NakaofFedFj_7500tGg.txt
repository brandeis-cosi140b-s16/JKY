Went here with a friend who is from the area, I must say at first walking in I was not impressed with the service at all.  There was a kid at the counter messing with the computer who did not even greet us I was under the impression he must be a server.  Low and behold after 6-7 minutes he turns to seat us, he was the hostess after all.

We were her for lunch the parking lot and dining room we sat in were pretty full, nothing fancy at all.  I don't think anything has been updated in about 20 years or so. 

The waitress was no better, she gave us our waters and didn't return to take our order for a good 15 minutes.  I had a shredded beef taco and a green chili tamale, again not impressed.  The taco was typical the tamale was loaded with way too much melted cheese on top so all you could taste was the cheese.  My friend had the steak fudido which she says is the best she has ever had.  I do admit it was pretty tasty and the meat was very flavorful.  Although, the overall experience is enough to ensure I won't be returning.
