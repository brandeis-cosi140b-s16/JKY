Bland Tex mex for those afraid of real Mexican flavors, and despite the name there was little NewMexican on the menu. I could best describe it as eating at a hotel style meal.

We opted to sit on the patio and enjoy the nice weather, it was odd that we were escorted out of the front door to get to the patio. The lighting was dim making it hard to read the menu. 

The chips and salsa did not arrive for over 10 minutes which is a bit odd. Some one at the table ordered a bean dip appetizer that came in a small dish, and was a bit lacking of flavor. The tri color chips looked nice but were a bit stale and the salsa lacked any green chilies spice I would expect from a NewMexcan spot.

I went with the Enchanted Garden Enchiladas, with red and green sauce, The veggies inside were crisp but the enchilada sauces again were very bland and spice less, the rice and beans were nothing special. $11.95.

Aside from the lack of flavor the other issue was the long wait, in all it took 1:25 to eat here, waiting for the meal and then the check seemed like an eternity.

I say go elsewhere for Mex style food.
