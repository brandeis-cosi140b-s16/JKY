Sitting in here right now! The girls who work the register are always so rude and unfriendly. I love their food or I would never come here for that reason. They never answer their phone for carry-out orders when I call, but always seem to be on the phone when I'm in the store! I don't know if they don't think customer service isn't important or they don't care but they should seriously consider being nicer to their customers. Especially ones who come often.
