I'm always up for finding a new Mexican restaurant to enjoy! Sadly, this one just didn't cut it. I ordered the combo platter (14 I think) and was excited to try their tamale! The waiter informed me that they hadn't made any yet. Okay, it was right around 1pm, they may have run out already with the lunch rush? I look around and the place is relatively slow with plenty of tables open (maybe people don't go there for late lunch).

So, I was able to replace the tamale with a beef chimichanga! When my meal came, I really couldn't pick out which was which (burrito vs. enchilada vs. chimichanga). After a little while, I realized the chimichanga was slightly crispy than the other two. Still, no idea which one was a burrito.

My friend ordered some rice milk (there's a name for it and I'm not about to get that wrong), unfortunately she had to remove an ice cube that had an unidentified black speck on it (gross) - but kudos to her for finishing the drink (I would not have been able to).

Service was pretty quick and we were in and out in 30 minutes for lunch (again, they weren't that busy - but I still like it when I can have a quick meal). I have certainly had better, but unfortunately I have had worse (mostly why I couldn't justify a 1 star rating).
