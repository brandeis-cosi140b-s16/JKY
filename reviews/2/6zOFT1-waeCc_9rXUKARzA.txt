Don Pedros or DP's as we call it out here.  I will tell you this,, I love the location of the place since i live right down the street ,  but as far as the food goes,,  It is edible,, but mediocre compared to the other mexican joints i have been to.  I really hoped that they would have good food, being so close to the house but it just doesnt do it.  I actually will drive 10 miles past it to go to Ricos on power & Riggs.  If you want good mexican food and you dont mind driving a little ways,  go to "Xaviers Casa Reynoso" on Val Vista & Southern.  You will definitely forget about DP's..
