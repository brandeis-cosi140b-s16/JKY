Went regularly for awhile but stopped. If you want cheap eats this is it, chips n salsa are free when you sit down. Taco's are like $2 and big in size and pretty good. Odd things happen sometimes though like no cheese in the taco, rotten tomato on plate (literally a black tomato), not much care into the assembly of the plate etc. Had one of the bus boys drop a salsa and splat all over me and they didn't seem to care. Salsa tastes different every time. Cheap eats yes but not high quality just typical flavor I guess. As for the structure and decor well that is lacking they don't bother with much of that at all.
