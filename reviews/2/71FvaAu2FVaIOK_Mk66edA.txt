I, just like a lot of people on here, were persuaded by the amount of excellent reviews and friends who recommended it. I was very, very, VERY disappointed. 

The reason I have it 2 stars is because of the cool atmosphere and live mariachi band. The food was sub par (and got my order wrong, but I can see why CHEESE enchilada sounds like CHICKEN enchilada.....  Not)

The chips and salsa were not very good- the chips were extremely crispy and the salsa was not like regular salsa. 

The margarita was also not worth the price with the lack of tequila in it

I would highly recommend Super Mex (don't listen to those reviews because I am one of the most picky eaters I know) compared to this place

Very unfortunate that this place didn't live up to the hype.
