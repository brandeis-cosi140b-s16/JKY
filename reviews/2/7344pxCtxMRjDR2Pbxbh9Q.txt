This place is kind of out of the way if you are on the main part of the strip but we had a vegan in our group. The food was good not fantastic for the price. We loved the mariachi band but other than that the atmosphere sucked. Our waiter was so friendly and nice and the food came out quick. I probably wouldn't come back on my own but if I had a vegan in the group again would go because there is something for everyone. Also she loved the food she ordered from the menu. Basically if you aren't vegan I'm giving this place a 2 but if you are I'm giving it a 4.
