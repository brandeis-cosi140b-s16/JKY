The tacos were good!!........

Now the problem! We went there to have some good Tequila "Don Julio 1942" @ $25 a shot we were disappointed, not only was it awful it was served in a shot glass. I have had 1942 many times and never has it tasted bad, I mean bad. If you are paying $25 for a shot they should at least serve it in a tequila glass which most tequila bars have.  When we complained (with still 3/4 of the shot left) all they did was some out and show us the bottle it was in. I tried to force it down and almost got sick.
