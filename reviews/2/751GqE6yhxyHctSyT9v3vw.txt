This particular Cafe Rio is ghetto. The tables weren't clean. The outside patio has broken umbrellas which means you can't sit outside in the nice weather. The staff is rude when ordering and one employee was fixing himself a drink at the fountain and forced me to wait on him. The food itself was about the same as the others but I had to guess which burrito was mine because he didn't mark it on top with the meat like they normally do. Go to another cafe rio instead.
