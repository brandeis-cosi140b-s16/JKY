I came to work in Gila Bend for a couple of months and Being that its the only Mexican restaurant in town, I was very excited to go there.  I was craving some flautas and went there for some. I placed the order to go and couldnt wait to get to my room and gooble down the flautas w/sour cream and guacamole!
When I got to my room and discovered that they were Rolled Taquitos, you know the frozen kind you can buy like 100 to a box, I was beyond disappointed and not to mention furious! Flautas are the easiest thing to make and it was a major disappointment.  A Mexican restaurant that puts out this type of quick fix doesnt take pride.  
Since I dont have kitchen access in my hotel and most likely have to return to eat there, being there arent that many choices in town. I held my tongue. I just know not to order that next time.
