Americanized Mexican Food. 
Served by friendly but overworked wait staff in a location that..well it's seen better days. 
Pricing...slightly on the high side when you look at portion sizes and overall quality especially compared against what you can find at so many other places across the valley. 
I want to like Macayo but I just don't have any real desire to go back. YMMV.
