Sylvia's, 

I REALLY want to keep visiting you, but it pains me every time I walk by to see how much money you spend on remodeling when all it would take to stir up business is to improve service. You have a captive audience with the neighborhoods surrounding your location and there is no excuse for the dozens of horrible reviews.  Quit blowing money on remodeling the place and instead get someone in there who knows how to manage a restaurant.
