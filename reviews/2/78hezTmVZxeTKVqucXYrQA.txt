Average higher priced fast food joint.  Both the burrito & cheese enchiladas were lots of tortilla & sparse on the real ingredients.  Full service after you order & only after you take your cup to the counter & ask 2 people for a refill. (Although,  it looked they were having a good time in the back.) Hope they figure it out!
