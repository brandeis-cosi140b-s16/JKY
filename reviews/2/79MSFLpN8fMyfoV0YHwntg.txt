You those restaurants that just use really subpar ingredients for everything? Well, Casa de Lara is one of them. While their food is not terrible, it is very expensive for the cost. Which, I should clarify, is not even that high. It is just that subpar.  Frankly, I could get a better burrito down the street at Chipotle for a much lower cost.
