Good start with nicely heated chips and salsa that was OK.  Prices are reasonable and you get so much.  Taco was bland with little flavor.  The chili relleno was not what I expected and rather plain.  The refried beans needed a little salt but were OK.  The gauc on the salad was pretty good.  Someone in our group ordered the chicken fajita and it could have served 2 or 3 people.

Service was good until we were done, then it was hard to find our waiter to get the check.
