"Think outside the bun" - usually only when I am starving and only have $3 to my name. But to do right by TB I have to say they do make a mean Mexican pizza.

Since I only usually go to this location there are some things I can say about it.

1) Service is always friendly and extremely fast!
2)Prices are great (hope it is actually human consumable)
3) Decent Mexican tasting food

So, when in doubt, do not go without - go with Taco Bell instead!
