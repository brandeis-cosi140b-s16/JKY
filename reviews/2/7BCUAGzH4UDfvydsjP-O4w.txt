Sorry this place had so much promise but did not deliver.  Walking by, I saw the same kind of custom guacamole bowls that I experienced at Cantina Laredo in Nashville, TN.  The guac was excellent and the highlight of the meal.  I thought I would try something different and that was a mistake - I had the Carnitas, and found them almost impossible to eat.  Every bite had sharp edges that cut like a knife, and the meat underneath was very dry.  I'll probably go back so I can update my review, but next time it will be something different.
