We actually ate at Sabor about 3 months ago. The Mole Negro Oaxaqueo and Petite Filet Mignon were good and the Pineapple Rum with Vanilla Ice cream for dessert was an excellent recommendation from our server. We also experienced good service while we were there. 

However, I'm giving this place 2 stars because I felt their ad in the community newspaper was misleading. I currently do not plan on returning to Sabor and nor will I recommend it to my friends.
