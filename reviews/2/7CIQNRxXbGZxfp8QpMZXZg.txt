This restaurant was featured in the Peoria-Glendale paper so we thought we would try it. As we walked in, we noticed the doormat said "Casa de Angelina Spanish Food." Sound interesting? If there was any Spanish food on their menu, I sure didn't see it. We were a party of 5 - 2 ordered Taco salads, 1 Chimichanga and 2 taco plates. No Spanish food there. The food we got was just OK, not up to typical Mexican restaurant standards. On the other hand, the service tonight was great. But again, the food was nothing special. We won't be back.
