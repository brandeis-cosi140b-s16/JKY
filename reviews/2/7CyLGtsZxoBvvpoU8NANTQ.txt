I don't get it. For some reason, people seem to think Comedor Guadalajara represents traditional, authentic Mexican cuisine. If that's the case, so do Acapulco, El Torito, Arriba and Macayo's.
Nevermind the location. I have strayed into much more intimidating parts of other cities and towns and come out unscathed. Anyone who is concerned about the location or the security guard will either feel that they were adventurous threatened. You can decide for yourself which to pick.
AS FOR THE FOOD... it's horribly average. Yes they make a good michelada, but the food itself is too fried, has too much lard, and just doesn't have much charm.
I don't want cheddar cheese on my Mexican food. I don't want Jack In The Box style tacos. I don't need beans and rice on the same plate.
The green chile is better at Carolina's or Rito's or El Norteno.

If you want fatty americanized Mexican food, go to Comedor. If not, I suggest you skip it.
