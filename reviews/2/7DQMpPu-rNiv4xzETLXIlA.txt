Meh.

Being new to the area, we had heard great things about this chain.  When they arrived in Avondale, we tried them out.  Food was only okay.  Salsa was unremarkable and like what you'd get from a Tostitos-branded jar at the Fresh & Easy across the street.  The service was very slow, even in bringing us chips.  It was rather loud.  And the ambiance was a cross of Ikea and nouveau K-Mart cafeteria.

Cool setting, though.  I'm a fan of the Avondale Sports Complex.  Great setting for families and team sports.
