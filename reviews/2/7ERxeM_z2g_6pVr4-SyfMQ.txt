I noticed this place while driving between work locations around lunch time, thought I'd give it a try.

I had the two item combo with a chile relleno and a tamale, it comes with beans and rice for $4.99, had a drink with it for $1.79.

Let's start with the chile relleno, small for a relleno chile and with very little sauce on it for a chile relleno. It tasted alright, just not much of it. 

On to the tamale, I'm assuming it was chicken, since I saw a few threads of white meat in it,, sticking out of the masa. They might as well just serve masa, no more meat than there was in the tamale. Seriously, I saw no more than 6 threads of meat, maybe an inch long and the thickness dental floss, in the entire tamale. As I said, they might as well just serve masa.

The beans average, the rice surprisingly good, I like the taste of the rice, it was good.

The prices are cheap, but it's not very good. Maybe I should have ordered something else, I was so disappointed in the stick of masa, they called a tamale. If they had taken the few threads of chicken out, they could call it a vegetarian tamale and I would have known to order something else.

I wasn't impressed. I might try it again and order something else, I'll edit the review if I do.
