This used to be one of our most favorite places.  We go there a lot and I am also a Concierge and I can't even begin to tell you how many people I send to them - NOT after today.  If folks want to go, of course I will book them but will NO longer recommend them.

Ordered drinks - I drink one with infused cinnamon infused tequila.  Today, I couldn't even taste the cinnamon.  When I nicely mentioned that maybe it wasn't the cinnamon tequila, the bartender (not Scott) could have cared less and said, that's it. Ok - so I drank it.  We ordered appetizer - he never came to check on us, to either ask how it was, remove the empty dish, ask if we wanted something else.  Another Server saw our empty drink glasses and went behind the bar and fixed us another one - nobody ever asked us if we wanted food - totally ignored.  So, we settled the bill and decided to go to a high top and have a regular Server take care of us.  We sat down, she brought us water and disappeared.  After close to 10 minutes waiting, we walked out.  The place wasn't crowded - there may have been 8-10 people there.  

Anyway, I don't think they care but they have lost our business as a couple and anybody looking for a Mexican Restaurant venue - found another place, by chance, hands down better.
