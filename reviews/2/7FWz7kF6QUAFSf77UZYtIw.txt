Let me start by saying that the 2stars are strictly due to our service.  The food was good but not, "OMG, I can't wait to come back!!!"  but very good.  We aged while we waited for drinks and entrees, slow doesn't cover it!  When we asked, "What is the soup?" She responded......"Noodle based with tomato soup".   Ummmmm......... We didn't order.  
First rule in the industry, make sure everyone has a drink to keep them happy.  Not so much!  When someone in our party ordered an  enchilada with tomatillo sauce and received red sauce, the server told her, "We're out of the green".  WHAT?  The chef/mgr had just been to the table and recommended the ordered sauce.  Our friend was surprised but didn't get upset.......until another employee delivered her meal as ordered and was surprised to see she already had a plate.  When he saw her plate he said, "that's someone else's!"   He removed the untouched plate and gave her the meal she ordered.  Waitress oblivious.  
Finally we get the check and eventually walk it in so we can leave.  Expecting to see the interior restaurant hopping but no........the restaurant was EMPTY!!!!!!  Where was she?  We laughed and made up a wide variety of scenarios, none of which involved the restaurant.  I'm not saying that all servers at this restaurant are horrible, I know that is not fair.  I will go back but think that FOGON  mgmt needs to be aware.  Tons of restaurants and snowbirds about to arrive.  Lots of choices!!!!
