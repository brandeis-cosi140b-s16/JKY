There were a lot of choices for tequila, however, maybe a total of 3 ounces in the very well Iced drink.   The chips were interesting but the dips we had were very good and flavorful.  I had the steak tacos with black beans, rice, and some kind of pickled medley.  The place was almost dark as there was no lighting at the tables nor above us and we had to use our iPhone flashlights to read the tiny writing on the menus.   My meal was cold.   The bill was wrong but we worked it out amongst ourselves to get it right.  For $40 I don't think I'll be going back.
