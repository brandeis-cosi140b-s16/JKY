I stood for a long time waiting to be noticed just so I could get seated. They seemed very short staffed and the hostess was running around tending to tables and didn't notice the people waiting. Our server was great. Poor dude was running around trying to keep up with all the tables but with them all full and barely any help it was hard. I had a hard time getting something to even drink when I was first seated and getting a refill was even harder. 

The complimentary chips and bean dip are great however the salsas are nasty. My wife and I shared some con queso dip and that was the best part of the meal. Very cheesy and lots of flavor. I had fajitas and they were not cooked how i asked. Some of the meat was still raw and the rest was tough. Only getting 3 tortillas my whole meal was complete crap too. I couldn't even catch my server to ask that the fajitas be remade because he was out of sight or rushing food to a different table. The beans that came with my meal were also hard. Cabo needs to get more employees on hand so things can run more smoothly.
