Service was terrible. I understand not everyone has to speak English but know and speak enough to take the right order. My friend ordered food and she brought out the wrong one and they still charged them for it. Brought our food out cold. The waitress attitude was awful and was more focused on her boyfriend being there than her customers. I usually have good experiences here but this was enough to make me look at other options.
