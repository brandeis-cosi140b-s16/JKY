In a pinch, we eat here because it is basically right next to the house.  The interior restaurant is unkempt and uninviting. The drive through takes a.million.years. to get your food. It all tastes ok at first, then you spend your afternoon in the bathroom.
The menu got fairly expensive. It used to be the cheap burrito place to to. At $6.99 for a Chile relleno burrito that recycles in about 30 minutes, I'd say it's not worth it.
