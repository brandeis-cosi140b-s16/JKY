I came here expecting so much.  I've lived in Vegas for years and always heard such great things about this place.  Plus, they're on the 'Best Of' list for years. Wow was I disappointed.  Service was pretty much non-existent - the other reviewer that made the comment about the lack of refil on chips and salsa was accurate.  However, we didn't even get a refill on our water.  The food was pretty tasteless.  My daughter posted a vine about the absent server because it was so obvious.  Now at least I can say I've tried the famous Lindo Michoacan... don't have anything good to say about it. For the price, the quality was sub-standard.   Bloody Mary came in a thick, narrow glass so the content was very small - it was overpriced and under-tasty, too.  I'll stick with Taco Bell for a better Mexican meal.
