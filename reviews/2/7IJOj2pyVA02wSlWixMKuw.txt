I've been here a few times and always liked it... But today was a BAD day .., I ordered the rolled tacos with the guacamole on the side, plus a side order of sour cream, $1.10 for a drop of sour cream, that's ridicules ... I not being cheap but come on... The food was so so and no wow factor , I think it's a bit over priced for bland food .. What I found to be very disturbing was a guy sitting at one of the tables conducting some sort of business with the employees, they'd pay him and follow him to his van and come back with clothing , one guy came back with a jacket .. The seller came back in and another employee bought stuff from him..  Im all for people making money.. BUT NOT on company time , just didn't look right and customers were inside
