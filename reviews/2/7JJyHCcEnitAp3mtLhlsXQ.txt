I've been coming here for years. Unfortunately it has been progressively going downhill. Last night was probably the final time I will go there. 
It was a bit slow and I came in with a party of 6 around 845pm. The staff was very detached, we had to beg for everything from water to cocktails. It was so bad that I went hunting for help and wound up in the bar to ask for the manager. Both the bartender and hostess (who were watching tv) told me the manager would come to our table.... He never showed up. 
So sad to see a place go downhill because of a loose staff and management. It's also been feeling dirty in there too. Didn't seem like they care anymore. Food was still good though, but with all the other issues I don't trust that they are handling it well.
