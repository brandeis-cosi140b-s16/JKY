Food was great and service from the two bartenders was exceptional! But don't know if I'll be back. West gate is usually busy Sundays after Cardinals game so we wanted to go to a place where we could drink, have a good time and enjoy the game, so we landed to this place. It was perfect not busy and a good amount of TV's to bring our friends, but when we asked if we could get the volume for the game instead of the music the bartender said the music needed to stop but he doubted it would because the owner was the one who was playing the music. The owner was having a blast drinking with his buddies making the bartenders work double to get they're drinks and ours. At that moment I told my friends not to come and we left elsewhere. I may not run a bar but know and work with customer service, and in businesses like that you cater to your customers first not yourself. At least me in my business I give the customers the best experience possible for them to come back but we did not get that... We're all heavy drinkers and work for tips as well so we like to spend money on places like that. At least that slow night they would've had good business and multiple nights after that, now I don't know if I'll be back!
