The food was just alright. Really great happy hour specials for drinks. ****BEWARE**** for our party of 4 (not 8 or 10) they added automatic gratuity. The fast and not thorough explanation given to my boyfriend was "yeah..we already add on gratuity". Ok...where is that posted? Is that legal? Gratuity is an incentive. Don't get me wrong, I tip, but I don't like being forced into something. I actually tip more than their forced tip charge. Just doesn't sit right with me when that isn't made clear. ****Seems deceitful.****
