Sadly, all good things must come to an end.  Much like my relationship with Los Betos, so goes mine with Filiberto.  Maybe his cousin will be better.

On my last visit, the chips were burnt. The guac tasted old.  The cheese in the enchilada had re-solidified to some disastrous inedible wad of nastiness.  Yes, I threw out cheese.  And the beans were just...there aren't words to express the horror.  Dry, stiff, terrible flavor.  Thankfully the taco was good, as was the rice.  It's a damn good thing I buy a lot of food!

For now, I say goodbye.  But I know in my heart, someday I'll be back, remembering the good times, hoping he will have changed...Until then, I leave an extra star for the memories.
