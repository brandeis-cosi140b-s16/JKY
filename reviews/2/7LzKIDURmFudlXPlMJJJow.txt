I am in search of a taco that is at least edible.  I ordered 2 tacos and tossed 1.5 tacos.  Not even close to a street taco in So Cal or Mexico.  And they were more than $2.50 each.  Highway robbery for a terrible taco.  People here were really friendly though.  Only reason they got a 2 and not a 1 was the people in the building.
