If you come here, do not go for the normal combination dinners. The meat is barely spiced, and the sauce on my burrito tasted closer to marinara than anything else. The salsa was also quite bland. Service was good though. My friend tried the fajitas, and those were also not bad. Still, I would see no reason to come here if I did not work in Verona. There are much better places in Madison.
