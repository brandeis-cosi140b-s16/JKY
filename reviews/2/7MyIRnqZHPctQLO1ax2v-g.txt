The meal itself (Well, what I got of it) tasted fine. The chicken was tender, with good marinated flavor. The sides were plentiful, and the salad was huge. 

Unfortunately, they did not include course 3 of the 3 course meal that I ordered to go, and did not realize this until I got back home. In addition, they were going to overcharge me on a coupon deal I redeemed (Get 4 free tacos) had I not noticed that they only took off the cost of 1 taco, not 4.

The salsa bar itself is a nice idea, but the station itself looked grimy, especially the lid and tray area. The pico de gallo looked really old, and appeared to have a strange foamy appearance, so I steered clear of it.
