Though the name resonates with an upper middle aged crowd, this Summerlin eatery falls short in many categories and is simply not worth the time or money. Despite its rich long term history due to its namesake and original location, this restaurant seems like it just tries too hard to be hip and cool and ends up resembling something more like Carl's Jr. but lacking the cheap eats value. 

When you enter, you are asked to order from a counter. Then you can opt for "full service" where the waitstaff will supposedly check on you and refill your drinks. To opt for this service you must leave a CC at the counter to establish an open tab, regardless of whether or not you accrue additional charges. Then once you order, you are given a number and told your food will be delivered to your table. How they know who is "full service" and who isn't I have no idea and it didn't really matter anyway as we left a CC with them yet not ONCE did a waiter come by to offer refills or check on us. 

We left the table to refill our own drinks from the soda fountain and collect our CC prior to departure. The best value we experienced here was our lack of need to tip. 

Overall, the only reason I gave a 2 star instead of 1 is I did enjoy the overall aesthetics. The kitschy 80's and 90's era toys like Stay Puft Marshmallow man and PeeWee Herman doll were nostalgic and cute. But when it comes to the food and service, stick to Carl's Jr. At least when they deliver the food they usually ask if you need anything else. Hussong's could learn a few things from them.
