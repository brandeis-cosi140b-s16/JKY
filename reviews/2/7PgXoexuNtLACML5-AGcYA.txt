This place works best as a sports bar than a restaurant. They did try to sit us away from the bar and loud TVs but still could hear it. The menu has the expected variety, nothing out of the ordinary. A word of caution, their concept of spicy can be different from yours if you are not used to hot food...what they would call a "1-star" probably was a "3" for me. Our waitress was very nice and, I have to admit I feel a bit guilty about my low score...I quite can't pinpoint why but it was not a memorable experience. Not horrendous, but not quite good either. Maybe I expect more of a Mexican restaurant in Arizona.
