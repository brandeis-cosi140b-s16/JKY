Not sure what happened to this Macayos, but this spot is a "tradition" so I ate here. The service is horrible. We sat and waited 10 minutes before a waitress came to our table to give us water. Although, it was 5pm on a Friday and there was 3 waitresses working, walking past us not making eye contacting, the wait time is unacceptable. When we finally did get our drink order in with the waitress, the drinks were wrong. Long story short... Macayos will always be Macayos but the waitress and even the manager on duty (at the time) need to make a change with their service and staff, or they will probably be closing like the one off tropicana and Maryland parkway.
