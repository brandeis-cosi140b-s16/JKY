I would give this place two to two and one half stars. My family has eaten here a few times and overall it seems to be about average. Fajitas usually have too much black pepper and the tortillas are too thick. The chips and salsa are good. Service is hit and miss and the kid's meals are a bit expensive. There are better and worse Mexican food restaurants to eat at in Phoenix.
