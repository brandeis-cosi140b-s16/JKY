First off, it's really awesome this place delivers and I appreciate that. Secondly, the woman who answered the phone was very polite and helpful. I ordered a shrimp burrito, & and a side of French fries. The French fries were seasoned perfectly and were very crispy. The burrito was just a mess. First off, the burrito had so much onion it was nearly impossible to pick it all off. Secondly, the burrito barely had any flavor all I could mildly taste was "salsa el pato" (that red sauce people use for cooking). Every bite of the burrito consisted of onion, cheese, some sauce, & a random piece of green bell pepper. Very disappointing experience with the burrito overall. Would I consider ordering from here again? Yes, but never a burrito.
