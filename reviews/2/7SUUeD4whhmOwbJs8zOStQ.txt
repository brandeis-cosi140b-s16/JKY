I'm kind of creeped out sitting at a table and seeing how dirty the booths are, even in the very dim lighting. The atmosphere is... well, outdated.   I'm sitting here trying to figure out why the restaurant is decorated with framed movie posters. There really isn't anything here that makes you think you're in a Mexican restaurant other than the food. Food has arrived. Chicken fajitas.  No sizzle.  Chicken is bland, no seasoning, and dry. Served with refried beans which tasted burnt... Not very good. Chips and salsa were good and plentiful.  Serving portions were large and menu prices were fair. I'd try a number of other Mexican Food restaurants before returning here.
