I live close to this restaurant, and I wish it was decent. It is not good. We have tried it three different times in the last three years and each time we say we will never go back. 
Food bland and greasy. The guacamole tasted fermented and made my wife sick.  The staff is not friendly - surprised they are still open.
Unless they have changed ownership and the menu very recently - definitely skip this one!
