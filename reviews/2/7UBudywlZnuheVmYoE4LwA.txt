Ladies and Drag Queens beware, the "sandbar" actually has sand outside. Not very friendly to those trying to impress in heels. I work very close to the Sandbar on friday nights after work alot (10-15) of people from my work go there. I have been there quite a few times but not somewhere I would encourage someone to go. I have had some of the food, minichimis are ok, tasty when you are drunk but it's no substitute for Jack in The Box tacos at 2 in the morning. 
There are a lot of great options for happy hour this just ins't one of them.
