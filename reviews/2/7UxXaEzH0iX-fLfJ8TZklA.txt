Don't bother.  Poor service, expensive for what you get, bland atmosphere.  Four of us went last Saturday at 7 pm.  Out of soup, out of one appetizer we ordered.  Server couldn't tell us about the wines.  They did have the shrimp appetizer (for $16), 3 shrimp to feed four of us - you'd think they'd gauge the number in your party and at least give you one shrimp per person.  But no . . . those babies cost $5.33 per shrimp.  Garnish of pickled cauliflower tasted like a hot dog with too much French's mustard - overpowering.  I wouldn't even think of ordering one of the entrees which cost upward of $20.

We wanted to sit outside, but most of the tables were only "for decoration;" out on the patio but not sealed, so unusable.  Restaurant redecorated with what look like pallets - could use some color - at least some plants.

I can't believe, and hope, this place doesn't make it.
