The experience has been sub par ever since the opening. 
Have been to this location a handful of times since the opening - with the understanding that there is a learning curve for the new hires. 
The food itself is as expected, but there are very long wait lines, food not prepared, no tea available. 
If this continues, I will seek other places to eat.
