My husband and I went for lunch this week.  The atmosphere is cute and very bright, the food is meh.

Hubs ordered the bacon burger with no bun and I ordered the bacon-wrapped hotdog.  We both ordered sweet potato fries and iced tea.  Aside from the price (over 30 bucks for lunch), the food was much like we would expect from any of the cookie-cutter casino cafes around town.  

Our food looked nothing like the pictures (and I don't just mean that is wasn't styled) and the sweet potato fries were actually tots.

We'll maybe give them a couple of months to settle in and try again, but I can't recommend then to anyone.  Stick to Smashburger for burgers.
