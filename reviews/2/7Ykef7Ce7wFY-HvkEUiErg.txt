Eh.  When it was Cocina Real (just a few months ago) ti was one of my favorite places.  But now, even though the menu is almost exactly the same and the people working there are the same, it seems like the food has gone down in quality and quantity.  Nothing comes with your order!  My order of quesadillas - no rice or beans on the side, no salsa or guac.  My friend ordered a burrito - also nothing on the plate but a burrito.  Pretty lame.
