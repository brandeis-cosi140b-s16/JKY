Way overrated! I had been to the previous location years ago and didn't care for it then. Decided to give it another go at it's new spot, and it's still ranks the same for me. The salsas are very runny, almost too runny, the bean dip was nearly tasteless. I ordered asada street tacos and wasn't impressed with them. The meat had no flavor. Overall I think this place is lacking that authentic Mexican flavor. I will not be going back. There are too many other Mexican food places on AZ that deliver much more.
