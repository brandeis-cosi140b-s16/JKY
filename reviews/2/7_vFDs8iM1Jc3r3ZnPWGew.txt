This used to be my favorite Chipotle but over the past two years the food quality has gone down hill. The chicken is consistently burnt and sometimes the mild salsa is tasteless, on the other hand the staff is always friendly. If your hungry for Chipotle drive the extra 5 minutes to 92nd street and Shea and you won't be disappointed.
