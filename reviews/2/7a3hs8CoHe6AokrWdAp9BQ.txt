Won't be back, been here a few times and keeps getting worse. Went for lunch today, waiter forget our tortillas with meal. Also asked what kind of meat I want, but they only put cheese ...duh... One entree, the menu description said comes with CILANTRO RICE, but they served with Spanish rice, and we asked about it they said we were wrong and CHARGED US FOR A SIDE OF CILANTRO RICS. We checked the menu on way out to be sure were didn't miss read it, but it did say CILANTRO rice. Instead of arguing we decided it WOULD BE OUR LAST TIME !!!! NEVER AGAIN WILL WE GO THERE.
