Not one to usually complain, but wow.  Pretty terrible experience here.  Didn't even get to have the food because we had to wait so long.

First off, this place is in a pretty bad part of town.  Right across from a correctional facility.  We sat down and a server didn't come to take our drink order for 10 minutes.  Then when we placed our order, we waited another 15 minutes.  Wondering what happened to our order, we asked the waitress to check on it and she said the kitchen had lost it.  When we asked if they could just make ours now, she said there were other orders before ours. The pozole was already made... 

So we just decided to leave. They didn't even offer to comp the drinks lol.
