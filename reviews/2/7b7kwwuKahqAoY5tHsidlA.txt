like Grand Master Flash said about the white lines "Don't Do It"
Rang dang diggedy dang di-dang 
Diggedy dang di-dang diggedy dang di-dang

my Torta Burro had no flava-dang, i was sad panda mang

this business has been in operation too long and clearly the owners (i doubt the original owners) stopped giving a shit. if they did the average rating wouldn't be 2.5 stars. i remember this place as a kid, i don't remember ever eating here. so i really cannot comment on how great it was. but like Sing High, the downtown nostalgia restaurants are extremely scary. just avoid this...it's not good. my plate looked sad, just a naked burro with a side of hashbrowns that were hardly crispy anywhere. the salsa was tasty, but i would hardly add a star to it. the service was compitant, but i couldn't understand her. i couldn't blame my ADD on it. my friend liked the menudo, but i wouldn't make that a saving grace for this place. cool logo on the building. very retro..but do not be fooled by it.
