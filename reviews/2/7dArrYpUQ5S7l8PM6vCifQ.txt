Large portions and good prices. However its extremely bland in taste. Ordered a green chili shredded chicken burrito w rice and beans. After waiting 20 minutes I had to inquire about my order and they informed me they forgot to actually make it. After waiting another five minutes it came out. Quite large but the beans tasted like canned refried beans the chicken was dry and tasteless, plus they gave me no rice.

So good if you are really hungry and don't care about taste.

I personally won't waste my time when I can get a better burrito at filibertos
