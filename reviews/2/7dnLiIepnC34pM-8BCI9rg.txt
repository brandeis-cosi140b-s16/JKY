This place is very close to where we work so the guys and I decided to check this place out.  Our first impressions was this was an upscale Roberto's.

The place was nice and clean and the service was fast 9/10.  My water cup was always filled.  The food was a 5/10.  My flower tortilla was a little hard - I ordered the Steak / Onions with Beans and rice.  

What really got me was when I got my check and we were charged $1.50 for extra chips and salsa.  We expected this to be on par with other Mexican restaurants that serve this GRATIS!  (FREE)

This brought my review from a 3 star to a 2 star.

Maybe we'll give this place another try after a few weeks.  We'll know better than to ask for extra chips however.  My last impression on this place was for the check.  It turned out to be about $40 after tip for a meal of three people. Kind of high in my opinion for the caliber of food we had.
