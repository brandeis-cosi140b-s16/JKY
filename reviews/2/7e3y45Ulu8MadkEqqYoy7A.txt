The prices are very high. We love this family's food and enjoy eating at El Sol and El Rico's. I must say I was really disappointed in the service and the prices were crazy. At El Rico's, you get twice the amount for 
half the price. The beans tasted like they were from a can and all the food was really salty. The prices and the service made this a bad experience and I wont be back. And the sopapillas are more like doughnuts..gross
