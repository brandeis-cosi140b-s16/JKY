Mediocre at best. I know that this place is located in the airport, but airport food can be great - this was NOT!

This was my second time visiting the Blue Burrito Grille in the Phoenix airport. The first time I tried a chicken and rice bowl. The whole thing was very bland, and needed tons of hot sauce. I understand that a rice bowl doesn't always scream flavor, so I decided to give them another shot while in transit back home to San Diego.

I asked the girl at the register how the Blue Corn Soft Tacos were like, and if they were any good. She replied " I don't know, haven't had it." Ok, maybe she's new. I ordered in anyway and got it with chicken. Once again, BLAND and tasteless. The lettuce was soggy, the cheese was stringy and the chicken had no flavor, not a fan. Even the side order of chips were stale and tasteless.

Not a fan, I won't be back.
