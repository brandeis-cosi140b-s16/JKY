A friend told me the food here was "legit".  I have to rethink my friend and his opinions!  There were 4 of us in our group - and we all had the same opinion...it was OK - wouldn't run to go there again.  The menu is unclear...I thought I was ordering a sea bass dinner - turned out it was tacos.  Two of our group got different types of tacos - they said they were "meh"...and that they've had as good or better for $5 off a food truck.  One other person got a pork dish, which I tasted and thought it was pretty good...however she said a lot of the meat was dry, like it was overcooked.  I wanted something other than slaw as my side, but they don't have just regular veggies.  I could have onions, or jalapenos, but that was about it.  They serve the rice and beans family style, which I've never heard of or seen before - pretty small plate for four people to have to eat from.  I had a prickly pear margarita which was excellent.  

The music was way too loud. Nothing "background" about it -  we had to practically scream to be heard.  Yeah maybe I'm geting old, but dining is usually a social activity and background music is best!  The overall appearance of the place is rustic/retro/south of the border kind of feel.

So overall, I'd have to say that the food was marginal at best.  Not likely I'll go there again.
