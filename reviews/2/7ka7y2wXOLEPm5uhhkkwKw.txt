I stopped buying their breakfast burritos because they jacked up their prices to one price $4.99 only and if there is a woman cook she makes them too small.  They also started adding water to their refried beans and guacamole salsa so you don't get what you paid for.  Who pays for small, watery bean burritos and liquidy guacamole salsa.  It's a ripoff!  I only buy their Monday - Thursday Specials.
