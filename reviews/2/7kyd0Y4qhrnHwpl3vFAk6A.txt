Love El Pollo Loco, great concept, killer food. I will not patronize this location any longer as the past THREE times I've tried to go, they are out of white meat chicken. Last night I went in and ordered a 2-piece Breast and Wing meal. The cashier paused and then said "we are out of white meat". Fine. I asked if I could wait while they grilled more. It was as if I'd asked for a million dollars! The poor guy was like "uh, it's going to take like 25 minutes".
Really??? It was 5:30 pm but you'd think I walked in at closing time.
This has happened 3 times now and we spend (as a family) at least $30-$40 per visit. 
Someone needs to figure out how a chicken restaurant can actually have chicken at dinner time. 
So over this location.
