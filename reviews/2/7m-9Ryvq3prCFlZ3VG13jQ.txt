I have gone to this Taco Bell regularly over the years.  Food is fine and I like the new redesign they did of the building.  They used to process drive through orders very quickly even when there was a long line.  I am sad to say the service has been noticeably worse lately.  Staff not as friendly...much longer wait at the drive through, and the worst part is the orders have been messed up numerous times.  This never used to happen here.  I hope some changes are made so later reviews can be more positive.
