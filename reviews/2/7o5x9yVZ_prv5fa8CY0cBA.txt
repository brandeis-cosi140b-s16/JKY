It's Roberto's, but noticeably worse. 

This is the only Roberto's that I have been to that is in a petro station. Sure, in other regions of the country that is normal, but the service is clearly slower here and the end product is significantly worse. If you can drive to another location, do so. There is a full-sized Roberto's on the WalMart-anchored stripmall on Cheyenne/Rainbow, although that one is not as fast as other locations either. 

Maybe it is just the NW. 

I have had the chicken burrito with rice/beans and perhaps the rolled tacos with guac. There is no condiment bar. It is really a piss-poor Roberto's, to be honest. Basically take-out exclusive since there are like two or three little round tables that most obese people that would patronise an establishment like this would tip over when they leaned their fat elbows on them. You've been warned. - E
