Went for lunch with high hopes of flavorful Mexican food and was disappointed.

The waitresses were very friendly and the Horchata was pretty good, but it ended there.

I ordered a Chile Relleno and Chicken Enchilada combination platter and the whole plate was bland. The beans and rice tasted like they were reheated in the microwave.

The chicken enchilada could only be identified because of the stringy white meat and not because the cheese or chicken had any flavor or seasoning to it.

The Chile Relleno itself was soggy and bland once again. The vegetables seemed somewhat fresh, but the preparation was very lackluster.

If I'm going to pay just over $12 for lunch, I expect much more. It seems I need to continue my search for a good Mexican restaurant near my work.
