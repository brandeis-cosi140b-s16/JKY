I've only been to this location a few times, but my very two recent visits made me so P.O.ed. They close at 10, so I made an order and chose to pick it up at 9:30. Got the same thing, Chicken Bowl with white rice, pinto beans, mild salsa/cheese/corn/sour cream/lettuce. But I was feeling a little special and decided to add chips + Guac. Went to get my order, it was pretty empty, only a couple people were eating and there was no line. I paid and I went home to find that they put black beans in my bowl, which I was like WHATEVER. I'm hungry. I took a chip and went to dip it in the GUAC and guess the freakin-what? Instead of GUAC, they gave me an unripe but blackened avocado half as my "guacamole" I was so pissed! Like seriously? I paid extra money for this piece of crap? You had all that guacamole in that tub but managed to find me an UNRIPE BLACKENED AVOCADO HALF. Waste of my money, they got my order wrong.

2nd time I came in AGAIN at 9:00pm I was the only one in line. There was 3 employees in the front, and the first two were talking right in front of me while I just stood there ready to place my order. The third one had this nasty look on her face as if my being there was a bother to her. She saw me, took notice I was ready, and then took out a towel and started to wipe down every tub and made me wait. Once she was done she took her sweet time to put on the gloves and said "what can I get you." I was agitated at that point but I just placed my order. When she was done I was standing in front of the cashier position but the cashier was no where to be found. The same angry lady that took my order literally YELLED OUT "CASHIEEERRR!....CASHIEEERRR! Where the hell is that girl!?" She went looking for her and a couple of seconds the girl finally shows up to check me out only to delay my exit a few minutes because she pressed the wrong buttons and the computer froze. 

I left pretty pissed. This location needs to improve. I guess I'll stick to my Dana Park location.
