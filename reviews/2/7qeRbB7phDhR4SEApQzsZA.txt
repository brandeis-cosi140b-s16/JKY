You ever go somewhere and wish you never had? Unless you are high out of your mind -- or with a tasteless palate developed over years of abuse/being a frequent patron of McDonald's and Taco Bell -- you will feel this same way after patronising Chronic Tacos. 

Note: most of the patrons in queue were one or the other, or in both states. 

This place fucking sucks. 

The service sucks and is at a snail's pace.
The food sucks.
The food sucks! 

Wait, did I get that twice? 

The pricing sucks. 

Why would I pay more for bland[er], shitty food than Roberto's*? Stop. 

I ordered the chicken burrito and got the worst burrito I have gotten outside of SYSCO-supplied military chow halls. This is the type of shit one would expect served in prison, not at an establishment one is actually paying to eat at. 

*If I want bland shitty Mexican, I go to my nearest Roberto's.

Rating: Barely two stars, "Meh. I've experienced better." 
Extra star for not killing me by way of food poisoning. Merry Christmas.
