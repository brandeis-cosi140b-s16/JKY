Meh was exactly the word I was thinking after I went here. It wasn't the worst I've ever had but just meh. So thank you, Yelp, for saying exactly what I wanted to. I went there with a friend last night since she had a Groupon for it and have been anxious to try it again since I've only been once four years ago. The fact that I didn't remember my experience there should have been some foreshadowing for my second go.

They had $4 Margaritas and $4 Mojitos on Wednesday night which is always alluring. I was pleasantly surprised by their salsa since I saw some bad reviews about it. It was watery but it packed some flavor so that made me smile. The service was good but the food was just meh. I got the spinach and chicken tamales which didn't have any flavor. I was expecting to taste some heat or at least garlic, cilantro or something but it was just there. I only had a few bites since I loaded up on the chips and salsa and took the rest to go but will be eating the rest since I'm frugal like that. Even though my meal was free, I was a bit shocked at their prices such as their combo plates which if you go to some other local Mexican places, are a good $3 or $4 less but I guess they gotta keep the prices up for the location they have.

The  food was mediocre but  I was diggin their patio area and the strength of the margaritas. I don't think I would ever go to La Paz on my own or say "Wow, I'm in a La Paz kind of mood" but will go elsewhere the next time I am craving some Mexican food for a more authentic and wallet friendly experience.
