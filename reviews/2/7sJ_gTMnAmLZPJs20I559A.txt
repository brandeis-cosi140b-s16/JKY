Okay, so we're in Arizona  helping my brother and his family move last week.  After sweating constantly since hitting the Arizona border, my brother suggests we take a break and grab some grub at his local Mexican restaurant.  We pull up to a place called Vaqueros, small little hole in the wall and I prepare my taste buds for a delicious, satisfying meal.

Service was quick, staff were friendly, but the food just did no justice to my carnivorous appetite.  I ordered a carne asada plate w/beans and rice and corn tortillas.  The meat was dry and not seasoned, the beans and rice were bland and I might as well have been chewing styrofoam instead of their corn tortillas.

Disappointing meal.  Being that the temperatures were still in the high 90's and humidity just choking me all throughout the day, a complaint at that point seemed futile.

Certainly glad to be back home in California where real Mexican food is just a stones throw away.

My rating would have been a negative 1 had it not been for the well mannered staff.

No bueno Vaqueros.
