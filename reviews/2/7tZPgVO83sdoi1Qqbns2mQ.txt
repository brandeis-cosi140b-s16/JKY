Unfortunately, I was disappointed by Sabor.  I was hoping that it was going to be everything that you read in the yelp comments.  It takes WAY TOO LONG for your food.   The food itself is pretty good.  Highlights were the arepas and the empanada. Taco Salad literally had zero lettuce.  The tacos Americanos were decent, but not exceptional like everyone seems to suggest.    The chips are cold; nothing special. The problem is that they don't give you chips when you order which makes no sense.  So after waiting about 15 minutes you may get some chips allowing you to enjoy the pathetic salsa bar.  When our food finally did arrive (approximately 30 minutes), I still hadn't gotten the margarita that I ordered. (Keep in mind that there isn't a wait staff, you order at the counter when you get there)  I had to remind them of this, they apologized and made it right away as they should if they want to sell their customers more than one drink.  (which I thought was the way restaurants generate most of their profit) Now I may be able to understand all of this if they were extremely busy, but there may have been four orders in front of mine!  I timed how often the kitchen was putting out orders and they took six minutes to make one taco!!!! ONE TACO IN SIX MINUTES!!!!!  I eat at 3 amigos regularly and that place is run tightly.    Skip this "latin street food" concept and go to where they have experienced servers and kitchen staff.  Sabor may improve with time, but they currently have a lot of kinks to work out.   I think the neighborhood hipsters want this place to be something that it's not because it sells craft beer in a can.  And yes, I am aware that 3 amigos has ownership in Sabor.
