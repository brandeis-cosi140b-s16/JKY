I do enjoy going to mom and pop restaurants because you never know what to expect. The Restaurant has a nice view of the mountains when they open their blinds. I experienced one of those beautiful pink and purple sunsets from my seat. 

The dinner started with chips, salsa and we ordered a side of guacamole . The guacamole was good ....you can tell it was home made! The salsa was also delicious! Then they served me some soup with noodles it tasted like salt water to me. I was hoping my shrimp dish would be something savory but it was more salty then anything .My shrimp was served over a red sauce with some Spanish rice. I could only take a few bites and packed the rest to go. 

We ended the dinner with some fried ice cream topped with strawberries and chocolate sauce. It was tasty but I think it would have been better if the strawberries were fresh and not in the compote form (syrupy). 

The environment is cozy but the food was a bit too salty for me .
