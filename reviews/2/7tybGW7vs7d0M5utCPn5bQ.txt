Tried this place the first week in C-U. After having read the reviews, I was expecting more. The woman at  the counter was friendly, but the food was disappointing. Ordered enchiladas verdes (chicken) - not the best, not the worst... but the place was so dirty, I couldn't finish my meal. The floors were so greasy/dirty you could slide to the table...the tables hadn't been wiped in who knows how long, and the garbage was overflowing (and we were the only ones there at the moment). There were flies all over the place. The produce looked so sad and wilted. The canned goods should be the same as anywhere else, but it doesn't seem like it's much better stocked than the Meijer or World Harvest for what I typically buy. I'd prefer to go to Chicago for canned goods, tortillas, masa, etc. (Tortillas and masa keep very well in the freezer) or if in a pinch, buy some from a restaurant that gets its goods from Chicago.

Bottom line- the food isn't anything remarkable and the lack of cleanliness is disconcerting.
