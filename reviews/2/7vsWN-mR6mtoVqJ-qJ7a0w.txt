These places are everywhere. Overpriced fast food with a catchy name. Go to Taco Bell and keep your money. The food is so-so. Nothing remarkable, I can't name one thing that is worth mentioning. The lines are long and the workers looked bored with Americans asking questions about the menu.

The two stars go to the lady making the fresh tortillas. But, nothing else. Don't waste your time or money.
