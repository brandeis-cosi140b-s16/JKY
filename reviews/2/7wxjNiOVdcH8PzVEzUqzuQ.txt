It breaks my heart, to have to write this review. I've  been frequenting  this place for the last 3 years, I usually come 4 to 5 times per month. 

The service and food are excellent I usually order the "Chilaquiles Rojo" with a piece  of "Steak" on top. I first noticed, that the portion of the chilaqiles and steak kept on getting smaller through the time. Now it seems that I am ordering a plate of "Rice, Beans and a side of Chilaqiles". I stopped ordering the steak on top about 3 moths ago. Now they started to charge for extra drinks (they no longer offer "Free refills"), in fact, they don't offer refills at all. Now you have to purchase a new drink every time. However, when you order a new one the refill the same cup and charge you the full price of a drink. I understand the fact of saving, however, as the portions kept on decreasing, the prices continue to increase. For that reason alone, I have to give them 2 stars.

Now don't get me wrong, I will continue to come here, just not as frequent as I use to.
