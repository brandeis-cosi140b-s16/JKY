I love the fact that they don't over stuff their burritos with a lb of rice! In fact they don't put rice in them at all. With that being said they didn't fill the burrito with much of anything. I ordered the carne asana and it came with 3 small chunks of meat. The only plus I enjoyed were their sauces. Both are on the spicy side and I enjoyed the green just as much as the red...
