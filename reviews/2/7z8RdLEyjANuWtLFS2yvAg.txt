I love Chipotle and I've been to many many locations throughout the country- this location is the worst. Consistently long waits with the line wrapping through the restaurant. I can't tell you how many times we've driven up only to leave because we see that line. My husband once timed it and it was a 40 minute wait. We've even tried to go on off time (1:00 lunch, early dinner) and it's always like this. There is no sense of urgency here at all and it's obvious that there is a huge time management issue here (maybe it's a management issue in general, considering the high turnover in staff). We've actually started driving all the way over to the Happy Valley Chipotle (a 20 minute drive) because at least we know we won't be in line for those 20 minutes. Ridiculous.
