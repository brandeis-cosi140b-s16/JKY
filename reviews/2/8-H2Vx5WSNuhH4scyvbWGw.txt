We had to send my friends order back twice,  and it still wasnt right.  The menu described it has having melted cheese.  Unless there is a special kind of cheese that doesn't melt,  it wasn't heated enough.  Granted,  this was New Years day at 1pm or so.  I will likely give them another try when the waitstaff maybe isn't hungover.
