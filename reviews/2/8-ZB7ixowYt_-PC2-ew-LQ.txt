The younger guy that works the cash register during the day is a douche! I went in yesterday and ordered 2 grilled chicken tacos.  There is a BIG picture of it on the menu right above the counter.  It clearly shows that the taco is prepared in a soft flour tortilla.  When I get to the table and unwrap the taco, I find it is in a hard corn tortilla taco shell.  I take it back up to the counter and state that I ordered the grilled chicken tacos.  He looks at me and says, "yeah, hard grilled chicken tacos".  I've been ordering these tacos for years, and have NEVER had one served to me in a hard shell.  I challenged him to show me on the menu where this was even an option.  He arrogantly walked around the counter to face the menu board and stared at it like a complete idiot.  Again I asked him, "show me where it says grilled chicken tacos come in a hard shell.  The mook walked back around the counter and stood next to the guy who was re-making my tacos...the right way.  Service has really gone downhill at this location.  It used to be really good, but this tool that they have dealing with the public now is not who I'd want representing my business.
