I have given this restaurant a few tries, and will probably not be going back. The salsa is amazing....very fresh and full of onions, tomato, and cilantro. Everything else I've tried is bland or has a funky flavor, even down to the refried beans and rice. I've ordered burritos, chimichaungas, enchiladas, and have always left disappointed. 

Also, the wait staff doesn't seem to be on their game....it took forever to get drinks and our order. I would look elsewhere.
