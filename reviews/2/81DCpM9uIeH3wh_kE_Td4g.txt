Alright, by looking at my rating of this place you may just write this place off.  But I have to explain.  I have been here twice and both times we had the same waiter, older gentleman with a southern accent.  He is one of the best servers ever, very prompt, polite and earns his tip.
Both times we noticed the place was curiously empty of patrons. The second time we went there was a banner out front that read "New Management", made me think it wasn't being ran well for awhile.
Now to explain the rating.  Both times we order their sampler plate, it comes with tacos, chimmichanga's, and something else. Anyways the first time after eating there I came home and puked at about 2 AM (we had dinner there).  The second time the same thing happened, so I thought too much of a coincidence.  Sorry Garcia's waiter, but I won't be back.
