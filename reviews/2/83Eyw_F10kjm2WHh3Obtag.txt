My brother in law wanted tacos, so we yelp tacos and found this place. Omg this place restricts your availability for tacos. Only had chicken, pork and fish tacos. Majority of people were whites and asians, we were the only hispanics there, the service was bad food was terrible. Only bright side was the chef came out to greet us and she was such a sweetheart, she's the only reason i gave this place 2 stars
