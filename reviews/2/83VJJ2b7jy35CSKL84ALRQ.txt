Quality of service has gone down lately. 

Most recent visit ordered Dr Pepper and a Lemonade by when we got to the window they were out of every syrup but cherry coke and tea. 

Food took a really long time and we waited at the front in a parking spot for ten minutes. The avocado salad had no avocado in it. The tacos were filled with some liquid that didn't seem to belong. The rice was chewy verging on crunchy. 

The redeeming item was the stuffed quesadilla, although pricey, it was full of flavor and meat. It saved the evening and we will get it each time. 

Have had a few bad experiences and long waits. Will try again soon to reevaluate.
