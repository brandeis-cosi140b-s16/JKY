Manuel's is a chain and with all chains, some are better than others. The one on West Bell Rd is great, consistent and friendly. This Manuel's falls short of the other. A co-worker and I have gone there 2ce for "gotta have Mexican " lunches and both times we were disappointed. The best thing is the chips and salsa--no problems there except no one comes by to check if we needed more. Which leads to the service. At best it's slow, at worst...well, I've had to refill our water glasses myself because there is just not that attention to the needs of the customers. The food has been "meh", not well seasoned, not cooked with that attention to detail that is so important. I asked our waiter this last time for a dessert menu. He brought the regular menu that had no desserts on it. I went to the front and asked for one and guess what? There's an actual menu devoted to desserts. That's an example of the lack of attention to detail, to subpar customer service and overall lackluster work ethic that made us agree that 2 strikes and you're out--will not be back nor will I be recommending this particular location to anyone.We should have known that, during prime-time lunch rush, there were not a lot of customers there. Now there will be less....
