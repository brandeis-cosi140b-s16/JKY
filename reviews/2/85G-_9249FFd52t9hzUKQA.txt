Very good service, and atmosphere but my husband and I BOTH didn't enjoy our food. Salsa that comes with complimentary chips was too spicy for my taste, although good flavor. My meal was not good, I barely ate any of it, and ultimately needed to get diner elsewhere. Husband ate his but said it definitely was not the best. Overall, I probably wouldn't go back here, but if worse comes to worse we will know it's there.
