Food was OK. $16 for nachos with beef added is pricey in my opinion, definitely take advantage of the Groupon. Never been to a bar that didn't make strawberry margaritas, and never been told "we don't make frozen margaritas!" $9+ for a drink and you can't crush ice in the blender? Won't be going back.
