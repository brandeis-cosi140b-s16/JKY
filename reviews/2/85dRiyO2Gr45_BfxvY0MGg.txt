If I had to use 1 word to describe the food, I'd say "sustenance". I had the chicken burrito and the seasoning was non-existent, however the portion was rather large. The horchata taste like the cheap kind with a gritty texture. The service was friendly, which is why I gave 2 stars instead of 1. I was starving so this was something to tide me over and that's it.
