My breakfast burrito was dry. The potatoes overpowered the taste so you couldn't taste any chorizo whatsoever. In fact, I think they put chopped up chorizo flakes smaller than the size of bacon bits in my burrito. Bummer!  The eggs were overcooked and needed more cheese for flavor. Essentially, my chorizo, potato, egg, and cheese burrito tasted like nothing. The best part was the freshly made tortilla.. Thank goodness I love me some tortillas de harina - since that's all I could taste in my burrito anyway.
