This is near my parent's house.  
I like my parent's they are pretty cool people, and this is their bar.  Due to proximity and I'd guess little else.
If I show up when they are there, my beer is free.  
This is why I go to Top Shelf.

The service is hit of miss.  Sometimes the glasses are kept full, sometimes our part of the bar or our patio table is a barren desert that no one ventures to.
I'd say it's and 50/50 split.  
The chips are the standard free chips.  Sometimes we get the cheesy spinach dip, which is good, but nothing special to see here.

I really like my parents, and the free beers (when we can get them) so as long as they keep going, I'll keep going.
