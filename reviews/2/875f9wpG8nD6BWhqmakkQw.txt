I know going after 9 is probably not a smart thing to do, but I was hungry. Bad idea. Usually I go to Chipotle but I was closer to this place. Let's just say gross. I got the tacos which first of all seemed like they were sitting in the freezer for an hour as they were ice cold. The chicken was cold as well. Lettuce was wilted too. I have never really been a fan of qdoba and now I know to not go back and I'll just stick to Chipotle. Only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because I went later.
