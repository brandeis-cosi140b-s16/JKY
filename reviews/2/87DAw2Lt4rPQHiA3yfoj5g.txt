I was very excited to try this place during restaurant week, the concept sounded interesting. A fusion restaurant, that combines the Chinese and Mexican cuisines. 
The highlight was avocado margarita, which was surprisingly tasty, the blended avocado gave it a thicker texture and the tequila used for it made it work. Since there were four of us we tried everything on the restaurant week many. The chilled corn soup tasted like raw corn, the consistency was weird. The potato salad was shredded raw potato, with Asian ingredients, and peanuts, the combination did not work. Second course consisted of a fisk taco and a mushroom taco. The mushroom taco was tasty, mushrooms and seasoning worked. The fish taco was not so good, the fish was partially cooked and it was not sushi grade, I had a very long stringy piece that was not eatable in my fish taco. Once I pointed that out to the server they brought another taco to the table, so that was nice. Third set if items were pork belly noodles with Chinese spices, the pork belly was not crispy, actually very fatty and difficult to chew. Also, a chicken tamale with mole was served, the seasoning was overwhelming, the mole had way too much chocolate in it and was way too much on the plate. Last items were dessert items, a flan made with goat milk, caramel and pineapple, this items was pretty good, the textures worked as well. The other dessert item was tapioca with coconut cream, this item was good as well.
