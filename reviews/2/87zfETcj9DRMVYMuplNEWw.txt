I'm spoiled by the old location we had here in Surprise where the staff was fun, friendly, and on point. This location, the staff is indifferent, in a rush, and don't even make eye contact with you when you order. I really hate that. 

The menu is the same and the food is good. But the staff is what really makes this location a 2 star joint. They really need to get a personality!
