Saw this place on the food network and I decided to try them out cause they looked so delicious on tv. I came here after a long night/morning of  partying/raging and ordered 70 bucks worth of food. Pretty much I ordered 1 or 2 of each taco and 2 build it yourself nachos. I tried at least 4 kinds of tacos. I don't remember which one but all of the meat in every taco tasted the same. Seems like the meat was boiled the same and the only thing different was the sauce they put on. I was kinda disappointed or maybe I'm too spoiled to the Mexican food here in San Diego. I would come back to this place.. The only reason why I'm giving this place 2 stars is because the guy that worked there gave me a discount for ordering so much and gave me a few extra tacos.
