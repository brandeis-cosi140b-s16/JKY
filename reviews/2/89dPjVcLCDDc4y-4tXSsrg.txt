We love Chipotle. but Do not like this location at all.. somehow there was no flavor.. the fajitas were tasteless and we were really upset, somehow ... Its just that we were in the area and wanted Chipotle and went to this location. I would not go back there again. 

After 2 days we ate at Chipotle again but the one that is closer home Happy Valley one, as we got our same flavor back, that is when we decided we will stick to our location.
