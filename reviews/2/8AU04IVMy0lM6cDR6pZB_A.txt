A chicken place where the chicken is dry, the lettuce is dry, the rice is dry. We tried a salad and the new CHICKEN, SHRIMP & SAUSAGE PAELLA BOWL. Had to go and ask for salad dressing twice. Tries all the sauces and the fiery wasn't, the spicy wasn't and the salsa wasn't fresh. All in all, the best I can say is "Nothing wasn't" what we expected. Just another fast food place that has been X'ed off our try list.
