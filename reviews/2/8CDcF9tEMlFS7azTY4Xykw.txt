A burrito a day kept the ramen away when I was an undergrad in California. Not only was Chipotle delicious, but also a great value. 

Yet, as I keep coming to this location, I keep being underwhelmed. 

Burritos, once $5ish, are now in the $6-7 range.

That $1.75 plastic cup of  guacamole, once bursting at the seams, is now filled by an air bubble (this isn't a bag of chips!!!)

The chips seem stale and not as lemony-salty as they should be.

The chicken is usually a miss, being over-seasoned and over-cooked.

My final straw was getting a part of a plastic bag along with my barbacoa o, which I discovered in my mouth. Yum.  

I still love Chipotle, but this location needs to improve its quality if you expect people to pay your increasing prices. I'll be back to check, but I am not going to hold my breath.
