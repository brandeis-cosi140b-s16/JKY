I was in the mood for a breakfast burrito and Los Rubios that is right around the corner from my house was closed. So I went here instead. Service was fast, however the burrito was marginal at best. I ordered the 'Breakfast Burrito', which had eggs, ham and pico de gallo. I was try to eat this and drive to work. 

Bad idea!

I had some 'juice' from within the burrito running down my forearm and onto my jeans. I wasn't happy about this. So I had to fashion the paper bag around the wax paper wrap to catch said 'juice'.

The only thing from here that I can say has been consistently good would be the super nachos. After I typed the last sentence, I realized, every time I had the super nachos were after consuming copious amounts of alcohol, which could be why it was good.
