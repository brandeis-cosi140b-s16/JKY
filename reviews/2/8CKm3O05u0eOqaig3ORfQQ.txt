We tried this for office lunch as a change from Chipotle, since the menu has some interesting options that Chipotle lacks (like fish!) and the dieter (not me) was impressed with the low calorie counts.

Next time, I'm going to suggest we all bond by getting root canals together.

Credit the low calorie counts to tiny portions, so figure your meal will cost the same as at Chipotle, but you'll get maybe 2/3 as much food.

The one counter clerk correctly noted that, since I was clutching a list of items, I was a captive customer. She did the obvious thing for corporate efficiency and kept me waiting (and waiting and waiting), then was snippy while taking the order (after having been sweet to the family ahead of me). She was even snippier to the person after me, so I guess it's not difficult to be inadequate to the glories that are the Blue Burrito.

The carnitas in the street tacos were dry and flavorless, so it's a good thing the portions were so small, as it would have been unkind to ask me to chew through more of that. Refried pinto beans tasted as if a box of black pepper had been spilled in the pot, but the rice was quite good. I can also summon mild enthusiasm for the chips, though the "hot" salsa also tasted more of black pepper than of jalapeno.

So if you're looking to pay $7-$10 a meal for small portions of mediocre (but varied!) food dished up at low speed in a mildly hostile but industrial-chic environment, this Blue Burrito will be your go-to lunch spot in Scottsdale.
