UCK!!!  I went in here a few weeks back with a couple of hockey buddies after a dinner at Yardhouse next door.  First off, we felt like we were already there while eating dinner because of the thumping of the walls from the music.

There is no cover, so that is a redeeming quality.  We walked in, used the bathroom and walked out.  Total round trip: 5 minutes.  This place will hold a lot of fodder for our website.  www.uradoosh.com  For sure!
