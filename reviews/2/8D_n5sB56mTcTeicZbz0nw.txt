I always thought the Mexican places back in my small hometown was just meh. But after trying countless places around Madison and the country I've concluded i grew up eating fabulous Mexican treats! This place is meh... Not that anything is bad it's just not that creative or flavorful. If you ask for a spicy sauce it's just hot with no flavor. Their salsa is plain and their chips are probably the only reason I go back, that and for what ever reason my SO loves this place( I think it's because it's fairly close by). The server we usually get seems to just go through the motions but never makes eye contact and isn't genuine with anything. But I'll give him credit he always gets our order right even though he writes nothing down.
