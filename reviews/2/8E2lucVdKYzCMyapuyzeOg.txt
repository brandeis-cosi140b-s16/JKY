This was the first place I checked out in NoDa, and I left so disappointed. Ok, so their claim to fame is fish tacos so that's what I ordered -- the beer battered white fish tacos. The white cilantro sauce was gross; the beer batter overwhelmed the taste of the fish. The corn salsa and chips were stale. The waitress offered to replace the meal, but since the tacos were bad and I was famished, I decide to order something safe . . . like a salad. Ok NoDa, don't let me down again. I am off to find my NoDa dining gem . . .  assuming one exists.
