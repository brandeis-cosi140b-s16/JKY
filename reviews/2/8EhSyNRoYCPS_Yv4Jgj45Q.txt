4 stars for their mango margarita 1 star for service and 1 star for the food, that makes an average of 2 stars for the restaurant. Our waitress was unfriendly and slow. Food was just not good, beef and chicken were shredded and not identifiable as meat anymore, chicken tasted like tuna! Salsa was flavorless and tasted like water!?
