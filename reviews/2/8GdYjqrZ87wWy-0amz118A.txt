I have been here twice. Once 6+ months ago - ate in, had the lunch special of two tacos and drink ($7.95), and carried out a al pastor platter ($10.95) just the other day. I noticed that maybe they do not have the lunch special anymore (?) - It was not offered on the menu. My first visit was good - I had a steak and al pastor taco, came with rice and beans and the drink was an pineapple aqua fresca which was surprisingly the highlight of the entire meal. The tacos were good and the value was great. This last visit-carryout was not a good experience-food wise. Service was great both times. The quality of the al pastor was below par in my opinion. Not sure I will return. I only ate half of the al pastor platter - threw out the rest - there was something gritty in there, I kept picking things out of my teeth. In my book (of a non waster), that says a lot. It was not good.
