What can I say except that I was thoroughly disappointed.  I feel like this place caters to out of towners that have no idea what good mexican food should taste like.  Build your case, you say...and I say okay.  I ordered the Enchiladas Suizas.  The chicken was cold, as if made earlier (which I'm cool with) but wasn't heated to temperature (problematic).  The sauce had zero taste.  Also, the complemented zucchini was flavored with a very exotic spice called salt (sarcasm).  Service was also so-so, with an upsell for shots every 10 minutes.  In summary, you could potentially do better at Chevy's (and I think of Chevy's as a B-/C+ kind of joint).
