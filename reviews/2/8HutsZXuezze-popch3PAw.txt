Went in here service was slow and kind of rude, if that makes any sense? The salsa brought out with the chips was not to my taste watery almost sweet! My wife ordered the fajitas and the onions were not done properly and it was just not seasoned properly. Not too impressed unfortunately Maricopa has very little options for sit down restaurants. Not too impressed haven't been back I'll stick to penascos!
