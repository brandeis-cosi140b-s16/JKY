Hubby and I decided to stop in for lunch today and it was mediocre at best. He got the fish tacos with vodka cream sauce & said it was amazing (only reason for the 2nd star!) I had the veggie chimi with house made red sauce. Everything from the stale chips and salsa to the giant raw pieces of green bell pepper were pretty tasteless. No hint of spice in the salsa or red sauce. The beans tasted like they were from a can and the rice was half cooked and crunchy. The prices are pretty crazy too, $11 for a chimi with rice and beans? No thanks! Will continue to go to Cilantro's or Tacos N More for better service & quality food for 1/2 the price.
