This place is close to my house and I've wanted to try it for some time. I was working near my house so the opportunity presented itself.

I had a combination plate beef burrito, cheese enchilada, with rice and beans.

The rice and beans were average. The burrito was shredded beef with onions and what I believe was a sauce made of tomatillos, since it was tart. The volume of the sauce and onions, equaled that of the beef (imagine you ordered a quarter pound hot dog, and the covered it with a quarter pound of catsup and onions), the proportions were totally wrong and I didn't care for it. The cheese enchilada was just okay.

Well as I said, I wanted to try it, I did, I won't be back. Too many good Mexican restaurants to return here.
