The food here is just not good. Not that it's particularly bad, but there is much better available nearby. It's bland in the way that wholly Americanized Mexican food always is, and the ambience of the place isn't really appealing either.
The people who only wanted chips and drinks looked like they were having fun, but I can't speak from experience on that. The view of the lake is kind of novel in this area, but you're really only looking out over a big pond at some apartments, which gets boring very quickly.
In short, I'm not really sure why anyone would want to go here, I'm pretty certain that regardless of what you're looking for, you could easily find better nearby.
