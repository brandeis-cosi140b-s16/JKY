Hostess and server were nice. Fish tacos were way too salty. Dinner salad had too much lime but was interesting. Salsa was mediocre at best as was the tortilla soup. They made a big deal about having fresh lime at the table to squeeze over the food but we never got it. We had to ask and got it near the end of the meal. The lime was not much help. The only stand out was the black bean soup. I would pass on this restaurant.
