With a name like Chronic Tacos, you'd think this place would serve some bomb tacos, they don't. They should change the name to seedy brick weed tacos. 

Nothing was fresh, tortillas were cold, tacos are way over priced and the staff was poorly trained. Management here must be non existent, no one knows what the other person is doing and there is no type of order at all. Had high expectations that were quickly let down.
