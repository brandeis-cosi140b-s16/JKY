Well, this place didn't bother me too much. I thought portion sizes were good and they were really on their game. There is a girl who works there that runs circles around everyone. Love her!!!  It's a chain, owned by mcdonalds. And Will I eat here again ... I don't know. But after what I saw today, I was not pleased at all. And have a picture to prove it. I was dropping my boyfriend off at work and a girl pulled up in her gross beat up Toyota with fresh produce in the back. She and another guy lit up cigarettes before moving box after box of food out of her car. Both holding the cigarette in their mouth while lifting and moving boxes. All I could think of was the ashes falling into the lettuce or it just falling inside by accident. Also, she obviously smokes in her car and a lot of the produce was in the back seat. It was very unappetizing to say the least. 
Why is an employee transferring produce in her own vehicle?  That's what I want to know. Who knows how long that food was in her car. Food thawing out and cigarette smoke going inside the boxes. 
Who knows if I'll go back to this location or others.
