Tried this place with the family tonight and came away very unimpressed. I wasn't expecting fine dining, but decent Mexican food. Anyways, off to the review.

Service: The hostess welcomed us with a friendly greeting and then taken to our table. The waitress came for our order and greeted us with a friendly attitude (which always helps). After the food order was placed, she was kind of slow and it wasn't that packed tonight. I made a simple request for some extra napkins and silverware (funny how I had to ask for it). It took a few requests to finely have the napkins. So, the service was okay at best.

Food: They started us off with there chips and salsa, but had a bit extra with the bean dip. The salsa could use a lot of work and add some favor to it. The bean dip was actually good and had some kick to it. Now for the chips and it's pretty hard to mess these up, but they tried. Some were spot on and some were left looking wet with grease (not very tasty at all). Onto the kids (2 kids) food, which was chicken strips with French fries . The chicken strips were good (I tried them), but they couldn't even get the fries fully cooked (some were well under cooked). Next up was my wife's food, which were the  Pecos Sour Cream Enchiladas. Now my wife loves sour cream, but these guys over loaded them to where she got overwhelmed by the sour cream and started eating my kids chicken strips. Now onto my order and that was the Arriba Taco Salad. Had them take it back cause I didn't see that it came with ranch dressing and I hate ranch dressing. Anyways, they were nice enough to fix that mistake. It was a pretty decent salad with the grilled chicken and guacamole.

Overall: I'm not impressed with this place and truly doubt coming here again. Nor will I be recommending this place to anyone else. They need a lot of work and hopefully they read this review and fix it.
