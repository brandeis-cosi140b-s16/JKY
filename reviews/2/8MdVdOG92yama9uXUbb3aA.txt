My fiancé and I love Garcia's, so it unfortunate I feel I need to write about an awful experience we had. We went to the Gilbert/university location in the evening of 12/2/15. It was busy, but not to the point of every table being full. When walked in we were told a 5-10 minute wait. We were eventually seated by the hostess who told us our waiter would be with us. We sat patiently and after about 5 minutes he came for our drink order asked if we wanted chips, which I found odd because our previous trips they automatically bring chips. We didn't see him again until 10 mins later when he was getting a larger table that was seated after us drinks and chips. I them asked him why we have received chips and just barely received water, he proceeded to say it was on another guy to get chips. At this point we were sitting 15 minutes and to be served, meanwhile the larger group that walked in the door after us received not only chips but drinks as well from the same waiter who was supposed to be our waiter. After 20 minutes and I know for sure it was 20 I told my fiancé we needed to leave, our money shouldn't be spent on poor service. As we were leaving we were approached by a young lady who asked if we were ok, I told her no and explained the situation. She offered to reseat us and get the order straight in. I declined because the service should have been that from the beginning or at least wait to seat us when a waiter wasn't so busy. If this is the type of service the restaurant is going to have I don't want to return, 30 minutes!
