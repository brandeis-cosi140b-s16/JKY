This place was not good tonight for several reasons.  The batter on the fish tacos was three times the size of the fish, basically just eating greasy batter.  There was salsa all over the seating, really the interior needs a facelift.  The staff made a good attempt, especially the gentleman working, but overall the whole restaurant was off tonight.  They couldn't get the orders straight, even with numbers!   Needs improvement!!
