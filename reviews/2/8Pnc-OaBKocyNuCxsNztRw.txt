Had an hour to kill before boarding, and this was the closest to our gate. Sat down for a drink and tried to order and appetizer (chips with queso) but they were out of it. So we settled for the chips with green salsa, yet it came out with two tiny plastic containers (like the kind you get from a taco shop you only go to after 2am) of salsa, one red and one green. Chips were cold and stale...and they cost $4.99. There was one waitress for the entire restaurant. Granted, it was 10pm, however, it was so packed we got the last table! She was definitely rushed but not her fault. We didn't try any other food, so not sure how it is! I would recommend trying another restaurant in the terminal!
