Coconuts has POTENTIAL if they would just pay attention to the details.  They better FIX IT quick before they go bye bye like many of the restaurants in Town Square.   Here's a punch list to FIX:

1. Give FREE chips and salsa for dinner and lunch patrons.

2. Bar Drinks should not take FOREVER to arrive and then be wrong and then take FOREVER to replace.  (get a NEW bartender who is GOOD)

3. If you offer 2 kinds of rice,  put the one the guest ordered on the plate and don't give attitude when you make a mistake.

4. Cook the rice all the way.  the flavor was delicious, but the uncooked kernels in my teeth not so much.

5. Don't be stingy with the avocado in the ceviche,  that sliver is pointless.

6. Remove that funky taste in the albondiga soup.

7. Green Enchiladas are not supposed to be SPICY, and enchiladas are supposed to be smothered in cheese.

8. Keep up the good work on the beans,  those were good. 

9.  Hire some waiters with brains.

Overall everything was just on the edge of being good.   I hope they can figure it out.
Good Luck!
