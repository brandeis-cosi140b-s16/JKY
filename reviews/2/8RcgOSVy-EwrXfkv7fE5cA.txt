We happened to be driving down Las Vegas Blvd and I pulled out my handy dandy iPhone and kicked open my Yelp app and found this little place. From the raving reviews I figured there was no going wrong. 

au contraire mon fraire, things went terribly wrong.. I ordere the nachos with Carne asada and I like a good piece of Carne asada and i am unsure as to how it is possible but the Carne had a water like fluid coming from it and making my nachos soggy... 

There is not alot to say other then that due to me pushing the plate away and heading out. I just could not do it. I am not the type to waste food and not take it with just in case those midnight munchies come back but unfortunately this was one case that I was not wanting to be prepared for the midnight munchies with the disaster I was served.
