Similar to another one of the reviewers, I also ate at La Perla years ago with my family, and I remembered it in a positive light.  While I have grown older, La Perla has just turned into a worn-down establishment.  The food was just okay, I had a chimichanga and my girlfriend had the chile relleno, which she pointed out, was very greasy.  The real problem I had with the restaurant had to do with its cleanliness.  While eating, I kept looking around and noticing how everything from the carpet to the walls was covered in a layer of filth.  The owners of La Perla should close it for a month so they can rip out the carpet, paint it, and replace the dirty, dirty booths.
