Canonita Express is located in the mall-like eatery in the Venetian Grand Canal Shoppes. Apparently it's the little sister restaurant of Taqueria Canonita, also located in the vicinity. Despite Taqueria Canonita having better reviews, I don't see Canonita Express living up to the standards of its elder sibling.

Like with most mall-like eateries, the food won't exactly be stellar, but it's quick, convenient, and relatively cheap. I decided to try the steak taco platter for $7.50 and it came with 2 crispy tacos, rice, and beans . The chicken version went for $0.50 cheaper.

The tacos had a nice crisp and the Pico de Gallo on the side was fresh. The steak itself didn't have much flavor, but the hot sauce packets did help. The beans and rice were mediocre at best.

My food came out relatively fast and our server was friendly enough to provide refills on my water. Aside from these factors, I feel there are better options in the food court to try like "Awesome Panda".
