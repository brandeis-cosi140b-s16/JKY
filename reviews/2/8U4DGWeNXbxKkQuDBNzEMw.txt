My friends and I came here for some good food and friendly service, too bad we were wrong. The restaurant has on the menu, a 48 oz margarita and the waiter kept trying to get me to get the Patron tequila, even after I repeatedly told him I HATE Patron, that was his first mistake, next, the waiter asked us if we wanted chips and salsa, we said yes, he brought them, we get the bill and its a charge for them, he never said they were not complimentary (where I'm from, Chicago, chips and salsa are complimentary), that was his second mistake (he did take them off the bill). To put the icing on the cake, I ordered  flautas, they were made with some of the thickest tortillas I have ever seen in my life, my friend's salad had no dressing, she asked for extra and where was our waiter?, running his mouth with his fellow staff members, it took him 15 minutes to bring a side of salad dressing, which we had to ask him for TWICE. Overall, I was not impressed and I will NOT BE BACK!!!!!
