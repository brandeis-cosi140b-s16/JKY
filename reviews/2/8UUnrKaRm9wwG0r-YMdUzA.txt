Good place for drinks and a few bites, but not recommended for dinner.

Loved the smokehouse margarita - very smoky and spicy, not for those looking for a typical margarita.  The avocado margarita was also great - cooling and refreshing.

Food is where things fell apart.  The menu looks amazing - we had a hard time picking what we wanted to order because the combinations all sounded so interesting.  So we enlisted the help of our server who was extremely passionate about the duck empanada and malbec braised short ribs which were in our consideration set.

The duck lacked any real flavor or richness - neither the foir gras nor the habanero came through.  But the short ribs were honestly a disaster.  The meat was incredibly dry - we couldn't even imagine how something braised could be so dry, unless they make it once or twice a week and then reheat in the microwave.  We barely ate half, and I typically will finish anything.

Guac was fine, nothing special.  Definitely not worth $12 in terms of either quality or quantity.  Ambiance was nice, but not enough to balance out mediocre (at best) food.  Unfortunate - I was looking forward to this meal.
