It's clean and the waitress was good and pleasant, the food  not so much. Fish tacos were just awful. I just don't like sweet fish or soggy corn tortillas. The fish was dark not nice and white. For the price they should use a better fish. Chips were good and so was the bean dip. I may go back and try something simpler. But only if I'm in the area     Won't go out of my way.
