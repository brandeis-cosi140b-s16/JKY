My friend and I rolled into LV late and were looking for a lively place to grab some food and drinks. I had high hopes for Cabo Wabo after several good experiences at Margaritaville. Thought this place would have a similar vibe and offer quality food. Not quite....I'll be heading to Margaritaville in the future. 

We sat on the patio...misters were nice in the 100+ temps. Waitress was nice...raucous, horrible sound from the karaoke bar was not so nice. 

The fish tacos were bland , runny and the tortillas were on the brink of expiration. They just had zero flavor. My friend said her tacos were so-so. Didn't bother ordering drinks for I knew it was going to be a quick dinner. 

I would have been better off at Del Taco (at least I would have pocketed some money to take to Sephora to buy some makeup or thrown the $50 in the slot machines). 

Will not be returning.
