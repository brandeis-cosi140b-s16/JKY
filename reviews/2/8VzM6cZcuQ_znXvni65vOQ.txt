Really expensive for "fast food Mexican". We just moved by here and thought we woudl try it out after reading the reviews on here. It was SUPER salty (yes I eat a lot of Mexican food and LOVE spice, etc. I know Mexican food is salty in general so for me to point that out, means something). The only thing I like were the tacos. They were decent and not too bad actually. The enchiladas were mediocre at best and their rice and beans were plain and boring. Think I'll stick with Filiberto's. They are much cheaper and these two are equal on the playing field of fast food for Mexican food.
