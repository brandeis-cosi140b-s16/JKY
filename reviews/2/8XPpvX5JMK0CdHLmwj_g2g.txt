This place used to be pretty good. Not sure if they turned over their staff, but the service has been atrocious lately. Twice in a row our order came out incorrect. Seriously? You're making tacos. If Taco Bell can get it right, why can't you? We'll give it one more shot, but if they screw up again, we're done. Lots of Mexican places out there.
