I've been here too many times in hopes that the food and service might get better. Well this last visit I had the mahi mahi which was actually good and I liked the veggies it came with. I don't like that they only have one salsa choice. The service is pretty ridiculous, since everytime we go we seem to be forgotten and ingnored. We waited 20 minutes before even putting our drink order in. Overall the food is just ok,nothing to brag about at all, and the service just sucks.
