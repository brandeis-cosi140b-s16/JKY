It was 11pm and we had just gotten back from the PHX airport.  We were on a mission for some late night tacos.  I've never been to a Del Taco before but hey, they're open late, so why not?

Pros: 
- cheap
- open late
- drive through was fast and cashier was friendly
- we got a bunch of coupons and hot sauce

Cons: 
- way too much salt in that beef
- just not that good (I actually think Taco Bell's hard tacos are better... can't believe I said that)
- random person hanging outside of the front door prompted us to use the drive through
