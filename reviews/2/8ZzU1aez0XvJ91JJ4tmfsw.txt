I was really looking forward to having dinner here. The wait was pretty short for a Friday. The food is good, not great. But the noise is unbelievable. My friend and I could not hear each other and cut our meal short because of the noise. The floors, walls and ceiling are hard surfaces and the voices just overwhelmed us. Very disappointed.
