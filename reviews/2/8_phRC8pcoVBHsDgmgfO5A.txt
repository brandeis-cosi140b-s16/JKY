It seemed like the stress test on Bar Rescue... No one had any clue what to do. I ordered a tanqueray and tonic with a lime, ended up getting a Tecate and a lime.... Food was sub par. Not worth it. Margaritas weren't that great. Mine was the one with a mini corona bottle, and it basically tasted like a corona with a little bit of tequila in it. Go to Rurus if you want better Mexican food.
