I got their green chile which was good except the rice had uncooked grains here and there, so you'd chow down on the rice that was mostly soft and all of a sudden your teeth would hit something hard. I pulled it out of my mouth and it ended up being an uncooked grain of rice!  It was almost insidious. We also ordered a burrito that was not included in the bag that we did not discover until we got home, very disappointing experience.
