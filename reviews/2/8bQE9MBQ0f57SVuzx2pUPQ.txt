For the amount they charge, I was expecting the food to be better.  I actually felt ripped off when I left.  I ordered the Chile Relleno and it was bland and had a bad after taste.  The chips and salsa were good though, so even though I barely touched the main course, at least I didn't leave with a completely empty stomach.  The staff were friendly and the atmosphere is great, but overall this place comes up short in my opinion.
