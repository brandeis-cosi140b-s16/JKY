This is a good choice for a 24 hour meal place, although the service is not too good. I usually come and get the Carne Asada fries with a churro and it comes to around 11.50$. I always say no onions which means no salsa and no guacamole. Last night when I went, they has onions all over my food and since I had placed the order over the phone, I was home when I realized the mistake. When I called back, the lady was like "oh yes I don't know why he put on onions" and when I continued to ask for a refund or a new meal she said no? 
Since when in the service industry do you not allow refunds or making them new food? That's horrible costumer service if you ask me. Very disappointed.
