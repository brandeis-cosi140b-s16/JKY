Wow, kind of let down.  I have been to other locations and always received a pretty good meal.  Most likely between 3 and 4 stars.  On an early Saturday evening, I walked in to an empty restaurant.  I order the combo: two tacos and one quesadilla with rice and beans.  My order was to go.  I live about 7-8 minutes from there.  

When I got home my food was room temperature.  It was like they pre-cooked the meat and then just warmed it up quick when I got there.  My quesadilla was a bean taco, yup definitely NOT a quesadilla.  That is it.  Not impressive.  The side of rice was great.  The side of beans was salty.  It is just not what I am used to from other La Bamba visits.  

Step up your game.
