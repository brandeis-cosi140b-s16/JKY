Had a bad experience today.  Food took an hour to arrive.  There were quite a few people who arrived after us, ate, and left, all before we got our food.  Compensation was a glass of beer and some chips (which should be free anyway), but to be fair, we didn't ask for any entrees to be removed from the bill or anything like that.  The waitress was somewhat apologetic, but she didn't actually offer the free items; a woman who must have been the manager saw how long we were waiting and offered us the refills/chips.

The food was quite good as always, but I'm afraid that after receiving poor service on almost every occasion, I'm not headed back here.
