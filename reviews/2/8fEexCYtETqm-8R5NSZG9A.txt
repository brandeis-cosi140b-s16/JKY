My friend and I were instantly greeted and taken care of. We started with ceviche and guacamole. The ceviche was nothing outstanding, mostly consisting of pickled vegetables and shrimp. (Not my preference). Guacamole was good. We also tried to of the margaritas which I would go back for. 

I ordered the chicken burrito. I'm not sure how they prepare their chicken, but it tastes like plastic. It was not shredded but cubed and comes out very rubbery. The only other filling I could see was rice and beans. In retrospect I should have been honest with my server and sent it back to try something else. My friend also did not like what she had, so maybe that  deterred me.  

When I spoke with acquaintances they relayed similar stories and had not been back.  We all also agreed that it is severely overpriced. 

2 stars for atmosphere, margaritas, and service (even though we were the only table).
