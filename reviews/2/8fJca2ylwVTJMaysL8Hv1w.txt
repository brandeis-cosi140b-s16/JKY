I used to love coming there to get my burrito fix as their food is way better and fresher than of the "Bertos" but lately it's gone down hill in way of service and food. Last time the food was way over salted but I let it slide. Today my burrito was just sloppily rolled with air pockets all throughout and I couldn't even see any chicken till I almost finished it. I only ever order the pollo asado burrito so I can't speak for other dishes on the menu. Whoever runs this place needs to be fired and have all new people come in. It's also not as clean as it used to be. I don't care if service isn't that friendly, I just want my food and my food done right but if you're somebody who cares about great service then this is not the place for you!
