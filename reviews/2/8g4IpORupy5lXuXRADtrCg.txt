"Ditto" to much of what Carina M. says. 

"Best of Las Vegas"? 13 YEARS in a Row??? Sorry. Whoever was on the Judging Panel needs to get out more. Might I suggest Mexico (or most any town within 600 miles) to establish a base palate. Best "Room" maybe. Best "Food". Bzzt. I hope not.
Chain Mexican at best. Perdon mi amigos y amigas.

There is much to applaud. 
The multiple salsas at the, All You Can Eat Chips and Salsa Bar.
Decor visually impressive.
Blue Agave Bar (shares some space) w/ it's overhead suspended parade of Tequila bottles. Kinda a unique visual.
The "Table Side" Guacamole. They make it Fresh right there! (extra $ my guess)
Portions in general are on par. (big)
The $23.99 Margarita. 40oz. (monstero de borracho, I'll call it)
Waitress was of caliber. I could tell she'd be happier being somewhere else. But, she was nice I want to add.

Beyond that there is the ever present casino background noise as if you are on some game show that is just beginning, or at the movies and the THX sound trailer plays and builds up every so often. Or the maintenance employee with his Walkie-Talkie squawking noise 10ft away during the dinner rush. And if there are 3 of you and you get a booth, avoid being in the middle. The seam between cushions is not friendly to you bottom (or should I say culo).

And the real reason I'm motivated to write this review............
my poo was not happy this morning.
Wait. Maybe it is authentic? I did have the water.

On that note. By all means.........................

Fiesta Casino on Rancho, near the Texas Station Casino.
If you park in the covered spaces on the south end, you're maybe 100ft from the restaurant. just an fyi.
