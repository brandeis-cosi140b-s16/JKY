Spinach con queso always resembles baby vomit, so it better taste exceptional. I could have made this at home, with a box of Velveeta and a can of spinach. Gross. Salsa, eh so so, on the soupy side. It's never a good sign when you walk into an establishment and wait 30 seconds, wondering if you should just seat yourself. I was generous by giving two stars, my cocktail was tasty and they had my favorite candy, which I took a handful of upon my departure. I won't be going back.
