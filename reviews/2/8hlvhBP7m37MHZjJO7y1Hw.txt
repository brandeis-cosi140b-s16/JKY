I always feel like I'm in the twilight zone when I read reviews about this or the neighboring PF Changs. It's literally only about atmosphere and the drinks. The food is beyond bland in my opinion for the price. I've tried the various meatless enchiladas, bean burrito and vegetable fajitas - the fajitas were OK but everything else was incredibly bland( I don't even know how you can make a cheese enchilada bland but somehow it is.)  So again - Atmosphere, Service and Drinks is what this place is all about.
