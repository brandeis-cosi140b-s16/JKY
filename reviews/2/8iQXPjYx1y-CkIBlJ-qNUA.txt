Not very good. Lady behind the counter was really standoffish while I was asking my questions. Best part of the whole meal was the side of sliced avocado. Beans and rice were unflavorful and the beans taste canned. However they gave me a ton of food, so if you like quantity over quality this place might be good for you.
