I wasn't impressed with the food at all. I had the meat and bean chimi. It was basically a huge enchilada as in was drowning in red sauce. The flour tortilla wasn't even crispy.

On a whole I won't be visiting here again. The lady at the counter was rude, and every time she tried to take my order she was interrupted by the cook.

The restaurant is very clean. The service was quick but I'm not sold on the food.
