Ordered a couple of breakfast burritos. Not too bad, a little dry, too much potatoes, had better. The hot sauce was decent and pricing on par. However, what put me off big-time was the obvious pro illegal immigration, anti Border Patrol posters. You wanna have your political opinion? Great, but it doesn't belong in a restaurant. I'll take my $ elsewhere where they respect the laws of our country.
