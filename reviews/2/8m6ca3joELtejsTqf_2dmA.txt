You can never go wrong with the food at chipotle. However, this location lacks speed! I called chipotle in the morning and asked what time they open. The guy on the phone said they open at 10:45am. I found that strange but I showed up at 10:45 only to find out they don't open until 11:00. They opened the doors at 11:05 with 15 people standing outside waiting impatiently. Once we got in, we waited 20 minutes until I was able to order! Not sure what they're doing wrong because other chipotle locations are quick and I never worry about long lines because they're fast. If you are in a rush don't come to this location!
