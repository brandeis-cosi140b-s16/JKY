We stopped in when my daughter decided that she wanted a quesadilla instead of a pizza. We were all outside eating our meal and she refused to eat. I thought she was just being picky until I tried it. The tortilla tasted old, the chicken was dry and the overall taste was bland. 

The service was quick and everyone was friendly and that is the only reason I gave it two stars.
