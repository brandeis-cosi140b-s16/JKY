El Nopal was my first meal in Vegas.  It is located in the Stratosphere.  There is very limited seating in the dining room.

I ordered the carne asada nachos.  When they came out they LOOKED good...but the steak wasn't hot or even warm.  The steak was very chewy.  There was barely any cheese on the nachos.  I was expecting awesome liquidy queso cheese...instead...a few strings of shredded cheese here and there.  

El Nopal was not worth the money spent.
