The hubby and I stopped here during a quick-but-epic 4-day Vegas run. Despite being an open-air setup, the outdoor area was perplexingly stifling. Tables were crammed together uncomfortably, and there was very little air movement. The tabletop was sticky, which I attribute to the tacky finish rather than uncleanliness....but I could be wrong. More importantly, though, anyone who is in Vegas on a budget (and we DO exist) should not step foot in this place. Overpriced-but-average bar food and drinks are not my thing! Our margaritas were $15 a pop, but not overly large, strong....or good. At that price, that drink should give me a back rub, or at least a kiss!

In short, SKIP IT.
