Came on here to see whether I was crazy or if other people were experiencing the same two things: really slow service and very small portions. Yes and yes, it seems like. 

This has to be the slowest Chipotle in the nation... I will drive out of my way to go to other locations just to avoid the cashier who is there at night and wants to have really awkward conversations with EVERYONE in line. I even tried to be on my phone one time so I could avoid it. 

If you need to finish a book, head over to Chipotle and wait in line. You'll have the time to read that and maybe another.
