The food is amazing, the atmosphere is fun,  but the service is really hit or miss! We've had five start service and we've had service that doesn't even deserve a star. It's such a shame because this place has such potential! If you have a lot of time on your hands go ahead and try it out. Last time we were there my husband had to walk back in the kitchen to get someone's attention after waiting to order for 45 minutes (with no drink or anything) Another thing I find weird is......sometimes we get chips and salsa, and sometimes we don't. I believe they are free, but not sure....
