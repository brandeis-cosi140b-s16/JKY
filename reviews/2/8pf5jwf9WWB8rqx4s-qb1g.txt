I like their salsa, chips and prices. They put some sort of strange chemistry-made cheese substance in their burritos that is kind of gross - it tastes like a combo of cream cheese, american cheese and sour cream - everything tastes premade and slapped together - nothing tastes fresh. I have only been here twice, and prefer Chipotle's over this any day of the week!
