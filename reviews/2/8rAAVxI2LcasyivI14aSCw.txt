I am not sure what ails this particular branch, but quality is bad and portion size is comparably smaller. I only order for either a veggie bowl or a chicken bowl. More often than not the rice turns out undercooked and the chicken is dry. Even if I am paying for an extra helping of chicken or guacamole, the serving size is always less. I have been to other places and never felt disappointed the way I feel at this particular branch.
