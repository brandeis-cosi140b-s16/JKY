I think I must have ordered the wrong thing, since everyone seems to be raving about this place.  I tried the cheese enchiladas, which consisted of some red sauce (tasted the same as the red sauce I buy from the store to make my own enchiladas) poured over tortillas that were covered in non-melted cheddar cheese.  It reminded me of the fake enchiladas you get in public school cafeterias.  My husband had the nachos, which were nothing special.  I think we probably made the mistake of ordering the wrong items, but I'm not sure if we'll be back to have another go.
