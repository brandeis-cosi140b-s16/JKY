These guys.. man it is frustrating.  They are right by a concert venue, so they should be used to crowds on concert nights.  You'd think it was their first time.  It takes waaaay too long to wait for a drink, and unfortunately, our bill was messed up.  Booo... however, they are close to the venue, so I will return.
