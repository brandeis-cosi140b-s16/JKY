Chipotle is so good that even when it's not, it's still better than most meals under $15. Why 2 stars? Well the employees here were loud, screaming over the music, and seemed annoyed to be working. My portion was half what I'm used to after eating Chipotle for 8 years. The seating in this store is weird, too. Most customers seemed to be getting their food and going to the nearby food court. Awkward. 

I prefer the one in University City where employees smile and the food looks fresh.
