I don't do this very often, but Cafe Rio you're on my sht list. Keep not paying attention, and wrecking my order. Three times I have been given the wrong order, in the last month. It's a simple matter of, 'you only have one job". Listen. That's it. Love the food. Awful service. All the way down the line.
