Got ceviche and was warm and the shrimp has not been cleaned, asked the gentleman working if I could replace it for something else and he shouted "WHY!" I had told him that it was warm and wasn't very good and again asked if he could replace for something else and he said "I can't reuse that, so no" I asked if someone doesn't like the food they don't replace it with something different and he said "NO". After that I threw my napkins away and walked straight out, never eating at this place again.
