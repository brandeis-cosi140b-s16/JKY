I love the food but I am so sick of the attitude. Everytime I go I get rushed through the line. I also get shit if I ask for stuff on the side. I have a picky family! Sue me. I have to take breaks from Chipolte because I get so sick of getting rushed out of the place and the bad attitudes from almost all the employees. Hate your job? Then quit and let the rest of the world be happy l.
