First let me start off by saying that the food is amazing. My 2 star rating is the atrocious service we received last night.

The restaurant hours said that they were open til 10 pm on Sundays. We arrived at 8:40. When we walked in our flustered hostess (there were only about 5 tables in the restaurant) didn't even greet us, just said, "Our kitchen closes in 20 min." Lovely way to start off the meal. When we were seated our drink order was taken by a nice gentleman. The drinks were brought to us by a woman who looked as though by us sitting in her section we were doing her a disservice. I have been in the service industry for 10 years so I can handle mediocre food but bad service is a deal breaker. We ordered our apps and then about 10 min later ordered our entrees. 20 min after we ordered our apps everything arrived all together. The portions are pretty large there so we weren't too pleased that everything was brought out at the same time and would unfortunately get cold. 

I'm not one to complain cause I know how it is to deal with people that can't be pleased but this made me want to literally ask our server if someone had just died because of the attitude she had. 

I cant really say that 'Id return. This place is 45 min away and I don't wanna waste my hard earned money at a place where they couldn't care less how their staff treats the patrons. 

Horrible service. Horrible hostess. Disorganized. Good food.
