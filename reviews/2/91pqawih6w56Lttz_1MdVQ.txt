I have been to Someburros a few times now... and I have to say I am not too impressed with this place on this trip I ordered the Crudo Burro - (Tender machaca beef combined with a spicy, light green tomatillo sauce with beans. The beans had no flavor really I covered them with salsa the burro had way to much extra tortilla but the meat in side was really good could have gave me a pile of that on my plate would have been a better meal... So I am not sure if I will go out of my way to revisit this spot.
