Waited almost 2 hours for food. One server for about 11 tables. Poor thing was running like crazy. First batch of chips we got were cooked in so much leftover oil they tasted like old oil. Second round was better. By the time we got our food we just had a packed up so we could leave. No drink refills. However very nice folks. I may give it one more chance just because of how nice the owners were.
