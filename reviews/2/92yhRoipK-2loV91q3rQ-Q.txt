As far as Chipotle overall goes, 2 of these stars go simply towards that.  Taste of food +1, service overall -1 (yes, it's that bad).  If this wasn't the closest one to my house I would definitely stop going.

They have screwed up my order more times than gotten it right -- and this is from ordering online, where they have a physical piece of paper directing them what to put into it.  Several times I've ordered online and come to the restaurant at the pick-up time given on the site and come to find out they haven't even MADE my order yet.  Not terrible since it's fresh but why bother putting a pick-up time?  They weren't even busy either.

I think this location just has a lot of lazy employees.  Food quality is still good in comparison to other Chipotle restaurants, but perhaps speaking slowly and clearly would be ideal when placing an order.

If ordering online, it's a mixed bag.  Sorry.
