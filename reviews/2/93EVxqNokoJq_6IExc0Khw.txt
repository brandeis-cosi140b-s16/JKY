I've been curious about Wahoo's since I saw it appear in Boca Park. I'm probably behind the times here, it's probably been open for YEARS, but I've never made my way here. 

Typically I head to Rubio's if I want fish tacos, but I happened to be in the area and Wahoo's was close. Because I'm comparing the fish tacos to many, many fish tacos I have eaten in my day the rating is low. 

The inside of the restaurant is a little out-there for me - the artwork on the tables, the over-done surfer theme, etc. I get it, but it's kind of too in your face.

Service was OK. I got my food to-go so I can't comment on much besides the woman who took my order. I asked for recommendations and she couldn't really help me out, so I just said, give me fish tacos. But then I had to go through - do I want them Cajun style? Do I want a combo? Do I want cole slaw/regular dressings on them? The good thing here is - the variety.

I ended up with a 2-taco combo with brown rice and black beans. The rice was disappointing mostly because I expect rice to have a bit more flavor at joints like this, especially with the "taco" theme (think: spice, not: bland). Beans were well-cooked and flavorful. 

Tacos - I got one of each: one regular fish, one Cajun flavored. Believe me, get the Cajun flavored all the way. The regular fish taco was a huge let down compared to the Cajun. I also got the slaw topping, which was OK, save for the bits of CILANTRO I had to pick out of my tacos. *shakes in disgust* All in all the flavors are there, but these fish tacos were a bit on the small side IMO.

Overall I've had better fish tacos elsewhere and I will most likely be heading to Rubio's the next time I have a craving.
