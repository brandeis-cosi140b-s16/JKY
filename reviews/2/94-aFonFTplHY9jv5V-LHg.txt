I used to go there more often, but the last few times the wait has been waaay too long.  

The last time I went, I ordered just a bean and cheese burrito.  It was like 3pm, not a busy time at all.  It took them 20 minutes to get me the burrito, when I was the only one in the place.

I got home and started to eat only to find that the beans tasted like canned beans from the grocery store.  I'm wondering, did they run out and run over to Fry's to pick up a can of beans?!

Anyway, I'd rather go to Gordas when looking for somewhere in Laveen for Mexican food.  But I will probably still stop in from time to time, the enchiladas at Villas are really good.  The bean burrito was not bad before when I have had it.
