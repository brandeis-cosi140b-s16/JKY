Well I stopped in because I saw the 4 1/2 star rating which is hard to obtain, BUT the Enchilada and Taco plate I ate was surprisingly Bland with a capital "B".  The chicken was possibly just boiled in a lot of water with little to no seasoning.  I saw no evidence of vegetable seasoning either, such as onion or cilantro throughout the chicken.  The salsa was not seasoned very well either and was watery.  It almost tasted just like the glass of water I had.  

I will say this; the service was fast and attentive

Thank goodness the food was inexpensive or I would have been mad as all get out.
