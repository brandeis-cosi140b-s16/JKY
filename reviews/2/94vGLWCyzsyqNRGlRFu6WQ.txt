I started going there since they first opened it was great and steadily the hot dogs have been getting worse to the point that last night I guess  the buns were left in the microwave too long there were rubbery and hard on the bottom and just does not taste as good I love hot dogs and I love this place but they better be careful as a quality is going downhill very fast
