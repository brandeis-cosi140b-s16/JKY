Let me just say I'm new to yelp and figured I must add a review.
I been to this new location 3 times now and I can say I don't want to return. 
Went in a week ago to get my usual salad and while ordering my food I had to yell for them to hear me. I got to the cashier and she was very nice and told me the next time I come in I have a free meal on my stamp card considering I had 9 before I went in there. So I came in today to get my free meal and bought one also for a friend, a different cashier told me I would buy one meal and get one free. After paying I asked for a new stamp card and she handed me one with no stamps? Confused, I asked for a stamp and she told me I didn't have enough on my previous card to get one and argued with me. I had 10 stamps enough for one free and I bought a meal, but yet she couldn't give me a new stamp for the one I bought? Horrible customer service. Get it together.
