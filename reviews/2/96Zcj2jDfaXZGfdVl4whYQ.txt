I have eaten here a few times with mixed results. The first time was, by far, the best.  I had the Glendale burger and onion rings.  Both were fresh and tasty, the rings were particularly good with the fluffy batter they have. On my second visit things went down hill. I wasn't in the mood for a burger so I asked the person behind the counter what they liked. They said the carne asada burro was excellent, so I tried that.  Bad idea! After several bites of my burro, I was convinced that I had been given the wrong item, as I had yet to detect any carne asada whatsoever. Then, there in the middle of the burro were three, small, fatty, burnt pieces of meat. Totally gross. They tasted like things other places would trim off and toss in the trash. I alerted the management to the issue and they apologized and gave me my money back, but why in hell would you recommend something that was so obviously bad? After that, I gave them another chance, ordering the bueno burger, but it was just ok. There is nothing to make me really want to go back. Take it or leave it, just don't get the carne asada burro!
