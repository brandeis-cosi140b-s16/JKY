I have been to this location about three times since it's the closest one to my house. I am dissapointed EVERY time I go. This time was alot better customer service wise, they greeted me as soon as I walked in and since it was 5:30pm the line wasn't very long. Everyone was attentive, I ordered a steak bowl to go....and this is where the problem lies. They are never consistent with their product, the steak was very tough and over cooked....I ordered pinto beans and those were hard/undercooked! You would think that Chipotle has a standardized way of cooking their food...I just don't understand. Not sure if this is a franchised location but they are always missing the mark at this particular location.

I've had Chipotle in Litchfield, Tempe and in L.A and this is by far the worst. Their cooks need to get it together. I look forward to Chipotle but with food like this I'm going to avoid this location even if that means driving further.

I really hope they read this and figure it out, you're losing customers! Like I said customer service was good but the food is not cooked correctly.
