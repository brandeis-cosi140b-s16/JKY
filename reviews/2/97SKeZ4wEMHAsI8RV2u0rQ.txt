The food here was good. In fact, the food was even better three days later as leftovers. Don't ask why, some food is just like that. The service, however, was not so good. We came in 40 minutes before closing. That's more than enough time for two people to eat and get decent service but they acted like we slipped in the door as they were locking up. This is the only restaurant I have ever been to where our drink order was never taken. Good thing they brought a pitcher of water out. Not once did our server stop by during the meal to see if we needed anything, just dropped off the check. We got a lot of food for the money but probably won't be going back because I guess 8:20's too late to eat dinner.
