Thankfully we were with friends that made the evening worth remembering, because the wait time and the food were not leaving lasting good memories. 

The appetizers - crab bread pudding and cheese fondue were both excellent, but the entrees lacked a balance of spice and flavor we were expecting. I personally think that the mussels were extremely "fishy" tasting and once I consumed one - it took forever to get that awful taste out of my mouth.

Not only was the service slow to get our food, but then we seemed rushed to give up our plates by a waitress that was much faster at attempting to take the plates then to bring them to us. Even after management learned of the over hour wait - all he had to say was EXCUSE after EXCUSE instead of trying to make us satisfied at all.

The cleanliness of the overall business wasn't bad, but coupled together with the lack of service and customer appreciation - I wouldn't think about going back for another try and do not recommend this place to anyone. 

Though the view in the upper dinning area was fantastic - it got quite cold by the time we ate and the heaters only heated some of the area - not ours. Add the price to the mix and I end up giving this a two star review!
