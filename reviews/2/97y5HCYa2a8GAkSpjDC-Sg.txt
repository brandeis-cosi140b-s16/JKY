For some reason I was mad craving tacos so I checked on Yelp and found this was the closest one that was open. This eatery is located at the back of the Bally's casino, next to the new Drai's location. It is a pretty big space... we opted to sit at the bar and order some grub. I got 3 shredded beef tacos and my friend got an order of fries and a tall Bud Lite. The fries were pretty standard, and the tall Bud Light I believe was like $6... pretty good deal! The tacos were $2 each, but really really blehhhhh. No flavor whatsoever. I ate all three anyways because I was super hungry. Overall, it was an okay spot that is open late with good prices... next time I'll try to find another taco spot before coming here. Thanks!
