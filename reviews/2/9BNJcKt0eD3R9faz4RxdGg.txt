I was torn between 2 and 3 stars, but then I thought about our overall experience and two it is. 

The salsa (one red) served at the start of the meal was just ok but the chips were fresh and still warm. 
It's a positive two for the guacamole.THAT, I know for sure. Their guac is more of a creamy base with smashed tomatoes and bits (slivers) of onions,combined with some(read very little) avocado used just to make it seem green as guacamole should. 

The color green was very sad. I have had some great guac (shout out to Cantina and La Unica!) and it was a happy vibrant color of green. This sad muted green was on the other end of the rainbow. 

The fajitas were pretty good with nicely marinated chicken BUT they are served with no lime wedges.I used the left over lime from my Corona, which we (all four) thought they tasted flat out of the bottle? And were not very cold. The Chicken enchiladas were good. 

The server had to take a few moments in-between placing our order and asking questions about the menu etc. as if she was just learning English. She tripped up a few times but she was trying hard. 

After the big disappointment of a take out from one of my *former* favorites this was actually very good, which does not say much. 

There are is another Charlotte location and two in Gastonia but I won't be rushing to any of them. Most likely not giving this another shot either. 
If I am in the area I'll go next door to Nona's Sweets . OoPppS, scratch that.  I'll drive the 1/2 mile down the block to her new location and fill up on Italian nummies.
