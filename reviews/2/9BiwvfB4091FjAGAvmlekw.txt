My first experience here was really bad, but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt since it was Cinco de Mayo. I popped in on my way home to grab a couple of tacos. Wish I could have had a margarita too, but I'm currently prego. I was greeted within a couple of minutes with chips and salsa. Good but pretty standard. A few minutes later someone came for my order. I ordered right away. Then I was forgotten about. A family of 4 was seated at the table next to me, ordered, ate their entire meal, and their table was cleared away before my 2 tacos & one tamale came out. During my 40 minute wait all I did was watch a "DJ" while he played on his phone and rotated some seriously horrible music and flashed stage lights around the room. Kind of strange for 5:30pm. A manager never addressed my (lack of a) meal, and my waitress looked so terrified that I was going to get upset once she realized that I didn't have my food I just waited patiently without mentioning it. The food itself was ok. The tamale had decent flavor but wasn't temperature hot, the sour cream on the tacos looked completely liquified. I've seen lots of good reviews on the place and I'll give it one more chance. Hopefully next time is better.
