This place has changed owners and everything else. Loved going here for the hot dog buffet but last time I went in they no longer have the wide selection of hot dogs and you have to order your dog and wait 20 min to get started. We waited 20 min to get our hot dogs and it looked like everyone else there was waiting as long as we were.

Appears to have added lots of other types and styles of food and ice cream, in doing so I think they have lost their identity. Was a really cool place but not anymore. I don't think I'll be back.

To the new owners, if it's not broke, don't fix it.
