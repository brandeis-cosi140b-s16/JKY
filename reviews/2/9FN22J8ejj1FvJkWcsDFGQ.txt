I've never been to New Mexico but now I don't want to go. 

The place is cute,though. Nobody was in there on a Saturday. Get there early as they close at 5:00pm. Odd for a restaurant. 
We made personal friends with the server who was delightful.  Since there was nobody there for him to wait on we talked to him a lot.

I'm just not a fan of this kind of cooking. The chips were different but good. Salsa was ketchupy. The beans were bland but probably healthy. My carnitas burrito was filled with a strange kind of pork that was full of little chunks of grizzle. Like it was carved from a waste part of the pig like the head or hocks. HUGE turn-off for me. When I have to stop chewing and spit something in my napkin every other bite you loose me. I expected nice pulled pork. I should have gotten the chicken one like my wife. She loved hers. The taste was good, however. It was kind of hot from all the hatch chilis. You may want to ask for sour cream. The rice was OK. 

You get a huge portion. You will get 2 meals from it so the cost is great. I might go back and try something else from the menu but I like Macayos better.
