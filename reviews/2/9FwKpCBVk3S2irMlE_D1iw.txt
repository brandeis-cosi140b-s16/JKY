I will just say, there is NO COMPARISON to the original location on Main.   I was so, disappointed in the atmosphere, the service and the food was terrible.  The windows had no shades, the sun was glaring right where I was sitting in the middle of the restaurant, I will not go back to this location, I will continue to go to the one on Main.
