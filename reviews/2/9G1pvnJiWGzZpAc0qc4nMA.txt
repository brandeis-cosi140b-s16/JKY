A group of 6 of us went to Cinco on a Tuesday night, and the restaurant was about half full. A hurried waitress eventually came to the table saying she had been called in because they only had one person on staff that night and the bar tender was now helping to serve food. It took more than 30 minutes for the first round of drinks to arrive at the table, after we asked about them twice. One of the six had ordered an appetizer for her entree and it came out ahead of the other food about 15 minutes later, and it was cold and awful (empanadas). At this point we were considering leaving. Another 10 minutes or so passed and the rest of the food came out. We also told the waitress that the appetizer came out cold and she asked if we wanted to send it back. We did not have another hour to wait for the food to be remade. The rest of the food was pretty good though! Among us, we had burritos, tacos, etc. and we all enjoyed the food. When the bill came, I would have thought they might take off the appetizer given the wait and it was cold, but no such luck. Better service would have led to a much better review. The waitress was very nice, but it did not make up for the long wait and food that was good, but certainly not great. Also, I know this place has changed restaurants multiple times over the years, but it does not appear have been renovated in the least.
