Mediocre at best.  Service throughout the night was fine, nothing at all to complain about.  Tried a specialty margarita and it was junk.  Had chicken and steak fajitas and they were eh.  My kids ordered mini chicken quesadillas and they were full of chopped onions.  For kids.  I know my kids are picky eaters, but a kid's menu item should be simple.  Anyway, they did the right thing and made new ones for the girls.  All in all, prolly won't be back.  Sorry guys.
