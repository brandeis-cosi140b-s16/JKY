The food is good also customer service was good. The only thing that turned me off about this place is that it smelled  really bad. The first time I went I sat by the front door so everything was ok. The second time I went and I sat in the back and it smelled  like urine that was gross. Then I wanted to give it another try and I couldn't stay as soon as I entered it smelled like paint it was very strong smell so as soon as entered I left. Then I went another time and the same.  the smell was different but it was not a food smell.
The reason why I went several times to try this place is because the food was good. But those bad smells gave me a warning signal. So I went to  different restaurants.
