Came here for my birthday dinner with family a group of 11. Some from our party had been and said it was good also chose it because it wasn't too far for my grandma to walk. 
When we told them we had 11 in our party the hostesses seemed annoyed and said well idk if we can fit that many it will be 30-40 minutes. 
So we lingered around in the area. 
We were eventually seated and oh man the music was so loud!! Way too loud I couldn't hear my cousin or friend next to me. 
I got a free birthday shot of sone nasty tequila i wish i hadnt honestly. food wasnt great, service was ok. but with music louder than a club I left with a headache!
