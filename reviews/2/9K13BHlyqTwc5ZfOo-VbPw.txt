I have eaten at lots of Mexican restaurant so I'm a pretty tough critic and this place was not that great.  I really was not that impressed. It's located inside the Cannery Casino so I'm sure it soaks up plenty of business from the people who are already there feeding slot machines their social security checks. I don't think I would go out of my way to walk through a smoky casino to eat here though. I find it funny that this place boasts "Las Vegas Review Journal The Best of Las Vegas 2008"... umm its 2011 that doesn't say much. I think the portions could have been better for the price. My girlfriend got fajitas and it was mostly vegetables. Overall our meal cost $29.17 before tip, I ate my whole meal and my girlfriend took home some vegetables.  I did like the chips and the two salsas and bean dip that came with it. If you're looking for an authentic Mexican restaurant go to VIVA ZAPATA'S it's just down the street on Craig and I-15 its way better.
