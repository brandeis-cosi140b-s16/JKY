Bummer. That's all I can say - I wish I could like this place, but it's too ostentatious. 

Basically, this is a Mexican restaurant going through a identity crisis. You walk in and it's really clean, but there's no smell - I mean, where's the spice, the flavor, the umph? There was none. 

Moving on...the people behind the counter - very friendly, no problems there. I get my food and hortacha, and this burrito is the size of a burrito from Taco Bell...except at TB I pay $.99 and here I paid $2.50 - the beans were runny and I was a bit disappointed in the taste/texture of the tortilla. 

The hortacha was tasty but the same as a Fili-b's, and a few cents more.

Here's the thing...we have Baja Fresh for the over priced, Rubios for the beachy/hip feel. We have all the -bertos and Taco Bells for the authentic and cheap...and all of these provide overall better tasting food - why would I go back to Tia?

What I really need from Tia, is some proof that they really care that I come back. I need them to show me they are ready to compete...because right now they're not cuttin' it and I know I've experienced better.
