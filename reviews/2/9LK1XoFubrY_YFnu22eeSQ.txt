I absolutely love this place when dining there. But, we don't get to do that very often. We have 4 kiddos, so we tend to order and pick up more often for a better dining experience. Lol   The last 4 times we have ordered by phone for pick up, there has ALWAYS been a problem with the order. Anywhere from missing 2 entire meals, to missing sides of beans or rice, to no chips and salsa and even wrong dinner order orders. I am so frustrated with them. Every time we call, they just say oops, we'll replace it next time. I've officially given up with Ajo Al's. Sad to say it, but they can only screw up so many times before losing my business. And unfortunately, they don't do enough to make up for their mistakes.
