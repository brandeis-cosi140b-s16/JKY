I have frequented often and enjoyed eating here until yesterday, when my wife and I stopped in for a late lunch. I ordered a combo that had an enchilada with it and my wife ordered the cheese enchiladas. Instead of getting enchiladas, we received a table spoon (if that) of cold cheese wrapped up in a tortilla with drenched in red sauce. I brought the food back up and their response was, 'we ran out.' So if you are out of something, let the customers know. Don't just half-heartedly attempt to mimic the entree someone ordered. That's dishonest and a rip-off. 

We won't be back.
