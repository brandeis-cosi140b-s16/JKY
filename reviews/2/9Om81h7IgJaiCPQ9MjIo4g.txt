Came here for happy hour. 
My boyfriend and I ordered margaritas. He had the strawberry margarita ($5) which was good. Would have been better if they gave us the choice of having a frozen margarita instead of on the rocks. I had the regular lime margarita, super sour and tasted odd. I ordered a mojito, good flavor. Not over powering. Would have been a 4 star experience if the bartender had some personality and wasn't so blah about her attitude. Goodness she couldn't even crack a smile. Kept asking if that's it? Rushing our service. Plain rude. I couldn't catch her name but I will remember that blue eyeshadow she wore. Be nice for tips. Bad service.
Overall, drinks were okay.
