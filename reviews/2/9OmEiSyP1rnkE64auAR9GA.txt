I wanted to like this place....I really did!    It's the 3rd restaurant in this space in the 11 years we've lived in the area.  A fresh, bright and colorful interior change was so welcoming as was the 'full house' on our first visit.  The service was 'ok'....I cut them some slack because of it being a very busy night and the place being fairly new.  However, our waitress chose to stand and talk to the table next to us telling them about her life, rather than complete our order.
The first bit of food arrived - nothing to brag about.
Our entrees arrived and were kind of tossed onto the plate.  Mine was barely warm (I am a stickler for hot food being served hot - don't just warm the plate and call it acceptable).  We decided we'd give it a try another time.
The second visit was similar to the first, except that there wasn't a large crowd, there were empty tables and yet we had about a 20 minute wait.  We sat at the end of the bar where servers were constantly coming up to get drinks for customers.   A big annoying.
The food service wasn't prompt nor accurate and once again, the plates were slopped up with food and sauce, barely warm and noting to brag about.
I won't go back.  I give it a couple of months longer and they too will close their doors.
If I had to guess, I would say most of the food is prepared ahead of time so it's not really 'fresh'.   Nothing is loaded with flavors...pretty bland and boring
The location is fantastic!   Lots of homes around the area...a mixed crowd of young families and a senior community.   Seniors go out to eat and we like places close to home!!! !
