So inconsistant, it's not worth the money.

I've eatten delivery three times now. Two times they screwed up my order, and one time they screwed up the other person's order. Infact the very last time, she ordered something straight from the menu, and they didn't put cheese on it, like the menu said. 

One time we ordered off their dessert menu, and they gave us something with beef in it. We called them to let them know and they actually argued with us. They tried telling us we were confused at what we were ordering. We ordered chocolate and we got beef, we wern't confused. They told us we wouldn't be getting our dessert unless we still had the beef things and we said that was fine...But come on, what are they going to do with the food after they delivered it? Plus, no one ever apologized or compensated us for a vegitarian biting down into a beef something when it should have been dessert!

The only reason why we tried it three times is because when they actually got the order right, the food was pretty good, and it's a great plus that they deliver practically always.
