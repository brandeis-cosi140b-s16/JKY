I wanted to like this place and based on the reviews honestly expected much more. I typically love *authentic* Mexican restaurants because of fresh ingredients and overall experience. I headed into Taqueria Allende for lunch and got their four taco plate; two beef and two shredded beef (maybe I should have diversified a bit). When my tacos came they looked good, were packed with some great looking traditional fixins but unfortunately that's where it ended. The beef tacos had an old musty flavor to them and the beef itself wasn't flavorful (beyond the unpleasant musty flavor) at all and was pretty dry. As for the shredded beef, eh, just as unfortunate tasting. The shredded beef wasn't as dry but the flavor still wasn't cutting it.

My cousin got the torta which he described as one of the least favorite sandwiches he's had. The beef on the torta was the same as what was in my tacos and didn't have nearly the proper amount of beef compared to the size of the sandwich (waaaaay too much bread, no meat).

All in all, an upsetting experience. There are bunch of other better restaurants in the area so I'd say try those and drive right past. 

As a disclaimer, I've only had what I've mentioned above. Typically if I'm going to give a place a negative review I at least give it a second shot but honestly couldn't bring myself to go back here when there are so many better options out there.
