The best advice I can give you is watch your account if you pay by debit or credit. An extra $1 was added to my purchase when I looked online. I guess they figured most people wouldn't notice. Of course  $1 is no big deal, but it's the principle of it that leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Not to mention bad business practice. 

The food itself was pretty good, but the portion size wasn't particularly the best. I am a big fan of chicken fajitas, so I already anticipate restaurants putting more onions and peppers than anything. But here they put a VERY little amount of chicken. Much less than any other place I have been to.
