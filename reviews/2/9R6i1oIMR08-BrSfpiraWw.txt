I wish they still did the Spanish tapas thing but now they have a Mexican menu. If you're looking for authentic Mexican food you can do a lot better than this place. The chips they gave us to munch on had a burnt aftertaste. I ordered the taco plate and the rice was bland and tasteless, the beans were overly salty, and the taco meat wasn't seasoned properly. Overall a very disappointing experience. The only reason I'm rating two stars instead of one is because our server was friendly.
