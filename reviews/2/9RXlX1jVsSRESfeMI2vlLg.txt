We tried the taco cart with Taqueria Guadalajara for a recent party.... Sadly it wasn't that great of an experience.

We requested a certain cook, they promised us over and over the cook would be there, when they showed up, they replaced the cook with another person. 

However, that wasn't that big of a deal.... They were supposed to show up at 3pm when the party started but didn't arrive until 4:30PM.  Apparently Arizona Freeways are very confusing and they couldn't figure out how to get to the East Valley. 

Instead of keeping me in the loop on when they were coming, I ended up having to call them every 15 minutes after they were extremely late.. 

Thankfully for their sake, their food is excellent... However I wouldn't trust them to show up at any of my parties going forward.
