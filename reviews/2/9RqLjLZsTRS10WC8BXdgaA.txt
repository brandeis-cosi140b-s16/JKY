Friendly service and new installations but the food just didn't do it for me. In my two visits I was served dry rice and the beans completely covered with American cheese. The "nopales con carne" were a disappointment because one couldn't taste the nopales. I figured that ordering beef fajitas would be a safe bet but they were just as flavorless as everything else I tried.

For a restaurant that has the reputation of serving great authentic Mexican food, my review probably seems harsh - I mean, they didn't get that reputation by serving bland Mexican food. So, I'll give them a try again in a few weeks and hopefully add stars to this review.
