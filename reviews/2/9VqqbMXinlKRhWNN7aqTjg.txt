I really didn't want to write this review since Chica Loca Taco is new. I know how hard it is to succeed in the restaurant business and I think there are very good intentions behind Chica Loca Taco but there could be improvements with the food. I was very excited to learn that this place would be serving Mexican street food so have been eyeing the place throughout the entire time of construction, awaiting for their opening. I haven't tried the gelato but I don't get the connection with the Mexican food. 

Anyway great that there are fresh ingredients but the fresca and green salsas needed salt and pepper. Chips were okay. Al pastor and chorizo had some flavor but needed a little more of something - perhaps again salt and pepper or even hot sauce. Chorizo looked kind of like minced dog food...

I left the place with the right amount of full in my belly but not the right type of satiated full. Price is reasonable and the service was incredibly friendly.
