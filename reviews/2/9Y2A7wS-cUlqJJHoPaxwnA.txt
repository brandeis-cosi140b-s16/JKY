Worst America's Taco Shop location I've been to. I typically go to the 7th St. and McDowell location. My burrito came out incorrectly, and it's just beans and cheese. The service was horrible. The staff whistled at us to let us know our burritos were ready despite the fact that (a) they gave us a number and (b) we were literally a foot away.
