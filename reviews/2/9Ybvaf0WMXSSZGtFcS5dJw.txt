Food is good but service is terrible!!!  We are regulars here and service has never been good but this time it took the cake.  We waited 1/2 hour just to order.  After 1.5 hours, three people in our party finally got there food.  Then the rest of our good trickled in.  Worst part was owner never once even apologized.  In fact she seemed annoyed and put out the entire time.  That will be the last time we patronize their restaurant.
