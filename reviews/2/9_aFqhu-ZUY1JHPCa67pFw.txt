This is just not my week for tacos. The speed of getting food in a fast casual establishment brand like this was abysmal. Management seems to be absent.

Monday catch up lunch with 3 friends to meet at 11:30 am. Most of us are there by 11:40 am, we get a table, the waitress brings our drinks. Ordering is sushi style, that is a pad of paper and pencils, and one marks the number of each item you want, and order everything all at once.  I ordered a plethora: Chicken, Fried Chicken, Carnitas, and Veggie Tacos. Plus churros, I was hungry. At $3 each is what a taco should be. There is a platter special of 6 tacos for $17 but one is limited to 3 choices and I wanted to sample flavors.

Waitress comes by and collects our orders, my receipt says 11:57am. Our late friend arrives just after noon, he gets his order in about 12:10.

Around 12:20pm guess which item comes out first? Guess. The churros! One has to wonder how it takes 20 minutes to make fried dough rolled in sugar. It's worse the dessert came first. Food finally arrived around 12:30. We were all so hungry we tore into it, so I'm not going to have a lot of nuance to say. The carnitas were moist, and a stand out among what was ho-hum and coldish. All came on corn tortillas.

Waitress came by to ask how our order was and apologized for the churros coming out first when she brought the checks at 12:43pm. If someone had come out and said hey Vida Cantina's kitchen was slammed I would have understood but being left waiting on such a simple meal is terrible.
