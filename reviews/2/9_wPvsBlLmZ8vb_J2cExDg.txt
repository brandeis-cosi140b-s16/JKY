Now take this with a grain of salt because I only came in for drinks.  Elaine B and I stopped in for a quick drink before book club one night and were excited to try the finally open Los Dos.  We sat at the bar and waited a good 10 minutes to be served by the bartender who was blatantly ignoring us.  We finally got her attention and ordered our beers.  She brought us some chips and salsa, it was average at best.  We finished our drinks and paid and Elaine B noticed the next day when checking her bank account that she was grossly overcharged.  Never again.
