I was excited to try this place and it looked really cute when we walked in.  We took our tacos to go and when we got home we were really disappointed.  We both got 3 taco plates... chicken and carne asada.  The chicken was dry and the carne asada was unflavored beef.  Overloaded with vegetables and most flavor was the onion on the taco.  I really hoped it would be great, but it wasn't.
