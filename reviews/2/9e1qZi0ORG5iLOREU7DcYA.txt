I've heard some buzz about Two Hippies Beach House, so when I happened upon it at lunch time I thought I would give it a try.

First of all, there weren't any hippies running the place.  Instead there was two lovely ladies, one at the front counter, and the other cooking the food.  They were both very nice and helpful.   

I ordered the 3 taco special, opting for a fish taco, a chicken taco and a carne asada taco.  I also ordered a diet coke, which was handed to me in a can.

My order number was called out and I recieved three large tinfoil packages...  I thought that was a good sign that they were so big.

However, I've never really been a huge fan of eating out of tinfoil or off of red trays, so that's where the experience began to turn south.

The tacos were filled with rice, beans, and the chosen meat, along with freshly grated cheese, and chopped cabbage.  They were quite big.  I wasn't sure if it was supposed to be that way, but all of the tacos were quite cold and flavorless.  The chicken appeared like it had come out of a can.  It was white and tasted boiled.  There was no flavoring at all. The carne asada appeared to be slow cooked beef, and tasted like  it had been boiled in water.  Again, no flavorings.  Then rice and beans were bland.  The pinto beans appeared like they had just come out of the can.

The fish taco had moist chunks of fish, and it was actually the best of the three, however the flavoring came from the sauce that was on it, not from the fish.

Overall, the restaurant came far short of the "Outrageously good" food that their sign out front touts.  There was nothing "outrageous" about it, and good, well the food was not.    

The best thing they had going for them was the two ladies who were working there who were very friendly.  

Two thumbs down for this restaurant.
