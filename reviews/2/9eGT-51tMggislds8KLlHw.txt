Somewhat disappointed 

Today I Went to the Cafe Rio Mexican Grill for lunch. The restaurant was crowded, however people were moving through the cafeteria style line and receiving their entrée's very fast. 

At Cafe Rio, you select the type of food you want to eat, add the meat, beans, sauces, and extras according to your own preferences.  Everything is fresh and prepared in front of you. The tortillas at Cafe Rio are made to order so I knew I was going to order a burrito because I really enjoy homemade tortillas.

As your looking at the menu it seems as if you are being hurried through the serving line.  On my first visit I ordered  a sweet pork burrito with, cheese, black beans, rice and salsa.  As you place your order, the food is passed down the cook line and tossed behind  onto a conveyor belt which runs your entrée through an oven. 

To be honest I was somewhat disappointed in the quality and taste of the food.  My entrée had an overwhelming taste of salt, it was all I could taste.  The burrito just wasn't very good.

I assumed that Cafe Rio would be another version of Chipoltle because the serving style and food items are very similar but I think I prefer Chipoltle. 

To end on a postive note Cafe Rio is clean, well decorated, and the employees are friendly and very accommodating.
