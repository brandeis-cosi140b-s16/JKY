2-stars at best!  The waitress was the best part of the meal.
There is a reason I've driven by this place hundreds of times and never eaten here before...other reviewers have said this place is a traditional Mexican restaurant...traditional as in, trapped in the 60's!
The inside is very plain, painted block walls with hardly any artwork....old school booths and tables...and a separate bar.  The food was mediocre at best.  I got the 3-taco plate.  Each of my hard shelled tacos came in a different taco shell.  The beef and chicken tastes almost the same.
The salsa was not good.  Not sure what, but it was missing something!  My wife wasn't too keen on here chorizo plate either.  The soft tortilla was pretty darn good though. i am certain they are home made.
Overall I give this place 2-stars and probably will never go back.
