Ive been to this place twice while hunting in copa. Both times the food has been lackluster. The chimichanga was plain with no flavoring. The meat is not seasoned and you could get a better burrito at filibertos. 

Second time the service was lousy. We sat at the bar and after our drink order and food order, we needed mire drinks and chips. The pkace is dead. After 5 mins i found the bartender chatting with staff. When we got our order it was wrong, and when we did get the food it was bland and tasteless. Will not return.
