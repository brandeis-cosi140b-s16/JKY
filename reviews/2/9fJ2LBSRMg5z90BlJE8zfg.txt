Not the best I have had mediocre and generic for that matter. I ordered the carnitas(fried porks pieces) and what I got was like five chunks of dry flavorless pork. Not good kinda left feeling sick. The rest of the food ordered by the rest of my party was none to appetizing either. I recommend going to find a place on or by south blvd in Charlotte  like Azteca it's well worth the extra five minute drive. The only plus to this place was the super sized sodas. Haha
