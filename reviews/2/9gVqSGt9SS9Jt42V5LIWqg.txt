I was thrilled that a potentially great mexican restaurant moved in near me.  Just wished it turned out to be more thrilling.  Had problems with service, completely inflexible.  Kitchen managed to muck up a basic of quesadilla order.  Server was incredulous that we might want that fixed.  And she questioned what a quesadilla should be, tried to take the kids menu from my 5 year old boy so she could read & verify WHILE he was coloring it with crayons.  Couldn't she just get herself  another menu?  They really need better servers.  And it was pretty expensive for a lunch time meal that was really just mediocre.
