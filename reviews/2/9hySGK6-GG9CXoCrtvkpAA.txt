Unfortunately, as much as I love Caf√© Rio, I seem to be disappointed time and time again... I usually order on my way home so I can pick up to take home with me.  It never fails, they are never ready when I arrive and in fact, I usually wait anywhere from 5-15 more minutes.  That is really sad as if I have to wait 15 minutes, I might as well have just waited and ordered there.   Additionally, I have to special order everything due to allergies and every time the order is messed up.  It is unfortunate because I really love their food.
