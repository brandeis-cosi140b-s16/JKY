I was driving from Atlanta to Durham, NC and planned my drive to stop here for dinner.  This Chipotle is pretty spacious compared to the other locations I've been to. At 730pm there wasn't really a line, which was good for me since I was in a hurry to get back on the road.  However, this is when my experience started to go a little down hill.

I ordered a salad, but they told me that they didn't have any more bowls to put it in.  Out of bowls, really??? Anyways, they were going put my food in a top and then wrap it with aluminum foil.  I didn't really care but then halfway through the line someone finds the bowls.  Come on, get your stuff together.

Next, as I start to eat I notice my food is really salty.  I think it might've been the chicken but I wasn't completely sure since everything was mixed together.

Overall, not my typical Chipotle experience.  But it's not going to stop me from eating at other Chipotles.
