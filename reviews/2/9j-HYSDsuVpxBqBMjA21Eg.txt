My husband and I absolutely love Cafe Rio but today's visit was so bad :( we got there and there were literally 9 employees no exaggeration. Some of the staff was standing and others were stocking. Ok we get that...but when a customer comes in you stop stocking and help them. The girl that helped us was so rude but I felt like she was mad cause she was the only one doing everything (still not a reason to be mad at us). Then our food sat there for like 3 minutes until I asked the kid stocking if someone was going to finish our food he said "oh yea he will in a bit"...um ok. Then we ordered chips and guacamole and the two girls were both struggling to get chips...it was seriously so irritating watching a bunch of employees and only the rude one working. Hopefully this place gets better.
