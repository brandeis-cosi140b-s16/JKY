This place was great about an year ago. Since then it has gone down hill. I ordered 4 tacos (on $2 taco Tuesday) and a drink while I waited. They brought me 4 ORDERS of tacos totaling $50! Then instead of admitting the mistake and removing from my bill, they "auctioned" them in the bar. Having other patrons pay me cash to make up the difference! Bad business, not friendly at all.
