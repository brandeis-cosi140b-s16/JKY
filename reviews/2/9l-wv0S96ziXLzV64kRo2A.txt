The service here was really good and the margaritas are of decent strength.  The food wasn't very good, however.  Okay, it's probably my fault for ordering fish tacos that clearly state on the menu that the fish is fried.  But I didn't expect Gordon's fish stick pieces, some shredded iceberg lettuce and a whopping load of tartar sauce to be the consistency of a fish taco at a sit down Mexican restaurant.  It's not Pete's Fish and Chips or grandma's surprise fusion cooking, it's a freaking Mexican restaurant!

I keep thinking about giving this place a second chance, but there are so many other Mexican places around.  Maybe it will remain a happy hour (for drinks and chips & salsa) only place for me.
