To start off, I'm originally from San Diego so my standards for Mexican Food are very high. When I first went here I ordered a Carne Asada burrito with lettuce, tomatoes, and guacamole. I think this is a pretty simple burrito that doesn't really have a lot of room for error.  Upon first biting into the burrito I thought it tasted good: the meat wasn't dry and was tasty, and the vegetables inside were fresh. The only problem I had was the guacamole. I didn't see any in my burrito so I went up to the counter and asked them if they forgot the guacamole and they said they didn't. I told them I didn't see any and asked for extra. They went to go get some guacamole and came back with a cup of green liquid that I assume was either blended avocado or the powder type you mix with water. Even though this is not the type of guacamole I'm used to I still gave it a chance and poured it into my burrito (pouring guacamole into a burrito sounds very wrong by the way...). I still tasted nothing! I have never been to a Mexican restaurant where the guacamole tastes like nothing and is in liquid form! I don't understand why they don't use real guacamole in their burritos but if they do I'm sure I would probably give the place 3 or 4 stars. 

I think I'm very fair and I decided to give this place another chance and asked to have REAL guacamole put in the burrito because I know if you order chips and guacamole it's the real type (chunky not liquid). Once again, I was disappointed. So apparently this place doesn't believe in using actual guacamole in their burritos. So sad...

Some positives: somewhat cheap and close to ATSU if you're a student there. Other than that, I don't think it's worth the money. I mean even Rubio's has real guacamole in their burritos. If you're not used to good Mexican food or you don't care what your food tastes like then go here.
