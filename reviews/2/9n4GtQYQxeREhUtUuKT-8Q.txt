El Toro is not horrible, but its not great Mexican either. Don't let this reflect on  Wedge. There are no better margaritas in CU than Wedge's. 

We got nachos and a chicken verde quesadilla. The nachos had cheese sauce instead of cheese. Not our thing, but the sour cream and guac were super fresh so that made up for it. The quesadilla was soggy and wet and lacking cheese. I didn't hate it but my boyfriend wouldn't take a second bite. 

Overall it's acceptable, but there are better Mexican places if you look elsewhere.
