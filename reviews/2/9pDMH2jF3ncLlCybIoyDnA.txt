Blah guacamole.  Beans were good.  Taco very greasy.  Enchilada quite greasy.  Don't even want to think about the fat content of my meal.  Yes I know Mexican food for the most part is fatty but this was excessively so.  Service OK.  Food came out quickly.  I've certainly had better Mexican food especially considering we drove almost an hour to get there.  Loved the decor!  Good lunch specials.  Parking lot really crowded.
