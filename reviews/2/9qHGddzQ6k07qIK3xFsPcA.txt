Just went through the drive thru ordered a quesadilla, a burrito, and a drink. They gave us an extra burrito and forgot the drink so we had to go back through the drive thru. They took the burrito back which most likely they gave to the car behind us, gave us our drink but we figured out the burrito was the wrong burrito. We then went back through again and got the right one but were asking if we could get something complimentary like some sour cream and they had an attitude and said no. Then we told them that's not right and you could've gotten our order right the first time then they screamed and said get the F*** out  of our drive thru!!! Completely unacceptable and disrespectful behavior!!! The food was really good hence the three stars but the service was horrific and will not be returning. Lookout for the pale faced girl with spider veins and a plank like figure she's the one that yelled at us and doesn't know what she's doing so check your food before you leave the drive thru.
