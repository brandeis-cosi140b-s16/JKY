Great food, but very poor service. Was here on a Friday night and sat at the bar. Bartender was okay but too busy to check in with us on a regular basis. We then moved to a seated table with a rude server. He could not be less interested in his job. He did not check in with us after he served our food. Later, and I mean much later we had to tag him to get our ticket. This is my second time here, and I won't be back again due to poor service. Too bad, because the food is great!
