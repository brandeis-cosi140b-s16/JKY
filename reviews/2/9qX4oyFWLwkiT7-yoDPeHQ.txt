We have tried La Playita a few times for breakfast on the weekends normally having the chilaquiles and usually happy with them.
So we decided to try for a dinner.  Served a nice spicy chunky salsa and cold chips upon sitting down.  We ordered the bacon wrapped shrimp, the empanadas and 2 chili relleno plate.
Food arrived very quickly and was pretty down hill from there.  Empanadas were not hot all the way thru.  The relleno plate use anaheim chilis and were not very good.  Bacon wrapped shrimp was wrapped with to much bacon and the layer of bacon under the first wrap was raw.  I returned that plate of shrimp and told them I did not want anything in its place.
I do not think we will be trying this place again.
