I would have given a much higher rating but the nachos we ordered were disgusting.  They were swimming in the grease from the beef topping.  I literally poured it off the plate.  Had to ask the bartender for chips because we couldn't eat the ones on the plate because they were mush the minute they arrived.  Made a comment to the bartender who basically shrugged his shoulders.  Found the bar area to be fun and enjoyed the margaritas.  Will give it a second chance but will definitely not order the nachos again.  It's such an easy fix???  Ordered nachos a million times and never had that issue.
