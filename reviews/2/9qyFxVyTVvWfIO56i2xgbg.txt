What's wrong with me? I used to go to Roberto's a lot when I lived in Vegas a few years ago. I've been back in Vegas since 2011 and tried Roberto's maybe twice. It's either gone downhill, or my tastes have changed. I had the enchilada plate- my go-to dish in the past.  The items seemed to kinda blend into one another. Nothing special about the flavors. A plate of pale and mushy food. 


In the words of Hall & Oates, no can do.
