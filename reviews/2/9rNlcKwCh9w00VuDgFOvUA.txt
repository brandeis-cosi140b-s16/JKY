Not a fan.  I'm used to authentic Mexican I didn't find it here.  Moreover, the service was lackluster.  I was alone and no one greeted me for about 5 minutes.  After I was seated no one came around for another 5 minutes. The carne asada was average and I finally got a refill on my soda after I had finished my meal.  I won't be back.
