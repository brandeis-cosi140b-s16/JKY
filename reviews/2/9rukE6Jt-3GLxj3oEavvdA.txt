I'll be honest, we used to go here all the time. Every single time, they were rude to us, but it was worth it for the delicious chicken gorditas. However, the final straw was when we found a toothpick in our taquito. No, I dont mean it was poking out, I mean it was wrapped in the tortilla inside with the chicken. My sis BIT into it. That same time, I chomped something hard, it was a big piece of gravel. In my chicken gordita. Ok, we're gringas, but I used to work in Mexico and speak some spanish. I am used to anti-gringo attitudes, I used to get called all sorts of names walking around. However, this place is the WORST I have ever experienced, especially here in the states, and I truly believe, to this day, it was because we are gringas. Gravel doesnt just "accidentally" get into chicken. Nor does a toothpick get fried into a taquito. I havent returned. I will always miss their gorditas.
