I'm usually pretty happy with Salsarita's and I realize that an "Express" location might not hold up to the same standards as a regular location. Limited choices are understandable and the prices here are not inflated at all over the full size Salsarita's. Burritos, tacos, salads and nachos are available with grilled chopped chicken, ground beef, or simply vegetarian.

I've stopped by here a couple of times, grabbing something for eating on the plane or to take home after a late night arrival. Depending on the time of the day, the lines can be long, but they do move quickly - faster than their neighbors it seems. The team of three or four each has a specific role in the assembly process which seems to help speed things up. However, the means that none of them care about the final product. While the burrito is fully stuffed, it's not mixed at all. A pocket of beans here and a spoonful of guacamole there, there is no opportunity for the flavors of these ingredients to mix and meld.

Still, it's way better than the "nothing" that most carriers serve in coach and it's possible to eat it without needing a whole lot of room to spread out, or a knife and fork. If you don't want BK or Quizno's and you're looking for something better than a pre-wrapped "grab-n-go" sandwich, give Salsarita's a try.

Salsarita's Express is located in the main concourse is between Burger King and Quizno's. It's in the main area between the "B" concourse and the "C" concourse.
