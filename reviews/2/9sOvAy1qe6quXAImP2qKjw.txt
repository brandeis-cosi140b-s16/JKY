I really really wanted to like this place, but i cant force myself to. The Kalua and huli huli chicken was VERY VERY salty, i could not finish my bowl. Trust me, i love salty food but not even I could handle it. Im disappointed because I love the chipotle concept mixed a hawaiian twist.  Wont be returning.
