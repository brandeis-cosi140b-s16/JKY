I've been to Cafe Rio in SLC many times and always loved it, so I was super excited when one opened up by my house. I waited in a decently long, slow moving line, and when I got up to order it was clear why. Their set up isn't the problem, it lies with the employees not having clear understanding of what each of them is supposed to do so they are all tripping over each other. I told no less than 4 people that I wanted to order kids quesadillas, and I still didn't have them by the time I got to the cashier, who had to go back to the line cook to have him cook them. I wish I could say the food made up for the service, but it was no Bueno. The sauce and beans were super salty, I couldn't get through half of my burrito. I know they've only been open about 2 months, so I'll give them a few months to smooth things out and give 'em another try before writing them off completely.
