Once was more than enough for me. This place is just weird. The seating is cheap and uncomfortable, the service is less than stellar, the decor was outdated(felt like Chotchkie's from office space), and the food left much to be desired. 

The waitress got my friend's order wrong. Who would order dry enchiladas and better yet what waiter would not question an order like that? She spilt water on the table and decided to wipe it up with a dirty rag right next to my other friend's meal. Overall her attitude just felt shitty. 

All of the flavors were odd and disappointing. Nothing I ordered mentioned cilantro yet it was found all over my meal. The fried avocado was heavy, oily, and just not good. Caramel filled churros contained exactly zero caramel. The biggest disappointment was the street corn. It was easily the most bland street corn I've tried. 

The only reason I might find myself back there would be for the happy hour but I'm definitely in no rush.
