Very nice and clean location.  Counter service was super friendly.  Sizeable salsa bar with five kinds, although I found them all to be terribly runny for my tastes.  Also watery in texture and taste, nothing was spicy or flavorful enough.  Free chips included with your meal, which is nice.  Chicken Baja bowl was boring... White rice (no brown rice available), black beans, peppers and onions.  Enchilada style pork burrito was a step up, but too much rice filler and not enough meat.  Basically very average food, don't expect to be wowed.  Should have went to Chipotle.
