After the first trip I returned  two more times  with my young son after  a particularly bad first impression. 

Two burgers.  

One  Arizona style 
This is not one to take away , the amount of sour cream  was excessive and dragged down the temperature of an already struggling patty.  It was edible and cooked this time.  Green chili had a nice taste on the isolated bit that wasn't drowning in sour cream and I would probably like it in a burrito. Onion rings also had heat in them too.   

One Bueno style. 

Same issue one small piece of meat trying to support all the ingredients that have cooled it down prior to getting the table.  

Still slow service, still had a construction area in the middle of it . It's just not doing it for me at $6 for a thin burger drowned out by the  toppings. 

2.5 rounded to 2.
