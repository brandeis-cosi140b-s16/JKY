Not really a fan, would've given three stars but the attitude from the staff shot down the third one. 

My BF order four carne asada tacos and he ate all of them but said they weren't memorable. They had decent flavor but he had better from other nearby locations. He also commented on the lack of meat on a few of the tacos. 

I order a red chili burrito and the women rolled her eyes and repeated the order in Spanish which I said "Yes, thank you" to-  So I don't know if she was rolling her eyes because of my language choice or the order but it was just rude. 

Getting home I took a bite into the burrito excited for some red goodness to find it was a rice, bean, cheese and green chili burrito. After her repeating the order back to me in Spanish, I ended up with the wrong order. Very frustrating, the burrito was decent but not what I wanted and I stopped eating it half way through. 

The sauces they gave were tasty, but not going back and wasting my money on a restaurant that is rude and with only a handful of people in the restaurant they mess up orders. No thank you, I'll find another locally own restaurant to support.
