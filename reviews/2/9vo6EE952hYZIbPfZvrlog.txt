I have to agree with the other reviews, this place used to be so much better!

My hubs & I 1st tried it over 2 years ago & loved it. We stopped by for dinner last Thursday for the 1st time in months. I can't say there's a huge difference in the way the food tastes, but I can definitely say service is lacking! Any way, we always get the same thing-carne asada burritos. They were pretty good . But I do feel like we were over-charged & they only print a receipt with the total so who knows what they add on. 

If I'm ever in Anthem I will have to check out the original owners new place, they were so nice & will be missed in Phoenix!
