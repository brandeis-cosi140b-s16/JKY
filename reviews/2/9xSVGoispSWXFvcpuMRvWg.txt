After two short lived Asian Restuarants closed down in this space, I was very excited to have another Mexican restaurant downtown. I like Baja Fresh, don't get me wrong but I really miss Acapulco when it was at this location and I was hoping for some good ole' East L.A.-esque Mexican food. Sadly, Uno Mas didn't quite deliver. 

The shredded beef tacos were the best part of my meal but they were just OK. Just a tad more flavor to the beef and we could be in business because it was moist and tender. The refried beans were just average. They weren't bad but I think I could have done just as well out of a can. The rice was pretty abhorrent. I seldom go to a Mexican place for their rice and don't hold it against anyone if the rice isn't good but the flavor here was just bad. I can't put my finger on what kind of bad, but it was bad.

So tacos that could have been better, beans that could have been out of a can and bad rice all adds up to a place that I sadly can't in good conscience recommend.

To top it off, it took three different visits before I could actually buy any food. The first time I went was after 2:00pm but before 3:00 but they had already closed. The second time they had to close early due to some equipment malfunction (makes me think of Precious, the coffee kiosk lady on "Come Fly With Me" for all you BBC viewers). So from a pure effort point of view, it took me three times to get a meal here and when I got it it left a LOT to be desired.

Very dissapointing.

That being said, they have just been open a few weeks, which is why I am giving two stars instead of one. Maybe I'll give it a month or two and try it again. If they can just flavor their beef a little more and try and turn out some good ole' homemade frijoles, I might eventually love them!
