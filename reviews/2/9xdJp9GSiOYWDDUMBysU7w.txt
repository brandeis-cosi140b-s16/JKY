I travel for work and go to Chipotles all over the country. This location was below average. The portion size is the smallest I've ever seen with half a scoop of rice and barely any vegetables (I don't eat meat). The service from the staff wasn't rude but wasn't friendly and there was no one athlete goatee to ring me up. Location is decent in Market Square but that's about the only redeeming value of this Chipotle.
