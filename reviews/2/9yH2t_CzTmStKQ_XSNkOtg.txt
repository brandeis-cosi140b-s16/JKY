Update:  I realized I had overrated it before. I think i am still being generous with two stars. 

Basic chain Americanized style of Mexican food. It's alright, but nothing special. Noting that our GPS had it listed under American food and not Mexican should have been the first clue. Totally forgettable and certainly won't be on my list, or on the list of anyone I know, when I come back to Phoenix. 

There are so many choices around, don't waste your time and money on something so very mediocre.
