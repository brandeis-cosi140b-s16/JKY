If you are stuck in terminal C, this is your only real sit down option outside of the modest food court. When the waitress asks you if you want some drinks, say yes because you are going to be waiting a while. The service is slow and harried, as this place is definitely a "turn and burn" restaurant, your seat will still be warm when you go to sit down. We ordered three taco salads, something that should be expedited, but even those took a little while.

The trick at McCarran if you want some real dining options is to take the shuttle to the baggage claim terminal and convince a TSA person to let you go across to the tram to the new Terminal 3 without having to go back through the checkpoint. That, however, can be time consuming. So if your time is limited, your options might be limited to this place if you want sit down service.
