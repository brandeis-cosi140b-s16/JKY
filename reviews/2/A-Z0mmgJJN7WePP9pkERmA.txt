I really wanted to be blown away by this place.  Although it is better than the previous restaurant in this location, El Rico, it fell w-a-y short of my expectations.  

Many of the other reviewers gave such high ratings that I literally drove the mile and a half down the road with my mouth watering.  We arrived and sat inside and downstairs.  The ambiance was not so great. We heard everyone else's conversations and the chandelier lighting was sharp bright and made my pupils itch.  Then the salsa arrived.  Hmm... sweet instead of heat.  I didn't like how the salsa was served really cold either. Then I ordered the carne burro.  It was OK.  But the enchilada sauce was nasty. Oh, and the rice and beans were "turable!" (as Charles Barkley would say).  Lastly, my girl had awful gas after we got home and kept denying it.  Not a great outing.
