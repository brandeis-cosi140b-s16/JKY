Maybe it is because I came in the middle of the afternoon. Maybe it is because the ambience lacked the typical festive energy of a Mexican restaurant but I didn't really enjoy this place. I walked in without anyone in line, and received no greeting whatsoever... A little bit of a downer. In fact, and despite my inability to make a choice at first, the cashier and those behind the counter never bothered to make a suggestion of a dish for me to try. 

 I decided to play it safe and ordered a steak burrito. Evidently their version of said typical dish only includes beans and a choice of meat. I was really disappointed to learn they do not have any rice or much of anything else to add to their dishes. The steak was somewhat crunchy (a bit old), the beans lacked taste and the meal was, overall, not remarkable at all. 

I must sadly say this is is not the place to visit for good food.
