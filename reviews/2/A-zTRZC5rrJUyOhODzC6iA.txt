One star for the clean facility and friendly staff. A half for nostalgia, for food that takes me back to my youth, when gringo Mexican food was all there was in these parts, and it was oh-so-good. Yelp and its fine community of Yelpers is forgiving, so the half rounds up and two stars seems about right for this fun, festive joint that unlike some other nearby places in the area, does not scrimp on and/or charge for chips and salsa (I'm talking to you Pasqual's). There is better food not far away -- El Pastor, Guadalajara, La Mestiza, Los Gemelos -- but Casa del Sol is better for families with its nice kids' menu, and that's why we were here.
