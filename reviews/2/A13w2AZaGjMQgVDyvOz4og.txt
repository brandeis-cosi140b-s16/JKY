The food was just "ok." The service very underwhelming. With the sheer number of Mexican food restaurants around the Valley, there really is never a reason to eat mediocre food with mediocre service. Normally I'm a pretty generous tipper, but due to the minimum service we received, I only tipped 13% of the bill. She got back what she put out.
