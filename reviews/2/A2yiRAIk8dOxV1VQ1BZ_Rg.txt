Showed up on a friday night 12/5/14.  This is my third time here.  The staff is still disorganized.  5 people working and only one is making the food on the line.  The food becomes cold by the time you check out because they are so friendly, but slow..

They ran out of chicken when it was my turn to order.  So I waited patiently.  They said they would bring my order out. They served me the wrong order.   and forget my side of guac.  The manager asked if I would like anything for my troubles, so I asked for another small guac and maybe some queso.  She never came back out to the table.  I finished my meal.  Tried to throw away my trash but they removed the trash can for emptying.  I think Zabbas in the same mall is run more efficiently and a better bet.
