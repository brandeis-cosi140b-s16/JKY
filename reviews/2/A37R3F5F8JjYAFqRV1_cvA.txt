Two stars because the food was good. Then again, I'd been craving a particular food item for a long time, so I might have been too happy finally eating it to really complain too much. 

The service, however, was atrocious. It took the workers several minutes to attend us even though the place was literally empty of customers. I'm not joking. One guy even passed by the cash register, looked at us (a dirty look on his face, it seemed) and just kept walking! Then, when the girl who finally came to the cash register, she didn't even bother to greet us! She just scratched her head (in a restaurant! She was in the kitchen and came out and scratched her head in front of customers! Talk about unsanitary, and rude!) and asked what we wanted. No, "Hi, welcome to Filiberto's, what can I get you?" No. All she said was, "What do you want?" Not only that, but she totally messed up ordering for us! 

We waited while three groups came after us, ordered, and got their meals before us, (about half an hour's wait) before one of the workers asked what our order was. Turns out, they hadn't even STARTED our order! When we finally got our food, that girl (I'm going to call her Bonquiqui cuz that's how rude she was) didn't even pause as she just plopped our food on the counter and continued scratching her head into the kitchen! No, "Sorry for making you wait" or anything like that! Any other restaurant would have given us free soda or a mini taco or something as an apology. Hell, I would have been satisfied with just a verbal apology, but Bonquiui didn't even seem to care. I bet she was angry that we interrupted her texting or whatever. 

All in all, the food was passable, but the people suck. They either need new management to keep Bonquiqui and her angry cook friend in line, or just get friendlier, more alert people to work there.
