We have heard good thing about this place. So my wife and I decided to give it a try. Walking up to the restaurant was strange. It was really dark walking up from the parking lot. We stepped in to the entrance. The first thing you notice is the Halloween decoration of a cob web directly over your head. I'm not a super tall guy (6ft) it was about an inch over my head. We then stood there for about 10 minutes staring at an empty hostess stand. Once a person took back into a very empty restaurant. We were immediately were brought chips a  "salsa". It's more like tomato water than salsa. I ordered the combo platter with a taco, an enchilada, a tamale, rice and beans. It was a ton of food. The enchilada and tamale was drenched some kind of thick salty red sauce. The taco had no flavor. My wife ordered the chicken sopa. It had no flavor what so ever. Between waiting a long time to order to waiting a long time for tasteless food it's so not worth it. I don't think we will be back anytime soon.
