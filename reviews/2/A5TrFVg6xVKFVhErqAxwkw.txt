To put it concisely, the food was tiny & weird, though they do get props for excellent decor.

The place looks nice, there's no denying it. There's an obvious theme going on, low-light interior with candles on every surface, around a dozen and a half ornate chandeliers, crosses on the back wall to tie in with the actual Spanish Mission. It's going for dark & solemn, and it hits the mark, so kudos for that.

The food, though...I mean, I suppose my group and I should have been prepared for pretentious presentation and ridiculously small portions, given that this is Scottsdale, but seriously, when the food came out, we looked at each other, had a bit of a moment, all clearly baffled by how little we each had on our plates. It tasted alright, and was artfully plated, but still, far too small.

And it wasn't only the portions; part of the problem, at least for me personally, was what they tried to pass off as a salad. It was maybe five slivers of onion, a few itty bitty greens, and half a dozen extremely thin-sliced tomatillas. This was all sprinkled over my flat iron steak and repeatedly referred to by the waitress as a salad. It was not a salad. It was a garnish that they tried to talk up as a very fancy salad so they could justify charging $30 for the meal.

My group and I will not be returning. We're happy to visit our usual Mexican restaurant haunts. But hey, in an attempt to end on a happy note, I'd like to mention that the service was awesome. The hostesses were welcoming, our waters were refilled probably 7 or 8 times, our waitress was very friendly and attentive, and a manager checked on us halfway through the meal.

Maybe we should have told the manager that the food was tiny and weird...oh well.
