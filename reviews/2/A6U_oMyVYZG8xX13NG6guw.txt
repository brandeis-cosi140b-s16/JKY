Food is decent but the service is terrible every time I come here. I always catch the red eye flight and the restaurant is always packed at least 2 hours before the 11:30pm flight but they always insist on having only 2 waitresses and one bartender. I wish the restaurant owner would get it together and realize that just because you are the only late night restaurant in the terminal doesn't mean you can just piss customers off and give bad service.
