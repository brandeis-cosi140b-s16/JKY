It does the job.  It's not crazy expensive like many of the other restaurants in LV.  Portions are large so a meal can carry you through the night.  But you get what you pay for.

Mexitalia serves both Mexican and Italian food.  I leaned toward the Mexican fare, ordering a Chicken and Beef Enchilada combo plate.  The food has decent flavor but there is nothing special about it.  Generic seasonings, nothing more.

As far as the Mexitalia "X-Press".....  That's definitely a misnomer!   We'd come to this restaurant rather than another in the vicinity because we wanted to eat quickly and head back out to the Strip.  My food took upwards of 45 minutes.  The quickest came out at about 25 minutes.  So, yeah.  Not quite express.  At all.
