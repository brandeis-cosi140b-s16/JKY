My experience was a little different here.  First of all the parking lot was empty, usually a bad sign.  When we entered the resturant, we were the only ones in there.  The two guys working there were friendly enough and the prices were fantastic.  But the food didn't taste quite right.  Something tasted a little off in both my dinner and my wifes.  Almost like the oil they were cooking with was too old.   And the fact that they charge for refills on the soda (after the first free refill, but it's a small cup) was a little offputting.  The price is right but the food could certainly be better.
