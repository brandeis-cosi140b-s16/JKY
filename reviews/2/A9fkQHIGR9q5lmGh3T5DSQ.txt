This place is good to go to if you're hungry and stumbling drunk at 2 am...

At that time your taste buds aren't quite on their game, so you won't detect your money being wasted.  Also, your massive hangover will mask the gastrointestinal impact of Texano's dodgy mexican food.

Really, I know this is a _bertos type of place, but I have been to better and not many worse.  It stinks like a rotten corpse outside of the place, and last time I was there they didn't accept cards.  i don't know if this has changed, nor will I, because I don't plan on returning.  

Also, I have noticed the ill effects of eating at this joint the day after and so have some of my comrades.

If you're near here and want a burrito do yourself a favor... go to Rivas.
