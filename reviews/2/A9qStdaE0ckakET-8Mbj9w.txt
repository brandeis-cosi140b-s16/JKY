I came to this location to eat lunch with my girlfriend 3 days ago. We were both craving some good mexican food and thought we found a good spot. Unfortunately not. 

DIdn't start off bad, we were seated quickly and brought chips, salsa and drinks. Right after this our server, a lady with a southern accent, came to ask if we were ready.. nope needed a few more minutes. She must have come back only 30 seconds later. Talk about annoying. 

So we got our order in and started with chicken tortilla soup. It was okay.
We got our food in a reasonable amount of time. But then realized we had no silverware, so we stole some off of another table. No big.. 

My girlfriend ordered 2 enchiladas and was only able to eat 1/4 of one before she started feeling sick and has felt sick since this meal. No appetite, nauseous, stomach pains and more. Which makes us feel it was food poisoning. 

I ordered a carne asada bowl special. 20 minutes later, two empty glasses and still no check up from our server. We finally decide to just get up and go to the front. The lady at the counter looked puzzled at why we came to pay empty handed and informed her that we hadnt seen our server since we got our food. 

Needless to say we will NEVER be back & will be sure to warn everyone we know.
