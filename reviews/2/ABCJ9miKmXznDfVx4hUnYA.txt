Another overpriced tourist trap that happens to be on the strip, with a Mexican Decor. The food was the same that you would probably find at your local Chili's or other chain restaurant that happens to sell fajitas. The only good thing about this place would be the salsa. 

The only reason we went to this place was because the group of friends I went with really wanted to check it out.
