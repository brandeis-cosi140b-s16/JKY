Well, I have eaten at the location on central downtown, I have noe eaten at another one. I currently find myself displeased at this locale vs centrals locale. They didn't listen to what I ordered. I ordered enchiladas, they tried to bring tacos, I ordered beans and rice, only got rice. To much of hassle to bring another plate...waitress was nice, my actual server, a guy waited on the ladies longer and just walked by me and tapped me on shoulder asking, how is it? By the time I looked up he was walking over to his friends for more chatting.
