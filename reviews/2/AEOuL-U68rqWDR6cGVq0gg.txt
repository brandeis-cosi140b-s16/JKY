How Good Depends On What You Order.

 I have been to Carolina's a few times, after all it's close to where I work.  The food at Carolona's is hit or miss and the quality really depends on what you order.  Carolina's is a small one story white stucco building with barred windows and doors. The side of the building has huge letters spelling out "Carolina's".  Once inside you walk up to the  order windows  and select your entrée from a large menu above the windows. 

 As you wait for your entree to arrive you can hear staff calling out order numbers. Once our number was called we made our way up front grabbed our plates and asked for some salsa, that is  available in small paper cups filled by big stainless steel mustard/ketchup pump dispensers.

The hard-shell machaca taco, rice and beans, horchata and tortillas a in the past were amazing. However, I found the cheese enchiladas to be mediocre (tortillas are hard, very little cheese, However, the red sauce is  tasty).  Today I ordered the beef tamale plate and to be honest my entrée was  pretty awful more fat than beef in the tamale, and the tamales had an overwhelming taste of oil. The meal just wasn't very good.

It might be a while before I decide to re-visit Carolina's.
