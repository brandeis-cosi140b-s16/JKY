The food is great, but I have to tell you this place develops long lines during non peak hours.  Management does not staff the line properly for efficiency.  I have been standing in line now for 20 minutes and haven't made it to order yet.  The line is to the door and there are only 2 people preparing the food.  Manager is nowhere to be seen.
