I have been here countless times the food is good but hate eating there because it's so hot. Sometimes the food can be dry. The customer service can be good  bad. The lady in the mornings and afternoons is so sweet and nice. The young girl at night can be rude and sometimes  rolls her eyes when taking order it gets annoying.
