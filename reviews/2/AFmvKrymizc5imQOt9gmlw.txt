This restaurant is by my place and I was hungry, so I went. To put it bluntly, go here for the food- not the service.  For me, service is the number one thing to look for in a restaurant.
I liked the food.  The nachos were excellent.  I just did not care for the service.  Very rude service.  They got the extra star because the nachos were slightly above par.
