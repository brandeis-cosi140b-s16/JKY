I appreciate they have a large variety of vegetarian fares. In addition to normal bean filling; they have spinach, avocado and mushroom as options. The prices are cheap -- even cheaper if you order off the ala carte menu. Sometimes when you go at night, the servers can be hard to catch. The food is OK. I'm not a huge fan of the salsa/chips. I like the spiciness of the salsa but the chips usually seem quite salty. Despite all this, I still go here from time to time because it is quite cheap, dependable and open late.
