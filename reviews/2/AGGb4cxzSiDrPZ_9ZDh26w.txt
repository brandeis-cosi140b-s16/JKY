The 2 stars are for the decor and that's about it. The service was non existent as the staff was too busy talking with each other vs. their customers. Margarita was ok but I'd suggest 'no rocks' because it was mostly ice like a fast food place. Enchiladas were cold, fajitas were ok. Had to actually ask for silverware...ridiculous. They charge for chips & salsa so I expected a better product, I think it was from a jar. Skip this place.
