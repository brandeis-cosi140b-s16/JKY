I feel like you have to be drunk to properly appreciate 3-pound burritos and $16 multi-meat and cheese tortas with silly names. I consider myself a fairly adventurous eater but chose to stick to their basic tacos and tortas and was underwhelmed. 

Lamb meat is dry, sauced tortas are drowned in sauce that was a bit too spicy for my liking. The un-sauced tortas made the dryness of the meat more pronounced. If they can't do the basics well, I'm not about to spring for their deluxe Frankenstein concoctions.
