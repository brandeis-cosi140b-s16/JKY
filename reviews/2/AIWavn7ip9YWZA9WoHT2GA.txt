I'm from Southern California, so I have had plenty of experience eating at taco/burrito shops.  I demand not only good quality, but good value.

I placed an order for a carnitas burrito with rice added (for $1 extra).  I wanted it like they do in SoCal -- rice, meat and beans.  I also ordered a tamale, which I normally do when I visit a new Mexican food restaurant to gauge their quality.  If they make excellent tamales, that's a sign that they care about quality.  Well, the good news is that the tamale tasted great -- very authentic, the bad news is that it was tiny... maybe 4 oz. at best?  They give you this huge takeout box, which lends to the disappointment when you open it to discover a half-anemic tamale.  The carnitas burrito with rice?  What rice?  In fact, I want to know what happened to the burrito -- it was the size of something I would find at Taco Bell.  Mind you, this was a $5.50 burrito, and for that much I wanted more than a small Taco-Bell-style burrito (that I can get for $2.00).  So no only was the burrito tiny, but it was missing the extra rice.  Overall, for the $7.50 I paid I was very disappointed.  Not worth the money.

I sensed  an order error might happen when I heard the cashier call-out the order to the cook.  When ANY restaurant uses the word-of-mouth system to place orders in the kitchen, there is a huge possibility for error (as happened in my case).  This is unacceptable and their order system should be changed to a computerized system.

Pros:  authentic taste, fast friendly service, fresh home-made tamales

Cons:  Small, anemic servings, poor order taking, slow cleaning of tables
