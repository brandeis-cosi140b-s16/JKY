So, our unintentional quest to spend every weekend in April doing something in Cave Creek/Carefree ended on a down note. I was craving Mexican food and margaritas and we had seen this place on our way into Cave Creek. It looked borderline hole-in-the-wall which we thought could be a good thing. 

Before heading over I consulted Yelp (as always). Which by the way boyfriend now claims I refuse to try anything that isn't highly regarded by yelp users. I have to admit, it's kind of true.... does that make me some kind of yelp snob? Anyway, back to Los Mesquites.... The reviews were all over the place so I said I'd be willing to try it. 

My thoughts: 

*Outdoor area had some potential, but it wasn't very well kept up. 

*16 year old karaoke birthday party was somewhat entertaining, but started to wear thin after a little while. Somehow Mexican food and 16 year olds rapping to Snoop Dogg just don't quite go together. 

*The food was pretty bland and definitely "gringo-ized". My tortilla soup (that the waitress said was really good) was vegetable soup with some tortilla strips sprinkled on top. The refried beans were also bland. The chips and salsa were fine (house-made chips and decent salsa, though not spicy). 

*The margaritas weren't bad, but they were nothing special.
