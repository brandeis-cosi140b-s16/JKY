Horrible attitudes at this location. We frequent this location for work lunches and today we ordered online for a large order. We went to pick it up and they had forgotten 5 orders! 5!! How do you not give someone five entrees. When I called to speak to the manager to let them know we had sent someone back, he responded with so what do you want? Your money back or food? He was unpleasant! I asked him if they could remake the food as it had been out for over an hr at this point. He responded fine.
When the person called who we had sent to pick it up, I asked her to make sure they had remade the orders...in the background I hear a lady scream loudly..I did! Not very pleasant. My guess is by the time I get my food...it will be wrong I'm sure....yep it's wrong...and cold...so no they didn't remake it...rethinking my lunch orders...aweful
