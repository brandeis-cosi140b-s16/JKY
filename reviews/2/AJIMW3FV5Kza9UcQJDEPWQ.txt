This is an okay neighborhood mexican food spot.  I've been here a dozen times or so, and it's just okay.  Always an upbeat vibe at this place since it's a popular neighborhood spot, but the food it the type you say "uhh, probably won't come back here for a while."  Pricing is reasonable for what you get and the service is what you'd expect.  I'll go back, but it's not a place I crave.
