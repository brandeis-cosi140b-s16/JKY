MEH... this used to be my favorite place years ago, took wife today, her black beans were cold and crunchy, I asked to see manager, he came over and immediately said "yeah, that's happened before, we keep them on salad bar and if anyone orders them, we just microwave some...."  then he walked off with the dish and never returned..no apology...no meal comp..nothing.... "HOT" salsa wasn't hot at all.  Prices were higher than other mom and pop places.  I like the interior, its clean and neat despite being "out of date" 
on the good side: Clean, good service
