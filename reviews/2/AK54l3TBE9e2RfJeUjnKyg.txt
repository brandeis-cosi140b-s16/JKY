So I initially ate here and it was my favorite place to get some authentic Mexican burritos that reminded me of California and Arizona. However, I started noticing a decline in the quality of food they started turning out. The salsa was awesome in the beginning, but later it was watered down - and lacked spice. Were they trying to skimp out on ingredients and make their product last longer, or the salsa was not refrigerated and just went bad? Who knows...
