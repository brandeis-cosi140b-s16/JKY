This was the worse service I have ever received. The restaurant was dead and we were seated promptly but rudely.  The food came out fast, which was the only positive part of this experience. Our waitress Patty, only came to our table once due to the fact that she needed to get our orders. We needed other things at our table and she never came by. We wanted to get our bill and we had to get a server come over to get Patty's attention. It took an additional 15 minutes to get our bill. Overall fast food but the service was terrible. Shout out to the cooks, too bad Patty couldn't give this restaurant another star.
