This place has really gone down hill the past few months.  The employees are very nice, yes, but I'd rather take someone with attitude over my orders taking forever and being incorrect.  Typical time is at least 5 mins a car in the drive through.  Ask for extra sauce, and get none on more than one occasion.  Even something as simple as a soda they somehow manage to mess up - today it tastes like soap. Maybe if they hire people who can actually work instead of making stupid voices orders will start being right again
