The food is good. Delivery fast. But I can't believe I paid $18 with tip for a steak quesadilla with almost no fillings at all, the missing green peppers I ordered as an extra and the tiny container of guacamole.  My hopes were high for a filling meal. Not so much.  Everything tasted good but it was way over priced. I just think that if you pay $10+ for a quesadilla it should include more than a few pieces of meat and a sprinkle of cheese, you know?
Not sure if I'll try again.
