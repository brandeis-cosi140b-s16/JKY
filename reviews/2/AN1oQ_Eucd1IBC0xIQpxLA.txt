I love Taco Bell and am known for it (sadly). 

After recently becoming a Pescetarian, I have been able to keep my obsession going because they replace meat with beans in everything I want!

After going a whole 2 months with eating no meat (which I'm very proud of), taking a bite and realizing I had eaten some made me sick to my stomach. 

This upset me very much! Be a little more careful next time? Thanks.
