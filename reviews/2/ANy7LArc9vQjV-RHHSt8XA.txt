I've eaten at several Filiberto's locations around the East Valley but this one does not get a high rating from me. I've received food at a full service restaurant faster than this fast food location. Most of the tables in the facility were dirty. The condiment bar was empty of all selections except for salsa and was dirty. Next time, I'll opt for the Garcia's across the street.
