Meh describes our Cilantro experience perfectly.  The only thing that could probably lure me back would be the guac but I'd order it with a drink and not dinner.  

Service was good, our waiter checked on us frequently and kept our beverages full.  We weren't in any hurry but it did 50 minutes for us to get our food, which our waiter apologized for profusely.  The quality of the food was just okay.  Like the previous posters have said, the meat was just okay quality, sides were hit or miss, and the sauces overall were really good.  

And yes, the atmosphere is a odd, it's very open space but yet the tables are cramped.  We were sitting in a little table by the bathrooms so we weren't out in the middle of everything.  From where we were sitting we could watch the wait staff and customers struggle to get around tables.    

Overall, I think the restaurant has potential, it just needs (a lot of ) refining to make it what it could be.
