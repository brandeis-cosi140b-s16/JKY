The food was good but there was this man sitting at the bar with a laptop who I assume was the manager or owner and he kept yelling at all the staff. It made us feel VERY uncomfortable. He kept going behind the bar and grabbing the drink shaker out of the bartenders hand and yelling at her In front of customers for making drinks wrong. I get it if you are the owner and you want the staff to do things a certain way you don't yell at them in front of customers. I could tell our waiter was so embarrassed every time he came to our table. I don't want to come back here because of how uncomfortable I felt.
