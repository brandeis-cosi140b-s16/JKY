I love gambling, partying and obviously I love to eat so naturally Las Vegas is one of my favorite places to visit. I have been to Las Vegas a few times and Pink Taco has always been one of my favorite and more afforadable places to dine. Unfortunately, on my last visit, I was a bit disappointed. I don't know it if was my selection or if they have just simple fell off, but the joy I typically have eating there just was not there. The portion size was good, the prices average and the service was what you typically expect, but the food itself was just not that good. I ordered the Carne Asada Tacos and it lacked something (aka flavor). I had to added so much hot sauce to make it taste an ounce of what it should & steak naturally has a bit a flavor so I am not quite sure why that was. And although they use fresh corn tortillas, it still could not save the taste of these tacos. On the other hand, the chips and salsa were pretty good, but I hardly expect that free chips and salsa can make up for mediocre food you actually pay for.
