Pretty average to poor.  They try to be an upscale Mexican bistro but really the food is no different than any other chain Mexican restaurant.  The beans were flavorless and too thick.  The cheese enchilada had no finesse--overwhelmed with cheese with a thick enchilada sauce.  Didn't like the margarita either.  I'm not a fan.
