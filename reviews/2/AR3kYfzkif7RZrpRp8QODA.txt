Here for a conference (does anyone actually come to the city of phoenix for anything else?). I should have known not to set foot inside just how empty it was compared to the place next door. This place is honestly one of the most disorganized places I've eaten at. The waiters literally are running around, and just getting a seat in the empty restaurant was a process.  We received no less than 7 apologies throughout our dinner. I'm not sure why they kept apologizing as they weren't always doing anything wrong... they must just be used to people complaining or something. I got a salad and while it is pretty hard to mess up a salad, this was not very good. The meat (pulled pork) on the salad was gross, and the sour cream was hard and gross... the lettuce was standard iceberg cut up. My dining partner had the gyro and the meat was gross and he just ended up eating the fries. Also, although it looks like they did at one time, they no longer serve alcohol. That should be a sign to stay away. I feel bad for the waiters as this place obviously is in need of new management and a menu overhaul.
