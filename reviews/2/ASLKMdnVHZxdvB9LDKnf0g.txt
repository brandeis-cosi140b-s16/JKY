The service lacks ambition!

My waitress took our order after about 10 minutes of waiting. Not only are we the only ones here but after she took our order she sits back down 2 tables behind us and eats, I really hope she washed her hands. 

There are no free refills and they carry mostly coke products out of a fridge. 

Still waiting on my food. Will update after ward.
