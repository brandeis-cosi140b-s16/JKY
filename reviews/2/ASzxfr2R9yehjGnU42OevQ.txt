This place is what it is.  Uneven service (we had the best and worst waitresses I've ever had, in one night), uneven and mediocre food, and so-so mixed drinks.  But, there is something alluring about the extremely laid back atmosphere and nice setting.  It's as if you stumbled into a somewhat dumpy, but still very fun joint in Rocky Point.  Yes, I felt obligated to give it two starts based on the fundamentals, but the proof is in the pudding; we stayed for five hours last night!  So, something is right!  The volleyball aspect is nice, but there is only one court now, so be sure to call ahead.  There is some league activity that takes over that court for multiple weeknights.   

Would I recommend S.S?  No (Yes).  :)
