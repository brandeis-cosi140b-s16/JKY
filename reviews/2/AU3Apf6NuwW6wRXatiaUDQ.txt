Yuppy interior decorator meets mexican food = Blanco.  The food was so-so, the cheese crisp was good, the people watching was the best part.  If your a single male looking for another male and you can stomach bland over frooffy food, this is your place.

I guess I just hoped for something better from the Borgata area, even the now closed El torito next door was way better.  

You will find me getting real mexican food somewhere else.
