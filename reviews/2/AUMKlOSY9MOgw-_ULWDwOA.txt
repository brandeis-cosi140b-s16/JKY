Was looking for a Mexican restaurant in the Ahwatukee area and was lured in by the big outdoor patio at Sandbar. I was with family visiting from out of town so I thought they'd like to sit outside and enjoy the warm weather. Unfortunately there were no open tables outside so we ended up sitting inside oh well.

The atmosphere is kinda loud and bar like which was fine. It wasn't so loud that we couldn't hear each other. Although the waiter had a hard time hearing us as we had to repeat ourselves several times. And he always seemed to big in a big hurry which was kinda weird.

We got chips and salsa and a couple people in our party got margaritas to start with. I was kinda bummed that the chips and salsa were $5 when they're usually free at other places if you order dinner. But the salsa was actually pretty good so it was fine.

I had the carnitas tacos and was a bit underwhelmed. Honestly the carnitas at Chipotle is better. They were fine, 3 to an order but the portions were kinda skimpy. The tortillas were fresh though. I ordered it with rice and beans. The beans were fine but the rice was pretty gross. I don't know if it was the seasoning or what but it was some of the worst mexican rice I've ever had.

The boyfriend had the chicken enchiladas and he said they were not good. He said the sauce on them was more like marinara sauce than enchilada sauce - yuck. 

My cousin and her husband didn't say anything so they might have liked it or they were just being polite.

With so many other good places for Mexican here in town I don't think we'll revisit Sandbar anytime soon.
