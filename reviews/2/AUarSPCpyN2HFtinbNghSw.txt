This might be one of those places that I'd be tempted to stop into occassionally if they had anything above average.  Unfortunately, their fish taco was good but nothing special and their 'service'... if that's what you'd call it, was not very friendly.  The only saving grace was the taco was only $2.  Too bad... the place looked cute!

Won't see ya here!
