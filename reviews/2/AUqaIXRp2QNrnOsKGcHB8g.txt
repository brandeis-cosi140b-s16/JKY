Since there were no reviews and the place just opened, we went there ready for anything. It isn't a sit down, you order at a counter like a fast food place and they bring the food to you. 

I'm giving it two stars because it is clean. It is so new it isn't decorated on the walls but that doesn't affect my rating. 

The service was OK but the problem is the food. One of us had the soft carne asado tacos (they give you 2) for $8 and the carne was dry. The flavor was OK but the value wasn't there. The refried beans were horrible and the rice was dry. The other person couldn't resist the urge to try the chile relle√±o burrito-yes, that's right, a burrito. It was a much better value than the tacos (tab was under five bucks including tax) and was a lot better than the carne asado tacos. We wished they chopped up the chile into bite size pieces because a bite brought out this large pepper and it was hard to eat gracefully-it looked like someone was smoking a pepper cigar. The burrito was filling but the $8 tacos left us hungry.

The kicker is that they have a drive-up window and they do make the food to order. We were half way through our meal when a red truck drove up to the drive-up. We finished and left and the truck was still there. I wouldn't want to order when there was anyone in front of me in the drive-up.

For the money, go to Rubio's (a chain). There was no condiment bar like they have at Rubio's and the value is better there.

They better get the kinks out or it will be another flash in the pan.
