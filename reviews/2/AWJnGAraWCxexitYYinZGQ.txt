The food is decent, but for fast food I can't handle the SLOW service. The two ladies that routinely take the orders and call them out when ready have to be the slowest fast food workers I think I have ever seen.

Neither are friendly. They both seem to be hating their job. 

Ordered: Nachos with grilled chicken. Decent. But when I have a half hour for lunch I don't want to spend the majority of it in line so Mary Worth can make her extra spending money behind the counter.
