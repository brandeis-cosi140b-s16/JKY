First time here since the remodel.  I ordered the Cubano sandwich.  I was hoping it would taste something like the Cuban sandwich from this food truck in tucson called DC Jumpie.  Well unfortunately I was disappointed.  The ham was over cooked and the pork lacked flavor, the pickles were good.  My mother order carnita tacos and she stated that the pork lacked flavor as well.  The black beans were too salty.  The sweet potato fries were quite good however.  They also have decent salsa.  
Another thing that the bus boys and waiters could do while they are waiting around would be to polish the silverware.  There are spots all over the silverware.  Something so easy could have changed my first impression.

Too bad, I had high hopes for this place.

I will probably try it one more time and give it a second chance.  I was told they have a fajita bar and it includes dessert.  Everyone deserves a second chance so it was not so terrible that I won't go back.
