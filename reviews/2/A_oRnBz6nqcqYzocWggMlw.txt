The place was clean and well decorated. The food came out fast, which means it was prepared in advance and it kinda tasted like it. The menu is crazy over priced for the food you get. I do not mind paying money for good food but this was bland and did not taste authentic. The fry bread was greasy and tasteless! The tables are too close together and we kept running into other customers and chairs. I bought a taco, tamale, tostada, rice and beans and one fry bread taco, add two medium drinks and we spent $28. Tasted like a $4 meal! You are better off at one of the "bertos"!!
