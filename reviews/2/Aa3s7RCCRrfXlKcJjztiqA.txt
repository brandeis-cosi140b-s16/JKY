Quite possibly one of the worst food experiences of my life, Mexican or Salvadorean. At one point, this space was a Salvadorean-Mexican fusion place owned by the same people as the Las Palmas market next door. The BF was one of their biggest fans.

But we went a couple of weeks ago, and despite being the same type of food, and the same space, this was not the restaurant he remembered. 

For the life of me I can't even remember what we ordered, only how awful it was. I vaguely recall ordering enchiladas but receiving something that did not even remotely resemble the dish. The corn tortillas were the only redeeming factor, but the meat inside was overcooked to the point of being dry, tasteless, crunch. The rice and beans looked suspicious and tasted worse- I don't think I've seen beans that far gone outside of a dumpster. The complimentary chips were stale. The salsa was watery. The food looked and tasted, in short, very old.

The café is small and simple, décor next to nonexistent, and the service is just as minimal. And I don't mean that in a good way.
