My fianc√©e and I used to come here a lot and the food was good.  Must be the gas prices cause the quality and portions have suffered.
5 small strips of steak for fajitas is SAD.  Maybe I ordered from the seniors menu.  Oh well it looks like I will be stopping by taco bell to fill up.
My opinion save yourself the trouble and eat at Taco Bell, at least the value for your money is better.
