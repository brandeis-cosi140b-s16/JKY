We wanted to try something new. Came to On The Border. Went to the bar area for Happy Hour. Only seats available were the two at the end of the bar. The end seat had a huge gaming machine that doesn't move. Who in the hell has those? Finally a small booth opened up. We moved to that. Now we have a new server who is ignoring us... Finally the bartender took our order. Food is ok. Better than Arribas. Presentation was a lot better also. All in all everything was just ok. Don't think I'll be back tho.
