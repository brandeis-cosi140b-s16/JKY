I would love to give this place three stars because the service is pretty darn good. But the food is just sub par compared to the other choices in Madison. I had a combination platter of a burrito, taco, and tostada. It was very bland and didn't seem to have much flavor at all.  I would compare this place to a restaurant like Pedro's.  It's Fast, Cheap, and just OK.
