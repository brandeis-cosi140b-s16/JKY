This place is good after a night out on Mill or any late night where alcohol is involved.  It's also great place to watch drunks brawl, or end up, after driving over the Big Burrito drive through sign! 

They have a good menu selection of typical Arizona mexican food.  They server carne asada in the food so that's cool since, it seems to be getting harder to find places that server carne asada in burrito, tacos and chimichangas, around here.  The food is pretty bland and greasy.  The spicy sauce isn't that hot.  If you go into this place knowing what you're getting yourself into then it's all good.  Makes me realize how spoiled I am to have good Mexican food at my doorstep and all of the great joints in The Mission.  

If you're craving mexican food, at 3am, Amados is where you go...just don't go alone!
