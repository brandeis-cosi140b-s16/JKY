I had high hopes for this one, considering all the great reviews... too high of hopes.

I consider myself a Mexican food addict. If there were a Mexican Food Anonymous, I'd absolutely need to join.

Like a few of the previous Yelpers, I ordered the #8 combination, which was a chile relleno, beef taco, and enchilada with rice and beans.
-The beef taco was crisp, yes, but there was the tiniest little shred of beef in it. Might as well have been a fried shell. I took one bite that had meat. The rest was empty.
-The chile relleno was extremely greasy. I don't know if their oil was not hot enough to fry or what, but the batter on the outside of the rellano seemed to be more of an oil sponge than anything. Took one bite and pushed the rest aside.
-The enchilada, generally my least favorite of mexican fare, was actually pretty good. Really plain, but the sauce was the lifesaver on this one. I actually ate the whole enchilada.
-Beans were runny and flavorless. No thanks
-Rice was fluffy, but much like it's frijole counterpart, had no flavor. No thanks again.

All this for 10 bucks (granted that's not a lot of money... but it kind of is considering all I got out of it was basically a bite of taco and a cheese enchilada).

At least the people who worked there were nice.

I won't be back. Sorry.
