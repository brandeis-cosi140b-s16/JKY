Four of us ate here for lunch on 3-16-2015.  Two of us are vegan which we told the waitress so she could assist us in ordering items that do not have meat or dairy products in them.  She told us that both the black beans and refried beans had meat but the rice was completely vegan.  We ordered veggie items with rice as our side dish.  The food was average and the server was friendly but very slow.  We asked for drink refills on two separate occasions and they arrived 20 minutes later each time.  It was not busy in the restaurant so it is puzzling that it took so long to refill water and ice tea.  The manager came by to ask how our food was and I made the suggestion that they offer beans made without meat for vegan and vegetarian diners.  She explained that they are in the process of changing their menu to include gluten free items and more vegetarian dishes.  She told us that currently the beans and the rice are all made with meat (chicken stock is used to prepare the rice) but they were working on changing this.  I told her that the waitress assured us that the rice was vegan and she said that the waitress didn't know.  I told her that the servers should know specifically as customers have dietary needs.  She apologized and gave us vouchers for a return trip.  I understand she was doing her best to make us happy and she was very apologetic.  It is very frustrating to eat in restaurants that do not teach their servers what is in the food or at least to make sure servers ask before guessing and bringing it out after the customer has made it clear what their needs are.  Management needs to educate their servers.
