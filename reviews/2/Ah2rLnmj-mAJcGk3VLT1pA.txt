There was a party going on the night that we came and all of the service was focused on them. It took about 30 minutes to get our drinks and another 20 to get our food...45 minutes and the restaurant wasn't that busy! They also don't know how to use their open table reservations! One person was working for the first 20 minutes we were here. Not impressed!
