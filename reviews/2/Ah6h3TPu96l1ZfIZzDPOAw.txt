The owner is there everyday, which is cool.
The prices are decent if u don't mind basically paying for a Rice/Bean Burrito with a dash of meat!!!!! 
(I don't want a bunch of filler, i want meat w/ filler..not Filler w/ meat)

They have a special on Friday's but.. its no good for me because I doubt I'll try it again. (I've been here 3x)
