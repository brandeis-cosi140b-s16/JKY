What a disappointment. I can't believe this place has 4.5 stars??!? I feel like I've missed something. Came here on a Friday evening with high expectations as I was in the mood for some good old Mexican food. I guess I can say I'm lucky to have had AMAZING Mexican food from LA, OC, to San Diego and this by far cannot compare. The ONLY item that I would recommend here is Adobada. The other items I tried: carne asada fries (bland, totally NOT WORTH IT), and carne asada taco. However, I'm not that adventurous and they did have cabeza and lengua on the menu. If your into that then maybe those are worth a try! Simple menu. DIRT cheap and fairly clean. There are several lines for you to put your order. Once you've received your food you go back to the register to purchase the items.  After such a disappointment I probably would not go out of my way to return.
