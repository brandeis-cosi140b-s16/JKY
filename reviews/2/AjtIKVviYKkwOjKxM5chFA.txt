Atmosphere: TOO LOUD!! 
Food: Blah 
Service: Iffy 
Overall Experience: Not Likely to return 

I went to dinner here with my friend Jess. We were seated halfway in the kitchen area...no joke!! There were kids running around like they owned the place, and we found out, they sorta do....they were the owners kids. What kind of restaurant owner lets their kids run wild through a restaurant on a Friday night??? 

We didn't have anyone come over and see us until we had been seated for over 5 minutes, which considering where our table was, we found to be kinda funny. The food was very blah, no flavor! I had a carnitas quesadilla and the only flavor that I could taste was the poblano peppers. My friend had shrimp tacos, she said that the shrimp was overcooked and lacked any sort of flavor. 

It was not a very pleasant experience, even not counting the food. The restaurant had music blasting the entire time, like it was some kind of club or something. Which I thought was funny because just about every table had kids or people over the age of 60 at it, definitely not people that enjoy loud music at a meal! The restaurant has 2 bar areas, which is kind of odd, especially for a place located in such a family friendly area. They really are trying to be more of a club I think, which is fine, but maybe they should act like a restaurant until like 9....then crank up the music!
