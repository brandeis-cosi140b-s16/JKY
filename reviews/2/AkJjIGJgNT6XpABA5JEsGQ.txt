Very slow service.  Sitting for 50 minutes without appetizer.  Entree served more than 75 minutes after being seated.  Cheese crisp was made with white cheese and not crispy.  Entree was good just a very long lunch that could have been much better if they had better help. Also there was too much cumin in the salsa and found chunks of it in there.
