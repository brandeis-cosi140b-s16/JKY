I've been there three times now, the third just to try the taco to get something quick right near campus and to be able to properly review it (can't review a Mexican place without trying a taco or burrito).  The taco was small, no more than 3-4 inches in length, and I didn't see a crispy shell option.  The shredded beef although was excellent, but for $2, not all that worth it.  On another visit, I tried the fried fish, and I don't think I could have been more disappointed.  It was seriously a fish with only half the meat left on it (bizarre wedges were cut out of it, and filled with limes), stuck in a fryer, un-filleted (other than the wedges), and essentially undressed or prepared (other than the limes).  The decor is juvenile (one sign said sexual harassment will not be reported but graded), and unappealing to say the least.  Bad price, sub-par food, but ok service.
