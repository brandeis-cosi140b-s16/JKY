I usually love El Pollo Loco, but lately this store has gone too far trying to stretch out the chicken.  Today's example is:  I asked for a three piece, rice, beans and tortillas.  what I received was a leg and a thigh that was cut in half.  WTF?!?  A thigh is a piece of chicken.  It does not need to be cut in half.  No response but an apology will fix this.  I don't need any excuses about how it is cut or nothing like that.  My office headquarters 26 companies and all of them are upset with El Pollo Loco at this location.  they wasted my money more than once and now I have no more time for being ripped off.
