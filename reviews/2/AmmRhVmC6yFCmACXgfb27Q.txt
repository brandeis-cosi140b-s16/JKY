OH MY GOD THIS PLACE IS GROSS! These taco bells have all been knocked down and rebuilt due to conditions that no longer make them sanitary enough to eat at.  Now this being said i like taco bell and I eat their healthy options because im not obese, as well as i don't go there much but this particular location which is unfortunately near my work i have been to several times.  The workers are illiterate which i spelled wrong and used spell check taking away all credibility but really scummy workers, gross place and my order has been messed up every time ive gone, go else where but not culvers because they SUCK TOO, and i dislike you if you like culvers honestly they shouldnt be in business
