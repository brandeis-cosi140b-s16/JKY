What to say.  For those of you who want a quick review stop reading and just go to chipotle.

Interesting and wonderful how innovation and competition changes our perceptions.  When baja fresh first opened it was pretty much the only quick Mexican food chain "game" in town and I thought it was good.  Then chipotle entered the game and the downgrade comparisons begin.  First the food is more expensive than chipotle but not higher quality.  For those with a healthy appetite, the quantity is also smaller.  We paid for our food and were given a ticket to wait for our food.  Chipotle again sets the standard as your food is prepared right in from of you while ordering and you get your food when you pay.  While on the subject of preparation, Baja does not provide any selection of ingredients for variety.  I know you can custom order a burrito, but it is not the same thing as seeing your food deliciously constructed before your eyes and being asked about each tasty new addition.  Finally there is the overall taste.  The burrito I had was good, but a touch greasy; very unlike the fresher taste of a chipotle burrito.  This baja restaurant lightly fried my burrito to give it a light browned appealing color.  Unfortunately the browning also dried out the tortilla too much.  Chipotle tortillas are always soft, warm, and taste like they were just rolled.  The only point that scored higher than chipotle was the salsa selection. Baja has a separate salsa bar where customers can serve themselves.  There is also a few more salsa types to select from.  I prefer the self serve option rather than having to wait behind other customers to ask for an additional bit of salsa

I've eaten at the baja fresh on university drive in Tempe and don't remember having the same less positive experience; but that was pre-chipotle too so perhaps it would be the same.  Ill let you know if I try this baja restaurant again and my experience is different

Happy eating
