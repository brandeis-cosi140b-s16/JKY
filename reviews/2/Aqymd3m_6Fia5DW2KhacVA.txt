i really wanted to like this restaurant, but it was just okay.  

i liked our waitress; our food not so much.  the chips were alright.  salsa tasted store-bought or like it came out of the can.  i mostly got full off of that because the food seemed to take a while.  ordered a three choice meal. i chose a deep fried shredded beef taco, sour cream green chicken enchilada, and tamale with a chicken tortilla soup on the side.  the best of my choices was the sour cream green chicken enchilada.  everything else was meh. the food is more americanized and it's acceptable for that matter, but disappointing for me as i was expecting authentic.  

i probably won't be back again.
