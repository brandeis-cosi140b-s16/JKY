I drove by this spot and had to stop for lunch... I am always on the quest for great street tacos so I entered the restaurant and was greeted by a really helpful friendly staff... So it's hard for me to give this review I looked over the menu and saw they had a Sonoran Hot Dog so I had to get it... Along with a Steak Taco and a Pork carnitas taco... I rate the food as followed.

Sonoran Hot Dog -D
Steak Taco - D
Pork Carnitas - D
Chips And Salsa - A

The Sonoran Hot Dogs bun was really soggy it made it fall apart and not enjoyable to eat... The Steak Taco tortilla was really doughy the meat was kind of dry the salsa made it better... The Pork carnitas taco tortilla was doughy as well the meat was pretty good the salsa made it better as well... They have a orange drink there that was really good plus the salsa was really good... I will go back again just to get the orange drink.
