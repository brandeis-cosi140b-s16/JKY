This was my second time coming to this restaurant. It's close enough to my work so I hoping it would be my go to spot for Mexican food. But I will continue looking since it left a bad taste in my mouth. 

The first time I went I ordered the Burrotote (Big Burrito) it's a joke. its more of a large taco.  Besides the false advertisement its flavor was bland especially since it has iceberg lettuce. 

I gave them another chance since it's supposed to be known for their Tortas anyway. I ordered the cochinita pibil Torta. I ordered it but the problem was that I was left waiting for my food for 25 minutes and when I went and asked the cook for my sandwich he said someone else had taken it. I went up to the counter where I ordered and the lady at the front ignored me. So I walk back to the cook and asked him to make it to go. 

THe torta was good, I have to admit, but I was dissapointed by the whole experience. Hey if you want to take your chance at this restaurant go ahead but why do it since Reyes de la Torta is just south of the street from them.
