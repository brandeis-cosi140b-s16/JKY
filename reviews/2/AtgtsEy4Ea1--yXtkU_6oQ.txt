My husband and I used to come here a lot since we found out about this place in summer of 2013 though we never really made effort to write a review until 07/2014 and now were back to revise that 4 star we left. Now were back with a two stars. Things have changed over the summer. Fajita mix was removed from the choices of fillers and prices went up as well. Now they have added the option to be able to tip the employees which we don't mind but there is a new employee  there,  an elder lady who talks with so much enthusiasm (trying too hard really) and right when you get to the window to sign your receipt with a dollar and some change she just gives you the look and changed the tone of her voice. Lady we can choose not to tip you know.
We hardly come nowadays. *Sigh* what happened to this place.
