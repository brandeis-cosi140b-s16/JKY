Sat at the bar. The bartender sucked, lame attitude, no silverware, never asked about food or needing another beer and basically not very friendly.
The chips & salsa were pretty good, not great. The chicken fajitas were ok but typical, nothing to brag about. They need to make the beer colder and the staff warmer.
