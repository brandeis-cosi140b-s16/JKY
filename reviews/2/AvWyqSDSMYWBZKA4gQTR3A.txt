Honestly... any place that checks guys for weapons is a no go for me. Im not really good around thugs and hoodlems. Was a little weird.

once inside I saw why.. its like tijuana meets southcentral LA. 
I also do not like to get shanked nor checked out like a piece of carne asada. Just saying...

The margarita was disgusting sweet and barely any alhoohool with it. And it was way to expensive. Sorry.... I rather go to my favorite hole in the wall mexican restaurant than this place. At least I wont get shanked, robbed, raped, checked out, abducted or touched.
