On our search for the best authentic Mexican restaurant, we tried Las Islitas.  It was very noisy inside, I could not hear my dinner partner across the table.  Mexican music played loudly over the speaker, and a juke box played in the back.
Chips were okay, the salsa was good.  We ordered the shrimp tacos and chili relleno.  The tacos were deep fried (not stated on the menu), and greasy.  They were more like an empanada.  They were plain and bland.  The relleno was greasy as well and soggy.  It also had very little flavor.  It was also somewhat pricey for a strip shopping center, "dive".  We won't be back.
