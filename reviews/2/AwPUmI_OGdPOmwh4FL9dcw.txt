I'm not quite sure why such good reviews.
The place was clean, and the guys Ok.
But the place was HOT, like no AC hot, and we're in the middle of the summer!!
And the food, was OK, but by no means great.
I had tacos de cabeza, they had no flavor.
My kids had burritos de barbacoa, and again, cooked OK, but no real flavor.
The salsas were OK, but I'm not going out of my way to eat here.
