Not impressed. Like other Roberto's the cheese doesn't come with the Shrimp burrito. I find that odd because that's the way its supposed to be made. The location on Nellis and Stewart stays true to the original menu and they don't argue.

The second time at this place was just 5 days ago. Ordered 2 sausage breakfast burritos. The burritos were not good. They were filled with deep fried potatoes ( dry) and deep fried sausage ( dry), a little cheese, and next to zero eggs. They were wrapped crappy and then wrapped in paper so sloppy that they fell out in the bag. All the ingredients are supposed to be cooked on the grill with the egg to sausage and potato mixture is supposed to be 2-1. The whole thing was dry and hard to choke down.

Honestly, in the whole Vegas valley, only the Roberto's at Nellis & Stewart gets every item cooked correctly and tastes amazing. Other locales are going to have to step it up. Very disappointing I have to drive 20 mins for good Mexican fast food.
