Sitting down and eating the grilled chicken avocado ... and I must tell you I rated to stars only because I find it two things that where good about this location. One was  the service from the customers was very nice. And D ingredients were fresh such as avocado lettuce cheese etc. but the meat was horrible !! Not real meat!!
