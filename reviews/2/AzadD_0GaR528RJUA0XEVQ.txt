My fiance and I went for our normal breakfast burritos and sadly the cheese was still frozen. We order the hashbrown burrito. When we took the burritos back they refused to give us a new burrito or to refund our money back. We were simply told that the cheese is sprinkled on top and is not melted.My concern was why was my cheese frozen then? Very rude customer service. We decide we won't go back there. Don't you think they would rather keep a loyal paying customer then lose us as customer all together?!
