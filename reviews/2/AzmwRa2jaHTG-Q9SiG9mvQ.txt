Poor bartending service.  Was with a wedding party with a 2 hour open bar (which included a prepaid $500 gratuity) and the 2 bartenders took their time serving drinks, ignored one side of the bar and then messed up drinks....simple ones more than once.  I guess that is typical when you know you already got your tip.  Absolutely pathetic.
