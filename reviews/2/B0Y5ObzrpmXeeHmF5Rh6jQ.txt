Let me start off with this place used to be great! Sadly they're now trading on their name and the quality has dropped off tremendously. They offer these three salsas with the chips you get when you sit down and my wife and I used to destroy them all. The last time we went in (about a month ago) was because my wife was jonesin' for some good chips and salsa and we couldn't be more disappointed. The salsas were bland, watery and lacked any unique taste. We asked the server and she said about six or seven months ago that they changed the recipe. I've always been a fan of the sabano de pollo. It was extremely rich but extremely juicy and flavorful. I used to think this is how a fat kid with a cake on his birthday feels. It was good this time around, and it may have been as good as in times past but I just couldn't get over the betrayal of the cheapening of the ingredients. 
House margaritas are solid, and service is good.
