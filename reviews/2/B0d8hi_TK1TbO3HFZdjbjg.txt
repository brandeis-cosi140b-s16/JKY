Went here for dinner, not busy. Ordered the guacamole to start, it is essentially a half an avocado with a raw onion and tomato, topped with cilantro. It was $8 and a very small portion, pretty bland, not blended. My husband had the beef enchiladas, they were dry and bland. Our guest had the shrimp enchiladas and described them as "no big deal." I had the carne asada, it had good flavor, but no better or more special than other carne asada dishes I have had elsewhere. The meals all came with rice which was flat. The pinto beans were the highlight of the meal. The margaritas were good. Service was fine, nothing in particular that stood out. Overall, I think this place is over priced for the small portions and the food is bland. We will not be back.
