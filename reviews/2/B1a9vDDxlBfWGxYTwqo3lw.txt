I wanted desperately to love this little place.  The vibe is awesome, the menu is cool and I love the cuisine.  Here's the thing, nothing was aok besides the beans.  The black beans were good.

I ordered the jerk chicken taco and the cochinita pibil pulled pork taco.  They came with a side of green and red salsa.  Nothing was aok about any of this.  The jerk chicken was kind of grey and didn't have any jerk flavors, it was topped by unripened mango.  It was supposed to be a fresh mango salsa I guess but the flavors didn't mesh and it was just awful.  I tried it with the salsas but couldn't recommend either of these insipid and flavorless imposters.  Were they sitting around too long and did everything need salt?  There was too much wrong with all of it to sort it out.

The pork was ok, there wasn't enough of it.  Neither salsa really complimented it.  It was swallowed by the flavorful double corn tortilla that housed both tacos.  These were obviously made locally and fresh but were heavier than I am used to.

I can't recommend eating here and I will not be back.  Can I go back to Chicago now?  Mexico City downtown was the bomb and I wish they hadn't closed because this was the real deal.  Even if this isn't supposed to be authentic, they still need someone who understands food preparation and this particular cuisine.  Only my warm heart kept me from hitting the 1 star key.
