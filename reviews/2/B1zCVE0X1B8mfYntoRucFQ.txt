A friend and I went there for lunch at work. The two girls behind the counter spent easily 5 minutes talking to each other before helping us. They had poor attitudes and we're inexperienced. Neither of us got what we requested even though it is similar to Chipotle. The girl put onions on my burrito with out me asking then was upset I didn't want them. Others at the tables next to me had the same experience. Maybe with time it will get better. The food was so so. I would not go back.
