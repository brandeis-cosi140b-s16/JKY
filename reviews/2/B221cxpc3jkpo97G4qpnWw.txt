So I went here last friday with a group of coworkers.  My ratingL is meh for the food. There is goods and bad's, but all in all it isn't worth returning.  Let me start off by saying the restaurant is very clean and the wait staff was super friendly.  Our waitress was great.  So onto the food.  I had a lunch special.  Beef Taco, Red Cheese enchilada and beans.  I really dislike when places use manufactured taco shells that seem like the ones you can buy at a grocery store.  They taste like cardboard.  Stop using them!  If Fillyberto's can make theirs on the spot, so can you.  The enchilada sauce also tasted like the stuff you get in the can or in grade school lunches.  Wasn't a fan.  The salsa were good and so were the beans. But the taco and enchilada, two basic things, were just meh.  Sorry guys, won't return.
