The food wasn't great, and our waitress wasn't the brightest bulb. My daughter wanted apple juice, but she didn't know if they even had it. When we asked about cheese dip, she had no clue what I was talking about. She had to go ask the manager if they served it.  My water was never filled, to the point that I had a completely empty glass. My husband had to add flavor to the guacamole. Not impressed.
