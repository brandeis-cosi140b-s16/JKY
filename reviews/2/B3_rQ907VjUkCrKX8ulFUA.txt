Two star only because my waitress wasn't a b and the cheese dip was good. 

This place is like walking into a frat house. The seats felt rather sticky, pretty gross. And since it was dark at night, you don't know what the heck are on those leather. Service was super slow. The waitresses definitely has something to "showcase." My guy friends were definitely starring lmao! 

I came here for a friend's bday. The outside patio was packed. Inside was loud, but they played great music. The food, besides the cheese dip is nothing to be raving about. My tamale was dry and overcooked. Either that or it was frozen o.o Guacamole was alright. Salsa was good. Basically foods were meh. Drinks were good though. I don't think I'd come back unless it's for a friend or something. Definitely not my type of scene xD
