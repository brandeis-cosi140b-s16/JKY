My boyfriend and I went on a Friday night around 6:20pm. Luckily, we didn't have to wait long for a table because I was starved!

I was surprised that chips and salsa were not served-you had to buy them (That's my favorite part about going out for Mexican.) Him and I ended up sharing a half order of nachos and the dinner plate of tacos. For as busy as it was, the food was decent, but not phenomenal. Our waitress seemed a bit aloof the entire time as well, which was not helpful in making the experience a great one. Overall, it's a good place to stop when you are shopping at Hilldale Mall and need a meal. I recommend that if you have the time and energy to go somewhere else for dinner, do that.
