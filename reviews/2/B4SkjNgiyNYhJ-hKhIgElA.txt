Very slow service, seems the employee that provides chips and salsa upon arrival was on break.  When the server finally greeted us, she said he'll be back soon, but didn't offer to bring some herself.  Food was delivered same time as complimentary chips.  The waitress never came back for drink refills until she brought the check.  We had to raid an empty table for a place setting as we were shorted.
The food was less than average but not awful.  Average value but leaning to slightly over priced.
In my opinion there are several Mexican restaurants in the vicinity I would choose over this one in a heart beat.
