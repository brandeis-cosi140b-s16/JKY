I would not recommend breakfast... the portions were really small for the price - nothing "Mexican" about it other than they served some beans in a cup on the side

My husband got the French toast - they brought it out but forgot syrup... after 7 minutes still didn't have any syrup so I had to ask again
by the time we got the syrup his French toast was cold... 
we were 1 of maybe 6 couples in the whole restaurant so I know it couldn't have been because they were "busy"

not the best service or at least not what I expected for a restaurant on the strip
