Been coming here since 2007 and the quality has steadily declined.

The breakfast burritos are a consistently overcooked mess in regards to the egg, yet half melted cheese and tough tortillas. The potatoes inside are dry and on the brink of being burned they are so dark.

Go to the Chandler location instead. Their quality and consistency is magnitudes better.
