Used to go here almost every other day when I first moved up here, for one simple reason it was good (not like the ones back home). Went there the other night and tacos were extremely cold!! Hot dog wasn't as good as before, wasn't bad but wasn't good. If mickeys is one of your options go with the other place, if mickeys is your choice then it's s win either way.
