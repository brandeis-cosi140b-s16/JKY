Great restaurant? No! Awesome place to find a cure for constipation? Abso-friggin-lutely! Get a 5 buck box, wait 2 hours and let the good times flow right out of your rectum like greased lightning. Also, if you like dating big nasties that work at Taco Bell, this place is the spot to be. On the upside they are generally nice and usually get your order right.
