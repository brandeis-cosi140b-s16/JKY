Fun atmosphere- not too great food. Took my kids (3 & 8) and we had such poor service. The server gave my kids giant glasses with straws, but then gave the table next to us kiddie cups. When I asked for the same cups she acted all put out and never came back with them. Then she charged me adult beverage prices. We also had to request a to go box three times.  I have eaten here three times now- never that great. Street tacos are 75 percent cabbage. They have left the avocado out of my salad . I went once for a school function- the taco station beef tasted like Mc Cormick's taco seasoning. I must admit the chips and black bean salsa are great, but hey it is Arizona we can get that anywhere.
I may meet up with the gals for drinks and chips, but not bring my family here ever again.
