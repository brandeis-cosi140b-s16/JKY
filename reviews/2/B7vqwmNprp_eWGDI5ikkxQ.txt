My bestie loves this place and I can't understand why at all. The service is bland, the food is bland, the atmosphere is bland. I was meeting a friend and got there a little early. The three hostesses at the stand were less than friendly, but they seated me right away. 10 minutes later a server finally comes, but she was nice. I ordered a Michelada, and it was GROSS. 

My friend showed up so we ordered ceviche and fajitas. The ceviche tasted like the shrimp was already cooked and then mixed in with lime juice, which it's supposed to be cooked BY the lime juice, or something like that. It just didn't taste right. The fajitas were okay, but the tortillas became crispy as soon as they cooled down within a few minutes. I had one and was done.

I switched up my drink for a margarita, and that too didn't taste right. It was sickly sweet. I couldn't even finish my tiny margarita. The bill was almost $100. I'm glad my friend offered to pay or I would've felt extremely cheated and maybe would've given just 1 star.  Definitely NOT my cup of tea.
