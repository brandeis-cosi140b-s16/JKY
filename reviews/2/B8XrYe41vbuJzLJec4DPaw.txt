Food isn't bad but after a 10 minute wait for a burrito it feels like a wasted effort. This is the first time I have actually gotten food at this location because normally when i go the line is long and doesn't ever move. Today i happened to arrive with no line but by the time i left 10+ minutes later the line was at least 5 cars long.
