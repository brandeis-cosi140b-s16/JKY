AWFUL! Run to Taco Bell, you'll get better food there. I ordered a "combo" with rice and beans. Guess what? I received a burrito wrapped in paper and a side order of rice and beans that came in a separate container. How is that a combo? Food quality is substandard.

I've never had such bad Mexican food as I've had in Arizona. Unfortunate. Any hole in the wall in The SF Bay Area or Seattle offers 10x better Latin food than 95% of places in Arizona. I think the epicurean standards here are extremely low.
