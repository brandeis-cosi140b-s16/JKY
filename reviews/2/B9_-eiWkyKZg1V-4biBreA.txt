I usually love Fausto's but my last experience was horrible.  I called in to order around 11 pm one night.  I know that they close at midnight but there was still plenty of time before they closed.  When I got through, the person taking my order had major attitude and seemed pissed that I even dared to call their store.  I still gave my order anyways.  Once I got to the store they had already put away all the limes and sauces for the night!  It was only around 11:15.  The cashier was even more pissed in person that I was going to pick up my food.  Even my boyfriend noticed his horrible attitude.  We were so afraid that they may have done something to our food since both of their attitudes were so bad.  Luckily our food was still good when we got home.  I hope my next experience is better.
