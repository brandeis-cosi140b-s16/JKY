This "Mexican" dining experience is the least authentic I've ever had.

The crispy chicken flautas tasted like convenience store 'taquitos'.

Their quesadillas had great tortillas that were admittedly tasty, but the cheese was questionable. Other Yelpers have pointed out it tastes like Velveeeta, which I'm not down for in a sit-down establishment like this.

The chimichanga is the worst I've ever had. The beans are too sweet, and don't even taste like they should be used for Mexican food. I tried to douse a portion with the habanero sauce at the table, but that was even sweeter. It was...gross, to sum it up in nice terms.

Don't get me wrong, I don't HATE this place, it's just really lame food for such a great location, decor, and the friendly staff. The tequila menu is pretty legit, so I might swing by again while I'm shopping.
