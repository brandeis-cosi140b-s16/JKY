I love chipotle but this one kind of sucks. Sure I came in late, but an hour before closing everything was shut down. They had no chips or guac and the remaining rice was hard and undercooked. Maybe it's fine in the middle of the day but everyone working here was more concerned with closing procedures than dealing with the lengthening line. Again I would have understood if I came in 3 mins before closing, but I was handed my burrito in a to go bag and the hint was definitely to get out!
