I was craving some Mexican food last night and looked up yelp for some places. That's when I looked arund for Little Sombrero and followed fellow yelper's advice and ordered the green chile burrito.
    The service was pretty fast, I think they might have precooked the burrito because I didn't see anyone making anything and BAM, my burrito showed up at the window. It costed 5 something for a fairly sloppy burrito that was wrapped very loosely and had what I think was cheese ooze out from every angle so I had to use a fork and knife.

    The burrito itself was just OK. I'm not sure what constitutes as "green chile" but it was plain enough to warrant more salsa than I was given. Maybe I have been spoiled by San Diego's plethora of Mexican food and giant carne asada and shrimp burritos. And where was the guac?
