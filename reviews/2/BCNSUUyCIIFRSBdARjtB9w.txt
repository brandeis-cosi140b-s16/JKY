Below average Mexican/Tex-Mex food.  We went once and everyone in our party agreed that the food just didn't hit the spot.  When the check came, the prices were a little higher than we anticipated and we felt we had wasted our money, especially with some good restaurants within walking distance for a comparable or cheaper price.  BRGR and Mad Mex come to mind.  To be honest, I would have rather gone to Chipotle around the corner.
