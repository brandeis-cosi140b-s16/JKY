It a new year and like many of us . . . it's time to try and eat health for a while.  And since I had recently seen an ad for the under 500 calorie bowls I thought I would try one . . . I ordered the Black Bean Bowl.

The Bowl it self had a very good taste . . . but was way too running for my liking . . . and the broccoli was way under cooked.  The service was okay but could have been faster.

Even though this trip was not very good . . . I will probably stop in to try another one of their under 500 calorie bowls sometime down the road . . . after all even two stars for something healthy is better than one star.
