Food is still good, but the customer service and attention to detail on several recent occasions has been lacking.  They forgot at least one item the last couple times and instead of being apologetic and immediately making the item, they wasted time confirming that we actually ordered it.  Disappointing.  Not sure we will be visiting this location again soon...
