Overpriced, flavorless, and poor quality.

Don't be hoodwinked by the "we give you free bean dip so it's okay if our food is mediocre" routine.  The food here is not good. My taco was flavorless, and was mostly made up of a HUGE mound of chopped lettuce and tasteless tomato clippings.  The meat?  MIA.

I had to do a double take at the check, $5.50 for a cheese crisp?  $4.75 for a single taco???  Am I shopping at an airport boutique?  Sure tastes like it.

2 stars because the server was attentive and there was no wait to sit down, but it was obvious why this place was empty at lunch time.
