Love Mexican food. 

Lived next door to this spot for a year. 

Ate there twice. 

Both times was very below average. 

Clean, but unfriendly staff and subpar food. 

I work from home, so instead would drive a few miles down the road and deal with the asu line for Mexican from a different spot. Was still worth it. 

Too bad
