Pretty much just like Salty's but a little better, minus the sand volleyball. Half the it is outside, its got some sand and little toddler pool thingy.  I think the cover was $6, mixed drinks $8, shots $5, beers $3. If you order tequila and they ask you what kind, don't say surprise me. Dude, gave me some nasty tequila idk what kind it was but I've never hated tequila before, and smelled funny too. One bartender girl (a blonde with short hair) was rude she kept making weird faces when I walked up, ordered, and when I was talking with my friend, like I was offending her with my prescience idk what her problem was (maybe she had tourettes ?).  So my next drink I went all the way to the other side of the bar where all the crowds were to order. The dance floor is like a tiny pig pen thing that people cram themselves into, their all sweaty and bumping into each other, it sounds hot, but its quite funny to watch.  If a waitress comes around offering shots for $3 bucks don't bother they are super weak, not even tasty either. I did see a couple cute girls tho. The outside area offers a good place to talk with friends.
