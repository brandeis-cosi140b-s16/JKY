Do not visit this location.  High priced as expected but at least the other locations give you a lot more food. I got a bowl and all the ingredients barely made the top of the bowl. The staff looks nervous when they try to putt stuff in the bowl they kept looking back at I believe is the manager like they didnt want to get in trouble for giving us to much. Half a spoon of meat, a small pinch of cheese half a spoon of rice come on at this price more food or less cost for us. I asked for more and every thing they said is that will be extra cost. Chipotle needs to do a surprise check in on this location
