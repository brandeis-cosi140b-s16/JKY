Ok so went here tonight signs says open 24 hours then little sign on the door says closes @ 10pm.  Well 9:30pm. The doors are locked.  Had the people standing inside open the door and make me food. . Sure enough fryer was shut off.  

If you have a restaurant and signage that states that you are open then you need to honor this and give quality to every individual that walks into your establishment up to the time that you close.  I really enjoy not being able to get what I wanted.  Thank you so much and I hope you do well.  

Now time to find a different Mexican food please that honors the hours of operation.
