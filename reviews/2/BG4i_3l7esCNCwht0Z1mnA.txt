I was excited to try this place since I love Mexican food. Pretty disappointing. We had the chips with pineapple salsa and the pineapples in the salsa tasted rancid. I had the huevos rancheros, the taste was okay but nothing major. Could have had more eggs. The corn tortillas were burnt as well. Service was below average. 

I'd possibly try the place again for lunch or dinner instead of the brunch. We'll see.
