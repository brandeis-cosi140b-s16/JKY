While I love the food at Chipotle, this location is terrible.

The tall black gal with glasses needs to be retrained. The entire time we were in line I watched her walk up and down the line and pick up scrap food that was laying on the counter that they make the burritos on. She would take the scraps and throw them back in the food bins that they use to make your food.Who knows how long it had been sitting out on the counter, it shouldn't go back in the food to be served.

Oh how I wish we had a well managed Chipotle around here.
