EXPRESS if your driving a burro LOL  definitely not . It took over an hour for delivery and was told I was the only delivery the driver had . The food I cant understand how some people said it was the best they ever eaten. wow they must of had some seriously bad Mexican food or maybe taco bell to compare too. It definitely is not the best in anyway at all or even close come on. everything tasted like it came out a can the sauce for the green was wierd tangy taste and the red was watery and very little meat from the can in there and the beans sub par by far flavorless. The enchiladas was a miss my wife didn't even eat them and she loves enchiladas her fav these didn't even temp her to finish her plate at all. Then the tacos where put together weird lettuce on bottom and skim of meat on top don't need to change what is already done but you can try to make it better. this definitely didn't do that..  I have to say my son said the breakfast burrito he had was good and enjoyed it. maybe we ordered the wrong things but hell green chile , red chile , tacos and enchiladas sounds pretty basic Mexican food to me and should be good at any Mexican food place express or sit down..
