Mediocre food, but lightning fast...and considering the other options in the stratosphere tower...probably the place to go.

They have a fairly simple menu, enchiladas, burritos, tacos and salad.  You can see the grill where they sizzle up your meat o' choice, shredded chicken or beef, ground beef, etc... Everything has standard rice and beans on the side.  The purist in me feels they should at least have nopales (ummm it is your restaurant name) but no luck.   This is Ã¼ber basic tex-mex.  

Anytime I'm there, it's usually pretty empty. Maybe one group eating...but never a line.  

It'll do.
