Vegan option when stuck in the airport

Since I was given a bonus 8 hours in the airport I ran out of food I had packed and saw that this place had several items that could be made vegan. I agree with the other posters, kind of bland, even with the fresh cilantro and medium salsa and jalapenos. They kind of skimped on the veggies which was annoying since I ordered a veggie burrito. But the staff was friendly and pretty fast. If abandoned by my airline again here I would probably eat here again since for airport food it was not as outrageous in price as one usually experienced, but will not seek them out when I have actual options. Frankly, I really only ate here because they had something vegan and was annoyed at being at the airport for so long.
