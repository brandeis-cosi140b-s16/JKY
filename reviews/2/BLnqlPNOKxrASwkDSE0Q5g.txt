This review is based on several visits here in the last couple months and in particular yesterday. The counter girl was just plain rude and bitchy. Her coworker even noticed and tried to lighten the mood with no luck. A word of advice, if you don't like people, go find a job where you're not customer facing.  The food was good, once they got our order right. This was the 3rd time in 4 trips here our order was wrong. All I asked for was no cilantro, not too complicated.  Also, the men's restroom was overflowing all the way past the salsa bar. This place needs help.
