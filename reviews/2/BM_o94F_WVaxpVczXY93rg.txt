Let me preface this by saying that I LOVE Mexican food......and its really hard (in my opinion) to f*$k it up!

My girlfriend and I decided to try this local establishment this past weekend....couldn't have been much more disappointed!

It was busy....some local convention going down in the area...anyhow, we were sat quickly....

Our drink order was taken...had to custom order our Margs....I mean who still drinks them with sweet and sour??  So we got them (after what seemed like an eternity!)

OK.....this was the one good thing about the experience.....the margs were top notch!  (but you have to remember....tequila, cointreau and lime juice...that's it NOTHING more....)

Now...on to the food....if I had to choose one word to sum it up.....wait for it....wait for it....ATROCIOUS!!

The chips were good but the salsa sucked....tasted like pizza sauce, I mean really how hard is good salsa...

I ordered.....carne asada....
....a staple in the catalog of good Mexican fair....but  NO...it was horrible (believe it or not, I'm being kind here!)  It was a cut of meat that I'd never seen served in this capacity.......not sure what the h&ll it was...only thing I know for sure, it was bad....over cooked, and chewy...how does that happen?

Luckily, my patient and lovely girlfriend decided on the Chicken fajitas......thank god!
they were at least a 7 on the scale....so we filled up on those...every once and a while taking a bite of my less than stellar second place dish!

The beans were 'ok'...the rice...well lets just say that the "San Fransisco
treat' could have been a better showing!

Side note.....some one should let these people in on something...the "leather' aprons that the bussers wear.....yeah, you guessed it...they look straight out of Hostel....you know, the ones that the killers wore.....not really "setting the atmosphere" if you ask me!

All in all....the only reason I can give them two stars instead of one....the Margs.....great drinks can do a LOT to improve a bad experience!

Do yourself a favor.....skip this one all together.....

Second side note....all the 'best of Phoenix' awards don't mean squat.....if they are from the early 80's....
