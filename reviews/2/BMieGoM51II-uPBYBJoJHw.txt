Ok, tonight was our last trip to Los Sombreros.  We have gotten take out a few times since my last review and the order has been wrong each time but this is the last straw.  

We ordered a bunch of items and when my husband went to pick it up he asked if the order was checked..."yup, everything is in there" he was told.  When he got home it was missing almost $20 worth of food.  He called quickly and we were informed that there is no manager there tonight - a Saturday night with no manager?  The guy was short with him on the call and offered to credit us for the missing items, how generous!  When my husband asked him to make sure the manager hears about this the guy hung up on him. 

They had to credit us back in January but needed two calls to get that done and they kept the tax, a small but annoying detail.  Let's see if they actually even credit us for tonight's mistake.

The food is pretty good which is why I still give two stars but it doesn't make up for the experience.  They just can't seem to get it together with their staff.
