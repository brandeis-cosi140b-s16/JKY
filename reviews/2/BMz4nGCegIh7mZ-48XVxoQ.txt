Not very organized or very English speaking, but the last point is expected. So, this place basically only serves tamales and at $18 per dozen it was the cheapest in the valley. I called in an order and three days later when I arrive, my order, my name and anything else got lost in translation and there was no order. What a waste, but luckily since all they make is tamales, you can just pick them up off the steam table and head off. 
   CORN - Very Yellow with real corn inside, but bland
GREEN CHILE - this a hot version, so beware with a carrot and onion inside also. Too spicy.
PORK - I don't like, so did not try
BEEF/Chicken - they were out
The point of calling ahead is get what I wanted, so they failed miserably in that respect and they also could use some better English speaking skills. This place will close if Trump gets elected. Sometimes the cheapest stuff is the place to avoid.
