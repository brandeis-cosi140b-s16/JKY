Great salsa. So so chips. From concentrate Jose Cuervo Margarita mix which they forgot to make even though I am the only one at the bar and the restaurant is 2/3 empty at 8pm.

Average thrown together, "who cares" style Mexican decor. Haphazard black and white tile dropped ceiling. Random stupid Mexicanish decorations on the wall. Cheap bar counter. Old cheap flat screen tvs. Numerous chunks out of the wall paint. Cheap tables strewn about.

Had the steak and pastor sopes and the chicken gordita. Gordita chicken was dry but the sopes pretty good.

There are 4-5 Mexican places downtown in Madison that I read about on Yelp. I will try another next time I am here, but based on the reviews expect more of the same.

Madison appears desperately in need of a Modern Mexican restaurant like Milagro in St. Louis.
