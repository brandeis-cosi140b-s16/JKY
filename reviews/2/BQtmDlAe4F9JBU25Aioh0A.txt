Another trip that didn't go right at the drive-thru. Between bad audio adjustment on the speaker and the fact that the person operating the drive-thru obviously didn't speak English as a first language led to a wrong order. They were also out of Jalapeno Rings - how does that happen? Management might want to step up there game at this location.
