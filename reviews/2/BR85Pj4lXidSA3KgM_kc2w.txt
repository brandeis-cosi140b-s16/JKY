When you walk in it is very confusing.The cashier tells you to go to each sign to order.You must wait in line for pork taco.Very small open faced $2.50 per each.the go to next line for beef taco,than another line for corn on cob,vegs ect.....By the time you have gotten your last item your 1st items are cold....Than you have to go to salsa bar....They need a different plan.....We had 6 SMALL tacos 2 sodas $20.00....Also salsa bar not marked,mild?hot,ect.I guess you have to figure it out on your own.These are small street like tacos....Not worth $2.25 a piece....Taco El Gordo on the Strip charges $2.00 per taco......We won't be back......Not a fan of cafeteria style....
