I should know better by now to expect authentic mexican in North Carolina, but I love it so I gotta keep trying. I tried the tacos ( 1 carne asada, 1 pastor and one something else) and then asked for the albondigas on the side. Having lived with a Mexican family during high school I know Mexican food, so when they plopped a big plate of meatballs in front of me without the broth I of course wondered "what the heck is this?" Albondigas is soup, not a plate of meatballs. Long story short I ended up with 2 meals and now my stomach hurts and it wasn't that good.

Its probably not that bad for the area, but I have high expectations of Mexican food.  

On a positive note, the restaraunt is in a nice area and is very clean and the staff is extremely nice.
