this was my third time eating food from Macayo's. Two in the restaurant and one to go.  I have enjoyed the food and service my previous visits. This time was a disaster. My food was not prepared as ordered,my husbands carnitas was so dry he couldn't eat it and we were the ones that had to refill our water and ice tea 4 times to the servers 1 time. She acted bored and even asked if the food was pretty good. Pretty good? No, it wasn't. I was there as a guest for my birthday. It was a bummer- if it wasn't for the wonderful company it would have been a horrible evening. Macayo's step up your servers training and back of the house training. The front staff were great.
