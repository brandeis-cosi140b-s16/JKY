I'm in Phoenix for a training course for work and I'm at the State Health Lab.  We were told that this place was very close.  It is very close.  Just turn the corner, and there we are.

A few of us went here for lunch on our first day in the course. 

Everyone seemed to be in love with the place, but I thought it was ok.  

I had the beef enchiladas.  Maybe I've been spoiled by some of the California "hole-in-the-wall" Mexican places.. but I was really expecting shredded beef.  It was ground beef.  I don't remember there being much cheese in it.. and the sauce it was smothered in was way too salty for my taste.

It came with rice and beans and some salsa and salad.. I got the lunch special so it came in small portions.  It was a good thing because with the saltyness of the food, I don't think I could have handled anymore.

They have a chips bar where it's self-serve chips and salsa, but some of the chips looked a little too over-fried.. and then the ones that weren't were on the stale side.

Some other people had the chilli and it looked really good that I may get that tomorrow since that's the plan for tomorrow's lunch.  

The "local expert"  told us to kinda be careful when eating here, especially if you were trying to lose weight because they do cook with lard.. yikes!

And if you look on one of the walls.. they show some products they sell per pound and lard is one of them..

So.. eat.. at your own risk..
