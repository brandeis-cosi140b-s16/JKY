Some of the worst customer service I've experienced.  No one manning the front counter when we walk in. (Busy Saturday night).  However, because their backroom door was open I was able to see the staff just hanging out in the back.

When the staff finally get around to taking my order, the associate gets easily distracted and ignores me halfway through me relaying the order to her.  2 stars because at least the food was decent.
