I really don't know how to review Habanero's.  In my opinion, it was just kinda blah and stale. I guess I thought my burrito was ok. They slapped my burrito together from ingredients that were being kept lukewarm on a buffet table. No salsa and chips, or condiments at the table. I was also disappointed that they did not offer half orders. I also thought that Habanero's was kind of pricey for what you received. For the same cost, you could eat at a nicer Mexican restaurant with complimentary chips and salsa, fresh food, and a much more inviting atmosphere.
