Went in for a late night dinner. The bartender sat us and another couple at the same time. We were sat at tables next to eachother . We got waters and chips from the busser right away. The bartender Justin came to tell us about happy hour but decided to save time and tell both tables at the same time ..I felt that was a little tacky. Then he got the other tables drink order. When he took our drink order I ordered the Horchotini. The other table recived their soups and drinks before he asked for our order..by that time we had filled up on chips . My drink was great but by the time we got the food we were not very hungry anymore. We had it boxed up to go..they should promote the busser to a server he took more time at our table..
