Staying in Charlotte for a week, asked the Hotel desk person where was a good Mexican restaurant. She raved about Azteca so thought I should give it a try. I walked in and was immediately  greeted and asked where I wanted to sit. They brought over chips and salsa [?] to be honest it really wasn't salsa it was very very watery with some raw onions.. almost no spice at all. I had to add salt to get any flavor at all.

 I ordered the Pork Carnitas Plate. The plate its self was HUGE, however the pork carnitas took up only 1/8 or less of the plate. There were two sides of what i'm guessing was like a "fresh" vegetable salsa maybe. I tasted it but it was really odd/dry/no taste. Then the rice & refried beans. The person who made the beans must have made the salsa for the chips as well. They were very very thin...to the point they would fall though the tines in my fork. No cheese on them and again no seasoning/spice. 

Now i'm honestly not trying to be negative towards the restaurant everyone else seemed to really enjoy them... so i'm guessing it has to be that with living in California we have real Mexican food practically on every corner especially with the taco trucks and they are not afraid of spice at all. It was just very different and didn't appeal to me at all...if i came back I would not give them another try...Sorry.
