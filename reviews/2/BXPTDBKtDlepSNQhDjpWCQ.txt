I see a lot of really great reviews here for this place. I think it boils down to the type of place you are looking for. My thing is finding little family run ethnic places where the food is good and the prices low. Service is important, but decor and ambiance are non-factors to me. On the other hand, if you like average food served up with old, piped in mariachi music and fake, yet expensive, Mexican decor, this would be your place. 

My family, when they visit from Indiana, like it just fine. They enjoy it. But to me the food was bland to average. We had a good variety of stuff on our first visit--I had a build it yourself combo plate and Carol had a shrimp dish, can't recall now which one. Average, as I said. The salsa was awesome though. Second visit, salsa still good, other stuff, still average. 

Considering how slow they were when we visited, the service was not great--slow and only marginally friendly. This was on both trips--the first time when it was just Carol and I, and a second time when I went with my family. That second trip it seemed like maybe the owner or a manager was waiting tables and building up a pretty bad attitude about. 

Bottom line...if you  like the real deal take a pass. If you don't mind this style, give it a try. It looks good and is not terrible.
