"Oh, look," I say, "They have a 'to-go' counter."

But not an expedient one.  You order off of the menu and then they make your food, and if you're me, then they make the wrong thing and have to make it again.  So twenty minutes later, you can go catch up with your friends and actually board your plane.  They did give me the botch, though, which was a nice bonus.  Food was a little bland and not quite as delicious as I'd been hoping for.  I also found the breakfast sandwich a little difficult to eat while I was sitting on the plane, worrying that I wouldn't be able to bite into the giant bread without squirting over-easy egg onto everything surrounding me.  

Sadly, it's about the only restaurant in this terminal, though it looks as though they might be building another one.
