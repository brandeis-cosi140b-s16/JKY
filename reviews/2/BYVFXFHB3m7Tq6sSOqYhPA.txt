Look, I don't like leaving 2 stars based on one visit but I'm not going back. I was so unhappy with the amount of food I got for the price. I ordered two tacos and a small drink. It came out to 7.49. The tacos were soo freaking small I felt like they were little appetizer tacos. Most of the time I pay over 7 bucks I usually get a meal out of it. I was done in like 1 minute. A fair price for those "street tacos" would be a 1 to 1.50. I will never go back. I'm not on a diet and I like to eat. It would take 6 of those tacos to equal a value meal at taco bell. That would come out to 22 bucks. I'm not joking! try it, order three of those stupid street tacos and a drink. You'll pay around 10 bucks and leave hungry.
