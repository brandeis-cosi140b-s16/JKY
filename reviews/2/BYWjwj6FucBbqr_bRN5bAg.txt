Although service was good, my drink was seriously watered down. To the point of me almost saying, can I just get a rum on the rocks? Seriously. Basically I paid $12 total for two cokes with a splash of rum. It reminded me of hearing Kat Williams say, if your drink is really, really dark like blood, that is because you didn't order vodka buddy so sit your broke A$$ down. I actually paid for some alcohol and got none.. I am not asking you to pour like I am fish, but man, can you add a little bit of spirits to my coke? That would be lovely, thanks!  I wasn't the only one with this issue as another member of our party complained about the exact same thing.
