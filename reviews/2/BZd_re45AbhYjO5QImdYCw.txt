Went to lunch with 4 other co-workers around 11:40AM on a Wednesday. 
Walked in and the hostess just stared at us. She was a young girl so maybe she doesn't understand what a greeting is. We said we had 5 people and she walked us over to a table. 

Our server Jorge came by and we received water and were reviewing our menu's. I will say that the service was quick to get the food out. 

We ordered the guacamole that they make tableside. It was ok but I've had much better at Gallo Blanco in Phoenix. They have amazing guac!! I don't think the guac here is worth the price they charge. 

I ordered the Enchilada Veracruz and can say that it read better than it tasted. 
It was dry on the top when it was supposed to have the sauce and cojita cheese. I was expecting a stuffed enchilada and it was OK but I have had better. Definately could pass that one up even though the server said it was highly recommended. 

The table didn't have any complaints as far as anything else...except that our server disappeared after clearing our plates. We probably waited a good 15 minutes as we were expecting to get our check and he kept serving other tables. Good for them and bad for us when we had to get back for business calls. 

The atmosphere was "Trendy Scottsdale" and it was a nice place overall but I don't think I will be visiting again. One bonus though, if you sign up with them online, they will send you a coupon for a free appetizer. So my guac was free.
