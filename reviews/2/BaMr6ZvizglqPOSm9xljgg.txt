(Filberto's + Baja Fresh) - (Cheap + Healthy) = El Gran Taquito

Yea, wasn't really impressed.  They have about 9 combos that range from $7 - $11 and they come w/ Rice & Beans but no drink.  Small drinks are $1.35.  Not expensive, but this isn't expensive food.  It's kinda cheap food.  And certainly cheap feeling atmosphere.  Now during M-F lunch they do have like 6 combos for $5.95 - but again w/ no drink.  

Now to give you a picture, this place is right between the Chinese food place and, a few stores down, a pizza place, and right across the parking lot from a McDonald's. You have to REALLY be craving a taco to come here.  

I won't be coming here again, but it's not like it made me sick or anything.  And the service wasn't good, but they weren't directly rude.  So, it's getting 2 stars. But just barely.
