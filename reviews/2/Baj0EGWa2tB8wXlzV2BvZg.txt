Atmosphere was great, our waiter Mike, was great as well. The problem.... Everything was too oily. There is great potential for there food as a few bites, the ones that did not squirt oil into my mouth, were actually pretty good. See pics for the amount of oil in my pink tacos. We also had the queso which again was good but not great. I don't think it was worth $51 with tip for 2 soda drinks, 1 queso app and 2 plates of pink tacos (each plate had only 3 - 4" small street tacos no rice or beans or anything else). I know we are in Vegas but come on. Even if I was drunk I still would have known it's a rip off!!
