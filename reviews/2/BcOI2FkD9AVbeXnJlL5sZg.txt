Wow, what happened? We were SO looking forward to great tex-mex and we left vowing never to return again.

There was one girl waiting the entire restaurant when we got there (4pm on Sun) and she was trying her best to get to everyone. When we finally recieved our order - chx fajitas and the chx salad, 10 mins later my husband had to ask somone for the tortillas and by then, his stuff was cold...all 5 peices of meat and a couple of peppers. My salad resembled a kid's meal - could it get any smaller? Yes, it tasted ok, but between the service and small portions, will definitely not be going back.

Too bad, we really liked Chevy's in CA. Will do Chipotle instead out here.
