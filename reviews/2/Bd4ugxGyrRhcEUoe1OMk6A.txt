I use to come here once a month with my wife for lunch and or dinner. I remember the service was pretty awesome, but the poorest most profound thing I found wrong with this company was that the day we ordered our food, it was on discounted day and I didn't even know about it. We received our food and as I took the first bite, I had something in my teeth that felt odd or weird, as my wife looked at me and said maybe it's cheese, I then began pulling it out of my mouth and it was a long black hair which did not belong to me, because I shave my head and my wife's hair is brown and it was physically impossible to have her hair fall into my food cause she was sitting across from me when the waiter placed our food down. 

Once I noticed this, I immediately asked for the manager and both the waiter and manager were shocked and the manager actually had the nerve to ask me if the hair possibly belonged to me and or my wife, I laughed and had to ask are you kidding me my head is shaved and my wife's hair is brown not black, he then said we can remake your food and comp this meal. 

I said no to the manager and appreciated his comp, but I had lost my hunger after having that in my meal. I took one bite and had a long black hair in my food. Now other than this it was an alright place, but since then I won't and refuse to return, because not only did I walk out without a comp which I honestly didn't have to have, but the respect of the manager should have been there and he should of said your next meal for myself and my wife should of been comped. 

Normally in a situation like this I never complain I don't care about spending the money it was the fact I was asked is the hair mine lol or my wife's when food was just brought out.
