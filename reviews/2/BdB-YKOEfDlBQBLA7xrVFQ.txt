I've eaten here at least 4 times in the past 15 years.  The best it's ever been was average.  The most recent time, about a month ago, I ordered a green burro.  It was very close to the worst green burro I've ever had at a restaurant.  Mostly soupy tasteless gravy, a few scattered bits of meat, and some slivers of something that might have been green chile many days earlier before the taste and texture had been completely cooked out of it.  The complimentary chips and dips are decent but the hot sauce is barely on the hot side. Garcia's is much better.
