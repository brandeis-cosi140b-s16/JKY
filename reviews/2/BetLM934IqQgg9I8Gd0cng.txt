Meh. Friday night at 7:00. They were busy. That makes sense. Would've made more sense to have more experienced staff working they night. 

I was brought the wrong drink, my Del Rio combo was over salted to a near inedible degree. 

I'll give two stars because my girl liked her tacos and my server tried hard, and what could I possibly expect from a giant chain restaurant.
