I really wanted to like this restaurant.  I had heard great reviews and there seems to be such a lack of good Mexican food in Pittsburgh.

We arrived on a Sunday evening around 7:30; the Pens game was playing at the bar. All was good. Noticing that the restaurant closes at 9, we quickly ordered and out came the salsa, chips and a few beers. The salsa tasted as if they added plain tomato sauce and the chips were cold and had a stale texture.  We decided to give the guacamole a try (with a fresh, warm basket of chips). It was delicious and the highlight of our meal!

Our Chili Rellenos meals soon arrived and were so disappointing.  Too much breading on the CR and hardly any fillings in the enchilada/taco that accompanied.  The beans and rice were tasty, but dry.  Our waitress was apathetic . We still chalked this up to "well... it IS a Sunday evening" 

This may sound like an oxymoron, but what really disgusted us was the cleaning. While I am finishing up a meal in a restaurant, the last thing I want to see is a wet, soggy mop (gag) or a staff member standing nearby waiting for me to finish my meal so that she/he can sweep under my table. We saw both right under our noses. At this point it was maybe 8:15. The Pens were still playing, but they shut off the game and started turning chairs upside down (on the tables)  As I stated before, the restaurant was open till 9 o'clock. 

We had leftovers. On our way to the car we tossed them in the garbage can. I'm only giving this place 2 stars because of the guacamole.
