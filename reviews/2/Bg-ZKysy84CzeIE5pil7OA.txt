Gimme a break, this is an imitation Mexican restaurant run by McDonalds.  I'm from Urbana and I live in a very competitive place for mexican food, San Diego, CA.  The best thing that can be said about the food is, (a) Its not expensive for the amount you get, (b) It's unlikely to cause indigestion, and (c) If you've never tried mexican before, this won't turn you away forever.

Otherwise, compared to many other mexican fast-food restaurants, this one is highly forgettable.  

Example : L.S. (CA West Coast), much better, a 5-star fast-food mexican restaurant.  

Example : R. (National), much better, a little pricier than the one above and salsas not as good, a 4-star fast-food mexican restaurant, and a publically traded company.  

Example : T.B. (National).  Ok, it's not really mexican, but I enjoy their "imaginary" mexican creations, such as the 7-layer burrito and their chalupas, 3 stars.
