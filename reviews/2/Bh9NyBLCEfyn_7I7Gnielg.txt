This restaurant use to be a 4.5 star but now I rate it a 2 star because of the diminishing quality of the food.  We are regulars sometimes even going twice a week and the food the last 3-4 times was just ok.  We wonder if they are having problems with keeping a kitchen staff??
Seating, I have read earlier reviews that you have to wait along time for a seat only to find out seats are open.  
I am commenting because we love this restaurant and we want them to get their act together.  Just a note, this is my VERY FIRST YELP REVIEW.  I just signed up to write a review for this restaurant.
