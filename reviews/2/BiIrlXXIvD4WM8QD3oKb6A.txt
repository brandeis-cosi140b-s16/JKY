The Charlotte airport is awesome so I definitely didn't want to just grab Burger King or Sbarros during my layover but I didn't have enough time to try a restaurant.  I quickly whipped out my yelp app and found Salsitas.  

The line was excruciatingly slow because the woman making the burritos had no idea what she was doing.  While on line, I had to painstakingly watch her make burrito after burrito because she kept overstuffing them until the tortilla broke & she had to start over again.  OMG was that frustrating.  Being optimistic, I thought she would get the hang of it for my burrito but NOPE.  I sadly watched my giant burrito break but luckily she got it the second time.

Having wasted 40 minutes watching her break burritos, I raced over to my terminal & my hangry self attacked the burrito.  Super disappointing!  It was not good and for the reviewers who said it was similar to Chipotle -- you are dead wrong.  In fact, you need to check your tastebuds.   It didn't taste fresh, chicken wasn't flavorful, wasn't warm, and was pretty much a huge faux-Mexican mess in a fragile tortilla.  

Honestly, I wish I just went to Burger King.  Also if you're looking for seating just walk down to the next section of fast food stalls.  They're the less popular options & the seating areas aren't as crowded.
