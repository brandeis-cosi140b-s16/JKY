So I have been lured back several times......

It's such a scam they suck you in with the fancy menu and these Fab chips and salsa, trust me after eating those you'd expect to the food to be pretty damn good, but NO ,to Quote Jenn H.  it is  "Blech. Die."

If and when I come back I'll stick to the chips and salsa, I also would usually order the table side gauc , but have found that they put such large chunks of onion and jalapeno it really takes away from it.......take your time chef and finely chop that shit!!

I'll give 5 stars for the chips and salsa
and 1.5 for the food, but you can't have both!
