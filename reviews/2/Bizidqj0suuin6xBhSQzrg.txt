And to think I loved this place as a tourist. Whenever I'd visit Phoenix I'd eat at Encanto. Now that I live here, you can't pay me to go. The food is average at best -- especially considering the prices -- and the duck pond is nothing short of disgusting. 

Besides, if you have kids (like I do) you're almost required to take them to feed the ducks which means you're walking through what the ducks (ahem) leave behind. Multiply that times 100 and imagine what the restaurant's floor is covered in. I'm just saying.
