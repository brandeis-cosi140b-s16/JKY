The location at Downtown Summerlin could use assistance in training employees. There were three employees present at lunchtime and neither of the employees could complete the task without seeking the help of another person. The staff person that assisted me could not speak up and was hard to hear. She was very tentative and lacked the confidence to take care of customers as she was new to her job and needed more training before she waited in customers.
Food prepared was not hot and mediocre presentation and quality.
This location needs more training of entire staff.
