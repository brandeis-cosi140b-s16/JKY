If you like super poor quality food but cheap and cheap drinks this is your place.  I don't hate on the cheap drinks but the food is terrible.  Id rather have Taco Bell (and I dont even like Taco Bell).  Definetly my least favorite place for happy hour- the place is small and crowded.  I dread when my friends want to meet here.  Much better places out there.
