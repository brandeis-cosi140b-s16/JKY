11 dollars for nachos is high so I figured they would be huge. Well I was wrong. A good size but very cheap on the meat. The bar was dirty and when I came in I was the only person at the bar. Sat 4 min with an empty drink. Over all average. There are other places to try. That's where u will find me.
