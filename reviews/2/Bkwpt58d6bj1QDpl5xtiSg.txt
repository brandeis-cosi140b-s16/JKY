5 dollar bowl. But holly smokes $1.69 extra for guacamole that is bland. Dame I ended up paying the original price for it. I will say no next time when ask "guacamole." Not only that count your change the cashier don't pay much attention on giving you the correct change. I gave her two 5 dollar bills for a total of $7.49 she gave me .51 cent of change. I was so caught off guard with how expensive the guacamole was I didn't recognize that she shorted me change until I left the building I guess they can consider it as a tip this time
