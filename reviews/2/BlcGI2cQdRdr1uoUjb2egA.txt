The food is mediocre but what really turned me off was the behavior of the employees. We ordered udon from the other counter and were told there would be a 3 minute wait.  Mind you we had gotten there roughly 15 minutes before 11pm.  When we looked to find a seat we were greeted with empty tables with no seats. There were 2 male employees that as guests stood up they would collect their seats leaving patrons like us that had just ordered food to stand around. No cares about the people that just ordered, only caring about getting things cleaned up and going home. This continued all the way till they locked the doors. We were lucky enough to grab a seat when a couple stood up to leave but there was a family standing around a table attempting to eat their meal. What ever happened to customer service?  Guess seeing be going back.
