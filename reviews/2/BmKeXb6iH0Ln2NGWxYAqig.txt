What a disappointment lunch was here today.  The menu was scaled way down from what appears on the internet.  They have added "sandwiches" that don't have any kind of relationship to Mexico.  We had hoped to have jicama and grapefruit salad or cochinita pibil but had to settle for a cochinta pibil "sandwich" (torta).  It was good, but not taking us back to any Mexican roots.  When we eat at Poca Cosa in Tucscon, the same modern South American food prevails, but for example, it is sauced with moles that remind one of where it came from.  Taberna fell short of the mark.  Our server was a vegetarian who could not impart any information about the dishes.  Why would a restaurant that serves meat entrees employ vegetarians?  This restaurant got a mild review in the Phoenix magazine and 5 stars from the blogger for LocalDines which was not deserved at lunch anyway.  The house margaritas at Canteen Modern Tequila Bar in Tempe which are $3.25 during Happy Hour are way better than the $9 margaritas we had at Taberna.
