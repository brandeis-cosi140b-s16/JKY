We were very excited to try Cafe Rio... Until we got there and the service was horrible. The first words they said to us was, "We're out of rice, is that ok?" No hello, nothing else. We say uhhhh sure, not knowing what else to expect. The people behind us asked how long we needed to wait for the rice since no time was provided and the girl goes back, meanwhile conversing with another employee about something that had nothing to do with the rice, then came back and say "maybe 5-10 minutes". When we said we would like to wait for the rice as well, the girl told us to calm down, we would get our rice, verbatim. 
I'm not a complainer by any means. I let a lot of things slide. But there was absolutely no customer service. Not to mention, they ended up mixing up our order with the people behind us... The food itself was subpar. 

I was generous to give 2 stars. Try at your own risk.
