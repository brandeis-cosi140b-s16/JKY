Don't get me wrong about this... The food is decent. I've had better from places like El Patio Mexico etc. My boyfriend and I also made a comment that we feel the need to get a Hepatitis test after eating here.

My main issues with this place are:
A) Dirty dirty dirty. I should have checked around inside before I ordered.
B) Soda machine only worked half the time we were there
C) You do not need to drown everything in guacamole. Guac should ALWAYS be on the side... not the main ingredient in a torta or yucking up half the nachos. 
D) Please get some staff that understand English. Blahblah, I understand this place is a Mexican fast food joint, but when I have to repeat myself a half dozen times to get the order right, only to find guac on everything despite me saying NO to it, I do get rather annoyed. 

If they fixed these few things up, they'd be a really great place. Until then, there are much better Mexican joints around.
