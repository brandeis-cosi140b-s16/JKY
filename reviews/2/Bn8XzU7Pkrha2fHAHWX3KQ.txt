Just ordered a quesadilla with grilled chicken and cheese. Went I got home and opened it up, it was nothing but cheese. I went back with my quesadilla but the guy was completely rude! He was completely defensive saying that we didn't order the quesadilla with chicken, and that we'd be charged extra. At first it was assumed charged just to add the chicken to the original quesadilla, but when rang up, it's was another $7. He wouldn't accept his mistake and make us another one free of charge. We've been customer for years and never have received such service as this. We did end up paying for it because what's a meal without meat, just wish I could take the tip I gave them after the first order! NEVER AGAIN WILL WE BE BACK!!!
