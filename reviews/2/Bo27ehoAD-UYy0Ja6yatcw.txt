Walked in, and the cashier was pretty friendly. I gave her the order, saw her input the special items correctly, paid and waited.

They were pretty quick at getting all of the food out, as my order was to go, and I was running late (Roberto's closest to work closed and we didn't know), I had to get back before I could open the container.

Now, the person who took my order, is also the person who packaged the food. She did not bother to remember or read the special instructions, thus getting my order wrong.

No big deal, I didn't want the other items anyway, apparently. The taste was almost absent on my enchilada. The chicken taco was good, the beef taco tasted a bit over-fried/crunchy.

The prices are a bit high for such mediocre/poor quality/taste. I think I will give other taco shops a try next time I am craving tacos.
