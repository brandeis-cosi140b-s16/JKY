I had lunch there today with a co-worker. I was buying so I told him to get what ever he wanted.

Free chips and salsa - not bad, chips are large and best of all - free, get all you want
Salsa - good mix of chili's with typical salsa ingredients
Two taco plate lunch special - ground beef was boring and bland, taco shells not so good
Rice - Did not eat - not appetizing to me
Beans - Not bad, had yellow cheese on them, edible 

Service was first rate - Amy is a rock star.

So So lunch. I would not order the two taco lunch again.
I do like their Albondigas soup and ordered a side of soup to go. Thanks
