I love going to the Taco Bell but tonight was different I went through the drive through ordered my food and the guy never gave me the total amount so I drove up to the window then he asked for my money before I even knew how much to pay. Then when I got my 3 crunchy taco Supremes and paid for my food I never got my change I had to ask for it. I don't know who the guy was but he wasn't very focused on his work I never got a receipt with my food. And then when I opened  my 3 taco Supremes all they had was meat sour cream and cheese no lettuce or tomatoes pretty dissatisfying when you get less than you expected.
