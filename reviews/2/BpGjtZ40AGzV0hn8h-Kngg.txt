This place is mediocre at best.  I've been to both locations (Monroe and Hilldale) a combined 3 times and everything I've tried is just.... blahh.

To be fair, I only order burritos.  I've tried a few now and they are just so dang bland.  Tonight's order, a chicken burrito, came with meat, a little quacamole, and some onions.  WTF?

For $7.50 or more, you should be able to get a tasty, properly seasoned burrito.  The best burritos in the world cost about $6-7 at taquerias in the mission district of SF.  I'd rather pay less for a far superior burrito from Chipotle, Qdoba, or even Taco Bell (at least save money).
