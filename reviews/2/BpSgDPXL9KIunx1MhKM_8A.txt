This place is super popular. They are of the "extremely generous portions" school of Mexican food.

Now, I'm a vegetarian, so I have to rely on what my dining partners say about their food, but I LOVE mexican food, so my friend has dragged me here twice.

My friend cannot handle spice. Seriously, once I put pepper jack in a sandwich and she almost died from heartburn or something. But she LOVES Macayos, probably for the same reason I don't like it too much - I find it bland. Enormous, and cheap ($10 gets you food to last for three meals), but bland. Although I like the salsa and free chips. My other friend liked her taco salad, because she was in a mood for crispy shells. I've had the veggie burrito with sauce (Oh, they don't tell you, but the sauce is $1 extra), the cheese enchiladas (the sides are refried beans, which aren't my fave, but the sauce wasn't very spicy or onion-y), and the veggie fajitas (not bad).

I'd come here again, but only because my best friend loves the place.
