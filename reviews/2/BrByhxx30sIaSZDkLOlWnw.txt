First things first....I'm a taco snob.  I've traveled all of the border towns from Tijuana to Juarez and have eaten a ton of legit tacos in each town.

I bought the 6 taco Groupon and gave this one a go.

The Good:  Lots of food for the money.  I had 6 tacos of varying types of meat and ended the afternoon legally stuffed.  Definitely a bit bigger than the standard street taco and the tortillas were double-wrapped.

The Bad:  My meal consisted of carne asada, chicken, regular carnitas, and Green Chile (pork).  Corn tortillas with pico, onion, cilantro, and mild green/red salsas.  All but the last one were flavorless.  Like boiled meats.  Like crockpot meat with no seasoning and too much water.  In fact, if you blindfolded me and told me to take a bite of each, it would have been difficult to discern which was which.  I was sorely disappointed.  The only half-decent savior was the Green Chile (pork) which was more spicy than flavorful.  Still, it was something after the five strikes before.

I'd love to recommend some EXCELLENT spots in Phoenix to the people who rate this 4-5 stars, but I realize that's not the point of this post. (You folks have no idea what you're missing, though!)

My recommendation to this restaurant:  Fix your meats.
