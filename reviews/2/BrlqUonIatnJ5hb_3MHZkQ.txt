Stopped in El Burrito Loco before my Doctor's Appt at the Clinic across the way.

I ordered a standard Steak Burrito, and it was sub-par. The steak wasn't seasoned very well, the rice was watery, and all-in-all there wasn't much flavor. The hot sauce had a very nice kick to it, but again it lacked any flavor (all they need to do is add some garlic, or maybe a little more vinegar). The one plus was that the burrito itself was huge. 

Chips & Salsa were extra ($1.99?), which turns me off. The burrito, I believe, was $8.99 which is pretty expensive for a sub-par burrito.

The service was great, and all of the staff were friendly, but I'm not planning on going back. 

If  you are in the area, I highly recommend checking out Swagat, which is an Indian restaurant located in the same strip mall. In my opinion, it is the best Indian food in Madison.
