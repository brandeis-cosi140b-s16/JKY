My wife ordered no lettuce,  I ordered no tomatoes and told the waiter I am allergic to fresh tomatoes.  The runner brought our food my wifes had lettuce on it, mine had tomatoes,  I told the runner about the allrgy, my plate came back they had scraped the tomatoes off so the juice was soaked in. I  had to wait another 20 minutes for my food. The Manager did comp mine but my wife was almost done eating by the time I got my food. The server was great,  I will not go back.
