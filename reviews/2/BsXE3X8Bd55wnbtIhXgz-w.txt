Only giving 2 stars because our waiter was a nice guy. Other than that, disgusting. We decided to go here because of the reviews.  A bunch of liars!  The menu was a sticky, confusing mess. I didn't think tea was an odd beverage. Nope, no tea. Hard taco? Nope, out of hard taco shells. Really?
My steak burrito seemed to be mixed with chicken. Only had to spit out one piece a rock hard substance. My husband had to quit eating because it was disgusting. You could not pay me to eat here.
