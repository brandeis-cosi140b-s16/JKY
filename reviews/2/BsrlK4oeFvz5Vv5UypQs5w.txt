Based on previous yelp reviews, I was hoping to find another phoenix gem but alas I was dissapointed.

The one thing about the reviews that was correct: service is not great.

Here's the simple lowdown:

Food is a solid 3

Chips and Salsa were decent - chips were nice a warm

Guac sucks - its the kind that they make every so often and put in refrigerator (try los somberros or bario cafe for real gauc)

Taco - good flavor on the ground beef - but taco was luke warm, like it had been sitting 10-15 minutes

Food Smell - I'm not sure if this was because I read on previus review...But I did notice a wierd smell to the enchilada.
