A lot of food for a cheap price; that's the only reason this place doesn't get one star. Place is just nasty dirty! Used my debit through the drive through, and the guy hands me the thing to type in my pin and its just covered with crap. By crap I mean it looked like it was dunked in grease, and then splashed with some kind of red sauce. I told him I wasn't about to touch that, you could tell he was mad. Thought he would clean it off, instead ran me as credit...
