My Hubs and I really wanted to try this place out. We LOVE supporting local business and this place is very close to our house. 
We tried it a few months ago and sorry to say it, but it was not memorable at all. The food was pretty mediocre. I'm a blonde hair, blue-eyed Italian and I have made more flavorful Mexican dishes at home. 
I suppose it's not for those who crave deep authentic flavor, but perhaps it's acceptable for those who prefer a far less authentic flavor than you would expect from a privately owned Mexican Restaurant. 
The place has potential if they updated the interior a bit and changed the menu completely, but it doesn't even feel like a Mexican eatery. It was kind of off-putting. The music was odd, as well. 
We won't be back, unfortunately.
