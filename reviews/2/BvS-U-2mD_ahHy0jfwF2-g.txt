If you know the saying, "What goes up must come down," then you might be familiar with the saying, "Mexican food goes in solid and comes out liquid."

I've never been a taco bell fan either, so maybe "quick" Mexican fare just isn't my thing. To each their own, I guess. Perk is that it's 24 hours in a residential area, but it's just not my speed.
