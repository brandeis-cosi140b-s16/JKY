Why did I come here? Oh ya, a 5$ coupon in the mail. This place is not awesome. The food is all flavorless... so bland and so salty. It was nice that they give you bean dip, but the bean dip was also bland and nothing exciting. I just had a cheese crisp...pretty safe... but it had absolutely no flavor. It's like they just open cans and serve. Although this was marginally better than Manuel's, it still isn't a place I will come to again.
