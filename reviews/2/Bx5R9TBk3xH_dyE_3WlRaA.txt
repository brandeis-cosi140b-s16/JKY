Well, they would have received 5 stars, however, the service the 2nd time around was horrible!

Food: Very inexpensive with 2 burritos costing less than 8 dollars. Hot Sauce is amazingly good to the point that we finished the entire bottle they gave us for sit-in. Takeout orders get 2 extremely small containers per burrito which is not nearly enough. Important to note that there is no salsa bar.

Location: Close to the airport (less than 5 miles) and very small. Place your order inside then wait for it outside. A small eating area is available attached to the kitchen. Nothing fancy or special, but heck, its cheap.

Service: The first time around we received our orders as requested. The second time, my GF who is vegetarian received a burrito with meat inside despite clearly indicating 'no meat'. This was during closing time and they were surprised when she came back to demand a new burrito saying 'you didnt eat that outside cause its closed?'. Clearly they were more concerning about closing up than just having given a customer a wrong order. Then on the way to the car rental, the replacement burrito was also discovered to have meat inside. It was immediately thrown into the garbage by my disappointed GF. Completely unacceptable and a 3 star demerit.

While the food was good, we probably would not come here again due to not wanting food to go to waste (when we receive items with meat inside when requested without) and lack of hot sauce / salsa when doing take out.
