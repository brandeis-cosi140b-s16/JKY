Chipotle is one of my favorites but I will be driving to the Goodyear location from now on. We live half way between the Buckeye location and the Goodyear location and normally drive to Buckeye just because the parking is better than at the Goodyear restaurant. Last Saturday, around 11:30am we drove to Buckeye to enjoy a Chicken Burrito.

When we arrived and walked in, the music was so loud I had to squint as it was bothersome. We walked to the counter and attempted to order and we couldn't hear the guy behind the counter because the music was so loud. Luckily we knew what he was asking since we eat Chipotle so often.

We got our food and sat down and my wife said, "this music is way too loud and giving me a headache". We couldn't hear one another talking and had to yell to speak to one another. We cut our lunch short and left because the music was so loud and bothersome. It wasn't pleasing background music but more rock music that was at the volume you would find at a concert.

We looked around and watched the other customers trying to have conversations and they were all leaning across the table and yelling to try and hear one another.

Very unpleasant experience and we'll find another place from now on.
