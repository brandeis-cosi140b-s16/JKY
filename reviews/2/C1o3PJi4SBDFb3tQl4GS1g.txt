It's been a while, but I think I've dined here enough to give a review. Located within the confines of the hideous Rebel Plaza (?), El Patio offers okay food at affordable prices. Complimentary chips and salsa were a nice beginning to my meals. They have lunch specials for us poor college students. I've ordered their tacos, enchiladas, and burritos. My favorite are the tacos, flavorful and hot. They also offer $1.95 margaritas for UNLV students (holla!), but I've never tried to be honest. But $1.95? Possibly a great place to get smashed post-finals. The restaurant is tiny but cozy and quaint. Not sure if I wanna visit soon, though. Probably just to get a el cheapo margarita.
