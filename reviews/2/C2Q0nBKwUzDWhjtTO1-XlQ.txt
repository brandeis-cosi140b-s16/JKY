I love chipotle! But not this location. I get a vegetarian salad every time . Typically when you get no meat they give you extra rice and beans. At this location I got the bottom of the barrel half a scoop of each. Seriously just because I'm a vegetarian doesn't mean I'm not hungry ! Next, I ordered my boyfriend a burrito they were out of brown rice and steak and were going to have me wait? Isn't the point of chipotle getting your food in a timely manner? So annoying. If you know it's dinner time don't you think you would be prepared. But it wasn't even busy. Wonder why?
