I'm sorry but no. Subpar. I just don't get the rave reviews.

After trying to get in on a busy Saturday night, we stopped in a week later midafternoon. It can be easy to miss, but keep a look out for a small menu posted outside by the front door. Inside, you grab whatever seat is available, so you're either at the bar or seated at one of a few different large community tables.

We had the carne adovado sliders as an appetizer. They were OK, nothing outstanding or special. I had the chicken burrito with green chile sauce, and my husband had the taos club.

The chicken in the burrito was very dry. I didn't get a lot of flavor, either, aside from salt and tons of cheese. The rice was dry and tasted a little burnt. I liked the beans, but I wanted more green chile sauce and more flavor out of the entire meal.

The taos club was pretty good. The avocado was a little hard and not distributed evenly in the club, so one bite was full of one ingredient and another bite was full of something else. The accompanying salad and fries were nice, but again, we just didn't see the ooh and ahh that everyone else has seemed to experience.

Portions were large, but prices were high to match. I just was not impressed. Small restaurant with awkward seating, food that is average at best, and expensive prices for what you get. I won't be back.
