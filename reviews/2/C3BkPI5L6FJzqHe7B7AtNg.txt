I feel as though this place deserves maybe two and a half stars... it really wasn't that bad- it just wasn't that good either. 

Came for dinner with my husband. The only reason is we got into a conversation with one of the managers while we were gambleing at a hotel up the strip. He told us to go in and tell them he sent us for a round of drinks on the house. Sounded like a good idea so we went. I had margaritas, which were pretty standard tasting- nothing super exciting.  

We did have a table with a nice veiw of the strip so we were able to people watch (always entertaining in Vegas) 

The food was decent. Again, nothing super exciting. Hubby had wings which were tasty and I had a chicken burrito. I enjoyed the one wing I stole from him and the chicken burrito was actually pretty tasty- though nothing about it was anything out of the ordinary.

The only thing that freaked me out? going into the ladies room to find a little woman lurking in the corner with an assortment of toiletries spread on the counter and a tip bowl for when she hands you a paper towel. Um. Random. I am perfectly capable of getting my own paper towel. And no, I will not tip you for that "service".
