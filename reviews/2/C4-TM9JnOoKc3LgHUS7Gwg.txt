Stopped by this place because it's right next to Hotel Valley Ho, where we are staying. This is a tourist trap full of less than mediocre food. The Carne del fuego or the "Meat Wreath" as my wife called it was forgettable. No one brought us the  famous tortillas they seem so proud of, so we can't weigh in on that featured item. They get one extra star because the margaritas weren't too bad although very light on tequila.


Go for drinks, dine elsewhere.
