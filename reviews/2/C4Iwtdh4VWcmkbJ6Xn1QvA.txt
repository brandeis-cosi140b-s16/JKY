I honestly hate giving 2 star.  I feel bad I really do.  This was a strange and unappealing dining experience.   We walked into the resturant on a sat at noon for a quick bite.  Our first impression was that the place was closed despite having a sign that says open.  We glimpsed an older gentleman working at the back and were unsure if he saw us as we were not greeted.  We had to walk to th counter and say hello three times before he acknowledged us and then just responded to my question of " are u closed ?" by telling us he previously "had 2 customers just leave who sat all morning".  It was a weird feeling to be responded to a clearly hinted question that the greeting was not warm or friendly.  Inside the menu there are several disclosure such as customers only get one bowl with salsa, nosubstitutions for dishes.  The door outside showed a sign of no pets and no use of bathroom except for paying customers.  The in the ladies room there was a sign for a reward for a The person who is stealing candles from the ladies restroom. I honestly felt like a criminal in that restaurant and began to suspect that the service was more intend on treating us like undesirable customers rather than good paying customers.  I started to have a really bad feeling and wanted to leave except my boyfriend was very hungry. I ordered a chimichanga and my tacos the two orders came out and the server who I think is also the owner was confused as to which of ours was what and only brought out only 1 at a time.  The food was bland tasteless canned or frozen. My dining partner complain that he could not chew through the beef in his tacos.I honestly didn't want to eat it. For the price not worth it.  I could of had a better meal and mcdonalds.  Won't be back.
