Stopped in for the grilled chicken enchiladas. Blech. 

All I could taste after only finishing half the order was SALT! You know, the kind of taste in your mouth that won't go away.

The enchiladas were so heavily sauced, I guess I should have asked them to hold back on the sauce, but this being my first time to Cafe Rio on Lake Mead I decided to eat the dish the way they prepared it for others. The chicken was super dry even with all the added medium sauce they smothered it in. The combination of beans, rice, and sauce all created this big runny blob of salt-laden goo.

I have to give the staff compliments for being so efficient and friendly. They deserve 4 stars for that.
