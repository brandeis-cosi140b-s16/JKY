I came here again and for some reason I thought it would be a nice place to take my wife's parents. Big mistake. The service was better than usual, but the food was worse than ever. It seemed like everything we ate was just old, somehow. The best thing anyone ate was the free chips and salsa before the meal.

This will probably be my final visit.
