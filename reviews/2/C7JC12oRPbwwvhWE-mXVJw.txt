The great thing about this place is their carne asada burrito!  Everything else is average.  We've tried different burritos and other menu items and they were just ok.  The last two times we've been here, they've gotten our order wrong and were NOT apologetic - to the point that I feared they might do something to my food for having to correct it.  :0/  

Anyhow, if they had better service (maybe a smile or a greeting or a thank you at some point - or how about they just get our order right?), and we just eat carne asada burritos, this place would get a solid three stars.  

Come on, Chandler/Gilbert.... can I get some good fast-food Mexican spots?!

One thing I did notice was that they're open pretty late which would definitely be convenient after a late-night!
