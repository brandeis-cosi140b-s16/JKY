Worse than Meh, but since the waitress was nice and the service was quick and efficient, I'll give them the second star. 

First off, this La Fonda is in no way related to the La Fonda Del Sol on Shea in North Scottsdale.  (See my review.) 

On other notes... 

-- the place has that funky antiseptic old-folks' home smell. 
-- the lunch crowd (4 or 5 other tables of diners) looked like most lived a pretty hard life. 
-- the booths could definitely use a good cleaning. 

Okay, so I went there for lunch today with my son, Jacob. The chips and salsa were okay, not great; the salsa was fine-- but certainly not like La Fonda Del Sol's-- and the chips were nice and hot but wet with grease. Jacob ordered a chicken fajita burrito with green sauce, and I ordered a small chicken nachos. Jacob's burro was not too bad. The green sauce was flavorful and really spicy (which I like more than him), but Jacob commented that the chicken seemed "a little gristly" and the bell peppers had a weird taste to them. 

My nachos, however, were inedible! They came with the shredded chicken sprinkled on top of the rest of the toppings. The chicken was lukewarm and really funky tasting.  Jacob was a bit annoyed and I think he thought I was being difficult because of their presentation until I made him taste the chicken. He quickly agreed that it was gross (and preceded to use his soda to cleanse his pallet). 

As I stated above, service was good, so the waitress was very nice, took away the offensive dish, and I ordered a machaca burrito with fundito sauce instead. The burro was okay, not great. Their machaca is minced very fine to almost a paste consistency (which I do not find very appealing --think dog food) and the fundito was okay but a bit bland. I wished that I had gone with the green sauce-- maybe even the chicken fajita filling as well.

All in all, a pretty unpleasant experience. As I said, this would definitely be a one-star review if it wasn't for the service.
