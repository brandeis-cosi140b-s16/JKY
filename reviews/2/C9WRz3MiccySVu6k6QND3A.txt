This place has a sleek look to it, but with plasma televisions all over the place the customer ends up getting stuck with their trickle-down cost on the overpriced menu.  Speaking of the menu, it is fairly generic in terms of Sonoran-Mexican cuisine. If you want a better meal, friendlier service (not being rushed through like cattle), try Restaurant Mexico one block north on Mill, it is better food at half the price.
