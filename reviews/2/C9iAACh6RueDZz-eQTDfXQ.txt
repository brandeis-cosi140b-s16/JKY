Okay, I had to post an update. I am so disappointed in Mi Tierra as of late. First of all the food is still delicious. But the service is sooooo bad lately. My husband and I went  for lunch on a Saturday a couple of weeks ago, and the waitress was so bad, no forks, no water, no asking if we needed anything, order messed up. So disappointed. On the same day, there was another customer giving the owner a piece of her mind as well. Unfortunately, I had to agree with all she was telling her. So I chalked it up,   as okay, maybe the waitress is just bad. So I decided to go for dinner with my daughter on a Monday night. First of all, we were the only ones there, and this other waitress was just as bad, if not worse. How can you not give your customers good service if we were the only ones there? I expected cartwheels! I do not know how they are staying in business, with that kind of service. Pretty sad, considering the food is really good. Needless to say, I left no tip!
