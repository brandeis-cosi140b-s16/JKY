Was really looking forward to having a new neighborhood go-to but overall left underwhelmed. There is so much potential in this place which the restaurant does not (yet) live up to. I recently dined with my family; we started off with drinks, two orders of guac and an order of street tacos. Not sure if there was any EtOH in my margarita and the pour of my mom's wine glass was rather insulting; they did accommodate and pour her a bigger glass when asked. The food is okay, nothing to write home about. I had the chicken mole which had a strong peanut butter flavor I wasn't expecting; the rice and beans to accompany your entree are rather bland. Mejico, you're over-priced for the food and for the neighborhood. $22 for a relleno with no more than a few shrimp, beans and rice? Knock a few dollars off your entrees and you'll draw a bigger crowd.
