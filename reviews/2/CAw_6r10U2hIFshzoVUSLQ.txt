Terrible service. Decent food - better airport quality here!
As another yelper put it, how desperate are you at an airport to find something to eat that isn't fast food before you get on the plane? 

Sammys had horrible service, the server was very rude, which immediately turned me off from the place. Children and families are not very welcome and must sit in this area that feels like you've been voted off the island. It's roped off, and once you are there, it's impossible to get a servers attention!

We ordered shrimp chivche, which was really just prawns in salsa. It was served with no chips, in a martini glass, and a styrofoam playe - all which I found odd. It was refreshing and a good light snack.

I ordered a cocktail from the bar, it was so awful, I sent it back. They replaced it with a beer, which can't be messed up.

My kids had garlic cheese fries whch were an excellet bar snack! The guacamole was canned/made with sour cream, not really guacamole if you ask me. 

Pro: good salsa!
Con: everything else
