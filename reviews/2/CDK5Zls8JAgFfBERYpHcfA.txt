So when my friend Kevin and I are looking for a beer fix, this is usually where we head. They have decent deals on pitchers and oh so edible salsa (personally I like the hot version) but that is where the love affair ends. And even though we have gone to this spot several times, I wouldn't say that either one of us are fans. We go for the convenience.

I've tried several items on the menu and have to say I've never been particularly impressed with any of them. That's a nice way of saying I've never had anything here that wasn't done better somewhere else. I have spent years learning the nuances of what makes a good Mexican plate and if you are looking for something authentic, this wouldn't be my first choice. On the other hand if you are happy with an Americanized version and in need of cheap beer, definitely check it out!
