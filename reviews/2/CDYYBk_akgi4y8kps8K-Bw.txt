Lets Keep this short and sweet:
Food = OUTSANDING A+
Customer service = B - (at best)
Facility cleanliness = A from what I could see
Nickel and diming you to death = they are true experts at.
To get your plate just the way you want it with all the "EXTRAs" plan on spending $12 per plate
Extras include:
Salsa on tacos
Cheese
Sour cream
Guacamole
Chips and salsa are nearly $5 (OUCH) (little baby cups of salsa too btw.)
The plate is a good size and the food is good but I left feeling like the opportunist of this business are exploiting their customers on a daily basis.
