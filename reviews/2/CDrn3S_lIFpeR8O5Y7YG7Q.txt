An open letter to Cafe Rio:
The 1st star is for the sweet Barbacoa taco, and the second star is for the tortilla. The first time I visited your cafe was in Newport Beach, California. It was overpriced and took way too long to get my food considering there were 3 people in front of me. I let that first bad experience slide since it was my first time, so I gave you the benefit of the doubt. The second time I went, same thing. Then the 3rd time, same thing. That was it. I was swearing off cafe rio. All was well in my world. Then, you decided to put a location smack dab in the middle of my town. North Phoenix. All these locals were stoked about New Mexican food. All it got from me was an eye roll. Unfortunately all my friends LOVE cafe rio. Sure, it's good. But dealing with the never-ending line, overall confused taco/burrito assembly line people, it's just annoying. 

There needs to be more training for your burrito people. They were only utilizing one of the line people, while the other sat and stared and said "I can't help cause I'm gonna get yelled at." WHAT? I'm gonna be the one yelling if you keep letting my  taco sit on the line getting no attention. 

whatever, cafe rio!
