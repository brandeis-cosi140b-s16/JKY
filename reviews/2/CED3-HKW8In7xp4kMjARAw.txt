Sad to say, Ajo Al's continues to slide downhill.  At two recent trips we were served food that was obviously not freshly prepared - for example, eggs with chorizo which suspiciously had no trace of oil.  How is this possible since chorizo is so fatty?  Answer - the chorizo had been pre-cooked and then dumped into an egg mixture.  The result was burnt on the bottom but the cheese melted on top and the extremely hot plate told me it had been heated again, probably in an "alligator".  The result was dry, almost tasteless, and completely unsatisfying.  

You want more - the chips were stale; the booth we were seated in had one normal side and one side where the seat was so low it would have been impossible to eat at it.  This could be fixed -- if anyone cared.

I've pretty much given up on you, Ajo.  Don't you know the mantra of today is fresh, fresh, fresh?
