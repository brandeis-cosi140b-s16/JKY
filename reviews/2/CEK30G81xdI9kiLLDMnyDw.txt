Like most people we came here because we were hungry and just happened to be around it at the time.

The vibe there is simple: have fun.  And they definitely strove for that.  Although it was far from a full house in the restaurant we had a MC up there like hyping it up like it was packed.  The waiters sang a Backstreet Boys song and opened up the karaoke for anyone else.  They would leave signs behind patrons, like "single and looking" or "kiss me."  Just anything they could do to create a laid back, party atmosphere.

But the food.  Ehhhh.  Best thing about the meal were the chips and salsa.  Luckily we got there right before happy hour so we ordered 3 appetizers that came out to 17 bucks.  I got burger sliders and the buns for all of them were SO stale.  I'm normally on a pretty strict diet so to have a "cheat meal" and not enjoy it is mildly devastating.

I won't be coming here again.
