This review is for the evening. Came here on a Saturday night after the polo tournament and felt this place was trying to be Hollywood unsuccessfully. It's pretty with cabanas and a pool (hence the 2nd star). Unfortunately the crowd was really odd with a lot of older men and cougars dancing to house music like it's 1981. I ordered a mojito from a male bartender and it was rudely served to me as one of the worst drinks I have ever tasted. There was a fashion show going on to benefit breast cancer but unfortunately they didn't promote it correctly. Nobody understood what was going on and there were absolutely no announcements. Maybe the clothes were for sale? No idea. The cocktail servers also were in pink attire but took it a little far with pink tutus and "save second base" tees.

Upside to this place, the staff who work the door are friendly and the place is pretty with cabanas and a pool. Maybe I'll come here again during the day to see if it redeems itself. In the meantime I suggest they find new bartenders. STAT!
