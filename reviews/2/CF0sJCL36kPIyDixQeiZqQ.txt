I have been eager to try Los Sombreros for some time. Last night (Cinco de Mayo) was my first visit. I expected it would be busy and that it would take a while to be served. 

It wasn't busy. The staff, however, was running around like mad, accomplishing virtually nothing. Tables were left uncleared throughout the restaurant. Glasses were stacked up at one end of the bar. Soon after I sat at the bar, more people started coming in. They had to wait at the door a good five minutes before anyone showed them to a table. The bartender was friendly, took my order quickly, and I did eventually get my drink. The drinks there are freshly made, which is great, but it's very labor intensive and time consuming. The man was behind the bar alone trying to take care of the entire restaurant's orders. On Cinco de Mayo!  Also known as Gringo's Night out for Mexican Food and Margaritas!  Very poorly managed. If a Mexican establishment ever needs extra staff,  it's on Cinco de Mayo. Then I ordered a glass of wine. They couldn't find the bottle. Fine. Ordered another. They couldn't find the bottle. So I asked him to pour me what did he have available. Luckily, it was a very nice Pinot noir. 

Then I approached the hostess stand and asked to be placed on the list for a table on their patio. They didn't actually have a hostess but the waitstaff who came up to help was very nice and said she'd just come get me when one came available. 

A good 20 minutes later she came back to me and asked if I wanted to sit inside. Uncleared, EMPTY tables were on the patio. No, thank you. By that time I was trying to get the bartender's attention to cash me out. Very disappointed because I really wanted to try the menu, which looked amazing. I just couldn't  wait any longer. 

I will go back and try again.  I have to wonder if a call to Bar Rescue might help the owners and management figure out that customer service really does matter.  We will see.
