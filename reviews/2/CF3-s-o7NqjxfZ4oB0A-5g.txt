Like a lot of other reviewers I'd have to say the food is 5 star but the service is horrendous. We were blatantly ignored once and got up and left after 15 minutes of staring at the menu. We gave it another shot and actually made it to the ordering part; and the food really is phenomenal once you actually get someone to take your order and bring it to you. The horrible service explains why it is never busy when we've gone. Which is unfortunate because we love the food. If they ever bring this place all together into a 5 star worthy eatery they will have a money making gem there! Until then know it's hit or miss on the service. More miss than hit. And honestly for me that was their last chance to gain me as a regular. Sorry Otro.
