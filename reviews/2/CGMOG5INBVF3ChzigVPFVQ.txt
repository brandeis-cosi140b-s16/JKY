I love grilled chicken as much as the next finger lickin' chick, but man- the execution here is somehow worse than most other locations I've been to, to the extent that I'll go out of my way (or flat out elsewhere) rather than deal with it.

If you use the drive-thru, regardless of what time of day it is, expect about a 10 minute wait. "But this is fresh, delicious grilled chicken!", you say. Well, if I can see through the window that they don't even start making my order until my card has been processed and I've been waiting a few minutes, I'm not thrilled.

Also, this location in particular has repeatedly gouged me on little things: chips and guac order is only half-full and chips are stale, ask and double-check for cilantro sauce and still don't receive it without going in and asking a third time, torn corn tortillas, and tortilla soup that is 80% broth and corn.

Somehow I still find myself giving them a chance every few months, and their chicken is good- but not enough to make up for half-assing my order each time.
