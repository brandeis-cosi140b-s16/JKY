Yet another place that has a reputation for good food and long ass lines. Another $40 meal that left me unsatified and confused. I'm left with these questions on my mind during and after the meal. What are the other people eating and are we in the wrong place? 

The food here does not live up to the lore painted on the colorful walls and menu. The bread and dip brought out while we ordered was stale and the dip was unmemorable. My wife insisted that we order the guacamole. I was not a fan of the flavor combinations of pomegranate and lime. It was Sunday, so we ordered from the brunch menu. I had the enchiladas verde and was extremely disappointed. The enchiladas were okay in certain places but mostly tasted like something I could cook at home myself. I absolutely hated everything else on the plate from the soupy and over sweetened verde sauce, burned potatoes and pico de gallo that was just out of place on the dish. 

At least the place was not crowded. I would have had to ask for a refund if I waited 2 hours like I've heard people do. The live music was cool and the place had a nice atmosphere. The only thing missing was good food.
