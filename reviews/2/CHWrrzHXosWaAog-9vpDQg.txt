You mean to tell me I not only spent $4 on a tostada, but spent 15 minutes waiting for it as well?

I ordered the Vampiro under the impression it would be quesadilla-esque. How I was wrong. Not only was there no cheese to be seen or for that matter tasted, but there was only the smallest dab of guacamole and onions. While the carne asada wasn't bad, by the time I walked back to my office, it was already cold.

The Vampiro was on the small side (for a tostada anyway) and not filling at all. Good thing I had some baby carrots in the office refrigerator.

And now I realize why the kid who took my order asked if that was really all I wanted. Here I thought he was just expecting me to be the Noah's Fat Ass Ark and order two of every menu item.
