Had a less than okay experience. In the past we order chicken faijitas and are pleased. Tried two other dishes and neither of us liked our meals. One waitress for entire restaurant, harried and abrupt at that. Agree with another reviewer that the restaurant could use a good cleaning and sprucing up. Kind of worn and shabby look. Not eager to go back.
