I'm on a Mexican food kick, and realized besides Los Taquitos and Arribas there's also one of the 'Bertos close by. I told my husband where I was heading and he gave me a dubious look.... Right there I should have re-thinked my meal plan. 
Ordered through drive thru, carne asada fries and three rolled tacos with cheese/guac. Food was ready fast. While driving home, the delicious smell I was expecting that usually makes me want to start eating in my car wasn't there. It smelled like grease, old grease. Got home and got a bite of taco.... Ugh no. It tasted like it have been fried a couple of times... several days ago. Then tried the carne asada fries....Meh, super salty. 
I mean, I wasn't expecting healthy food, greasy food can be delicious but this was not, at all!!! I started feeling disgusted while trying to eat the fries and didn't even looked back at the tacos. Sadly, it all ended in the garbage and I hate to throw out food.  Maybe I should have ordered a burrito or had some drinks before coming here. I'll give them a try again, but in the very distant future when I can think about Bertos without feeling nauseous.
