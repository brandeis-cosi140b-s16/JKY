If we weren't staying at the Flamingo, I don't think we would have gone to this place.  Nothing good, nothing bad, but the chain could have been plopped into Minneapolis or South Dakota.  Typical Mexican chain and everything had that corporate taste.  I suppose most go for the showboating by the bartenders, but there just was not anything memorable about my meal.
