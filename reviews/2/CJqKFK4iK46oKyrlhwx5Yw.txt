When this place first opened they had some really good Mexican food and service. New management came in and really changed the feel of this place, trying to make it more of a restaurant then fast food Mexican. Unfortunately this place has really gone down hill and their food isn't that great anymore. I have given them more then one chance thinking they maybe having a bad day, but each time I have gone back it's been worse. I wouldn't recommend it.
