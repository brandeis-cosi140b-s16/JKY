Worst tortilla soup ever.  More like a Luke warm chili with a big glob of guacamole on top.  I sent it back. 

My friend ordered a quesadilla and they delivered enchiladas.   If he wasn't so tried he would have sent them back

Knowing we're were not happy they did comp the meal, which was good ( and raised the rating by one star).
