Las Gloria's would have gotten as many stars as possible until our last visit on the first Friday afternoon of August 2015,  but it was not the same.  The  server was uninformed regarding the margaritas.  She was confused by the request for one of the 3 different types of tequila listed on the sign on the wall. The  next server told me the  sign advertising  99 cent margaritas was old and hadn't been removed.  I  asked for management;  I was told " he" was busy  making a big platter, and could not speak with me.  I persisted.  When she returned from the  kitchen she  said "he" would be out later.   I was left standing at the  service bar.  Then 2 servers rolled their eyes at me giggling as they scurried away.  Later, a man (he didn't introduce himself) came to the  table.  He said he would not be able to sell us  blue tequila margaritas as posted on the sign because it was too expensive.   He  showed me a bottle of an expensive blue tequila from a different company that was not the same thing as the sign with pictures and words listing white, gold, and blue tequilas.  He told us he was personally making my blue margarita, and bringing it to the table.  Never happened.  What is going on in this place?  It was the best neighborhood restaurant.  Now I'm not recommending it to anyone because of terrible customer service.  Embarrassed? They  should be.
