This restaurant has now moved to Highland Ave in East Liberty.
First, the service was very good. Our server was a bit shy and did not appear to be really experienced, but that was perfectly fine by me: she was very sweet and attentive.
The food pretty much sucked. The tortilla chips were very inauthentic and store bought tasting. It seemed like they just dumped them out of a bag. The salsa was okay. My jerk chicken burrito was okay but not all that exciting. The presentation left a bit to be desired: it was on a tiny plate with nothing on the side or on top or anything. More importantly, my husband had to send back his goat entree because it was very cold in the center, as if it had been frozen. When he got it the second time, it was hot, but didn't have the same spice as before and suddenly had a side of plantains but way less sauce than before. In the end, it was okay, but showed that there isn't really consistency in the kitchen.
Keep your front of house people (although you probably didn't need FIVE people standing around...) but the kitchen needs to get their act together.
