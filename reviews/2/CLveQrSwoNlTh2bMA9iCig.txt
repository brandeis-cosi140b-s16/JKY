A for effort for La Frontera Mexican Restaurant in Austin Village. I ordered the Enchiladas Cremosas and it was bland and the chicken was dry. The constant fruit fly at our table was a lovely companion. Made me wonder how clean the kitchen really was. I get that flies come on the fruit and veggies but come on. Bleach the sink, empty the trash can and get rid of the nuisance. All in all, drive 2 miles down the road and get excellent food at La Unica!
