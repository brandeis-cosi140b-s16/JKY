I'll start off by saying, I do love Chipotle. I've been to many different locations and the food quality has always been consistent. I can't give this location any more stars though. Something is wrong with the management.

The past two visits, something hasn't been ready or they've been out of an ingredient. The first trip, they were out of Pico and the second trip they were out of all tortillas...How can a burrito place be out of tortillas??? I don't get it? Out of all the Chipotle locations I've been to (probably ~10 or so), I've never had this happen. It's really disappointing driving to Chipotle and having them be out of something.
