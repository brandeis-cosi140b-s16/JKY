Checked out the reviews on yelp so decided to give this spot a try since I live close by. Drove into an empty parking lot. That was a bad sign but decided to give it a try anyway. The restaurant was dark and the service was ok. I ordered camarones rancheros. The shrimp was overcooked... Rice and beans were ok... Overall not impressed. Wont be coming back.
