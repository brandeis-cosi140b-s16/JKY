I was pretty dissappointed with my last visit to this location. The service was really slow and inaccurate (ordered a margerita on the rocks and frozen came). I can't really blame it fully on the waiter, the place was obviously under staffed. 
I ordered a green chilli chimmy with green sauce... and it was not good. The beef was dry and flavorous and the green sauce was bla... I couldn't finish it.
