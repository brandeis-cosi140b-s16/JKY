My hubby likes to find local owned restaurants especially when it comes to Mexican food. He heard about Tony's on ABC 15 and decided we would give it a try.

The location is not the greatest in Old Avondale, and the building is tiny and shows its age. We ordered our meal as carry-out, I was in no shape to be seen in public so I didn't catch the inside. 

I had their carne asada combo plate which of course includes the staple beans and rice. The meat was seriously over cooked, and the beans and rice were bland. My husband makes way better carne asada, cooked to perfection. My husband had the tamale, cheese enchilada combo and he ate it up, mind you, it doesn't take much to please my Sailor Man when it comes to food. 

Overall I would compare it to a mom and pop version of Filibertos only not as good. It possibly could be better with a few beers. Maybe I will give them another spin...who knows.
