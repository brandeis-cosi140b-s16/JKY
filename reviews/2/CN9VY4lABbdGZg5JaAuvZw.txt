I have been here three times and did enjoy the breakfast burritos but will never go back. My wife and I went in for breakfast and since they only serve drip coffee we stopped by Starbucks for an iced coffee. As soon as we walked in we were told in a rather harsh tone "you can not bring those in here. I will get fined $200! Please leave and get rid of those drinks!" I was totally caught off guard. I understand policy and am fine with that but please treat your customers with respect. My wife responded that she will just go elsewhere and the lady told us well that's fine then. Horrible customer service!!
