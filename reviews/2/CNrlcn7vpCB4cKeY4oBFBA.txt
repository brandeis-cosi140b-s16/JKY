So sad to say that Elvira's will be taken out of the rotation.  While the food is ok, well on the better side of most Mexican food places I've been to in Arizona.  We have been there 5 or 6 times.  The margaritas are good for the prices, but the service is terrible.

I really want to support local business but the last 3 times the service was unbearable.  Part of the problem at least during the week is the bartender doubles as a waitress, so between her tables she can make drinks.  Seriously the last time it was 25 minutes before we had water or chips, or drinks.  Total time on a Wednesday was over an hour it took so long I didn't bother ordering a second margarita.  My other big issue is followup.  We almost have to tackle the waitress to get a second drink.  I guess they don't know the tip is based on the total check.  It maybe a AJ thing you do see people with water only or soft drinks, but you would think for people ordering drinks they are going to spend more they would get ok service but sadly NOT!!!
