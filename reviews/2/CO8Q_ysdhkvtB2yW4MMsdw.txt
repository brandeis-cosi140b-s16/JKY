Make res first.  Went on Saturday at 5:30 and they wouldn't seat us.  There were at least 10 tables open, but said they had lots of reservations later that night.  Buzzkill.  We went old school to El Sombrero on Main and Utah instead.  Been there since 1946 and the have the best chile Colorado and Chile verde you could ask for.
