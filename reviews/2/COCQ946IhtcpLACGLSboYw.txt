This is the second time my partner and I have dined here and I really want to like this place. The service is meh as is the food. This trip we ordered the green chili quesadilla and there was way too much cheese on it and I am always leery of a Mexican food restaurant that uses yellow cheese. Ooh well, I got over the bland quesadilla and ordered a shredded beef darado taco and there was no spice to it! My partner ordered the tinga shrimp taco and it was also a fail. The chips were stale and blah. I do like the salsa but the guacamole is horrible, who puts pomegranate seeds in guac!?! I get they are trying to me new age but they need to get the basics right first.
