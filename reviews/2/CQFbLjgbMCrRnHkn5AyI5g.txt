Another place that for some reason can't make a breakfast burrito.  The ingredients are egg + chorizo + cheese + tortilla, thats not a long list!  Yet for some reason mine was totally devoid of egg and the woman behind the counter had the audacity to argue that it did have egg in there.  I'm pretty sure I know the difference between egg+chorizo and just chorizo and that was definitely the latter.  The only reason she got bumped up to 2 stars was for offering to make another, though I didn't feel the need to brave another iteration of that horse troth worthy slop. Probably would have been less grossed out by a turd wrapped in a tortilla.  You know when as you order they hand it through the window and the kitchen is dormant that that crap has probably been sitting a while, and it trasted like it.  Her offer to "Make me a fresh" one was just a pleasant way of saying "hand another cold one thats been sitting for the last 30 thru the window".  I'm sure their real place in town is much better, obviously you can run a good restaurant in an airport or someone would have succeeded at it by now.  Airport food always sucks, best to just bring a sandwich get to wherever you're going and eat a real meal there.
