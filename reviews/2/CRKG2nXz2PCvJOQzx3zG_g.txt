UPDATE: Now convinced this is the Worst location of this chain in town. The guacamole (normally the highlight) was more brown than green and the salsa fresca looked about five days past it's prime.

It was about 9pm on a Friday night and some of the meat in the bins looked very tired and ready to go to bed. I also had visions of what produce should I get that could possibly get me sick and possibly make me rich like those in the Northwest. Well I survived this trip to the troubled chain, but they are now charging $7.50 for a barbocoa burrito. The other meats cost less, so this must be the gold standard of barbocoa, but I could not tell the difference. It tasted fine, but based on looks and the time of day, maybe these guys should deduct some money off the burrito's after 9pm. Now, they even started hiding the spoons, so I can't stock up on that item to offset the high prices. I now own alot of Chipotle forks/knifes and napkins.
