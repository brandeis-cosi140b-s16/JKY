The only reason why I'm giving it 2 stars is because their carne asada burrito was good. BUT, I'm never coming back here again. 1st of all, the price on their drive-thru menu is different from the window price - which was more, of course. 2nd, they don't do any substitutions in a burrito; paid $2 more because I "added" beans & cheese. 3rd, the lady at the drive-thru didn't warn me it would be more $ for my "added" items and didn't really care that the prices were different on their drive-thru menu. All she said was "the owner said he updated the prices" - no real apology or any accommodations for their misled menu.
