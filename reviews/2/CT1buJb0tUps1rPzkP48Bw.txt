Not impressed at this price range . The waiter was rude wanted us to rush to order even we were just enjoining our drinks and guacamole. I felt pushed into ordering something. I ordered the Mexican burger and was very salty also the chicken enchiladas those were better than the burger but the best had to be the guacamole. We also ordered their nachos but please be warned its like four tortilla chips with stuff on it for $9 like really ??? Just weird !!! Bill was $90 and I was left like really ? Won't be back !
