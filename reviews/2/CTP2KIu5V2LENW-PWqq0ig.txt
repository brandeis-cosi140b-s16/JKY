Help me please I'm still in a noise induced coma from Senor Frog's.    The food is rubbish (their spin on Tex/Mex or Mexican) and the noise will make sure that all audible communication between you and your friends will stop completely.   I don't get what genre their appealing to either and what is all that weird signage crap on the walls?   Another review said this is like spring break in Mexico?  I didn't get that impression - more like another Vegas attempt to be hip...
