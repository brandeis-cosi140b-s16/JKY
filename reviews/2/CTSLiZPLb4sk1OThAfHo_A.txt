Yelpers, you steered me wrong on this one! I found this place highly rated and decided to stop on it. I wanted to love Los Jarochos based on the reviews and the atmosphere but I was super disappointed in their tacos. 

This is obviously a family run establishment and it pains me to write a 2 star review but I have to. The warm greeting when I walked in was lovely, as was the delicious smell coming from the back of the kitchen. The charming older Mexican ladies cooking my tacos made me smile and got the foodie in me thinking "wow, these are going to be some seriously kick-ass street tacos." When my food was ready, I was more than disappointed. 

I ordered a carne asada and a chicken taco. The meat was poor quality, with a slight edge going to the carne asada. The chicken taco was HORRIBLE. The meat wasn't white meat or breast, it was more like rubbery, chewy thigh meat -- the kind of "chicken" you get at the worst Chinese restaurants. That's not my cup of tea, so beware. The prices were cheap enough (we both ate for $12 total), but the food wasn't good. 

The chips tasted like something out of a bag and the salsas were really thin and runny. Don't attack me for liking a bit of chunk with my salsa. The flavors were okay but nothing I wanted to finish eating. The homemade corn tortillas were good. The tacos were fine but they are very heavy on the cilantro and onions so if you want to do some kissing later, skip the toppings. 

It looks like in the past they had a more extensive menu but now, half the signs are covered up or scribbled out with magic marker. Maybe their more "exotic" meats are what's good here, but I really just wanted a chicken taco, not a tongue taco. The restaurant was clean and pleasant. 

I was just so let down by this place.
