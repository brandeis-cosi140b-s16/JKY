This is my second visit and it's just okay to me... I'm just not sure what all the fuss is about here because there is a chipotle right down the street that will give you better taste and more bang for your buck.  I guess this place is more about tradition and being local, but in my experience being local doesn't automatically make you better.  I had the steak and tilapia tacos which were okay but kind of bland when it came down to it.  I also ordered chips and quac... The guac was good but the chips came in a bag which reminded me of gas station nachos ( I was thinking, "Are you kidding me for $4").  I don't know... maybe there is something they have thats very good but I won't be going back to find out.  Just like Southend in general, this place is very overrated!
