Taco shits? I gotz them!

Ok I know its gross, but I literally got sick from the food here! FYI I'm watching the HBO Beyonce documentary and am starting to feel sick again.

Sooo this place is like a mini Del Taco, the drive through is usually where we go. Its like oddly placed as well. Sometimes the cashier ladies are nice, but mostly theyre not. They have your typical cheap Del Taco fare, and I always go for the fries. Today though, I was feeling like a renegade. I got a small beef taco and a chicken taco. The chicken wasnt like it normally tastes so I think that may have been the culprit.

Word of advice, the drive thru has a sharp turn, so dont mess your car up!
