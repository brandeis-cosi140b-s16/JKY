Everything looked soooo good so we decided to put our shopping for Hello Kitty aside and grab a bite. I would call it a mistake, the juice drinks were not that tasty and some tasted downright odd, not horrible, just musty? Freezer burn'ish?. The spicy tamarind was just bleh, not even as fresh as the lollipops you get when you donate $.50 into one of those boxes at a restaurant to help the kids.  The elote in a cup wasn't bad though, a bit overpriced. I did want to like it, because I live down the street, but I will try my luck hanging out at the park instead.
