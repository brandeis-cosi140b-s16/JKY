The food here is pretty average if not plain bad. Do not go here if you are hoping for some good Mexican food. 

However, considering that you're in expensive Vegas, the $2 tacos and beer are a nice option to have. I came here twice for that very reason. 

The tacos, which are Taco Bell style, hard shell with cheddar cheese and sour cream, were good for being far from authentic and only two bucks. 

I also tried the tortilla soup, which is really a misnomer, since this soup was more like some sort of tomato soup with tortilla chips on the side. 

Again, this place isn't necessarily bad, just not authentic and not that good either.
