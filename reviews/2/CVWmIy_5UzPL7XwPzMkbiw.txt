There are a lot of Taco Bells to choose from in the Vegas Valley and unless your like me and this one is close by or its just on the way then pass it up!

There's nothing really wrong with this Taco Bell in general but every time we are craving some TB we go here because its the only one near by and they just drive me crazy because they never have the new burrito or taco and always seem to run out of the items that I want or like. I mean how can you advertise the new Nacho burrito all over the place and don't have it or we are sorry we ran out of those right now. Wait what. how the crap do you run out of tortia chips, cheese, beef, beans and tortias when that's what you do!

All in all its a taco bell and honestly when it comes to the flavor and service its pretty much the same. Sometimes there are good employees there that care sometimes there's not and its not the locations fault its the young dumb kid behind the counter! So I can't blame TB franchise for that. 

As far as there seating area its pretty large for a taco bell. typically clean and just as any TB you get your food done the same and fast!
