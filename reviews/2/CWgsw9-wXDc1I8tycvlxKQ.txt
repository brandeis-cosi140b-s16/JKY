Giving two start because of the terrible customer service.  We spent an usually long amount of time discussing  our non-complicated/completely ordinary order of tacos and quesadillas with the cashier, and went over it not once but three times before she got it right.  Order went in and then we waited, and waited, and waited some more.  Finally our order was ready and after all of that time spent going over the order, it was still wrong!  Food was delicious but not worth the wait or hassle.
