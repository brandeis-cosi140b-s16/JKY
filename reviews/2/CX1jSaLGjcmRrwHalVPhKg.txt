Worst food ever. Chicken tacos are gross. Supreme nachos were bland. I asked for cilantro and they didn't give me any. The burrito  with no rice was literally just a tortilla with meat. No Pico de gallo,  no sauce, so cilantro, NOTHING!!! Only reason they got two stars is because they were fast. Horrible food though. Not authentic Mexican food at all.
