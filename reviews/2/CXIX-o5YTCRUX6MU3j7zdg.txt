The food is the same as any other Cafe Rio however the service is awful. In the middle of my order the food line person left. 10 minutes later another new employee came over and had no idea what order was who's. In the meantime  the food sat there getting cold. If you haven't been there yet go soon as I believe this location won't last long.
