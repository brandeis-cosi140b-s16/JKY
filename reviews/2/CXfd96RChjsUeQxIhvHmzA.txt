Revisited this location on a lark; the smell was still present and every taco we ordered (around nine or ten, crunchy and soft) were so dripping with grease that they were largely inedible. Crunchy tacos no longer had their crunch and soft tacos were slippery.
We called the location and they said they'd make it right for us free of charge tomorrow, so l shall update this review at that time. I'm glad Taco Bell got back to me on Yelp about my last review, but something really needs to be done at the location at this point.
