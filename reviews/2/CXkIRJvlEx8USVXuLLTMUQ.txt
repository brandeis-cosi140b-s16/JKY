No Bueno. 

We tried this location as it is closer to our house. We walked in at 8:30 and the girl at the counter immediately said "we close in 30 minutes!".  I told her, "yes, that's why we are here at 8:30".  

We ordered two tortilla soups, a flying saucer and chips and salsa.  The salsa was served in the smallest condiment plastic to go cups possible. Although you order at the counter, I would never expect at a restaurant that you have the options to "dine in", to be served tortilla soup in a styrophome cup!!!!!!  My daughter ordered a flying saucer and she was served on a plate. This really bothered me.   

Food was ok, but I can't handle feeling like I'm picnicking when we are dining out. We'll opt for Gecko Grill or the original Tia Rosas next time. I would MAYBE go back for take out only.
