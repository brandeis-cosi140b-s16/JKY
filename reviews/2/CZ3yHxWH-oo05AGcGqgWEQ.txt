Taco Guild has all the trappings of a great taco joint.  Located in a spacious renovated church, it's no doubt a great place to grab a beer after work.  But the food?  That's a different story.

Like everything else in the restaurant, the menu looks like something you'd see in a great eatery.  You'll find street corn, creative aiolis, slow-cooked meats, pungent cheeses, and freshly made tortillas.  But the chef seems either unwilling or unable to properly use the tools at his or her disposal. I had street corn and the lamb and cherry steak tacos, each one of which was drenched in their homemade mayonnaise.  And in the case of the tacos, both were loaded with so much bleu cheese that I barely noticed the well-cooked and seasoned meats stuffed at the bottom of the tortilla.

This place has potential, but right now, it clearly misses the mark.
