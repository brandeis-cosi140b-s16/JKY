Bleh. First, any "Mexican" restaurant with ground beef on the menu is not authentic. Second, this stuff is not fresh. I asked whether they could cook my steak for the steak burrito medium, and the waiter said the steak was "precooked."  So, I asked for steak and shrimp fajitas. I asked for the steak to be cooked medium, and it was harder than an old sponge (nasty). I ate here last night and asked for medium rare steak fajitas, and they came out very rare (still mooing). Rule of thumb: do not order steak from here.  Also, buyer beware!  My coworker literally could not put her fork through the tamale she ordered ... Someone overheated a frozen tamale!
