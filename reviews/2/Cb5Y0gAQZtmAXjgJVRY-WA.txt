I am so sad to write a bad review for this place. I was so excited to try this place. The staff was very nice and friendly and fast. However the food was a different experience. The chips are tasty, the salsa and "hot" salsa tasted like ketchup. It was pretty bad. I went with the Pollo Rico. The chicken was so awfully dry I used the ketchup I mean salsa to help it out. Even then it turned into tomato soup. I asked for more hot salsa the waitress told me they have habanero salsa. I asked for some of that....it was ok. The refried beans so so hot however so so bland. They absolutely had no taste. My son was not a fan of his food either....The place it's self is beautiful and they do have a great atmosphere. I will try one more time but after that $20.00 for mexican food between my son and I is not worth it.....sorry =(
