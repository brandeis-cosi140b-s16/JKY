not sure if it is the same place or not. we went to moe's in ROBINSON TWP today. i was pretty let down. 
first of all, it is SO FREAKIN' LOUD in there! the music is blaring and there are no baffles on the ceiling to control noise. it was hard to hear the person at the same table. 
next, it is nothing more than an imitation of Chipotle. not impressed with the food in any special way. 
when you come in , the employees behind the food bar and counter yell "Welcome to Moe's". um... not sure there is a point to this. and , it got annoying really quick for someone eating in. 
yes, greet people at the food line. yes, be friendly but i don't agree with the yelling. not clever. 
the parking is lousy. i would not go out of my way... or in my way , to go there again. would DEFINITELY choose elsewhere.
