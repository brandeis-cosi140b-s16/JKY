The salsa that came with the chips was too spicy so I asked if they have a milder salsa. The waitress said they have some pico that was milder a brought some out. However, there was a $2 charge for the pico and we weren't told.  They removed the pico charge upon my request. I wanted a taco salid but they didn't have one on the menu so I had nachos with added chicken. The chicken was spongy and didn't seem to be real chicken chunks. The cheese was a white sauce and not flavorful so the nachos were bland. The service was fine.
