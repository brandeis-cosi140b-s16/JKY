We met a large group here. Based on the mediocre reviews I wasn't expecting much and played it safe by ordering a beer. Can't comment on their cocktails, but did have some chips with guac, and then ordered fajitas, another hopefully safe choice. Typically with fajitas you get your sizzling meat, peppers and onions served on a hot skillet, with the cool stuff like cheese and lettuce separate, right? Not here. Everything came out crowded on one very small plate and at the same temperature. Yuck. 

On the positive side, they deserve credit for reviving the Fyfe's location which sat unused for a good long time. It's a cool old building with some nice features like tall ceilings and big windows overlooking East Wash. The bar area is pretty inviting, but the dining area less so. Our server was very good and cheerfully brought a large number of separate checks.

This place is near home and I'd like to see it do well, but based on this experience I wouldn't return for a meal. Maybe will try the bar sometime?
