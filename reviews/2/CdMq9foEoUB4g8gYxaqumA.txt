My first time here it used to be Baja Fresh , I order a steak burrito. It was beans and rice than steak then the streak wasn't cocked good, it was kinda raw. I told that to one of the employees and the answer was that depends who's the cock that day that's how the meat is going to be cock. Can u believe that ? So thumb down. Maybe with time they will learn how to cock.
