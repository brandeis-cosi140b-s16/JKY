We stopped in for a quick bite before a concert at the Mandalay Bay Beach on a Saturday night.
I had eaten here before when they first opened, I remembered it was average but we were willing to give it another try.
There was a mariachi band playing and a football game on the tv at the same time, we couldn't hear ourselves think.
The hostess seemed like we were bothering her when she realized we wanted a seat. Staff seemed a bit disoriented. Our waitress was great though, attentive and pleasant, I believe her name was Jessica.
They serve free chips and salsa, chips needed salt, the salsas' were gross.
We decided to split a steak burrito with cheese sauce...it was so bland. No spice at all, not much flavor going on. It was edible, but should only be served in an old age home.(no offense to the elderly)
Oh and my husband ordered a Dos Equis draft, it was flat.
We will never go back.
