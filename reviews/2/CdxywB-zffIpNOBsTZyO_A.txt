This is NOT Mexican food. I repeat NOT Mexican food! We walk in, nice place, kind of surprising how cute it is inside. The booths have pillows, and are cozy very cool. To get appetizer and drink specials you HAVE TO SIT AT THE BAR. Oh and chips and salsa cost money, nothing free here! 

The margaritas are on "special" for $5. Not that great. Also not worth sitting uncomfortably at the bar to get. 

We were the only people there, on a Friday night. Yes, it was before 5pm or 6pm,, but really? The wait staff was super friendly and made sure we had everything we needed (except real mexican food maybe?). 

The menu had pork chops, pork loin, sandwiches and ribs. So don't go here thinking it is a Mexican food place like we did PLEASE. The food was marginally "ok". The spiciness was "ok". The red "smoked" sauce tasted burned, and the actual food on my boyfriend's carne adovada WAS burned. It was also very DRY... this is their specialty dish?

Service good,, but not even close to worth the 50 bucks we threw down for the meal for 2 people and 2 drinks. 

Just know you are going for a....want to be higher class restaurant... that really has nice ambiance, but the food is not up to par.
