After meeting friends for a quick brew over at WBC, the urge to eat struck and we ventured into Verona to see what we could rustle up. A failed attempt to eat at the Draft House landed us over at Cuco's. 

+ Nice looking building
+ Huge interior with high ceilings - very open feeling; someone noted a northwoods feel - I couldn't agree more
+ Prompt seating on the outdoor patio

- Outdoor patio is *tiny* and has far too many tables/chairs. They should remove a few tables, or think about changing the size/configuration of them, because once you're seated, you can't move anywhere. Servers had to shimmy between everyone to get food/drinks out

- A huge menu; far too many items. How many variations of a fajita or burrito can you have? Answer: too many.
+ Decent pricing
- Draft beer options not listed anywhere; servers didn't offer up options
- Ordered a Tecate, received a Corona Light with no explanation or correction
- Sangria was very buttery tasting (not in a good way)

- Servers seemed very confused. We had three different servers over the course of our 45-minute visit. First guy said it was his second day and didn't know anything; second guy said first guy went home early so he was taking over. Third girl was good, but first two servers must not have filled her in on anything. First server got order wrong; third server had to correct it and then come back to tell us that they were out of several items we had ordered. Just very odd.

- Food wasn't anything great. Asada tacos were chewy and flavorless. Meat tasted and felt very greasy. Chicken salad was decent; the chicken was by far the best option.

Not sure I'd race back to visit again.
