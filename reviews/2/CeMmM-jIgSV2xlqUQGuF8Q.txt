I really wanted to like this place prior to going here however, I can't. The customer service and environment are good but the food is dry and tasteless. I've eaten here 4 times thinking each time it might be better but, unfortunately it is not. My advice is to reduce the menu of stale frozen dishes and have fresh dishes even if it means having less items on the menu to choose from.
