I've been thinking about joining Yelp for a long time, and never got around to it. Eating here got me to take the plunge. The tacos are really pretty good, but the atmosphere gave me a headache. I ordered a grilled veggie taco and a grilled fish taco, both of which were decent. The tortillas themselves were bland, but the fillings were good basics and Baja-style salad toppings, and seemed balanced. My vegetables and fish were hot, tasted fresh, and the fish was well-spiced. My husband thought similarly about his beef tacos, though my grilled veggies wanted a bit more kick. Their guacamole and queso (which they gave us free when we ordered the guac, nice) were both good, too -- fresh and flavorful.

But... We were the only people there at 4 on a holiday afternoon, and about 10 minutes after we ordered, heard someone behind the counter say "did someone start that order?" Riiight. The decor didn't help either -- it's extremely yellow and bright, and they were playing loud Britney on the sound system. As I waited for my food, I tried to figure out whether Fuzzy's was annoying, or whether I was tired from shopping. Probably both, but I would've dwelled on it less without the long wait.

I'd say Fuzzy's is more of a taco sports bar than anything else, but the food is -- as a previous reviewer said -- decent, and definitely a good value. If you like that kind of atmosphere, Baja style tacos, and don't want to spend much, Fuzzy's is worth a shot. If you want a quiet chat or a touch more innovation, try Tex Tubb's. If you're looking for authentic Mexican, check out Guadalajara or El Pastor.
