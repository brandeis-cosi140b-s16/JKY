meh. came here for a quick work lunch which turned into a bit longer than we really liked work lunch. no one was manning the hostess station so we had to find someone and ask if we could seat ourselves. after sitting for about 10 min someone finally came around and brought us menus and took our drink order. i noticed that there were only two people working the whole place (bartender and waitress) and that communication with each other was not exactly their forte. 

yes, i ordered a burger (guacamole, no bun, no cheese) at the mexican place. dont shoot me for it. i just didnt feel like a food coma this afternoon would make me exceptionally productive. it was just ok. wasn't a huge fan of the fries.

overall a lackluster lunch that didnt impress. i still dont really understand why it was recommended by someone from work. never trusting them again.
