Go there every week, for the last couple months. Service just gets worst and worst. We sat down with my boyfriends parents, who arrived before us. And it took the waitress 30 minutes to even realize we were there and order our drinks. When she arrived, you could just tell she hated her job and didn't want to be there. An hour goes by and finally our food came out, while all of us have been done with our drinks for quite some time now. I'm sorry but this restaurant goes down hill every single time we go there. By now we haven't even gone in for 2-3 weeks now. They need more HAPPY servers and another cook or something.
