So I was excited to eat here because of the reviews.  I was believing the hype that it was going to be great.  First the workers were rude horrible customer service very disappointed there.  And the food wasn't great it was ok I have had better Mexican food and for the price to me it was a little bit expensive. Over all i did not like this place and would not come back.
