This is the second Baja Fresh location I've been to. Like all the others places I visited in downtown Phoenix, it lacked people. The store wasn't busy at all, so I guess that's a good thing? 

I ordered the garlic lime shrimp tacos on corn tortilla with rice and beans, and I wasn't impressed at all. There was no flavor to any of the food, I had to drench everything in salsa. But I'll never know if other items on the menu are any good...

The food wasn't that great, but the workers there were really nice and helpful, and even gave my friends and me coupons---an incentive to return, I suppose.
