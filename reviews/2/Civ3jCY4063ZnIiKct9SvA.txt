This is more of a 2.5 rating but I just can't give this place 3 stars.

Unlike the other Cabo I went to at Santa Fe, this Cabo at Boulder just seemed super off.  Kind of slow customer service from the start, long waits to get food. Yada Yada Yada.

The think that irked me a bit was that when I got the unlimited tacos, they told me I can only order 1 kind of taco and can't mix it up.  So I ended up grabbing 3 shredded beef tacos.  

They were fairly on par.  Then I ordered 2 chicken tacos since I was trying to make myself vomit by the end of the night and instead of the shredded chicken I would get at the boulder station, it was just chicken chunks, no real flavor.  And mixing it with their flavorless rice didn't boost anything.

I'm not gonna knock on the chips, I love the chips and salsa but overall that won't make me give them a 3 star rating.

Conditions For Me To Return:
- Someone pays for me
or
- Randomly drunk and felt like making sub-par decisions
or
- Really bored and have comp dollars and want to feel classy as opposed to eating Taco Bell
