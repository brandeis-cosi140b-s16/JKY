My son and I came here for fathers day dinner waited to be seated for 15 min nobody acknowledged us even being there, I watched 2 server's sitting at the bar laughing and talking. Also 2 other customers who said they had been there for 2hr+ service was slow and the food was not as good as it use to be since they changed managers. Very sad this was one of my favorite restaurants.
