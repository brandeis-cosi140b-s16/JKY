I asked for a bacon potatoes egg and cheese burrito.... I ate 1/4 of my buritto, eggs, cheese, and huge pieces of ham??? Like huge, that wasn't bacon.... no potatoes.... I don't understand how hard it is to make this burrito.... I'd suggest going to the other place down the street on 35th ave... this place always screws up my order... oh and their veggie burrito is soup in a tortilla....
