I am really a big fan of Caf√© Rio, but NOT this location. I have visited this location 6-10 times since living in the neighborhood, and I've noticed a serious decline in service and food quality (especially when compared to other locations in the valley). The employees don't wear nametags most likely because of their poor customer service skills and lack of interest in their jobs (including the manager, a dark haired guy, about 6'2.) The food quality today totally grossed me out-- the lettuce was wilted, guac was brown and other ingredients just seemed old. Definitely NOT worth the nearly $10 price tag for (1) salad... Unfortunately, I'll be adding this restaurant to my "places not to go" list.
