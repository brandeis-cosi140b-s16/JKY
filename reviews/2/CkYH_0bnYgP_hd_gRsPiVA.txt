Can't say I am impressed with this place. While I know people who have enjoyed it, my experiences have been poor. My buritos have been nothing but beans and lettuce when I order beef.  Didn't taste great. Everyone else didn't seem too pleased with their food either. My dad ordered guacamole, and it came out high. He thought maybe it was a big thing of it. No. a little serving came out. It was ridiculous. 

I decided to try them again, cause people keep telling me they are good. I went in and tried to order. I was told they didn't know english ( "No Ingl√©s" ), and after struggling trying to make a order for some tacos and buritos, I raised the white flag, and went to leave. Some one past me as I went through the door, I hear in perfect english from the woman at the counter. "Oh, hey! How are you!"
I honestly don't understand why I have had such trouble eating there, but I have given up.
