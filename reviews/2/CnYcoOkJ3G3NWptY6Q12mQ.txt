Toto's is close to my work, so I stop in occasionally for lunch.

They usually have a lunch buffet which has a decent, but limited, selection.

I generally order of the menu. Most recently I ordered a lunch combo with a chicken taco and chile relleno. It was okay but not great. My biggest complaint was that the chile relleno was only lukewarm.
