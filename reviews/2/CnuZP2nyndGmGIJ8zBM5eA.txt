Taxco is the latest incarnation of restaurant in this space, but that may not mean it is the best. It isn't bad, by any means - in fact, the service is actually quite good. The food, however, is a bit lacking. Even the fajitas do not feel like they want to come to the party, as the cast iron skillet doesn't want to sizzle. You can put your hand on directly on there without any protection (not suggested in all circumstances).

It is hard to put my finger on the exact problem - everything tasted okay, it just had no pop to it - almost like the cook(s) forgot to add seasoning to everything. About the only thing that had any flavor the night we tried was the salsa that came with the chips - and it was not so hot that it killed off everything else, so I don't think that was it.

Since they just opened, maybe they haven't received their seasonings yet.
