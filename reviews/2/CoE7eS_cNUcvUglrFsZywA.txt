Food and Drink
1. Cheese crisps ROCK, especially the "cheese only" option.
2. Main courses are okay, nothing special
3. White sangria was very bizarre.  Tasted more like fruit punch than wine. Glad I had a sample before I ordered.
4. Happy Hour-- appetizers (including cheese crisps!) are 1/2 off.

Service
1. Wait staff appears to be very inexperienced.  After ordering, my server said, "there has been an accident in the kitchen.  Someone cut their finger".  I was expecting to be told my Blanco cheese crisp was going to have a special red sauce, but then he continued, "I have to take him to the hospital, so Buddy will take care of you".

Atmosphere
1. Nice open restaurant with awesome patio.  Great for the cooler weather, built in heaters throughout.
2. HUGE bar in the center of the restaurant, great for those creepy old Scottsdale guys who like to check out the chicks.

Misc
1. Their plates are so heavy, they can be used for either Frisbee Golf or as a weapon.
2.  I have never seen so many trendy gay men in my life (they were either gay or severly metro sexual)
