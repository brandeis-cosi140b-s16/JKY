The first word that comes to mind is DEAFENING!!!!
The place is just to LOUD. They pump the music up above the chatter and of course the people just YELL above the music. It continues like that until no one can hear anything.
The food was very good, but if I'm going to drop $150, I want to be able to hear what the people at my table are saying! I will not return because of this. Even our waiter said he couldn't hear us when we tried to place our order. In my opinion, if you want to be a restaurant, be a restaurant. If you want to be a noisy Uptown club, then choose that. But you can't be both and have your restaurant customers unable to enjoy themselves. Sorry Vida, you lost me and my money.
