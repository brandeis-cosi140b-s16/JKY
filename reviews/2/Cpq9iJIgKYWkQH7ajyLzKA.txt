Good atmosphere, decent food, service was good not that great. Plus it was too expensive. I was mislead on the "Happy Hour" rules of this restaurant. Outside the menu read Happy Hour 5-7 pm so I thought this meant for the whole restaurant. I was wrong this only meant the bar area. No where did it say only for the bar area. I spent $12 on nachos that my boyfriend didn't even like. I did not leave happy.
