Sat and waited for an outside table at the bar and experienced a woman bartender with a huge chip!  The waiteress made up for the bad bartender however the food was mediocre at best!  They charge for chips and salsa and the salsa is serves in a dixie cup sized plastic cup. I had the fish tacos which were soggy like they had been warmed up in a microwave with no flavor what so ever, The guacamole was like wall paper paste and the black beans and rice were served cold and lumpy.  Im truly upset they have let this place slide, I use to dream about their cowboy burrito...They need to get back to basics!
