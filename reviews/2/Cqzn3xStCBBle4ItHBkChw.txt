Qdoba was recommended through a co-worker who assured me they were "just as good as Chipotle". Well, being just across Thomas and 10-15 minutes closer made it infinitely more convenient. Almost walkable, if you don't mind getting flattened by the new Light Rail whizzing by. As Stephen Wright says, "Anywhere is walking distance....if you have the time."

Well......about halfway through my fajita ranchera burrito, I'm already sadly disappointed. Taste, quality and price are all below my precious Holy Sepulchre of the Chipotle temple. 

First off, I decided to try the fajita, since it's what I get from (angels sing) Chipotle, so it would make the best comparison. I always ask for, and get, some extra peppers/onions for a perfect, albeit "Chain", burrito. So I was a little shocked by the "We'll have to charge you for that" response. 

For about 4 pieces of pepper and onion. No joke. Hard times, Qdoba??

The rice is thinner and smaller than Chipotle's, and the burrito instantly fell apart. I guess they need to send their employess to the same rolling-and-folding school that Chipotle includes in their tuition reimbursement benefits.

The final price was over $9, 2 bucks more then I pay at Chipotle for the same - no, better - food.

Sorry, Qdoba, Jeffrey doesn't want burritos with good taste, he wants burritos that taste good! (and cost less)
