This was my first time ordering online at Chipotle. When I got to the restaurant there was nowhere telling me where to pick up my online order and I ended up standing in the lunch line just to have someone tell me to go to the front of the line for the cash registers were to pick up my online order. I would suggest they get some signs letting people know where to go. The whole purpose of ordering online was to save time, but instead I ended up wasting it.
