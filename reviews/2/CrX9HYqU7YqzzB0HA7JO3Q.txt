I ordered the caldo de camarones, found it tasty but then an hour later, I had the MSG-overload effect. You know... the sensation after you eat Chinese food that you just can not get enough to drink? Soooo THIRSTY! The camarones, too, were as tough as old leather. I think they were in there just to flavor the soup, not meant to be eaten. The pastor taco was so cute - was about three inches long. Was ok, not the best I've ever had. Also tried the Ricas Cemita since it was highly touted on here. So, its like a sloppy joe with out the sloppy. Meh, ok. Did not blow my skirt up. Would be 50% better if they used good n' fresh buns.  

Look, I've had roll-your-eyes-back amazing Mexican food, from little hole-in-the-wall joints where I'm the only gringa within three miles. This is not it. What does perplex me is, with all the south-of-the-border folks here, legally and not, why the hell doesn't Vegas have some of THAT level of Mexican/Oaxacan/Salvadorean food options? I have to go to Santa Barbara for truly amazing gorditas. I have to go to San Jose for effin' phenomenal pastor "devil" tacos. That kind of food makes you want to drive three hours out of your way to enjoy. I'm left stunned with all the five star ratings with this joint. Have to assume our collective level for what makes real 5-star food has dipped. I it like an LA "4" is a Vegas "10?"

Back to Compita and the plus-es of the experience... service was nice, prompt and pleasant. The place was as clean as possible. The salsa bar was arctic-ly cold so all the goods were nice and fresh. They kept a good eye on the salsa bar and kept it stocked and clean. The caldo is enough to feed 2-3 people. The cemita will kill any hunger within three bites - man that thing was crammed full of meat chunks. (Quantity is not a problem here). Also, parking is easy, and its next to a panderia if you have a sweet tooth.
