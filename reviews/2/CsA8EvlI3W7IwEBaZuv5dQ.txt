There is nothing impressive about the food here. 
The prices are kind of insane considering the food isn't very good.
Even the rice,beans,and salsa sucked. I mean,how do you manage to mess THAT up?

We ordered oysters,menudo,camarones a la diabla, and some kind of fish filet. Taste-wise,It ranged from gross to eh.

The service,however,was good.
We weren't ignored ever so I'm giving them the second star.

I'll probably never go back though.
