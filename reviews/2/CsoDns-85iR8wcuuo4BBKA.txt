I didn't really expect to eat good Mexican Food in a sketchy hotel off the strip in Vegas. My assumptions were not wrong.  The food was average.  Nothing to celebrate or recommend but a decent meal in a hotel where the other option is a buffet or Jonny Rockets to go.

The staff was extremely slow and didn't think about the next step at any time.  We were constantly asking for my water, chips and for them to take our order.  I don't enjoy restuarants where I have to do more work to get them to do their job. 

Granted, this place was a nice escape from the outside environment of a gross off the strip hotel. But please, don't expect much
