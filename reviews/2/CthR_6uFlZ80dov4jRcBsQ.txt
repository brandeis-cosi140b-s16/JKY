Food is ok.  Depending where you sit you may have a decent view of the strip but the prices are outrageous for mediocre food.  $19 for three tacos?  $10 for a bowl of soup?  Luckily it was early and I was drinking soda.  Who knows what a beer costs.  I get the whole being on the strip thing but the prices are way too much to make it worth the effort.  We had a really nice server and he was helpful with our selections but I doubt I will go back next time.
