The only reason this location gets 2 stard is because i luv Chipotle! I use to have this at least 2 times a week, but now its way less, and the only reason is for the disorganization at this particular location! Like a few other yelpers have stated the service here sucks. On multiple trips i have waited in line for 30+ mins cuz they ran out of stuff on the line and just not efficient. I work in downtown and go to the location at cityscape and that is a model location. Lines are crazy long but the line is always moving. I was soo pissed one day cuz i waited and waited then they got my order wrong and gave me attitude when i mentioned the mistake, so i went online and wrote their corporate office. I basically stated they should look into this location cuz it could do soo much better. Gotta say i have been back to this chipotle and nothing has changed :( so if ur craving and dont wnt to deal drive to the one on 99th!
