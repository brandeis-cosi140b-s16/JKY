I went there on a Friday night with a friend of mine for Happy Hour. We both loved the atmosphere, food and drinks were great, staff was very friendly. It was pretty slow for a Friday night but they had some good Happy Hour specials. Wish some of their food was on the Happy Hour special. 

I ended up going back Saturday night with a group of people. Bad idea! The place was very busy but we were all having a great time. The two bars up front were pretty busy so a few of us decided to go to the bar in the back by the pool to get a second round of drinks since it wasn't as busy back there. There was only one person waiting to order drinks from the bartender and a few other people around us. We sat down at the bar and waited for the bartender to come up to us. We sat there for about 10 minutes trying to make contact with her but she continued to ignore us. Finally, she came around and one of my friend's said "Excuse me, we've been waiting 10 minutes, can we order a drink please?" She was a total bitch and responded back nasty to my friend and said basically that she did not give a shit how long we were waiting. She turns to me and asks me what we want and I tell her and she looks at me at says "That's it?" We sit there another minute in disgust waiting for our drinks and she still hasn't started to make it so we start to walk away. One of our friend's asks why we don't have our drinks and we tell him what happened. He walks up to her and asks where our drinks are and she says "F**k you." I could not believe this. I was so angry and pissed off that someone could treat their customers like this. We also heard her being rude to another customer. 

I will never go back there again. My experience with a rude nasty bartender has put a bad taste in my mouth for that place and next time will be spending my money elsewhere.
