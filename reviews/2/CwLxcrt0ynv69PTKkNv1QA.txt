Please stop referring to this place as a "California" taco shop, the only thing Cali about this place is it's reference to a certain drug in it's name.  The place looks like a tatoo parlor, nothing "surfer" about it.  The food was just eh and they do not even have a salsa bar.  NO self-respecting real mexican joint goes without a salsa bar. 

I ordered the beef flautas and a cheese quesadilla.  This is comman fare in any mexican stand.  The flautas were actually very good, generous amounts of meat in them and happily not over cooked.  They were crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside.. but not very flavorful, you definitely need guacamole or salsa with them.  The quesadilla was a flop.  Their first attempt at my quesadilla resulted in one that was so over cooked that the line cook could not cut it with his knife.  He had to saw into it and he ACTUALLY thought he was going to serve this to me.  I looked at the cashier and said, "don't you think that's over done".  She immediately told the cook to make another one.  Take two - this time the cashier stood over the grill and cut it up herself for me.  I think the problem here is they are making the quesadilla's in a panini grill and it toughens the tortilla before the cheese melts fully.  Any decent cook knows to make them on the grill and flip them, this way the tortilla doesn't have a chance to dry out and the cheese has time to melt.

I'll wait to go back to San Diego and have real mexican food rather than go back to this place.

NOT TO FORGET:  A plain cheese quesadilla is 5 bucks, WTF?
