Considering the high reviews on the Web, this restaurant must be under new management... Every ingredient tastes like it came out of a can, nothing tastes fresh or homemade. Every type of meat was dry and tasteless, while the beans, rice and produce felt like they opened the cans days before. Luckily, meals are inexpensive... The meal wasn't terrible, but easily forgettable. I can't think of a reason to dine here again considering the caliber of restaurants in the area.
