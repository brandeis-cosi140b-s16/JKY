I think this Mexican restaurant/sports bar is a great concept, but boy was this a big miss. 

When I walked in, I noticed there was a private party in the immediate bar/room to the right of the entrance. If I remember accurately, there were about 3 TVs at the bar in there. The crowd here is a little bit older, but everyone looked like they were there to have a great time - MILFs, DILFs, and cougars included. 

I went up to the host stand where I waited for almost 5 minutes. Many servers walked by, but no one bothered to help, or tell me someone was on their way to seat me. Once I did sit down, I waited for about 15 minutes for my friend without being greeted by a server. Once she arrived, we waited another 20 minutes before my friend went to grab a waitress. The waitress apologized and told us she didn't realize she had our table as well. I've worked in a few restaurants through college - long enough to know that things sometimes get mixed up, but when you have a table waiting without food our drinks for 30+ minutes, you should probably go ask them if they need any help! 

The food isn't worth talking about, so I won't.
