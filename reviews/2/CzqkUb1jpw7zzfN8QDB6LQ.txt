This is a cool place in a great location. I've been a few times and really, really want to say good things but I just can't. The main problem is the service or lack thereof. The second is the food. They are trying but just aren't there yet.

The drinks are good and they try at making them special. But on two different visits I had their Bloody Mary. The first was great with appropriate spices and garnish. The second visit it was undrinkable. There must have been half a glass of hot sauce and maybe a 1/8th oz of vodka, no garnishes. Everyone at the table tried it and heads exploded. Sent them back but the bartender refused to remake them. 

Of course, this was after the waiter spilled two Bloody Mary's and a margarita in my lap. Took about 10 minutes for the first round and another 10 minutes for the second. He said of course he would comp the drinks but still charged us for them. Had to explain to him that we wouldn't pay for the spilled drinks and what comp in the replacement drinks meant. He thought not charging us for the spilled drinks was a comp. Had to ask for napkins for cleanup, had to ask for silverware...had to ask for everything. 

I had the breakfast burrito and it was dry. Only eggs and sausage or whatever meat they include, no salsa, no cheese. I queried the waiter and he went and checked but said that is the way they make them.  My dining companion had the chilaquiles on two separate occasions. The first time they were excellent. The second time they did not resemble anything like the first, smaller portion, less presentation, dry and bland. 

I love Sylvia's Barrio Cafe but she needs to spend more time and attention on her newest place. I can't justify a return visit yet.
