I tried their combo plate with fish taco, chile relleno, refried beans, and rice ($7.99) + an extra $2.00 for the chile relleno & fish taco.  I highly recommend against these two menu items cause it was disgusting, to say the least.  I didn't eat any of it!  I've had a lot of different types of chile relleno, most being stuffed with goodness, but this one was flat wrapped in some egg type bread batter nastiness, and topped with cheese.  I don't know what it was, but it had a type of omelette texture and was kind of rubbery/chewy.  Can't explain, it was  gross!  Fish taco was very bland, lacking any flavor.  It was a few pieces of fried soggy fish, with lettuce, cheese and a spoon full of mayo.

Pass, pass, pass!!

BF had a burrito, and it was huge!!  This will fill you up if you're super hungrrry, but didn't really care for it either.  Everything was mashed up inside.  When I have a burrito, there are usually visible layers of the meat, beans, rice, cheese, etc.  This burrito was just stuffed with a blob of mashed up meat, sauce, and whatever else was in there. Passss!

Also had the carne asada tacos; it was the only thing I liked.  The meat was flavorful, tender, and was the only thing worth paying for ($2.99, but still kinda pricey for a taco).  This alone gets 3 stars.  

Service?  I walked in, wasn't greeted, so I walked up to the counter, grabbed menus and sat down.  I wasn't sure if I was supposed to order and sit down, or if it was table service?  I noticed other people sitting with the menu, so I just took a seat.  She took forever to take our order.  We got up to ask for the check, ask for to-go containers, and we also walked back up to pay?? Not a big deal, but the woman running the front of the house wasn't very hospitable.
