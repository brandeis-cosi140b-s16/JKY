The only good thing about this dining experience was the actual taco. The rest of the food was blah, including my cocktail (beans, rice, chips, dip)
The restaurant wasn't full, but was so loud that it was hard to have a conversation. Our waiter wasn't very friendly or forthcoming with service (we had to ask for water and then leave the money on the table because he was busy talking to coworkers)
I picked Pasqual's because it seems to be a favorite of a lot of Madisonians but I can't figure out why. I wouldn't recommend it!
