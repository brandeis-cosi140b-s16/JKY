Not the best customer service. They are so slow no matter how many people are in line. Plus it seems like they are always out of something that's so standard on the menu. One time they were out of beans, another time you had to wait on steak and veggies. One girl actually yelled at my fiancé because he asked for beans and she didn't hear him. When she passed his food to the guy next to her, he asked for beans again. When the guy started to reach over her to get beans, she chewed out my fiancé saying he never asked for it. Like really!? Is that such a issue? One time I went through the line and I actually waited for someone to cash me out. There was no one at the register. When someone finally came to the register, he rushed me and didn't give me a receipt. I asked for one and he handed me one and it was someone else's receipt even though I was the last paying customer to ask for it. Weird and suspicious.
