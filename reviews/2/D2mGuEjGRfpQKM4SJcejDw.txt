Full disclosure, I came to The Yard with intentions of eating at the Culinary Dropout... But it was a 90 min wait and we had a full party. Barrio could seat us right away (not typically a good sign, but we decided to take a chance). 

Well, we shouldn't have been excited to get sat right away, because it was still an hour until we actually got our food. And their menu is severely limited: only half a dozen or so entrees, and cocktail menu is just several different spins on the Margarita. Not terribly complex or difficult to pump out. Plus the place was only half full of guests. We should've got our food much quicker. Very disappointing. Especially since it is Mexican. Mexican food has about four basic ingredients - it should never take this long to prepare.

And then we finally received the food; it didn't improve. Entrees sizes are dismal. I'm talking ridiculously small, for outrageous price ($23 for sliver of skirt steak, GTFO). I'm not one to expect Claim Jumper style portions. But an entree should not be mistaken for an appetizer. The food itself was ok. So they get an extra star for that. But that is where my generosity ends.  So much potential wasted.

To top it all off. You know those cheap Madonna candles that they sell at the dollar store? Yeah, those are littered all around the tables. In the middle of serving, one of our waiters knocked a candle over and spilled hot wax all over our toddler and our food. Yay.

F- this place. Yeah I said it.  
Most of the servers were trying to please (except for candle fail incident)... But you can only do so much when the menu,  kitchen and planning blow.

They've only been open few weeks... so maybe they'll improve. Good luck.
