we had been frequenting this location for many years (probably 60+ visits), but we will never go there again. . it has gone so downhill...i agree with the earlier review that stated that it should be closed down. it seems like every surface in this place is dirty, and the service is exactly what the opposite of friendly is. you would think that after giving this place so much business, after being regular customers for so many years, that we would be treated nicely...not the case. we were treated so rudely the last time we went (by an awful lady who works the drive-thru window late at night), that we vowed to never go there again.  there is a new location over on priest and washington that has much better condiments, is a much nicer restaurant, and has a far friendlier staff.
