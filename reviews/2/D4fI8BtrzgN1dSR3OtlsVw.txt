Used to be a loyal customer... Until we went on a Friday night. Disappointing service. We did not get greeted until 10 minutes later. Finally 20 minutes in we got seated. In hopes of a great experience we stayed. No one came over, other tables got chips and salsa before we did. Finally ordered and the food took so long that we change it to go. Got home and finally anxious to eat, I was very disappointed by the quality considering their prices.
