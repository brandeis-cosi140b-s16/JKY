I have eaten at Chipotle before, and the food and customer service is usually great. Today, I went to the Chipotle in Casa Grande, and the service was horrible. I walked in and there were eight employees on the floor working. Four of which, were eating, and the other four were goofing off. It is one thing to have your lunch break when a customer is not waiting to be helped, and its another to not act annoyed to pause your "break" to help a paying customer.  I work in the food industry, and would have never treated a customer or a person for that matter in that way.  When a customer comes into an establishment, you do not make your own food over the customers, especially while your on the clock.  I was extremely disappointed to have received this kind of service after spending a good amount of money there. It makes the management on duty also look bad, because almost your entire staff that your paying to work are not doing their jobs and are acting as if customers are "interrupting" when we come there to eat. At least while your stuffing your face with a burrito while handling customers food, but a smile on your face and not be rude to make up for the disgusting customer service you just provided.
