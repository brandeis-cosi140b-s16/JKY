More mediocre food at McCarran airport. Moe's is located at the end of terminal A. I didn't think it was as bad as other reviewers. I got the junior sized burrito, which was plenty of food for me. The chicken was seasoned well, but was dry. It was filled with mediocre rice and beans and all the typical add-ons that you would find at a fast food place similar to Chipotle. The burrito also came with a pile of stale chips.

Service was slow because there was only one person working. So, she had to assemble the food and ring it up. It was pricey, of course, because you're trapped in the airport and don't have many options.
