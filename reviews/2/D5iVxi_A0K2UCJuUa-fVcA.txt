This place is just a Mad Mex clone, and Mad Mex kinda sucks. I popped into this location for a quick lunch. The food was mediocre. It took way too long for me to get service even though there were very few people there. 

This place is supposed to be mexican, I guess. They don't have Mezcal, though. I've been to local dive bars who have better tequila selection. Steel Cactus is a half-baked concept. The only positive is that the space looks pretty cool. Staff was fine.
