OK Mex,but not just feels cheap.

Not open for lunch and the waitstaff would rather be doing something else.

Why cheap you say?

I went there a year ago and sat at the bar and noticed a very loud fan in the beverage cooler (like 70 or 80 db loud).
Went back 2 months later.Still broke. 
And 3 months later,nope,still broke.

Last time I was there,it was finally fixed,but this is a sit sown restaurant in a very large casino and you can't get that fixed for nearly a year?

Man ,talk about cheap!
