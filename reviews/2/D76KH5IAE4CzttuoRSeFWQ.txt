The food was really good. Not something to die over, but your typical mexican food. I have been here multiple times over the last four years. The last three times I've been there the food was okay, but the service was beyond terrible! The busboy who brought us chips was rude. The waitress was not interested in serving us. Honestly this was the last chance for this restaurant the third time with terrible service was just enough to call it quits. I have talked to the manager about the awful service each time and he does not seem to be interested in fixing the problem. I'm not sure if the manager beats the employees before they go out to the table, but they are always in a terrible mood.
