I have eaten at other Garcia's before, but this new location isn't as good.  I ordered a grilled sirloin burrito and the steak tasted rancid.  The server replaced it without issue with my second choice of Monterey Chicken.  

The kid's meal came with fries that were dripping with oil and soggy.  

I wouldn't eat here again.
