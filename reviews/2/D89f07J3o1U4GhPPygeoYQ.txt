I managed to fish the first bug out of my margarita, but when I saw the second one floating there, enjoying my much anticipated beverage, it had to go back.  Don't get me wrong, I appreciated the fact that they added a free protein boost to my drink, but I like to enjoy my margaritas on my own, thank you very much.

There's something that's just not right about this place.  The service is very friendly, but my menu was wet and smelled like someone had tossed their cookies right on it.  My friend's nachos just tasted...funky and the vegetables that came with my bean and cheese burro were so dry, they were cracked.  Combine that with the fact that everything tasted oddly like cardboard and I was feeling like I was on an episode of Kitchen Nightmares.

I'd say that maybe this place is great when you're hammered, but yeah, I really wouldn't want to be there then either.
