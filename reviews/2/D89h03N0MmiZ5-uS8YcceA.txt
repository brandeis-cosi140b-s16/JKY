Como se dice "meh"? Aunt Chilada's sucks mucho. Lets start with a very average margarita for $12, an $11 Mojito made with a mix, and chips with a salsa that could call 
any supermarket aisle home. Entrees are way over priced for a very mediocre offering.  I always clean off my plate, seriously concerned with the plight of starving children in third world countries, but on this day even that thought couldn't get me to finish. The tortillas were horrible, how the hell do you screw up a tortilla? Service was also sub par, bordering on rude. Never again, or as the say in Mexico, nunca mas.
