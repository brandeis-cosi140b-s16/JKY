We stopped by here while checking out the hotel and casino during our Vegas trip. Decor was awesome and we chose to sit on the patio which was overlooking an awesome pool. Our waitress came by and was different, not sure what was her deal but she couldn't hear anything we said. We ordered a margarita and a mojito. Margarita came and no mojito. Five minutes later she came by and I asked about the mojito. Apparently, she didn't hear my order and didn't apologize just walked away. The wait for the mojito was not worth it, it had Malibu rum in it and tasted like sun tan lotion. My mistake for not reading the ingredients. I ordered ahi tuna tacos, they were great minus the sweet fruit salsa on top. My bf ordered shrimp enchiladas and was brought shrimp tacos, oh well he ate them anyway and they were good. We didn't complain just wanted our check and to go somewhere else without our awkward waitress. If she would of asked if we wanted more to drink, we probably would have but she was too busy getting others orders wrong probably. Food was ok, service not so much.
