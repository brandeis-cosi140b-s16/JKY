It seems not too busy,and my steak burrito, was pretty dry, I guess it need a little guacamole or something , which was extra,,the burrito it self, was pricey than at a good taqueria, it was salt and just ok,,, would of better off getting tacos maybe? Service was prompt and friendly, funny they offer white rice if you did not want Spanish rice? No thx I was probably better off get a sandwich at Earl, will not be going back to chronics...
