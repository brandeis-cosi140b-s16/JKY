Sometimes when you're driving to or from Tucson, you must stop by the I-10 Del Harris aka Del Taco.  Unfortunately, this one takes the cake for "what the heck is going on here?" I've been here a couple times, and every time I order something, they have me pull up to a parking spot and wait for Christmas before bringing the food out?!?  Excuse me?  This occurs even if I'm the only one in the drive through.  Del Taco, send some execs, and get this joint straightened out!  It gets 2 stars because Macho Fries soothes the soul.
