I got a curly brown hair in my black bean salsa here at San Felipe's.  I took Pops here for lunch and his lunch special featuring enchiladas, was just that -- enchiladas.  No rice, no beans, no eff you. Nothing.

I opted for the BBQ Pollo sandwich with avocado and "smashed papas"  basically a whole potato chunked up and fried.  The sandwich was pretty average.  

The digs here are very Chuy's-like -- like your typical Mexican beach bar with festive chotchkies everywhere.  The crowd here was bleak -- maybe about 5 others in the whole place on a Thursday lunch hour.  Upon telling our server about the hair she handled the situation, but wasn't as apologetic as she probably could have been.  Lunch for us two was about $20. Two stars.
