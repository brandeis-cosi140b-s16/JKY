Food was good but....... Service was horrible!! We received 1 basket of chips and then finally on the third time asking for more she told us they were out of chips. How do you run out of chips?!  And she let us order guacamole knowing there was no chips. Then it took 20 mins to get our check once we asked and we had to yell at her again. We are still waiting here another ten mins later wait for her to run out cards. Worse service I've ever had!!!!!
