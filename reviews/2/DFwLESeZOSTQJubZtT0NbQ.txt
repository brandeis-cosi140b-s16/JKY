Very disappointing. Margaritas were very good and service was fine. But the food?  Overpriced and not good. We started with the duck confit empanadas.  The filling was nice but the sauce was way too sweet and then there was the crust.  You needed a steak knife to cut the thing!  We ordered the pulled pork tacos for two dinner (32.00).  It took quite a while and when it came the tortillas were very small and extremely doughy.  The pork was fatty and just not very good.  

On top of everything else, it is very dark so it's hard to see what you are eating.  I used my iPhone flashlight app so we could read the menus.  

Really wanted to like the place but the quality was not there.  Definitely would never go back.  One start is for service and the other is for the drinks.  That's it.
