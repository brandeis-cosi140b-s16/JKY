Mexican food is easy to find around here. I will go to one of the many other local establishments from now on. I have been to this location twice because I did not think it was fair to leave a review on a single experience. Today I went back and things weren't much better. The carne asada clearly is cooked days in advance and is just scooped out on an as needed basis. 
A little personality from the woman working the counter would be nice. I am sorry that we inconvenienced you to order food. 

Prices are high, portions are large, flavor is fair. You be the judge. I've had far worse and I've also had much better.
