It should have been a sign that the food was not going to be good when they were too lazy to get the lights  turned on the outside of the building... My French fries were mushy and barely warm. Better referred as on their way to being mashed potatoes... Tacos didn't taste much better!!! The employees were all standing around with their thumbs in their butts wearing sweaters with hoodies over there heads. Unprofessional if you ask me. On the upside my soda was refreshing. Thank goodness that didn't get messed up...
