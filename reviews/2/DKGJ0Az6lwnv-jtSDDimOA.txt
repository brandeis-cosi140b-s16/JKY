Good airport food, not necessarily good service. I asked for my waiter and the woman literally yelled from one side of the restaurant to the other "Jeffrey!!!". A little embarrassing. I ordered the fish and chips, the fries were stale and left on the plate. THe fish was good. Not amazing but with hot sauce I enjoyed it enough to give this 2 stars. I asked what specials or nice cocktails they had and the server told me to just order a regular drink.... so I ordered water. Overall, it it was a quick meal before my flight,  I wouldn't go back though. The Wendys next door probably would have been a better option if I wanted a quick meal that was more tasty.
