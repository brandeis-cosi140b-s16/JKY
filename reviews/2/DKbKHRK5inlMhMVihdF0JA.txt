Let me start off with: THE NAME IS HILARIOUS! Haha

The decor is kind of run down. Chipped paint. Old tables. They need a paint job. 

Food- Good. I got the sampler. It had tostadas, a tamale, chicken chimichangas, beef chimichangas, beef tacos, beans, and rice. 
-The green tamale had too much manteca (lard), not enough flavor.
-The tostadas were okay. 
-the beef tacos were good. 
-the rice was good. 
-the beans: blegh. Flavorless. 
-the best thing on that plate were the chimichangas! Yummers!

They give you endless chips and salsa and that's great! I just wish the salsa was spicier and wasn't pure tomato. 

Service was good, but they kind of took a long time. I love the music! Affordable prices. Cute place but not my first choice.
