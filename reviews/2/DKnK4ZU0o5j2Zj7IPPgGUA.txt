I wanted Chilaquillas , I asked if they had it and she said yes. I ordered it with green chilli and she she OK. I was obviously interrupting her texting session.  What I got was soggy chips under green chili. It was funny.  The green chili was good though.  Everyone else ordered burritos, I bet they were delicious.  Just stick to the burritos and you will be fine. Also don't ask for a small soda because all they have is medium and large and they will look at you like an idiot. Lol!
