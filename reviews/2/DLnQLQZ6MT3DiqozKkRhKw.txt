My son has OT in the same parking lot, so I have come to this place a few times for lunch. First thing that turned me off was a huge tip jar they have in your face when you order. They have a sign saying that they prefer cash, and that 'credit card and debit card fees break small businesses'. Huh? The first thing I ate here was shrimp fajitas, which with drink was about $15. Very small portions and not worth it. Chips are ok, but the salsa and picante sauce are in squirt bottles...and cold as heck. If you want any kind of side, it costs a dollar or more. I got a burrito the next time I came here (it was good, the Healthy Bean one) and it is 5.50, but if you want sour cream, guacamole, and chicken (they try to press it on you) that will be another nearly 5 bucks. It's good but not very big. Drinks are in small styrofoam cups and cost 2 bucks. They have a sign saying NO OUTSIDE DRINKS. I can see why, they have a racket going here on their overpriced drinks. The straw that broke the camel's back is that I waited in line behind two people who couldn't make up their mind for twenty minutes, and the woman behind the counter tried to help the woman BEHIND me first. WTF? Not great service, food is ok with skimpy portions, cheapo atmosphere, TIP JAR in your face...skip this place.
