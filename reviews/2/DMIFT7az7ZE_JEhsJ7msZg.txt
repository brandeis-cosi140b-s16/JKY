This was a bustling little restaurant that I dropped in to get a takeout dinner. Very pleasant and friendly personnel, and my chili relleno/taco combo was good, except for the side of rice which was dry and under cooked. The salsa was thick, tasty, and medium hot, and there was an accompanying warm flour tortilla. Overall good, but not exceptional.
There is no excuse for undercooked rice; this is a rookie mistake and should have been caught before leaving the kitchen. I give them a zero for quality check on this one.
Pros: Right in the downtown area, with good atmosphere, friendly service, and plenty of on and off street parking. Alcohol served. Portion size and value OK.
Cons:As above
