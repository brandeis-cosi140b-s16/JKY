Decent chips and salsa, the free app was a nice touch but way under staffed for a Friday happy hour in the bar. Bartender was swamped and was the only one servicing the large bar area. Food was ok.and prices were not too bad (no food specials for happy hour). Wish there were other local options in the area.
