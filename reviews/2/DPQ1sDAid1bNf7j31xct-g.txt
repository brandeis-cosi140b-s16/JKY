Been to this place 3 times, this morning being the 3rd.  My turn-off to this place is 3 fold.  First is the unbelievably long wait it is to get a take-out order done - even when there are no other orders in their system.  20 minutes for a couple of burritos?

2cd, this place is WAY over priced!  Their breakfast burritos are just short of 5 bucks, but they do not come with cheese, they charge you and extra .50 cents for that.  I had their version of Huevos Rancheros and it was nothing to come out of my way for. Small portions and the price was almost 8 bucks.  The guy working the counter today told me $4.95 for 10 freshly made flour tortillas.  Seriously? This is NOT a good price.  

3rd,the dude working the counter.  About as much personality as a box of rocks and he has been working that counter all 3 times I have been there.  

Their competition out beats them in price, quality, speed-of-service and taste, hands down.  I am referring to Los Dos Favoritos.  Their burritos are much cheaper and taste MUCH better and the wait is FAR less.  Their version of Huevos Rancheros is also far superior and the same to be found with everything on their menu, IMO.  I'm not saying the food here is bad, per-se, it just doesn't match up to other Mexican Food restaurants in town.  They are calling this place a bakery, I am assuming, because of all the freshly-made desserts and "pan" they have out there. It all looks good, but again, the price is too high.  The New Mexico grill is also better.  

Anyway, not the worst place on earth but their prices need to come down and the amont of time it takes to get a small order out needs to decrease substantially.
