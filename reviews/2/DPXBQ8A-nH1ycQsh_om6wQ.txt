Service was good.  I choose a table on the outside of the restaurant so I could people watch while enjoying a snack and drink.  

Prices are very high... so much that I regretted not just grabbing some trail mix and a soda from a concession stand.  Next time in LAS with time to kill I'll try a different spot.
