The location that is not at the mall stinks. You can't see what they are putting in your burrito and it doesn't represent the chain well. If one of your stores has all it's food in the open , then the other one should too. The Shea location is cavernous and not personable at all to customers. The food quality was poorer, the price was higher and nothing tasted the same as it was in that glorious food court location. The burrito was overloaded with black beans, skimped on the meat and it was  a mushy, not well rolled food item. This is a clueless chain because chains mean continuity and this location lowered the standards on all their other restaurants. Waste of a meal and almost 9 bucks for a burrito.
