I went here once while I agree that the chicken is good, I easily get turned off eating when the dining area is a mess while the store is not busy. I would understand that if it was busy, but it was 4pm on a Sunday and total of 3 people dining in.
I try to keep my reviews professional, but it's not great seeing napkins on the floor and some sticky stuff on a table. Ugh,
The staff here are friendly and nice, but  seriously speaking, someone take time with the dining room!
