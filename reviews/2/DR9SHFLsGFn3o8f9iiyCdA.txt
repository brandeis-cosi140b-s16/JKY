I noticed the quality, quantity, and service have gone down significantly since I started going here six months ago.

The last time I went, the burrito my boyfriend ordered was half the size it typically is. Mine fell apart while the girl was making it, but she kept going so when I opened the foil, all the ingredients fell out of the tortilla.The cashier was quick to take my money, but she ignored our burritos waiting to be bagged. Four burritos piled up, waiting to be bagged, while she stood there blankly staring into space. 

No one says a simple "hi" anymore, just "burrito or bowl?" and no "have a nice day". It appears the workers don't care about their job.
