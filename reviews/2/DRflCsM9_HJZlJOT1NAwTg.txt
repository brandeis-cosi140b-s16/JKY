So we made reservations and when we got there, the line was out the door. We waited for a few minutes at the front door. It was very uncomfortable as it was humid and there was a stench coming from somewhere? They brought us around to the back side in front of the window. That was great. But it was evident that we weren't going to get served anytime soon. Our waitress went to every table around us, including a couple that was seated 5 minutes after us???? I was calm as I wanted to have a nice evening. But I really wanted to get up and leave after 15 minutes! When her mood ring changed the right color for her to serve our table, I ordered a strawberry rita on the rocks. Way to sweet. Move on to the Dennis enchiladas. Those made everything better. They had a creamy cheese sauce on top, instead of a lump of hard melted plastic. Very good and filing. The service picked up as the evening wore on, but the place was empting out as well. this would have been a four star review, but....
