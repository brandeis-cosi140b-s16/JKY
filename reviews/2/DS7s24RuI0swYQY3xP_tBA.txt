Because of reviews went to try this place today! Kind of confused, no one was friendly, I might say they were polite, but not friendly! Food did come quickly! We both ordered same thing, fry bread tacos, with carnitas! One was cooked very light, one darker! Was wondering where the carnitas were, but found all on one end! Can't say I didn't like it but lacked any kind of flavor! Maybe should have tried the red or green chile one! But the kicker was NO refills on drinks, it was 113 degrees today and the food was so dry! Can't say I will return, quite a ways to drive! If I'm in the area, I may try something else so I could be a better judge of food!
