Color me unimpressed with this place....

I ate here twice once about a year ago and ordered a chicken burrito it wasnt on special so it ran around 8$ with tax. I promptly went home and made my own because I could do it for so much cheaper and get 4 portions out of it. This time I tried the chicken tacos, my coworker had chicken nachos and her food got a little more love than mine.

When it came to my tacos the guy assembling was rushed so he scrimped on just about everything plus the tortillas are pretty tiny teeny and not warmed or toasted. 

Then theres toppings which arent listed on the menu so I had no idea what i would be charged extra for-- theres a 2 for 6.49 lunch option but my friend said those portions are smaller. 

So 2 stars for service, 1 star for price for quality of food, its basic chain tex mex. Menu is a little limited and price for what you get.

Eh- next time i'll do Chipotle.
