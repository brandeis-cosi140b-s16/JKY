Good place to go if you want drinks and drinks only. The food is just that food with extra sauce to give it a little flavor. The service is bad, almost like they are under staffed. Maybe its just me because I work in customer service but it seems like every Dos Gringos is like this. I may be back but unfortunately for them its only gonna be for the beer from the tap forget about anything that has to be made. Fail!
