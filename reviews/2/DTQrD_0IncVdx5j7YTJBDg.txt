We had a table last night and ordered 3 bottles of Hennessey and 1 Absolute plus 2 hookahs and wings. Music, food, atmosphere was awesome. Except for the service. Hookah wasn't hitting right and had to call 3 different people over instead of them checking on us. Towards the end of the night I ordered one more bowl and I asked a gentleman where it was and he said let me get your waitress. She never came. He walked by me again and I told him tell her to cancel my order it has been over 30 min and I still haven't received what I ordered. I walked up to the hookah bar and finally my waitress came. Why do I have to leave my booth to request service? If that's the case then they should have a walk up order window!!!
