The food was good but a little pricey.  Unfortunately I had the worst waitress  I've ever had in my life.  It was like I didn't exist and left me feeling pretty disappointed.  When I wait 15 mins and then flag down another waitress to ask her to find you so I can get a drink refill, you aren't doing your job.
