Read about this place in the paper, so we drove over from Centennial Hills to check it out. Sorry to say it was not worth the trip. Mediocre Mexican food. Frozen Taquitos, watered down horchata from a mix, yellow cheese? A note to 'Anglos', if you see yellow cheese in a Mexican restaurant, expect cafeteria style Mexican food. No yellow cheese in Mexico. One unique item though, turkey rump. I had it in a sope. Tasty, but nothing special. $18's? My bad.
