I'm giving this 2 stars because the servers are nice!! The food is not worth the price. Been here about 4 times the last few years now and still not good. Don't ask why I keep coming back! I got tortilla soup the other day and does not taste like it used to. It tastes like watered down soup full of rice and chips. Plus the avocado that was in my soup had a tiny little fruit fly on it. Just Nasty!! I'm not one to complain and send my food back so I just dealt with it, put the avocado aside. Luckily it didn't touch the soup!! But the prices are too much for quality of food. Not good at all! 
Okay well the chips and salsa are the best part!
