The concept of Maki Taco is great: creative, build our own tacos. The problem is in the execution. I got the panang fish tacos at Chow Down Uptown and really the only word to describe them was bland. The corn tortilla far overpowered anything in it. It wasn't bad, it just "wasn't". Add to this the fact that they were clearly overwhelmed with folks and you get a list of several key ingredients they were out of and a more than a 20 minute wait for food truck food.

I would give Maki Taco another shot, but only if they were less mobbed. They have a good base to work with, but that night, when they could have made a great impression, they just weren't turning it out.
