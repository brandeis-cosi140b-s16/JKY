Oh Maria... Like other Yelpers, I really wanted to like this little place.  The shopping center that its located in is very nice, the colors inside are on par for the Mexican feel, but the food was just not cutting it.  When you walk in, there is a huge metal staircase in the middle of the room.  It seems like a neat idea until you have to awkwardly duck under it to get to your table.  I'm surprised there's no foam all over it to prevent terrible disasters.  (Please note: I'm 5'6", and I had to duck under the staircase.). 

Our server was verrrrrry sweet.  The chips and salsa were good.  There was no salt or pepper on any of the tables, so we had to ask for it.  The food though, was not good.  I hate writing poor reviews, so I usually try to sugar coat with "this was ok", or t"hat was fine", but no.  Unfortunately, the food was just not good.  Everything was greasy and not put together well, creating one big, messy Mexican dish (and not the good, greasy-delicious way).   So, I'm glad that we used a Groupon, and didn't pay full price, but I will not be coming back here.  

(I was going to give it 3 stars and maybe another try, until my stomach cramped and I was nauseous the entire next day.  Could have been a terrible coincidence, but I feel like I could have avoided it, had I avoided this dinner.  2 stars for Maria Bonita, and her quesadillas.)
