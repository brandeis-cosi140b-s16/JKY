Located in the imperial palace hotel. Food overpriced. Service seems slow, they got my order wrong.  The  tequila sunrise was pretty good. They offer  two types of salsa  with their chips. I ordered the fish tacos. The taco shell was dried out, the fish was also dry. The nachos I order was average at best. The plates the food was served in was extremley hot. I almost burned my fingers touching the plates.  I don't think any restaurant located in this hotel is good. I was disappointed.
