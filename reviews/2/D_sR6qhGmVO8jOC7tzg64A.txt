Chips and salsa are fine, but I've had better.

I often forget that their cheese quesadillas have green chiles, which turn me off.  The service can be a bit slow, however I think it's because they don't have a lot of help.  

I'll give them credit for the Happy Hour specials and the quiet atmosphere.  But that's about it.
