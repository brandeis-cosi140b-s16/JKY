I have to be as honest as possible with this review. It is average at the very most and should really be considered a large hole-in-the-wall type of joint. The place is dirty and would be very surprised if they haven't received sanitary citations in the past. As for the food it is below average Mexican and below average Asian and I don't care how many 4 and 5 star reviews you see listed. Granted that I travel extensively and eat at some of the best restaurants in the world, good food is good food whether you eat in a palace or off of a food truck. If you are going to visit here be sure to keep your expectations in check and within reason and you won't be disappointed by surprise.

Final summary: Visited on 21 February 2015. Dirty with below average Mexican/Asian cuisine. Think of it as a very dirty Panda Express and you'll be right on the money with what to expect.
