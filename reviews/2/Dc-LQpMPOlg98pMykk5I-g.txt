At my last visit to this place, I had the #7 (Two Fish tacos with fries and a drink) and chili cheese nachos.

The nachos were decent; they were hot, cheesy, and had a good chili flavor to them. Not a bad deal for only $1. The left over chili/cheese sauce went well with my fries. Nothing special, but it worked. The fries I had been given were pretty delicious. They were salted, crispy, and hot.

The fish tacos come warm wrapped in foil. Upon opening the foil, there is a single slice of lime before full uncovering the taco, which I thought was pretty neat. However, all thoughts of ingenuity vanished when I learned that the limes I had been given were dry and incapable of producing any significant amount of lime juice what so ever. Upon opening the rest of the foil wrapper, what I was greeted with was a decent sized fish taco on a flour tortilla. Unfortunately, the fish taco was void of any taco-like flavor. No flavor of fish, cabbage, nor salsa was present. However, any condiment I added on the taco, whether it was the few drops of lime juice I was able to produce or hot sauce, would become the flavor of the taco.

A typical Del Taco experience. Fast service, low quality food. I have enjoyed the other items on the menu, but I have learned not to expect much from a fast food joint. This was one of my less enjoyable visits.
