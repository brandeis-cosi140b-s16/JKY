Distrito all I am really gonna say is that as good as the food was there is no way that it could ever make up for how terrible the service was. We went for brunch on Sunday and after we were seated I checked in on Yelp and was given a free guacamole appetizer for checking in. I was happy about that and unfortunately that would be the last good thing that happened at this place. Let me say that while we were there it was not busy at all. First we ordered our drinks I had a coke and she had the bottomless bloody mary. Then I ordered the free guacamole thanks to Yelp. For our plates I ordered the skillet and she ordered the pazole verde. The waiter brought back our drinks and that was the last time we seen him until he brought our bill. Someone else brought out our plates about a half hour after we ordered  but we hadn't received our guacamole yet. We asked him if he could get us another bloody mary and he left never to be seen again. We had to actually go inside and find someone to get a refill for my coke and the bloody mary. Then we asked about the guacamole again and they finally brought it out when we were done eating. Overall I enjoyed the food but the service was so terrible I would never go back.
