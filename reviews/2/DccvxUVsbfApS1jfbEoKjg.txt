There are times when I'm not going to throw down $25 for a buffet in Vegas, okay, every time.  And there are times where I'll slum it at some hole in wall, okay, most times! lol  Such was the case last week in Vegas.

I was there for the Interbike convention and the first two days where spent riding very expensive bikes in the hot hills of Boulder, after the second day I really wanted something basic...  A taco.  A plate of tacos!  So I headed south from the Sands where I dropped off a bike and departed my buddies, I remember some eat places over on Flamingo so I thought I'd find the same on Sands Blvd.  Not the case.

I passed this strip mall and saw a sign that featured tacos, I dove for the lot!  "Tacos Los Toritos" is a medium size place, the seating was limited to one half the place as one of the workers was scrubbing down the floor of the other half, love that Pine-Sol!!

Good size menu with lots of choices, but I knew I needed tacos pronto so I ordered up from the sweet semi-bilingual girl behind the counter.  4 carnitas tacos...  And an orange pop, Jarritos, which I love!  This plate reminded me of home near Highland Park and all the taco trucks to choose from.

Tacos hit the spot and all was had for $7 bucks...  I needed to conserve funds as I didn't fair so well at the tables, so, this place was key in more ways than one!  Well, just 2 stars because I've had tastier pork, the salsa was also more on the tame side.  If I ever stop here again I'll ask for hotter salsa.  Oh, and as I walked to my truck I caught the eye of a girl walking on the sidewalk...  HOOKER!  lol
