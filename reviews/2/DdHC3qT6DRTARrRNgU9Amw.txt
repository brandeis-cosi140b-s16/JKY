Newsflash to management: you're no longer downtown, your prices need to come down like $3/dish. I don't know how you can call it a lunch "special" when your choice of ONE taco or enchilada, with rice and beans, is $11. Even a burrito is $10, and it's $2.50 to add cheese. Ridiculous.

Got a $10 order of nachos with carnitas and they were mediocre. Chips were super greasy, as if they were dumped directly from the fryer into the box. Carnitas were simultaneously fatty and dry. 80% of the toppings on my order were pico de gallo.

I guess their prices have to be high so they can keep paying their enormous staff: anywhere from three to seven employees were behind the front desk during my visit. They easily outnumbered the customers, and yet bickered over who was going to take my order.

TLDR: Overpriced & overstaffed.
