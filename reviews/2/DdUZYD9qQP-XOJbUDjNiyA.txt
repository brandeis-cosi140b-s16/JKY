I travel to Hawaii often and was glad to see a Hawaiian food themed place open up close to me after reading about it the the Las Vegas Sun magazine. I've been twice and both times have had the tacos. Pork, Chicken and beef I have tried. Unfortuantly my stomach has been upset after each visit within 30 minutes. I wondered if it was a certain sauce I tried the first time, but the same thing happened after the second visit with different sauce and ingredients. My first visit there were 2 young employees (guys) in uniform hats and shirts hanging around the register on the customer side, but were not interacting with customers and seemed bothered when one customer asked a question. Manager was there also behind the counter and on the floor and was pleasant when I spoke to her. 
My second visit was saturday night 8pm on Sept 5th and there was only 1 employee (a young girl) working by herself. I saw a cook at one time, but the young girl was doing everything by herself and there was a line of 6 people to order. She was very polite when it was my turn to order and assisted me and offered a sample if I wanted one of the steak. I was disappointed that the homemade ranch dressing was not in stock, but I then opted for the non spicy salsa.
