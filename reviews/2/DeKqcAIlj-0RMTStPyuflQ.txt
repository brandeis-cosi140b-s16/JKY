My wife and I went here for a belated Valentine's dinner. We arrived about 5:30PM and were promptly greeted as we entered.   There was no wait and were seated right away.  

My wife had a chimichanga special and I ordered the "mex and match" with two enchiladas (one chicken and one shredded beef). The chips and salsa "appetizer" was less than good. Half of the chips were crumbled small pieces of chips. Also, some the chips were soft, so they we either stale or under cooked.  The salsa was good.

Our meals were ok. My wife enjoyed her chimichanga, rice & beans. My enchiladas and rice were ok, nothing special.

Our waitress was nice. We ordered water with NO lemon when we sat down and she brought us water WITH lemon. No big deal. 

My wife wanted to order sopapillas after dinner, but the waitress didn't even ask about dessert, she just bright us the check and walked away. I know we could have asked, but we decided to just go somewhere else.

I suppose we might go back someday, but not soon. Plenty of other Mexican restaurants to try.
