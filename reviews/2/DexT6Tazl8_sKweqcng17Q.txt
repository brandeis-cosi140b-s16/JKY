I went through the drive thru at approximately 10:45pm. Keep in mind, I never eat fast food, but I had never tried El Pollo Loco's food before & I heard that there are healthy and inexpensive options on their menu. 

When I drove up, I attempted to place my order and I must have sat there for approximately 2 minutes before I was acknowledged. After I attempted to place my order, the person at the window answered "we don't have enough of the ingredients to make that dish". I tried to choose another option and was told again "we don't have all of the ingredients". The worst part, was that after I was told that neither of those options were available, he said, "We are closing soon. You have 1 min and 58 seconds to place your order." I was beyond appalled and extremely disappointed. Needless to say, I told him to forget my order and drove somewhere else to get my late night dinner. 

I added 1 star because I mentioned this unfortunate experience on Twitter and El Pollo Loco promptly replied, which is a plus in my book. Unfortunately, this experience was beyond unacceptable and first impressions last a very long time.
