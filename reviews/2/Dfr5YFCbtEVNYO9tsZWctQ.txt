Stopped by here on a lunch break with a co-worker for their taco Tuesday specials. We should have listened to the reviews. While the deals were great and the tacos were delicious, the other issues were just too much.

First of all the service is terribly slow. You're lucky if you get a drink refill. The tacos, like I said, were good, but good luck getting the ones you ordered or with the proper toppings. I got completely different tacos than I ordered and my co-worker got a taco with avocado in it which he told the server he couldn't eat because he was allergic. When the waitress brought the taco up to the cook and told him about the mess up with the avocado we saw him laughing about it behind the counter.

Halfway through our meal our first waitress just stopped coming to the table so we had another server come around and help and she was great, but still it was very bizarre.

If you go don't expect to get good service or the meal you actually ordered. I won't be coming back again.
