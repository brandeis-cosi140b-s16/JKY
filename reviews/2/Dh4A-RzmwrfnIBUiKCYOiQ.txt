The saying, if it aint broke don't fix it should've applied to Elvira's.  Before the remodel/expansion even though the place was much smaller and the wait for one's order was much longer, the food was much much better. Tonight my chile rellenos were greasy and the egg batter was soggy. The cheese enchilada and rice were ok. My husband's chicken chimichanga was bland and lacked flavor. The chips were so so but would be much better served warm. Don't think we'll return anytime soon, too many other better and more consistent choices when we're in the mood for Mexican food.
