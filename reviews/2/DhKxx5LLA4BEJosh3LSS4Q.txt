I came here by chance because the Oyster Bar line was too long and I could not wait any longer in line, so thought I would give Cabo Wabo Cantina a try.
It was mid afternoon and their was hardly anyone there except people sitting at the bar. I got seated pretty fast but then I had to wait 30 minutes for my food which I thought was long considering it was slow time. 

I got the pork tamales, it tasted okay, but I felt I could have just went to Roberto's for the same thing except with a cheaper price tag.

I don't know if Ill be going back
