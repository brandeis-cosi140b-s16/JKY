Well, on the way to this location we called and asked the girl who answered the phone which corner of Cooper and Ray they were on and she said she didn't know, hmmm (SE corner BTW). When we walked in there was a very strong cleaning chemical odor coming from the propped open bathroom. The decor is very stark and the service less than enthusiastic.   There is a handwritten sign by the "salsa bar" threatening prosecution of any apprehended hot sauce thieves, you are warned! Food wasn't terrible, just not very good.  Won't be returning.
