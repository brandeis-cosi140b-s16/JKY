This is a follow up to my earlier review. I wrote that I sent Chipotle Corporate in Denver a complaint. Well in the interest of fairness here's their response! Let's hope they fix things and in a few weeks I can write a better review.

Edit: On top of the email below I just got a call from Corinna, one of their regional managers. She apologized as well and listened to my concerns. She has noted several things to be fixed and will be working on improvements. She also offered me a free meal on her...that's nice but I told her I just want my reliable Chipotle food back. Sometimes you just gotta have a Barbacoa and chips and quac. Nothing else will do. 

The bottom line, they do care about the food and the service. I'll be glad when they get things fixed!
