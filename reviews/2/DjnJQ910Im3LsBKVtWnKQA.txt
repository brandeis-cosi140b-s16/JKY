I used to have this anorexic friend.  She would join us girls for dinner sometimes.  She would never order anything of course, and when the food would come she would squirm in her seat, roll her eyes and say, "Are you seriously going to eat that?". When I took the lid off my Julio's Too take out, I had a flash back of my anorexic friend and I thought, "I'm not sure this time.". 

I'm from Texas.  I know TexMex and I love it.  No offense, to the other Yelpers who have used the term, but this is not TexMex.  This is more like a Mexi-Mess!  I ordered the chili relleno and green chili corn tamale which was presented in a foil tin mixed with refried beans and rice.  I'll give them credit for the beans and rice.  That was good, but the rest...hmmmm.  The chili relleno was drowned in a glob of greasy cheese.  I'm not trying to say, that the chili relleno is the healthy choice.  It's breaded and sometimes fried.  It is never soggy or submerged in goo...unless you order from Julio's Too.  As for the green chili tamale.  In Texas, tamales are much smaller.  The corn (or maize as they say) is much more understated allowing the filling to really stand out.  This tamale was like a men's size 12 corn shoe with a little bit if cheese and green chili inside.  It was also, encased in a tomb of cheese that I had to dig through before I finally found the tamale.

I won't go in to the salsa.  The other Yelpers got it right.  

Now, I do like the location, the vibe and the service.  I would ride my bike over there for chips and guacamole with friends.  They have a convenience store selection of beverages and a nice patio, which merit an extra star.

I'm not trying to be a jerk with this review, but this is just what I think.
