I posted pics of the food we had: oysters and fish tacos. The oysters were wonderful!  Very friendly, courteous service. The restaurant smelled a little funny, maybe it was the fish and bleach for cleaning mixed together that was weird but it put me off a little. It is quite a drive from the Vegas strip, about 20-30 mins b/c it's all street. Other than that, I would go back for the oysters.
