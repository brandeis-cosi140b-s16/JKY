When the original location at 75th & Indian School opened back in the 90's there were few places like it in the valley  (prior to the "'Bertos" explosion of the aughts) and it was, in the parlance of the day, the bomb. Super nachos, yo!

Ramiro's has since opened and closed several locations and lamentably the quality has suffered since the West Side (Wessside!) heyday. The food here is decent and fairly priced, but nothing that will knock your socks off. A good after hours joint to aid in soaking up the poison you've consumed all evening.
