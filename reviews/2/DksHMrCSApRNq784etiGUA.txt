Tried the head taco and it was okay. Also ordered the nachos and really was disappointed.. The lady who took my order wasn't very friendly and the lady who brought the food to the counter (where I picked it up) wasn't so cheerful either. They have a good salsa bar but it didnt look that fresh.

Will not be returning..
