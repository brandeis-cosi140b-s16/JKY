I usually love going to this place, but we went in there Saturday night and the hip hop music was so loud we didnt even finish our drinks and left.  Absolutely horrible music and waaaay too loud.  Dont get me wrong, I love loud music, just not that hip hop crap.  I thought I stumbled into a bar on the west side of Vegas.  Probably due to the youngster tending bar.  I will go back, but if that kind of music is blasting I'm finished with this place.
