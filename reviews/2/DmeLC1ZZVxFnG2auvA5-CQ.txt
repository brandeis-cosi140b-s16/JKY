We went here this morning for brunch and the food was fantastic.  Great nachos and breakfast burritos.  

The biggest disappointment was the service that we received while we were there. We were one of the only parties at the steel cactus and couldn't find the waiter for 10-15 minutes at a time.  

At one point I was so frustrated that I just went to the bar for a beer and began ordering drinks for our group (9 of us!).

I guess I really shouldn't have expected much from a server that told us he was "chillin" when we asked him how he was doing .
