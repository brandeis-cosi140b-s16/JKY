This is a family owned and operated restaurant. We started with golden margaritas they arrived and almost tasted good but it was like drinking half water and half drink.   I didn't care for either salsa, one was smooth tomato puree that was just very hot and the other fresh tomato one was very watery and smooth with barely any flavor like the margaritas.

I ORDERED a grilled CHICKEN salad. As my luck would have it the waiter presents me with a grilled BEEF salad. I didn't say anything and just accepted it. The salad really was OK with grilled mushrooms and some onions the beef was OK but not seasoned. I was afraid to use the dressing that came with it because it was bubbling a bit.

My husband had a platter with steak, sauce, onions, fresh roasted jalape√±o and cheese all melted up with rice and beans, he said it was good. 

We got good and not so good.
