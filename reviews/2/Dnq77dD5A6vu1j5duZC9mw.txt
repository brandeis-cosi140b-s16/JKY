At this El Pollo Loco they charge more for some items than any other El Pollo Loco I have been to. What happened to me is I simply asked for black beans instead of the pinto beans in a burrito and was told they might charge more. The manager came out and rudely said it would be .49 more. This is even after I mentioned that the 3 other El Pollo Loco's I go to do not charge more. I wasn't asking for a side dish, just a simple substitute. Wow, customer service is bad and I should have gone to any one of the other places around there.
