When my boyfriend & I first walked in, we were greeted with 'hello' by the workers. Thought it was nice, so I smiled & said it back. But then.. Once we got to the counter, the girl (chubby white one) looked pissed at me for some reason. She looked very unhappy & was very unfriendly toward me. The way she spoke, and her actions. Also, there was another girl who helped scoop the food into our burrito bowls, and she had the same attitude as well.

While they asked what we wanted & scooped it into our bowls, they barely scooped anything, so I asked "May I have some more, please?" They followed by scooping a very, very small amount. One of them, when I asked for lettuce, scooped about a quarter sized amount & when I asked for more, another quarter or two sized amount. I'm not sure why they're so stingy here, but at other Chipotle locations I've been to, they always give a generous amount of food & customer service is mostly great.

Once I got to the cashier, the guy gave me the wrong change (less), but when I let him know, corrected it almost immediately. I always tip food service, and almost didn't (because of the mean girls) but did because the guy saved the day by being nice & he didn't give me a mean look or frown. He SMILED & was genuinely nice. I'm not quite sure what's crawling up the girl workers' butts but they're not just ruining it for the customers, they're ruining it for the business as well.

Actually, I'm not quite sure if it's a racist thing (since I'm Asian & they're not) or if they think I can't eat (since I'm petite), but I was still kinda hungry even after I ate everything, since they gave me smaller portions. Funny, since the other two white girls after us got very large portions~! Lolol.
