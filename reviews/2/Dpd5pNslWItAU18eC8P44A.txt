So our server was awesome. Told us the straight story(won't mention the name). Sucks to order tacos. They come three to a plate and you must get all three the same. Asked for the manager...states that they can't do it any other way because it would back up the kitchen. WHAT?????  Need new kitchen staff. You can get three different tacos if you order the taco flight however you get 15 tacos!!!  That's great here with your baseball team!!!!  Lol what a joke. Server told us if you get the right manager you can get what you want. Where is the consistency?  Not impressed.

Food was 2 stars at best....Over salted.
