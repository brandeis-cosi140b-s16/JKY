Waited 30 minutes to get our food.  This is counter service and it was 7pm on a Thursday, so in my opinion, that's crazy.  It wasn't even busy, either.  Once we got our food (I got the chicken burrito with a side of beans) it was rather bland.  My hubby got a tamale, which was pretty much all masa and no beef.  Only good part of this restaurant was the salsa.
