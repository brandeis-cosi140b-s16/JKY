The service was great, but unfortunately the food was terrible. I ordered a sampling of the "street food." The mini tostadas were three tortilla chips (literally) with cold black bean puree and dried out shrimp. The margaritas were ok, but a little sweet and thick for my taste. It's also very loud, with hard floors and bare walls, nothing absorbs the sound. I hope they fine tune the issues and do well in this new location.
