While the value is pretty good, the burritos are not really that huge (come on people, be real) and their quality is very low. Every type of meat I've had there has been dry and stringy; the beef in particular was barely edible. The burritos sometimes aren't even assembled that solidly, which may be due to the size, but still they shouldn't fall apart and have such a messy puddle of dripping in the bottom of every wrapper. I've been here 3 times and I'm never going back. It's a step above generic Americanized places like Qdoba and Chipotle, but it's still really, really low quality food for drunk people who can't tell the difference. Go to Los Amigos if you want decent Mexican food on Green Street.
