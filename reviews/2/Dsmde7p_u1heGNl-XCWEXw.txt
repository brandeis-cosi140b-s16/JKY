I went here with a dozen friends shortly after Mad Mex Shadyside opened. Being used to the Oakland one where one could get an impressively stiff margarita on an undergraduate budget, we all ordered margaritas and dinners, some opting for a floater.

While the margaritas were palatable, outside of the floater there was so little tequila or triple sec that it was unclear whether or not the drinks were actually alcoholic. Further, the floaters were a dismal half to a third of a shot. As far as any of us can tell, we paid $10 for a half shot of tequila and 20 ounces of non-alcoholic mix.

The food was good as is the food at all Big Burrito restaurants I've been to, but I think next time I want a margarita I'll either mix it myself or try one of the many other fine bars in Shadyside.
