Not great.  Some mediums and some lows:

Ceviche - not that great.  Fish was kind of mealy and not seasoned well.
Beef Tacos - the beef was VERY dry, some of it completely dry.  Seasoning was not noticeable.
Carne Asada - decently seasoned, and not dry.  Nothing memorable though.
Chips and Salsa Bar - the best part.  Several different kinds of salsa, including a tomatillo/avocado, a "spicy" red, and a "smokey" red.
Tacos al Pastor - not that good.
Rice and refried beans - standard fare, nothing to make them stand out.

I do like that they used Mexican crema for the sour cream.

All in all, qualifies as a "Never Again" stop.

P.S.  Had three co-workers with me, and none of them liked it either.
