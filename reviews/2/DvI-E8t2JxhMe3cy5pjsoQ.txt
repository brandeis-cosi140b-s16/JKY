We first tried this place late last year, it's right down the street from our condo and we were itching to break away from the norm and try a new place.

I am always thinking I might find the next "it" place that no one else has discovered. I know Julio's has been around for awhile but I had never heard anything good/bad about it.

It probably didn't help the start to our dining expierience that an ex-manager/co-worker came into the dining area when were first sat down. Let's just say I pretty much disagreed with this person on every aspect of life and leave it at that. 

Service was slow, very slow. It was a lazy Sunday and place was not even half full. They finally brought the meal and it was wrong, we waited another 20-25 min and I think part of it was wrong again. I don't even remember what we got it was so forgettable. Just blah, it provided some calories and nothing more. Everything was just bland an so-so. 

I gave them 2 stars instead of one because they did comp our entire bill. I felt somewhat bad for the waiter so I left him a big tip and got out of there, so much for trying a new place.
