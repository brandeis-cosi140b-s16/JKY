Taco Bell is losing my love. Apparently you now have to pay to get a water cup. In Arizona of all places. Now i'm not ignorant, I get that they're covering their costs for the cups. But the one thing I could always count on in Arizona was free water, and that the fast food restaurants gave you a cup for free. Now slowly that's going away.
