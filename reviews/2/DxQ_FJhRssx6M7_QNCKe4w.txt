This is a fairly new place. As I drove by, I noticed the cool name and immediately got excited to try it out!
Went one night, very hungry, & dined it.
Overall customer service & dine-in experience= 
Pricey, Little flavor, Unenthusiastic. 
& The horchata tasted as if it went bad...

Although, they did have some seriously bomb salsa !
