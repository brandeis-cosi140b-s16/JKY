There food has gone steadily down hill. Ate there several months ago, and it was good. Ate there a month ago, and just OK.Ate there last night and had a burro I couldn't even eat. I don't know how else to describe it, but the meat tasted "dirty" A bad flavor, and no spices to speak of. There chips are ok, but their salsa is really bland. Service is good, but there food is going south real fast. I would not recommend them. There was a current change in ownership, which i will blame on the tepid food.
