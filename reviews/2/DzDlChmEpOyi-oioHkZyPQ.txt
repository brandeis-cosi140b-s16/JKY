Everytime I drive by Loco Patron, it looks packed.

Not when I went! Damn!

We were literally the only ones in the bar, at 1330 on a Wednesday that wasn't too surprising though. The music is rather not good (they played madonna) and the place is just kind of .... there. I had an indifferent 3 star experience until I had a little run in with the bartender. I took a sip of my bottled beer and it was room temp. I called him over and asked if I could have the bill for our warm beers. He offered to "get something else that might be colder" and I declined. He then said if you don't want something else then why bitch about it dude? Whatever, I was trying to show my girl a good time for her 21st and didn't want to get in a big argument so I let it go. 

Mark my words, I'll never go back. That was some serious attitude that was unnessecary.
