Man how disappointed I was with quality of food with this Roberto's Taco Shop . Generally I love Roberto's especially the one closest to my house off Gibson. But I decided to try the one closest by my work which happen to be the Rancho dr one.. 

This is the second time I have tried the food at this location and was let down twice .. Normally I love the Wednesday taco deal , but the tacos at this location were a big let down . I went during the  lunch hour rush, both times and it seems like they maybe a little under staffed . Because the food I got was cold and I noticed that the had a canister full of pre cooked tacos .. I ignore this, but when  I go to eat my tacos they just fall apart because they are cold and hard .. 

I Know it's not easy to keep up with the rush hour for lunch .. But I think the food should be cooked upon ordering .. Not pre-made food that I received..  

Sorry but twice is enough for me not to return to this location ..
