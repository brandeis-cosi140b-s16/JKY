When I was halfway through the long line at Chipotle, they made an announcement that there was no more brown rice.  When I finally got to the front of the line, they made an announcement that they had no more rice at all.  Five minutes later, when they brought out more (white) rice and the line started moving again, they realized they were out of steak.  I love Chipotle, but this was ridiculous!
