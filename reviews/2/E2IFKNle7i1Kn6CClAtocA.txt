It's been awhile since me and my husband have been here, We ordered our food got our drinks it very quickly Took about 25 minutes to get our food my husband ordered the shrimp cocktail, I ordered the octopus and garlic butter the shrimp cocktail shrimp were overcooked soggy and had no flavor, My octopus plate was very tough the rice was cold beans were cold and the potatoes that came with it were also cold not satisfied with today's dinner, overall I will never come here and eat again.
