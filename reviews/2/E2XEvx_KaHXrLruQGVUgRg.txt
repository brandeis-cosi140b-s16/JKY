Although the large amount of sauce and cheese can disguise the truth, the food that I have tried here is low quality and lacks flavor. Was with a group of six and everyone agreed. Also had one of the cheap margaritas, which was nothing special. Just what you would expect from a $1.50 margarita 

I am pretty sure the salsa was made using canned tomatoes. 

I would not recommend.
