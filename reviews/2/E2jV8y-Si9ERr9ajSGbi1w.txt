I would give the food a 4.5 but the service a 1, so I'm giving an overall a 2. 

Food- pretty good, salsa is great, this was our 1st time so we ordered #'s 1, 10, and 15. The tacos (beef) could use more seasoning and was a little bland, and there was so much lettuce on everything, it was a little ridiculous. Next time order with no lettuce. The rice and beans where the stars of the dishes, don't skip!

Service- I called in, waited 15 minutes and went in to get the food. There was no one working, just 2 kids that I assume are related to the owners running around. The phone was ringing non-stop and after about 15 minutes I had one of the boys get someone to help me. Even then I had to wait about 7 minutes for her to cash me out, then another 5 for the food. I was going to write this place off until I had the food, now I'll have to give it one more chance.
