People who compare qdoba to chipotle are seriously handicap. 

There are similarities but not enough to justify this statement. 

If I would have gotten a burrito and not seen it made I probably would have given it 4 stars because it's pretty tasty. (I was starving while pre thx giving shopping so I actually ate it, had I not been so hungry I would have left after looking at the food display)

Everything had been sitting out so long it had a film, the guacamole was brown and crusty looking, everything else was splattered around the tins and left long enough for it to crust up. I came at 7 so that's a normal dinner time, even if it was slow you should be wiping all that crust crap. I think she saw the look of nasty on my face and tried to stir everything up but it was too late. 

The sweet girl working was like once you taste this you'll want to come back once a week. Hmmm maybe if things were fresh! 

Then when I got my drink there were lids in the lid dispenser that were filthy! They were brown- I was like "did someone step on these and put them back?" 

5star service
4 star taste
Negative stars for freshness
Negative stars for cleanliness

I probably won't be back unless they make some serious changes.

Too bad bc it was cheap and pretty flavorful
