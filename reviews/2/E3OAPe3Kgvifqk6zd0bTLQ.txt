SMH!!!!!
I know it's Cinco de Mayo but wait for food was ridiculous.  We get it not mad at the staff but when you wait this long and the food is below average still Shaking my head!!!
Been here before and I remember it was good but tonight...NO NO NO
Well at least I caught the back end of the young mariachi group.
Not so happy Cinco de Mayo
