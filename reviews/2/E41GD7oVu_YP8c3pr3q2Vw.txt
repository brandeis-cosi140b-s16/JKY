Taco Bell is more mexican than this place. Subpar service, good luck finding a place to sit. Limited menu and prices are way more than what you should pay for this food. Its pretty gross. Made us sick. Quesadilla with cold unmelted cheese inside?? yuck! Thought you couldn't go wrong with nachos and ordered that with the carnitas. Meat was cold. Thoroughly enjoyed my ice cold Corona. Find yourself a TacoBell instead.
