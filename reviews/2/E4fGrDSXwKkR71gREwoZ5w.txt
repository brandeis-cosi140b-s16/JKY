For a $6 carne asada burrito, the portions are very small. The steak is grilled well, but it's flavorless for the most part, and their salsa doesn't enhance the meal in any way. The place was clean and the $2 Pacifico's are a bonus. 

I was expecting more, and won't be returning, especially because of the portions. This is just another place that makes me want to help my mother start her own restaurant.
