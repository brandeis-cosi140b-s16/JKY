I am boycotting Arriba's.

Why the two star review?  I love the food and the attention to flavor in all of their dishes.   

The Food:  * * * * (four stars)
The Abiance -* -* (negative two stars... yes, the ambiance is that bad after the closure of the patio)

Why am I boycotting Arriba's?  I need to yell, so pardon the ALL CAPS . 

MEXICAN FOOD IN THE PHOENIX AREA IS DESERVING OF A FREAKING PATIO DURING THE WINTER SEASON!

They had an awesome patio on which my wife and I would sit on two to three times per week, drink margaritas, I'd have my chile verde burrito with charro beans and just sit there in Sonoran heaven.

BUT THE FREAKING BONEHEADS ENCLOSED THE PATIO!

THE INTERIOR OF THE RESTAURANT IS DARK, REEKS OF DIRTY MOP WATER AND IS DANK!!!!

The patio was the best thing, besides the food, that Arriba's had going for it because it was relaxing, awesome for a leisurely early evening dinner and for post-meal cocktails.

I haven't been back since after I discovered that they enclosed the patio.  :-( :-( :-(

ROOKIE MOVE, guys. :-( :-(
