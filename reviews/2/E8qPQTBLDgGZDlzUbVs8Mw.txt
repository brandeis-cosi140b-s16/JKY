This meal was mediocre at best and it cost $104 pre-tip FOR LUNCH. The margarita, which wasn't even that good (based on ingredients, it should be far cheaper) was $14.  Honestly, if it was homemade or a little effort had been put in, I would've rolled my eyes at the price but I certainly would've understood. I go to any Mexican joint and have that exact margarita for $4.00. It really is absurd.  Considering their patrons are mostly retired people, this is basically elder abuse.  Overcharging old people because they don't know better.

The food was ok.  My husband got the huevos rancheros which was probably the best meal out of the bunch.  I got the General Stack - the potatoes were underdone, though crispy.  I was STARVING and managed to eat more than expected I felt sad every time I took a bite.  Oh, and it only came with two eggs and they promise three (but now I am just nitpicking).  My dad got the shrimp tacos - we took one home for my grandmother to eat.  She loved it, which is a terrible sign.  My dad seemed to think it was "fine" but it costs $14 for two tacos.  WHY GOD WHY!?

The highlight was our waitress.  She was delightful.  Very attentive and funny.  We liked her very much.  So a big thank you to that woman for excellence at her job.

The ambiance of the place is nice.  We sat by a fire and enjoyed that.  Honestly, there are some pretty decent restaurants around the area and you should frequent those way, way before this place.  I know they have a great patio (it is raining, we didn't get to sit there) and that is a definite plus but it cannot be worth the sub-par food/drinks.

Check our Cafe Bink before this place.  You'll get better food/drinks and pay way less.
