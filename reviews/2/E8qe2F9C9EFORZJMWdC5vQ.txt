I hate to write a bad review about this place but it just isn't that good. I fully recommend this place for drinks and appetizers. Great salsa and guacamole but thats about it. 

The dinner entrees are overpriced and average at best. There is nothing on the menu that sticks out as being great. There are too many other places in this city that are better. 

I do not recommend this place for dinner. Drinks and appetizers only.
