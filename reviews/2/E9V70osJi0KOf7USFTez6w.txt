First time coming here and I ordered the chili Rellenos plate for myself and a carna asada burrito for my husband. I was very please  with the size of the chili relleno but was very disappointed with the sauce on top. It taste just like a cheap can of spaghetti sauce and looked like it too! Terrible flavor killed the whole meal, not to mention the rice was extremely dry and hard.
My husband said his carne asada was good but wish they out more in the burrito. The burrito would have been more enjoyable if there weren't any of the hard dried up rice inside of it. The beans were ok. Weren't watery and runny like other places can be.
