Crazy place. Get there early there is always a line. Its a bar and grill so every things a bit pricey. Get your drinks in the casino first. Food quality well I ordered my favorite Buffalo chicken sandwich.  When I got it it tasted old and a strange crunchy taste to it so I sent that back. I had a been burrito and that was just as good as taco bell. The live bands are cool. That was about it.  I dont see my self going back. :(
