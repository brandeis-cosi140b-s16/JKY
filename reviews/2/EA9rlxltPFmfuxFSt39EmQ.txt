Only two stars based on the 46 minutes wait for the food. Monday at 5pm only 3 tables and two customers at the bar. I went early because I seen this issue mentioned in others reviews. 6 people and it was $280.00 only two drinks were ordered. The rest had water. 
Nice place if your in the early dating stage. But NOT good for families. My 12 yr old had a $32 pork chop. Ugh!
 They do clean the plates away like your gonna steal them. Lol very quick and GREAT water refills too. Maybe the bus boys should be cooking? 
Food was tasty, average portions and not a lot of choices. Two pages for drinks and one for food.
