Often the little hole in the wall restaurants have some of the best food.  That is not the case here.  And it smells funny.  Not funny ha-ha, funny raw meat, slaughter house funny.

The tamales were nothing special and they too smelled funny.  I'm sure there is better Mexican food to be found in Casa Grande.  That doesn't smell funny.  Ha-ha or strange.
