The food is way too spicy.  Thankfully, I got a soft chicken taco that didn't have any sauce on it and that was quite good.  Still, not amazing.  Find it so hard to believe that this place is so renowned.  $30 for lunch for 2 with no drinks and not that much food seems insane - and half of our food was way too hot to eat.  The atmosphere was very lack luster.  Unlike other folks experience, the service was good but, I won't be seeking this place out again.
