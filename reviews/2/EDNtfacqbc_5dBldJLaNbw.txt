I was excited to try a new place but wasn't very impressed with the food.  I order a veggie quesadilla, guacamole and chips, and an horchata.  The quesadilla had soggy lettuce and onion inside and the horchata was too sweet.  It also cost a lot for a small portion of food.  It was fast and smelled amazing so maybe if you order a meat item it would be good.  Friends ordered taco's and said they were good but small.  What's interesting is that each meal comes with a radish, slice of lime and cucumber.  Might wait a while and give it another shot once it's settled in.
