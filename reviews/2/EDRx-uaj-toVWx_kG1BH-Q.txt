Came here after I saw all the reviews every one was talking about. But it's nothing to talk about here just a average place. I order some fusion tacos each $2. The food taste like Panda Express in a taco which its not a good sign.
The owner was a little pushy when I was ordering my food to go. The hostess was kind. The place was not neat or that clean as some other reviews talked about.

At the end I think they just brought the reviews and all the Asian Americans and Americans just hyped up the place because they don't know what's good food from average. The only good thing about this place was the Mexican coke!
