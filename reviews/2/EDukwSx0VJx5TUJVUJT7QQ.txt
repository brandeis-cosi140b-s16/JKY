I think I was over sold on this place, and that set my expectations too high.

When we arrived an elderly man exiting the building told us this was the best Mexican food he has ever had. I LOVE Mexican food both Authentic and "Authentic" but I just did not get this place. 

From their website:
"As I grew older and my tastes changed, I became unsatisfied with eating enchiladas that were the same color as construction cones and had the texture of a hot dog bun that had been dunked in water by a professional food eater."

I don't know where the owner was eating but that was never my experience at any decent Mexican restaurant. 

The food was ok, and spicy but not in any kind of familiar way. It sort of reminded me of a TV dinner enchilada that had been churched up. My wife was not impressed as she thought it was too spicy, I thought it was not spicy enough. I'd love to tell you exactly what I had, but I just don't remember.

They definitely "redefined the Enchilada" but not in any way that I like.
