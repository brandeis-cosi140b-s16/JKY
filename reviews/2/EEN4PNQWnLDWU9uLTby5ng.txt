I live right around the corner from BYT so when they opened up I was hoping against hope that it would be a great place to eat. You see, this area of Mesa is a foodie black-hole. In order to have a decent meal you have to travel across Mesa to reach a decent restaurant. I've been to BYT several times now, reserving judgement until I had experience the place enough and I have to say it's pretty disappointing. I've been to Mexico and have experienced authentic street tacos, but I've found BYT's to be very dry and tasteless. To top it off, it's pretty expensive for the portion size.
