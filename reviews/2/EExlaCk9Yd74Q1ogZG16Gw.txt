I ordered a vegetarian enchilada here and I was surprised to see that the vegetables that were used looked like frozen vegetables, the birds eye or green giant kind that comes in a frozen package.  They even had machine cut cubed carrots and lima beans, just what they used in frozen mixed vegetables from a grocery store.

I asked why the vegetables were like that?  The waiter told me "unfortunately we don't use fancy vegetables in our food".

Fancy as in, fresh?   Seriously?

I came to this place when it was Diego's and it was far better, I'm really disappointed with this venue and will not be back.
