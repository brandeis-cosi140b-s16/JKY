Wait wasnt long. Only problem is the food quality is different.. It's like they changed their cooking procedures. The toungue taco doesnt really taste the same, small stringed out pieces instead of the chunks. Kind of on the really salty side. No more Horchata refills....That is a no no. You cant just take something away that people were so acustomed to...Oh well when I am desperate I'll come here.
