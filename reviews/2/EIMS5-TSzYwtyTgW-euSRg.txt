I love Chipotle.  Love it.  But this location just does not have their act together.

I've been three times, and each time it just takes forever to move through the line.  We are usually getting food for us along with our friends that live in Middleton, so on multiple occasions I've been scolded for not ordering ahead and holding up the line.  

The fourth time, I wised up, and ordered ahead.  I requested my food be ready at 5pm.  I showed up at 4:50, and it wasn't ready yet.  It took until 5:05 until it was done.

I've never had any issues with the food once I've gotten it, but time=money.
