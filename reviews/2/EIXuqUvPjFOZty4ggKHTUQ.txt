The food is good, but unfortunately they have new people working the register that aren't as good - in fact, rather lazy. On 8/22, the girl at the register went and sat in the back of the kitchen rather than tend to customers out front. When our order came out, an item was missing. We figured no big deal, maybe she is new. On 8/29, we called our order in at 5:50pm to pick up. When we got there it was busy. After several people came in after us and got their orders before us, we asked about our order. Except for two items that had been made (which were ultimately cold), the rest hadn't been made - she hadn't followed up on our order and couldn't have cared less that it hadn't been made. We asked to speak to the manager who wasn't there. The other girl wrote a message, but of course I doubt the manager ever saw it. So, forty minutes later we got our food and left and I doubt we'll return unless they can muster up some better customer service.
