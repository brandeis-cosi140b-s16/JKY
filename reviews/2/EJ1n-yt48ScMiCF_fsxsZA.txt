First off, the address is incorrect!  Google and yelp say 616 E Pima, but it's actually around 530 W. Pulled up at lunch, and the parking lot was full (usually a good sign!), but it also meant we had to wait nearly an hour for our food.  Waited almost 20 minutes   to have our order taken before going up to the counter. Chips and salsa are delicious, but they charge extra for refills...  Food was bland, but filling. I had the chicken Gordita meal, mother had the chicken tostada. Both were meh
