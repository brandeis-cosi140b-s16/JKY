This place isn't clean. It's dirty and sticky; plus, the food isn't very good either. Or the bar for that matter, because they barely serve alcohol. It's really not a place that you would want to purchase anything. Also, it smells weird in some areas; I thought it was vomit, but it was just really gross. 

The one, ONLY thing that this place is good for is for dancing and listening to music. Latin nights. They are just a whole lot of fun. It's super crowded, with crazy music, and even crazier dancing. Everyone here needs to be careful, the crowd is really touchy-feely because they want to dance on you. If you're not into that sort of thing, then this really isn't the spot you want to hang out at! 

The one thing that I thought was kinda cool was the comic book-esque sayings that were plastered on the ceiling. I'll come back if someone brings me there, but only to dance. But definitely have a drink somewhere else, because you shouldn't be ordering here.
