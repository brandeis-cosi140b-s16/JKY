I absolutely love chipotle, and eat there all the time. Unfortunately every chipotle is different and this location I went to was not one of my best. My friend and I grabbed dinner there two nights ago. After a couple hours of studying, we were starving and decided to get chipotle. I regret that decision because they were so stingy it was ridiculous! I was not in the mood for rice or beans so I just got a chicken bowl, and without the extra stuff in your bowl you can definitely tell how much they really skimp you on the meat. Then I got to the guac, barely even half a scoop.... all for 10 bucks.
