Have tried to make sense of all the 5 star  reviews but I guess for phoenix this is better than nothing.  have eaten here several times just to make sure of my posting I find the food here alright, the trip as are not rinsed from the inside so you get all the crunchy cowshit to enjoy.  The chicharon was a mystery meat not good at all, lemgua overcooked, Chile verde not what I expected.  And so forth on the other items Al in all the food looks nice but is rather bland.
