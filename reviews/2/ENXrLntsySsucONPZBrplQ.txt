I have a love/hate relationship with Tacos Mexico. I know I could have way better tacos elsewhere but it's like a bad relationship, I keep on going back because I need tacos in my life. 

Prices have gone up, gone are the days when you could order a taco for $1.19, now a mediocre taco will cost you $1.69. 

This Tacos Mexico is located in a shady downtown neighborhood. I once had a bum stare at me while eating, it made for a very uncomfortable situation. The service here is just okay. It's a hit and miss. Today's cashier was extremely rude, she slammed the drive thru window as soon as the bag touched my hand, she was not friendly, she seemed miserable. On the plus, they finally got an English speaking cashier, thick accent, but that's a step towards the right direction. They only used to have non-english speaking cashiers. 

The food is okay, tacos are mediocre like I mentioned before. I've never ordered anything else here before. They do have a taco special, three tacos with beans/rice, and chips for $5 and some change. It's worth ordering if you're paying with cash, if you're paying with a debit/credit card then you'll be charged an additional dollar. The beans are the best here, they top them off with cheese, the meat is too dry and the rice has no flavor.  

Drive thru needs to improve. Wait time is about 20 minutes and they have no prices listed on their drive through menu. They have no voice box and you have to order at the drive thru window. For the price I could definitely go somewhere else with far better service and food but they're just so close to work that I keep running back to them, uugh.
