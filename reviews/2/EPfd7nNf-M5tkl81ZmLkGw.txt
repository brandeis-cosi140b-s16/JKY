I am Not a fan. A la carte pricing means your dinner becomes really expensive really fast. There are things on the menu (like the ground beef tacos) that are simply not good. If friends want to go here, I get two fried fish tacos and then eat something later around 9pm.

The real mystery is: Why do my friends keep wanting to go here?
