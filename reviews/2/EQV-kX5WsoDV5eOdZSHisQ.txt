Super bummed I wanted to like this place, it's was recommended by a friend... She said the food would be similar to home... Since moving to Madison I have been looking for a really good Mexican food restaurant. I am still in search... Went in to order a meal to go... It was really busy it took a min or two for the waitress to acknowledge me. Fine I can wait... Looked over the menu in this awkward sitting area in the middle of the hall... When a crowd of ppl got up to pay for there meals so I am sitting with strangers butts in my face trying to not be in the way when I hear this guy from down the stairs make a weird noise I figured they where talking to a coworker but it continued and he kept making the noise so I look over then he hid behind the wall... This went on for the entire time I was there... I finally was able to make my order... They were quick with the food didn't have to wait long... Thanked the waitress and gave her a tip... As I am walking out the door the man that was cat calling me yells from across the room over all of the patrons BYE.... Embarrassed and just wanting to go home and enjoy my food I blurt out awkwardly bye and run out the door....  By the time I go home to enjoy my Agua de Jamaica and burrito de pastor it was gross... Greasy and soggy from oil... Just a mess... Needles to say I will not be going back ever...  


I give them two stars just because I was super excited to have Agua de Jamaica its my fav...
