We were driving through town and chose this place based on other Yelp reviews and this is really the first time a highly rated dive didn't pan out for us.  

First the good:
- Very friendly and attentive service:  never had our water/drink glasses empty
- If you are a sports fan, they have 2 TVs and were showing different NFL games when we went there (Sunday lunchtime)
- The portions are definitely generous.

Now the average:
- The pricing really isn't that good to be honest.  For a family of 4 we paid $50 and didn't order any adult beverages or appetizers.  Frankly we can pay that in Scottsdale.
- While the service was very attentive, the food took a little time to come out, and it wasn't super busy in the restaurant.  It wasn't a major flaw, but I did find myself wondering where the food was for a little while.

Now the poor:
- The food...just not good at all.  I found the refried beans to not be fresh or tasty.  Really seemed store bought to me.
- The sour cream tasted awful.  I had to scrape it off my food.
- The guacamole was mediocre at best - again seemed store bought.  My 11-year old daughter's guacamole blows this away!
- The chicken seemed very low quality...definitely dark meat.  It was seasoned fairly well, probably because of the low quality.

The decor is dated, but honestly that wasn't an issue for us.  Most of the time dives like this with high Yelp ratings have some of the best food...just not in this case.  I really like to support local businesses, but unfortunately this is not a place I'd try again.  Sorry.
