So, we finally got a chance to head back over to Three Amigos after our poor experience the first time. And needless to say, this trip wasn't any better service-wise. The only reason I'm not dropping to a 1 star is that the busboy was very helpful (and the only person on staff that we saw in the dining room for the majority of our time there). 

Here's how our night went. We were seated immediately in a fairly full restaurant. It quickly became apparent that most of the tables were waiting for checks, so we figured we were starting off on the right foot. The fabulous busboy brought us our chips and salsa and waters. And we waited. And waited. And waited for a full 15 minutes before a server came over to take our order. I got the combo with a chicken taco and a chicken enchilada; my boyfriend got the enchiladas verde. And then we waited. And waited. And waited. The busboy (again) came and filled our waters and brought more chips. Then we waited some more. Until 35 minutes later when our food was delivered. 

And after all that waiting the best food I had was the free salsa on the table. No joke. The free salsa with chips was the best thing I ate. We then had to flag the busboy (yes again) down to bring our check. I didn't even let him set it down before handing him my card to pay. I was done waiting. We then saw our waitress for the last time as she brought our check. I hardly recognized her. But I can tell you exactly what the busboy looks like and that he was working his bum off the whole time. If I'd had any cash I would have handed him the tip directly.

We will not be returning to Three Amigos. I'm honestly not pleased that I've now paid $50 for two meals and both were mediocre with some of the worst service I've had. Ever.
