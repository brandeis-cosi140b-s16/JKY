I tried this place again Friday for lunch.  It's still meh.

This time, we didn't sit on the patio.  The wait service was better, but it took much too long for our plates to hit the table.  Hello, it's lunch time on a Friday, and we didn't order any alcohol, that might be a clue that we've got things to do.  

The food was just OK.  The closest comparison I can think of is to El Torrito.  That's not a compliment.    

I've eaten here many times over the years, and my sense is it's gone down hill.  I'll probably skip this place the next time I'm in town.
