The food was just okay, I have had much better from many taco joints.  I am rather bummed because this place is not far from where I live.  

My sister and I ordered chicken, carnitas, and carne asada tacos to share.  The carne asada was the best of the 3, but nothing to write home to mom about.  The carnitas was overcooked and crispy/burnt/dry.  The chicken taco was pretty good, but again nothing exciting.  The sauces (green and red salsa) were not very spicy and rather blah.  I can say the service was very fast and the prices were cheap.  Most of the tables were not cleaned off in the restaurant.  Also, we ordered everything without guacamole and that seems to be their claim to fame, so maybe we are a bit biased and missing out on the key ingredient.  

I will be back if I am in desperate need of a taco nearby, but I will hopefully find a better place before that desperate moment occurs.
