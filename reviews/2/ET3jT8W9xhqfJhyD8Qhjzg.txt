Wife and I having dinner here for the first time.  It was quite busy.  Dining area was clean, staff friendly, kitchen appeared clean.  However, the bathroom was disgusting.  Food was just ok.  We did have to ask for our table to be wiped off and was left sticky.  We'll probably be back....  Just use your bathroom at home!!!!
