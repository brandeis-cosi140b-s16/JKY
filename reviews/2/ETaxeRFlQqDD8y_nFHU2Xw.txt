what happened to the menu? i went for the enchiladas but the only kind they had on the menu contained egg. not to mention the entire menu has been drastically pared down offering not much of a selection. and the chips and salsa have actually gone up to $7. we ordered chips and salsa, one beer, one soda and two entrees (me tacos, the boyfriend fajitas)  for a grand total of $60. the price is a bit tough to justify and i don't see us going back anytime soon, which is disappointing.
