Terrible.  Server didn't even come to our table.  Took our order from the station which was near our table.  I asked if they had Mojitos, she told me No and never took any alternate drink order (if she'd bothered to come to the table maybe she could have given me other options).  Fish tacos were so-so, I didn't finish them.  Everything seemed to come from a can.  Bland, and mushy.   Service was pretty uninspired and not very quick.  Walk a little further or stop at the burger place in the airport.  Charlotte airport has so many other options.  Our meal was over $50 for 2 fish tacos, a burrito, and a margarita.  Considering the quality, they should be ashamed.
