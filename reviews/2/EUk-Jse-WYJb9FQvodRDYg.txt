Very average Mexican food. Glasses and utensils wrre, in some cases, dirty. We sat outside and asked for the heater but didn't get it... It sat there unused. Someone else asked for it and also didn't get it...but then another party asked for it and got it! The manager came by asked how everything was and got an earful but appeared to ignore it. Food was not offensive but nothing special either.
