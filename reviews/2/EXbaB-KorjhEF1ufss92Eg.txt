Phoenix magazine listed this place to be best taco and cheap margarita. The margaritas are only $3.00 and are listed as fresh squeezed citrus, yet it comes out of a tap.  A little too sweet for my taste. As for the tacos, I ordered the chipotle chicken taco and grilled Napoles taco.  They were out of the Napoles, bummer.  The chicken taco is loaded with meat, but it is sweet.  It tastes like shredded BBQ chicken in a taco, just weird.   
As for service we sat at the bar.  The gal who helped us was a little slow, but it is only her 3rd day so she is still learning. No biggie
All in all, I guess this just isn't the place for me.
My husband, however, had the pork belly taco and loved it minus the slaw.  It was too vinegary for him, but he really dislikes vinegar.
I did really like the atmosphere and art work.
