This is the closest location to me so this is where I go. However, the last 3 times I've gone, it's been a disappointment. Twice thin chips were stale. The food has just been nasty and very skimpy. I've had a good experience ordering through the app and my order being ready, but the good itself has been disappointing. This is the last time I go to this location.
