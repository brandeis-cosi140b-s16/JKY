My birthday dinner was pretty much dissed by the servers here. I made reservations a week before but most everything was messed up and they didn't care. They had one server for THE WHOLE PATIO. We even had to ask for menus, waters, and chips since we weren't talked to until 20 mins after getting there. Half of the group didn't get their food and mine came out cold. The only thing that they did right was give me a birthday shot and I can't resist their Mole sauce (reason for the extra star). We were stuck there for over 3 1/2 hours due to the lack of good service. Go here if you have nothing else to do during the night since the servers do not care about you or your time at all.
