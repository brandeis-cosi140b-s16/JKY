So I bought the groupon to this place for our Vegas trip this week. We get there from walking a mile from our casino to find that they open at 4 (it was like 2ish). We were going to have a late lunch there. I wanted to use the group on so we decided to eat a light lunch and go there for drinks and apps at 4ish. We get back and it happened to be happy hour. I told them I had a groupon and they said I couldn't use it on happy hour. Weird bc the groupon did not say we couldnt. But Ok... So show me what I can get. It seemed like such a hassle.The waitress said we couldn't get margaritas bc it was happy hour and it took her like 10 min just to bring us the reg menu. We decided to just forfeit the groupon and order from the happy hour despite the fact that the groupon did not specifically say it couldnt be used on happy hour. As we sat we saw a couple other disgruntled customers over the groupon/happy hour issue, one of which ordered $50 worth of food and drinks specifically bc she had the group on. She harrassed and literally yelled at the manager until she got compensated. I should have but with the super slow service we were just ready to get out of there and not hear screaming customers anymore. For 2 margaritas and nachos to take an hour from ordering to getting the receipt was just absurd and annoying. Overall the service was super slow, and our margaritas tasted like the cheap Jose mix. The Plus side was we ordered the nachos and those were delicious! Maybe dinner would be better especially with the groupon usage but this experience was just poor.
