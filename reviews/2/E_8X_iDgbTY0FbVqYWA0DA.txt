Came in today, kind of late for lunch, about 1:00/pm. Were seated promptly, and had chips and salsa pretty quick.
Our waiter, a young kid named Nick, came by to find out what we wanted to drink (2 waters), and then seemed to kind of hurry us through ordering.

Our entrees were brought out, and almost literally dropped, and then Nick took off immediately.  There was no "is there anything else I can do for you - enjoy your meal" etc.  Just a drop and go.  He did walk past, back and forth, and practically did all he could do, NOT to look at us, or at our table.  What if we wanted more salsa, or chips??  

He NEVER checked on us again.  Apparently, it was his time to leave for the day, and I saw him take his to-go order, and GO!  He didn't come by and tell us he was leaving, and that another waiter could help us.  He was just GONE.
It was a very poor way to do business!!
