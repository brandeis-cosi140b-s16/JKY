The place itself is pretty cozy and inviting.
The price ... It's decent. You can get a meal complete with water, chips and salsa, and a main dish for approximately 20.00 (tax and tip included).

We dined on a Monday. The bar area was busy, the main dining area had bout ten diners (excluding my party). 

We were seated promptly, chips and salsa was served timely as well... And it just went down hill from there! :/

Service was very sloooow! It seems that the restaurant was very short staffed. Our meals did not arrived for nearly 40 mins, and we waited another 20 mins for our tab. Once we received it, we hand to wait for another 20 mins for someone to help us pay our tab.
