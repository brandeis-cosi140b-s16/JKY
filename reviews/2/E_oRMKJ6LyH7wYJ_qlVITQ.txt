Food isn't bad...

Service is horrible. Came here with about 20 people for a wedding rehearsal dinner and it took hours to get food and drinks. The bride and groom got their food last and it took 3 times for them to make the salmon as requested. The owner came out and said they didn't hear that she wanted it well done but also noted she couldn't make a 3rd one because they already made two. 

The food really isn't too bad but the service and timing is off the charts bad. I would look other places for your Mexican fix
