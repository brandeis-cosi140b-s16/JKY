The worst customer service from the guys, the girls were being accommodating. They were not prepared for a lunch rush, no brown rice almost out of white (the base of everything pretty much!) the manager came out and looked around and went back to whatever he was doing in the back. You can tell management is the problem. They had no system or help.
