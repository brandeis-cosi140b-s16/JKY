It's ok if your hungry but taco bell tastes better. It's a buffet, so don't expect the best. Beans are dry and taste like they came from a can. Rice is bland. Enchiladas are gross. Sadly the best thing they offer is the sopapillas at the end. Drizzle with honey and your in heaven. For the price and amount of food you can get, it's ok. But if you want flavorful authentic Mexican food, keep on driving. 

Also, a bit of warning. Both me and my roommate at the time, both ended up with upset stomachs after eating here. Did we eat too much? Its possible. Was it the food? probable.

Note: Please don't mistake this BUFFET place for the authentic, sit-down restaurant on Central Ave in south Phoenix. Ponchos in South Phoenix has excellent, authentic and really tasty 'home-cooked' style food. 
This buffet place? Well, again, think of Taco Bell, cafeteria style.

While its not HORRIBLE, its not very good. Save your money.
