Not impressed the food was over seasoned and even the patio was loud.Should cactus salad have cactus? Mine didn't.

I have to lean towards Bill M's response. I think the name and location makes this a so called "hip"place to go. I just prefer to taste my food not have it covered up with "a hint of lime"which must have been a whole lime. Not real anxious to go back but who knows.
