Pros: Full bar, salsa bar

Cons: No bartender, watery salsas, poor service.

We visited this shop for a weekend lunch.  We were starving and didn't have a lot of time, so we opted to quickly sit at the bar.  We waited 5 minutes, and a server brought us chips.  We then went and picked out a few salsas from the salsa bar.

Out of the 4 salsas I tried, I liked none of them.  They were very thin and watery, and the plastic containers are smaller than the chips - so you can only dip the corner of a chip (but the salsa won't stick), and you can't pour the salsa onto a chip (because it will run off).  The only chips that sort of work are the 'defective' folded ones. I have no idea why everyone raves about the salsa bar, perhaps for the novelty of it, but chips don't work as a salsa-delivery vehicle for watery salsa.

After 10 minutes, we still did not have water, and 15 minutes into us sitting there, we apologized and left.  Their tacos may well be amazing, but we didn't have time to sit around.  Waiting for 15 minutes (literally) with no water delivery during an AZ summer should be criminal.

There appeared to only be 2 servers for the entire restaurant, and no bartender, and they clearly couldn't handle a lunchtime rush by themselves.  Luckily, there are many other excellent taco shops in the area.
