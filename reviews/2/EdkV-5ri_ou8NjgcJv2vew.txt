The sangria is pretty good, and is more reasonable by the pitcher than by the glass.  There's also a happy hour special of 1/2 price apps, so that's Ok too. 

 I've been to Frida a few times over the last few years, always at someone else's suggestion but would not go out of my way to eat there.  The service is OK, and appears to have improved since my last visit. 

Food value is fair, so while I'm not in love with the place, I don't leave feeling completely ripped off either.
