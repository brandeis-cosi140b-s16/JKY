It seems interesting to me that this place has gotten some really good reviews.  I guess neither I nor my husband "get it."  My husband and I visited this place shortly after it opened.  So, maybe it had made some changes?

We had the carnita's burrito.  In my opinion, it was not that great and totally overpriced for what you get.  The carnitas was dry and there was an odd sweetness, perhaps a sweet salsa, in the filling.  I am a salty, savory, spicy person.  I don't like my burritos to be sweet.  

I don't think I would visit this place again.  I am just not into it.

For some reason it is difficult to find a good Mexican restaurant in Tempe.  I really don't understand why.  

My go to is Restaurant Mexico or Chipotle for something quick and cheap in the Tempe area.
