In Short: It's not the greatest  but you do get a mountain of food.  This is OK if you are drunk.

Filibertos is a staple for drunken college kids around ASU, it's fast and cheap, and you can feed a small army with one plate.  Except for that, there's nothing much to write about.  Most of the food contain loads of carbs, some meat and a unhealthy slathering of cheese, guacamole, sour cream, and oil (it's more like a combination of all or some of the ingredients).  That's pretty much it, not much frills.  If you are drunk, I'd say this will be the place to go to get some food in you, but as mexican food goes, this is around the bottom of the list.
