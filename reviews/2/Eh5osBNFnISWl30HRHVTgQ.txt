came in for a simple shrimp cocktail and a ceviche,the cocktail was pricey for the size and the amount of seafood in it ,also not much flavor to it,same thing with the ceviche casuelita at 15 dollars I really spected beter ,no seasoning or flavor on the ceviche whatsoever ,i could do much better without even trying.total waste of money and time probably would not come back
