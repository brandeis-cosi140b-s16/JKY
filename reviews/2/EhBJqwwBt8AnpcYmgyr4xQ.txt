Ninfa's used to be our favorite Mexican spot in Glendale, but no more.  With the revision of the menu came the elimination of all the things we loved about the menu.  No more carnitas, seafood enchiladas or ceviche.  I understand that some people wanted a less expensive menu, and they made the change for them.  I guess we're just not the target audience.  We won't be going back until carnitas are back on the menu.
