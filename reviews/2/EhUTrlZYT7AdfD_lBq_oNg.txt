I had my first experience at the Maki Taco truck on Friday at Rural Hill.  After committing to staying in the hour-long line, I was very disappointed by the bland tacos.  I had the coconut curry chicken tacos.  I barely tasted any of the flavors in the taco.  My husband had the Maki Shrimp tacos, again, theses tacos were bland.  No Asian influence or flavor stood out in these tacos.  I will not visit this cart in the future.
