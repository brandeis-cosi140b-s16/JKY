There are way too many legit Mexican spots in the city to waste your time here...the food is no good, plain and simple.  The quesadillas had way too much greasy unseasoned meat and very little cheese, the rice was bland and the refried beans were disgusting.  I think the bar area is keeping this place open since most of the patrons were having margaritas......
