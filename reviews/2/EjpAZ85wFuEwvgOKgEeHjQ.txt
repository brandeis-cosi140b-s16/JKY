Visited with a vegetarian friend, because she loves the tofu options.

I ordered three tacos, and chips with salsa. The "red" salsa was inedibly salty, as in "soy sauce" salty. The green was pretty good, and the chips were thin, fresh and crispy.

The tacos were awful. The chorizo taco was literally a spoonful of ground chorizo (beef?) on a corn tortilla with a few specs of raw white onion and cilantro. Boring. The pulled pork taco was exactly the same. The jerk chicken taco actually had some toppings on it, mango and pickled something with an avocado sauce, but the chicken tasted rancid (seriously, it was not right) and I declined to eat it. They were nice enough to take it off my bill.

My friend's jerk tofu was actually quite good. Spicy and perfectly cooked, with rice and a few delicious friend plantains with mango and pickled something (I'm not sure what).

I don't live in this city, but if I did, I wouldn't recommend it except for the tofu. It was a strange experience.
