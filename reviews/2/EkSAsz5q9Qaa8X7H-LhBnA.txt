So I went out to dinner with my neighbor and our kids. I was iffy about this place all together because I usually go to the original Garcia's on 35th ave in Encanto. Well, when we first got there, they sat us close to a whole bunch of people.. I'm sure that restaurant is bigger and they can spread us out a bit.. We gave him our order and what not and they brought the food back pretty fast. When I received my chimichanga enchilada style, they gave me like a teaspoon of sour cream and very little rice (which is my favorite :( ..) I'm used to restaurants giving a good heaping serving. Well not even halfway through my meal, I asked the man if he could give me a little more because they didn't give me much the first time. When I received my bill, he ended up charging me for more sour cream. I tried explaining to him that he gave me a tiny bit in the first place. He told me he needed to speak to his manager about it.. I'm like really dude, for some sour cream? Well he ended up taking 50 cents off the bill.. Seriously........50 cents? Would it really hurt the restaurant to give me more sour cream? This isn't a big issue because the food was okay.. The customer service just sucked and I won't be going back..
