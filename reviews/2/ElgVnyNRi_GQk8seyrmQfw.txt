Very disappointed with food and service. I am rarely in the University area but went to Northlake mall a few weeks ago with a friend and decided to grab lunch here. I have always enjoyed Azteca off Independence. I had been to this location several years ago and it was ok but not this time. The server we had apparently had  someplace he needed to be or would rather be. He was very impatient when we were trying to decide what to eat. Once we decided the meals were not as good as in the past. I ate less than half of mine and the server never asked if everything was ok just came by and said are you done and took my plate. Oh well, not like I would be going back here soon but now I will certainly not recommend it.
