Yelp was not so helpful on our food hunt in Apache Junction. We went on a nice hike and found ourselves very hungry. Rather than driving back to Phoenix to eat, we decided to YELP search out something yummy and well reviewed in the area. Mexican sounded appealing, so Los Gringos won out.

We arrived quickly and found ample parking (as if we wouldn't in Apache Junction). We were seated quickly and offered drinks. About 15 minutes passed without our water. We were quite parched from the hike and the heat and desperately wanted water. Do I need to get it myself? Finally, when I was about to trip the waitress, she noticed us looking like cacti and brought us water. She apologized and took our order. Enchilada Poblano and a grande burrito.

It seemed like forever until our food came. We also had to ask for water refills several times. It seemed like the wait staff just disappeared for long stretches at a time. The wrong dish was served to me, though it ended up looking far better than what did finally arrive. The food was average. I cannot say that I was impressed and I also can not say it was bad. It just filled my belly but did not make me jump for joy. I do not think Mexican usually does, but I was hoping.

Overall, meh is about right. I was terribly disappointed by the service, despite them all being very nice. I just expect to not be forgotten for 10 plus minutes at a time. I will not be back here.... but I will also not likely be back in Apache Junction. I recommend you try another place in Apache Junction, though, if you are looking for something good.
