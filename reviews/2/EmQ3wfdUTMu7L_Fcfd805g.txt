I was bored and hungry on tour, found this place thanks to my Yelp app, and decided to go for a walk in the hot Arizona sun for a Corona and a burrito. 
Fast, friendly service. Decent food. I couldn't pick up my burrito because it came out on my plate already split underneath. Luckily I'm the type of person who doesn't mind if he has to eat his burrito with a fork an knife. 
I ordered the "mix" meat burrito which was consisted of chicken, pork, and beef. About half way through my burrito, I realized there was little chopped up bits of hot dog in the meat mix...weird. I saw Mexican hot dogs as an item on their menu but didn't think they would make their way into my burrito. But it was good, so of course I continued to eat it. 
No free chips and salsa, although there was an open salsa bar with a really good salsa verde along with other salsas and hot sauces, jalapenos and carrots and onions, limes, and even cucumber. 
Oh and the $2 coronas all day every day is always a plus. 
All in all, it was decent but I wouldn't go out of my way to go back there to eat. Maybe to drink though :)
