The chip and salsa were really good. But the rest of the meal was not. I had a chicken burrito with rice and beans. The chicken was really dry and they gave me maybe two diced tomatoes and a couple of shreds of lettuce to go with it. I love beans but their beans I did not. Not much flavor. Maybe something else might be better. The person that went with me got the fajita salad and thought it was good.
