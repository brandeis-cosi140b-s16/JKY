I had the Mexican hot dog.  The dog was boiled not grilled.  The bacon was bacon bits sprinkled on top.  The "bun" was cold as were most of the toppings which quickly cooled down my dog to lukewarm.  My friend had the chicken stuffed burrito and she said it seemed like the chicken was boiled also.  My other friend did enjoy the tortilla soup and beef taco.  And everything but the soup was served on styrofoam.  I am so Not a fan of styrofoam.
