The place has excellent customer service and it's very clean, however, they severely lack on the quality of the food. I ordered two Carne Asada tacos and a vegetarian quesadilla. Bad idea! The meat was dry and tough, the tortilla wasn't heated at all when they brought it to me and on the quesadilla, there was too much cheese, ugh. Also, the guacamole has no flavor what so ever. The quesadilla was bland and I really did have to smother it in Tapatio sauce to give it any flavor. On the bright side, the chips and salsa were decent and the employees and awesome but I think I will have to pass on this place again for lunch.
