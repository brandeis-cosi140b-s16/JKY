I went a couple of weeks ago for the first time with my boyfriend and some friends. I was eager to try it out. It was 7:00 on a Saturday and the server told us they were out of chips. I asked if they had tortillas or tostadas so I broke them up by myself. She told me they wouldn't "charge me extra". Next, they were out of CHICKEN for tacos, jambalaya, etc. but they still had a chicken breast for an entr√©e?? You can't shred it/cut it up?? THEN they were out of hot sauce. So, you're a Mexican restaurant and you are out of chips, chicken, AND hot sauce?! As a business, you can't go to the store before Saturday night service to prepare for the evening? This was beyond a disappointing experience. I would only hope the original restaurant was better. Although I work around the corner, I will most likely consider other restaurants nearby.
