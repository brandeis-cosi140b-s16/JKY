I went there for lunch a few weeks ago.  There were a few patrons sitting down.  It seemed to take awhile for someone to help me-between who I presumed to be the owner, who was doing work in the middle of the restaurant, to the other two people who helped me, I was never quite sure who my waiter/waitress was.  

The food arrived and as the other reviewer stated, the plate was scolding hot- really, it was too hot to eat.  As far as flavor, it was alright.  Since it is very close to my apartment, I might go back .  I hope their service is a bit better though next time around.
