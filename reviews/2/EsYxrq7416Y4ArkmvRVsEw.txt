The food looked much better than it tasted. The salsa tasted like plain tomatoes, and the chicken in my quesadilla was brown and tasteless. Prices are average. I paid about 9 bucks for a medium sized quesadilla and a small drink. My order was also forgotten. The only positive I can think of is the complimentary chips and salsa (despite the average quality of the salsa). Wouldn't go back.
