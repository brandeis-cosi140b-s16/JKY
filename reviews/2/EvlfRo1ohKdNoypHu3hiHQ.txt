For some reason, I pictured that when ordering a 'Blue Burrito' it would come in a blue corn tortilla.  But it didn't.  (Maybe it used to but Godzilla-sized crows have decimated the blue corn supply? An upset in the food supply as blue corn farmers switch to growing the oh-so-popular quinoa?)  

I had the signature Blue Burrito made without meat and without cheese (on that veggie kick again) and it was pretty marginal. Just your usual black bean, rice, salsa affair that was unfortunately tasteless.  The guacamole tasted exceptionally over-mayoed.  Being from Southern California, I always have high expectations for Mexican fare and am routinely disappointed when I'm not dining in my hometown.  Also, I had a little heartache over the fact this puppy set me back $9.39.  Not a great way to begin a 2-hour layover.
