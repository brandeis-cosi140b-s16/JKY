This place is awful. The only thing that bamba's has is that it is open late enough that if you are drunk, you may eat it.  Just NEVER during the day. I got massive food poisoning from here. 

The only reason it gets two stars is because it really is a part of campus nostalgia. Everyone knows bambas.
