Don't think about asking to 'pick-up' your food, they won't allow it! 

This was a little frustrating as I was coming home from work, I needed to get into my hotel room, eat, shower and pass out.  I get there and the first thing I ask is why can't I order to go, I get a response that because too many people were ordering food and not picking it up, oh please- that is the worse line of bull I have ever heard.  I should have thought about it, I'm sure it's a hotel policy that makes them do it because they want the individuals to play while they wait for their food.  I'm told, oh its quick- literally 5-6 minutes, I'm sitting here thinking that's not even possible, but let's see it happen! No, it wasn't possible, that girl lied worse than a politician- the food took almost 20 minutes and it wasn't worth that much of a wait for the rush I was in.  

I got the steak fajitas with the whole wheat flour tortilla, and the first thing to mention is the tortilla (which there were two) were hard and crusty on the outside, like CRUUUUSSSSTTYY!! I ripped the edges off and said whatever lets dive in and make these babies!  I immediately realized there was about 3 pounds (yes I'm exaggerating, come on people!) of vegetables and 5 oz. (no I'm not exaggerating) of steak.  Literally I'm talking 6 small little pieces of steak with what I guess a whole large onion and 2 bell peppers.  The steak was good, I will say- but the overall flavor of how the onions and peppers cooked was not great, it just was bland- not a fan at all! 

Will I go back yes. Was I happy with the service, not so much.  I didn't like being told I couldn't pre order, I didn't like that the girl bold face lied to me about the cook time, and I didn't like that I had what felt like tortillas from the early 2000's and I wasn't happy that I got less steak than the scraps I feed my dogs.  

Give this place a try, but maybe try something other than the fajitas!
