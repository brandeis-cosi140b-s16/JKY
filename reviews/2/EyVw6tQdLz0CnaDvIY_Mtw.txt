I don't normally even make comments...but this place needs work. I went there today because I got a gift card and figured I'd enjoy some chipotle for lunch as I often do. I noticed this one was really close to my apartment, less than a mile. I asked for a chicken burrito to go, and when I got home, which only takes about 2 minutes, my burrito was cold. Normally the chicken,beans and rice are hot and the only thing cold is the cheese and sour cream. The chicken tasted burnt and as if it had been sitting out all day. Also, the young lady who made my burrito, although very nice, ripped it on both ends and said "be careful it's ripped on both sides" without offering to rewrap it or make a new one. I got home and put it in a bowl because it just fell apart. I might give this place one more chance because it's so close to my apartment, but I sure hope this was a one time deal.
