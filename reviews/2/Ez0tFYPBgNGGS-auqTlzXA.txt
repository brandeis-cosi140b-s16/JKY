Decided to check this place out since we had a good experience at the steak house next door.  They brought us chips, 2 salsas and a bean dip.  Chips tasted commercialized, salsa gave me the impression of store bought that was blended and the beans came from a can.  Maye they didn't but it tasted like it.  I ordered the Mole poblano and a bowl of tortilla soup.  First they brought me Albondigas (Mexican meatball soup).  I sent it back and they brought me tortilla soup.  It was FILLED with thin tortilla chip strips.  It wasn't bad, I would say 2.5 stars.  The chesse was one continuous glob at the bottom but the broth flavor was decent.  Then the main dishes came.  My mole was WAY too sweet and had no spice in it.  The rice was crumbly, beans too dry but the corn tortillas were as good as they come from a bag.  I didn't finish my whole meal (or the soup).  Wife ordered a side salad with ranch and it was average (ranch was good and salty which we like).  Her fajitas were ordered with no tomatoes but came with it.  She ordered a side of cheese and the waiter didn't bring it out.  They also did not include the Guacamole like they were supposed to.  The fajitas were okay, had decent flavor from the "charring" but could have used a little salt.  The veggies were way too oily for my liking.  Overall, food and service I will not be going back.
