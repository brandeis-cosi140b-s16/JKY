Damnit, damnit, damnit! I wanted to write a good review of this little mom and pop restaurant. On the surface it's got a lot going for it; it's quaint and sufficiently run down enough to make you think it's one of those small gems, it's gotten great reviews
In the past, it smells like a good Mexican food place should, and it's been around forever. 
Unfortunately it did not live up to expectations. I got a bean burrito with sour cream and a large horchata. The tortilla was excellent, but the beans were so cold that they didn't melt (or ever warm) the clump if cold cheese inside, leaving me with what is essentially a burrito-cicle. I came in relatively early at 11:10 so I suspect that they just were not really ready for me. The taste wasn't bad, it was just that it was too cold to really enjoy. 
As a sidenote, the horchata was so sweet that it was almost undrinkable, and had the taste and consistency of coffee creamer.
What a shame.
