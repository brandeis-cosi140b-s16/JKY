A friend recommended this place when I was craving a breakfast burrito. Meh, not that great. Just your basic breakfast burrito, nothing super special. I had to ask for a customized burro and ended up not getting everything I ordered on it. It almost feels like a cafeteria more than a restaurant inside. Casual is kind of an understatement. Felt a little dirty, Plastic tablecloths that smelled of mildew and less than adequate dining furniture. Oh well. It's been there a long time so maybe I am in the minority here!
