Here we go another Americanized Mexican restaurant kind of a copy cat of Garcias but not as good .. Food is decent rice is horrible and bland beans are beans and salsa is just that salsa. Had the Pollo Fundido which is a green chile chicken chimi cover in sour crean and cheddar cheese melt over the top. It was ok had better at Garcias and El Norteno. Just wasn't impressed at all with the quality and look of the place . Time to remold and redo some of them dishes .
