I agree with the reviewer who said "no value at all." That statement pretty much sums up the food at this restaurant. I wanted to like this place. I thought the decor was very cute with a southwestern theme throughout. It felt cozy and quaint. The decor earns the one star. Our server was pleasant, but once bringing over our food didn't really ever come back to check if everything was ok. 

The food was average at best. The prices were ridiculous. My carnitas "platter" was $16.99 and it was a handful of meat, a tablespoon scoop of guacamole, a tablespoon of sour cream, some tasteless beans and rice. The pork was not dry, but it was very flavorless. And being limited on guac, sour cream or any type of sauce to add for flavoring due to the server never coming back around to check on us, my plate was left half eaten. While still a solid amount of food on my plate, another female server comes from behind and asks if I am done. I say yeah, probably....does she offer a box for three quarters of my meal? Nope. I, in nicest way possible, reclaim my plate and ask her for a box. She trots off and drops one off at our table.

Boyfriend had a "macho burrito" which was $14.99...pretty standard, average burrito - in portion and taste. We didn't bother waiting for someone to come by to ask for another box, so we just piled it up in mine.

We ordered a strawberry margarita to share..it was ok tasting..they of course use low quality tequila like cuervo in it, but the price was $11.99!

A simple bean and cheese burrito was $10.99. Beans and cheese and a tortilla...$11 bucks.  They need to truly re evaluate their prices or really improve on their food if they plan on sticking around.
