Meh. This place is okay. I'm sure it's a nice lunch spot for businesses in the area, it wasn't the sit down place that it appeared to be. The staff wasn't very helpful with suggestions or directions and I probably won't be going back. There were a few things I didn't like, they served their guacamole on a bed of chips instead of in a bowl, which made them soggy. They used a pre made guacamole, which sucked. We had to ask them to put ice in the ice machine. Over all it wasn't a great experience. I'd pass on it and go somewhere else.
