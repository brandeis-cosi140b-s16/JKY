Okay, so I don't understand how you mess up my order not only once, but twice! I ordered a two combo plate (pork tamale w/ green sauce on top & a chicken taco). When they brought out my food, it was a chicken tamale w/ green sauce and a cheese enchilada. It was not alt all what I ordered.. So the next time they brought my food, they brought out a pork tamale w/ red sauce and a chicken taco. Again Wong order.. Finally I get the correct order after everyone in my party was done eating! However, the food want that bad, it was actually pretty good.. My me need up being free, but come on guys.. Get ur stuff together.. The waiter was nice, but I just don't understand how u mess up an order twice. I also should mention that my spouse order a carne Asada burrito topped with shredded cheese and green sauce, which they forgot to put on his burrito and my mother order green sauce and sour cream on her chimichanga which they did my put on again.. So do yourself a favor and make sure that they get ur order correct!
