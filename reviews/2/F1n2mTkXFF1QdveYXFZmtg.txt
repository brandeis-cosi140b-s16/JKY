I would recommend skipping this restaurant.

Reasons to avoid this place:

1.)  The service is poor.  Example, we waited 42 minutes to place our order.

2.)  The food is poor.  My 4 year old complained that the chicken strips were gross.  4 year olds can be picky and don't make very trustworthy food critics but I tried them and indeed they were disgusting.

I ordered the Carnitas Hacienda and it was quite poor for a $30 dish.  You can drive 5 miles to the Senor Taco in the Walmart parking lot and get far superior Carnitas Tacos.  Senor Taco is delicious btw.  2 Carnitas tacos there will set you back $6.  Seriously I challenge the chef at La Hacienda to go to Senor Taco and learn how to properly prepare some of their dishes.

3.)  The prices are very high for the food quality.  $30-$45 per person is an entry level high end price and the food is Cheesecake Factory quality.

There is much better food locally for far cheaper prices.
