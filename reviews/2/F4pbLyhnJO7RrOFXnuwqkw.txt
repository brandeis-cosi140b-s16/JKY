I was disappointed with the food.  I havent been to a La Parrilla Suiza since I left Tucson in 93 and I had hoped this would be what I remembered.  I even drove way out of the way just to have good experience but it was not good.  It was pretty bland and boring.  The chips were good and the service was o.k. even though the server forgot the beans I ordered but after I got the food had a couple bites I was already over it and didnt care about the beans anymore.  Wish I could find a good Mexican joint!
