Went here for the first time tonight. It was crowded, but we were sat right away on the outdoor patio. Our waitress was very nice and helpful. Our appetizer came out pretty quickly.  After looking around at the tables near us I noticed no one had any entrees, and shortly after realizing this another waiter came to tell his table that the kitchen was very backed up. Not a big deal but definitely raised a flag. We waited about 15-20 minutes for food, which wasn't even that bad, but the manager was making rounds apologizing to everyone saying that it usually isn't this long of a wait.  

After receiving our food we had multiple problems. Both entrees came out incomplete. We ordered a salmon baja bowl and a chicken and shrimp burrito. The salmon bowl came out with no salmon (go figure) and the burrito came with only chicken and was missing shrimp. To compensate for these mistakes we were given the burrito at half price ($5.75 off) and received the shrimp in a to-go box.  

I must say this was a majorly disappointing experience. I've heard great things about this place, and the food was delicious even though it was all wrong. Sadly due to the lack of care from the kitchen I won't be returning to Cabo Fish Taco. I can get the same quality of food at a different place that offers reliable service. Food tasted pretty good, at least.
