The food here is excellent BUT the service is so terrible it makes pretty much any other Mexican food place's service look like the Ritz. My husband and I work the graveyard shift and they are one of thee only restaurants around us that is still open when we get off. Going there one night I noticed the guy taking our order wasn't wearing a uniform. The food was disgusting that night and gave us food poisoning. A few days later we noticed that our credit card that we had paid with there had been copied and was now being used. The only place we used that card in almost two months was at Filiberto's. They've pretty much lost our business forever because I don't carry cash and I don't trust them with my cards anymore. They're fine before ten o'clock at night, after that--DO NOT BOTHER. The service normally sucks bad enough, but this tipped it over the edge.
