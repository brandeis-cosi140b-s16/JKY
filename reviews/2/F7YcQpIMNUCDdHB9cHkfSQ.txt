a few of us decided to stop here for some food before going out. We were seated right away and a server came over in a decent amount of time. She seemed pissed when we tried to order food and drinks at the same time. it took forever to get the drinks and the food came out almost right after the drinks. Several times we had to go to the hostess and ask for out server. The food was nothing special and with this bad of service there is not a planned return in the near future.
