I hate to do this because I always try to support small businesses when they are just starting up. But I simply cannot recommend this place. I came in  with a friend fairly excited expecting a California burrito with fries and the like, but that wasn't even on the menu. Instead we got bland and not particularly authentic Mexican food. 

PROS:  The beans were the only part of the items I tasted that actually tasted very good to me. The meat all seemed to be very high quality. The shredded chicken was good but a little under-seasoned.The inside was nice enough and the staff was kind. 

CONS: YELLOW AND WHITE SHREDDED CHEESE MIX that tasted like it was from Walgreens. I'm sorry but for me quality mexican food uses chihuahua cheese, queso fresco, or if they absolutely have to, high quality Monterey jack. The supermarket cheese blend was liberally thrown allover everything  in a misguided attempt to plate the food. On the nachos the cheese wasn't even melted. For the flauta, the fillings inside were cold, which was awkward because the tortilla was fried and piping hot. The quesadilla was were the cheese really disappointed me, when I paid  nearly $4 for a cheese only quesadilla I expect some good quality melty mexican cheese and lots of it. Instead we received something that would cost a dollar to make in a dorm-room or any place that has a microwave. 

OK: The guacamole is ok. It's without question very fresh, but I don't think its house-made. The chips were standard.
