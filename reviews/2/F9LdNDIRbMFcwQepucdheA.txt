Recently visited Frank and Lupes. Food was very good but service was slow. In fact, we had to go to the bar to order drinks because our waiter wasn't coming over to our table.  At the end of dinner, my dinner partner left the table to use the restroom, and our waiter came over and asked me if I was waiting to be seated......this after he had been already waiting on me for an hour and a half.
