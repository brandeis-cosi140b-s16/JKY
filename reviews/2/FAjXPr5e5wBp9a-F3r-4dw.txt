We split a breakfast burrito, which had a decent chorizo flavor, but the egg was fake and not very appetizing. The salsa was not good at all and we were afraid to eat it after visual inspection. I also felt a bit sick afterwards and this was the only thing I ate. Chili's express might be a better choice for airport dining.
