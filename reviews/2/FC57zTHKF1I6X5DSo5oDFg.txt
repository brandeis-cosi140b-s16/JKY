Went for lunch with my husband.  I ordered 2 al'a carte items off the menu (taco & enchilada).  They didn't have the prices on the menu for al'a carte.  My husband got the lunch special (burrito).  Chips and salsa were ok.  Both our lunches were ok.  Service was not very good.  Waited for a long time to get the check and when we finally got it, I was shocked that my taco and enchilada was $10.  More than if I would have ordered it with the lunch special.  Same order with rice and beans would have been $8.99.  I asked where the al'a carte prices are on the menu and the waitress said, "they are not listed".  I could have got the same items at a fast food place for $5 and it would have been just as good.  Thumbs down on this place.
