We had an occasion and were seeking a good restaurant.  Scanning options nearby we spotted this place.  Good ratings here on Yelp.  So we decided to go.

Driving by it is not obvious this place is here.  It looks like  motel from the outside.  Inside there is a shop and this restaurant.  The menu is a large board above the counter.  It's a dive.  But the ratings were really good, and a dive isn't necessarily bad.  So we got in line.

The three of us ordered different things.  I got the signature dish (ahogadas Guadalajara), my wife got the caldo de res (soup), and our guest got a chicken burrito.  Plus a side of rice (me).  My wife says her soup was good.  Our guest says her burrito was good.  I didn't notice any great enthusiasm, but they apparently were content.  My dish is essentially a smothered sandwich.  They take the meat they would normally wrap in a tortilla and put it on a bolillo bread.  I see why there wasn't enthusiasm from my dining partners.  My ahogadas was fine.  Not great, but fine.  The sauce tasted a lot like chili powder.  Reminded me of a sauce I made years ago in college that was basically tomato soup and chili powder.  Really underwhelming.  And the rice was REALLY underwhelming.  Very weak flavor.

I've had authentic Mexican food, both in Mexico and here in Phoenix (I still mourn the loss of La Tolteca to fire).  This really isn't it.  If the other reviewers here like it, that's their prerogative.  But I most definitely don't agree that this is particularly authentic or good.  It's not bad.  If I were in high school I could see coming here to get away from school food (as we noticed:  about 15 minutes after we got there the line got VERY long full of high school kids from Chandler High).  But otherwise, no.  I could come here again, but I wouldn't make a point of it.

Real rating would be 2.5 stars if I had that option.
