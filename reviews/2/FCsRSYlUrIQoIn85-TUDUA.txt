An interesting experience to say the least. Went there with a buddy from out of town and we couldn't stop chuckling at the service. Now, it more or less entertained us while waiting for the food to arrive so fine by me. Chips were good not great. Once the food did arrive, my friends beans weren't the least bit warm, other than that, enchiladas  were up-to-par.  I'll go back when I want to be semi-entertained.
