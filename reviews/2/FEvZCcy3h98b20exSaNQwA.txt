I LOVE Chipotles spices they use on their steak and chicken like you cannot believe. What I do not love about this particular establishment is that it seems like every time I go they forget to add a part of my order to the to go bag. It takes me a little while to get here b/c of all the stupid traffic lights from my office off of price and southern.  So it is annoying to get to the office finding out they are forgetting to put someones food that was paid for and having to go back to get it or salad dressing for the salad. Kinda stuff that is crucial.

So annoying.
