I haven't been to Espo's in 10 years and they used to be a staple. I'd heard they got expensive but figured I'd give them the benefit of the doubt. My order of red chili burro enchilada style, side of beans and a fountain drink cost me $12.70!  Why does a hole in the wall (yet tasty) Mexican restaurant charge so much??? Thankfully I skipped the $2.99 side of chips and salsa.

I'll go back to Someburros when that same meal would be under $9 and include chips and salsa. 

Someburros folks- I'm sorry to hate on 'ya but your too expensive...
