I HATE giving bad reviews...its doesn't give me any pleasure or joy but sometimes it needs to be done. 

My family rolled in here today for our favorite crazy chicken. They took our order for the 10 piece combo meal with 3 sides (coleslaw, pinto beans and french fries) and lots of tortillas (that's what we usually order). All goes off well. We find a booth and chill out for a few minutes, then a few minutes becomes a lot of minutes. People behind us got their orders before us (the orders were the same size as ours)..so we began to wonder. Sure enough...we go up to check on it and they had lost/forgotten our order. They were super apologetic about it and brought it out on the double. The food was cooked to perfection and they even threw in some extra tortillas to make up...that's why they are getting two stars (food quality and willingness to admit their mistake). I will be back again and hopefully I can up them to what should be at least a 4 star review (Yay! I'm a fan).
