You can never have a second chance to make a first impression.

I thought I would try this place out and support my local taco shop. Unfortunately I got screwed!

Ordered a Combo platter and a muchaca taco.m to go. They have me my combo platter w no rice and no beans then handed me bean tostada instead of a muchca taco. 

The food was very bland and had no cheese on the enchilada, tacos or the bean burrito. 

For a combo plate and an extra taco it cost me $13, I will not be back and only have it 2 stars because I likes the customer service, but the food sucked! Fast food would have been better..
