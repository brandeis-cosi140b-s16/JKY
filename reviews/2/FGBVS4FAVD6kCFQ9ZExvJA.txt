A friend of mine has been raving about Los Molcajetes for some time now, so a couple of weekends ago a group of friends and I decided to have a late lunch here. Well,   they have live mariachi on Saturdays from 3-5. Goodness. Now as it is I am kind of a grump when it comes to live music in restaurants, and oh my god the place is sooo small and they were using microphones. It was so loud. But then again, I am a grump and sometimes act like an old fart. Everybody else was there to have a good time and not converse with their tablemates. So to each their own.

I didn't particularly like the food either. For the three of us we decided to share two molcajetes, one with beef and another with shrimp and beef. The dish is served with cactus, tomatoes and jalape√±os all smothered in a sauce. For some reason, I thought the dish would be different. I had heard the dish was served with sauce, but some I thought like a chile, tomate y cebolla kind of sauce. Like literally, salsa. So the dish somewhat threw me off. It is a tomato-based sauce. It doesn't taste bad per se, but as I said I was expecting something else.

The service is great; our waitress was super nice and attentive and gets you your beers super fast. Although she could've told us about the cubeta promotion, where you get a bucket of beer for x amount, instead of paying individually for each one.
