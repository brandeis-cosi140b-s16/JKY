As with most chain restaurants, the main difference between different locations is the service. I love Chipotle, and it pains me to give them only 2 stars, but this location just isn't cutting it. I've been in for lunch quite a few times, and it's usually fine. My main complaint is with the phone, online, or fax orders. 

The first time, I placed my order from my iPhone, and naively assumed all was well. I showed up to pick up my order, and the girl explained that their system was broken, and it didn't send my order. She said "this is all it printed" and held up a sheet of paper with my name and phone number on it. Okay, now I completely understand that my order was supposed to be on the piece of paper, but why didn't you just call? I would have been more than happy to repeat my order over the phone 45 minutes ago, so that it was ready when I got there, rather than standing here 5 minutes past my order time repeating it.

One time occurrence, I thought. So, round two. I placed my order online, waited 5 minutes, then called to ensure they received my order. They confirmed my order and the time, and assured me it would be ready. I arrive at my scheduled pick up time, say my name, and they go to check on my order. A moment later, they return, "it will just be a moment". I wait, and wait. I glance toward the back area, and it looks like they are making my order. I wait, and wait. And wait some more. Finally, they come out and hand me my bag, with a "Sorry for the SHORT wait" (they didn't emphasize SHORT, but I am). I glance at my clock, and I am now 17 minutes past my pick-up time. 17 minutes!!!! Meanwhile, the people who walked in the door behind me and went through the line are sitting down, halfway done with their meal. What was the point of ordering beforehand?

Will I go back to this Chiptole? Probably. But I'll only do it when I have plenty of time, and I definitely won't be pre-ordering.
