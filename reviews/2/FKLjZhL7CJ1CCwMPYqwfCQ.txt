Went there for the first time today and didn't taste anything that would get me to come back.

Nice people work there.  Chips and salsa were below average.  The ice tea was fine.  I had several of the street tacos of which only the Pulled Pork would I order again ... though, I doubt I'll return.

Rock Taco is a good idea - kinda reminds me of a Mexican Hard Rock Cafe - however, it needs a better menu.
