I stopped by to grab a bite to eat on my lunch break.... I ordered one of the new shredded chicken quesaritos (which I do have to say are quite tasty!) and a soft taco with NO LETTUCE..... needless to say when the receipt clearly says "no lettuce" you get it anyways! I get that this is a simple mistake, but the point is that it is a simple mistake, just don't put the lettuce on- not that special of an order!

Unfortunately I used the drive thru, so I was unable to go into the restaurant to get the mistake cleared up immediately, so the taco was donated to the trash bin at my office.
