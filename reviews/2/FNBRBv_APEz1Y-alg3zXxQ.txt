Decent Food, Average Service, cheesy decor but killer margaritas. Arribas Margaritas are like a half liter in the largest martini glasses in town. I know why people go there. Its not for the the average mexican fare its definately for the fact they can order one drink and sip it all night long.  I do like the fact that they serve a very good bean dip with their chips. Free anything is good in my opinion. I will add that they have the worst advertising and product photography and it probably scares more people away than gains new customers.
