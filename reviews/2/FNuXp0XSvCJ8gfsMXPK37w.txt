Certainly not the best Mexican food I have ever tried.  Both my partner and I ordered vegetarian entrees and drinks.  For the quality that they churn out I would expect a bit lesser cost.  

The chips were good.  Hot and salty with fresh (I think) salsa.  It was a good start but it sort of ended there.  

The fajita could have been better.  The veggies were mostly peppers and onions.  It was hot but it was also a bit too greasy for my tastes.  The rice and beans were a bit dry (possibly undercooked beans) and the rice seems to have been out a bit too long.  

The burrito was also a bit bland.  Copious amounts of hot sauce were needed to eat it.  Perhaps the ingredients weren't fresh?  Perhaps it was an off night?

The drinks, although expensive, were strong and well mixed.  

In hindsight, I would have been better off going to Chipotle...
