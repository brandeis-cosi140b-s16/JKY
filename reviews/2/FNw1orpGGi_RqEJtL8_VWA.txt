This place seems to be home to bland mexican food that isn't that well prepared.  I have gone through the drive through and it took about 15 -20 minutes to get a cold Chile Reno Burrito with crunchy chiles.  We I ate in the service was fast, but my enchiladas and the sauce really had no flavor.  They need to work on the food prep and up the spice level to get anywhere close to the other options around here.
