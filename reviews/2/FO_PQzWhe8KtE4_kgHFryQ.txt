For some reason, my family likes this place. I'm not such a fan. This is a very mediocre Mexican restaurant. There are much better options in the area. I find the food to be flavorless, American versions of Mexican dishes. For example, the fajitas are served on a plate, not a skillet. Everything just seems watered-down and lackluster.
