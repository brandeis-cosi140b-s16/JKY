I wasn't impressed with La Paz. Like others have said, I wanted to like it. I really wanted another Mexican restaurant to frequent. But the food (I had the steak burrito) was just kinda so-so. 

I have to say...the worst part of my experience was that the hostess sat my friend and I next to a table of about 10 babies and toddlers. Yes, there parents were there, though you wouldn't have known that because the kids were destroying the restaurant and screaming and going crazy. I know this isn't La Paz's fault, but it was pretty ridiculous that they sat us in this terrible spot. The rest of the restaurant was pretty wide open. Not cool.
