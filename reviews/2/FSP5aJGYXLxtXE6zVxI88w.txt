I went here for lunch today on a whim. I've driven past this place hundreds of times and finally decided to give it a try. Besides the enviroment (the tacky decorations, the bad music, the plastic silverware and styrafoam plates) that was bad, I can deal with that. I don't really put too much value in it as long as the food is good. Unfortunately, it was not. I ordered at the counter, and paid almost $11 for a combo plate with two tacos, beans and rice with a fountain drink. I felt that was really high, but sat down excited to get my food anyway. 

They give you a plastic tray with some chips and salsa and hot sauce. I thought it was all pretty bland and very forgettable. My food came out really quickly after I sat down. On my personal rating scale for Mexican food, where 1 is Taco Bell and 10 is the street tacos I had in Mexico, this food was about a 3. I'm not talking about "authenticity". I don't care if you want to call it that. It was gross and bland. The taco shells were hard, but not crunchy. They were more chewy, and gave the tacos their prevailing flavor: vegatable oil. The beans were runny and the rice was also really bland. I ended up dumping the taco contents out of the shell and trying to finish it that way. I really wanted to like this place because it is so close to work, so maybe I will try again sometime and order something else. Or maybe not.
