I wanted to like it.  

The salsa that came with the chips wasn't spicy, looked really good, but it was just tomatoey.  

We had a place of steak and eggs, which the hubby said the eggs weren't all that well cooked and the steak was a thin piece of meat.

Also had a chorizo and egg plate.  The beans were good, but the chorizo was different because it had pico de gallo in it.  It was a big portion that we took leftovers since the kiddos weren't all that into it.

We also had the pozole.  The only thing I liked was the big portion of meat.  The broth was more watery than rich in flavor and the side fixins' were a bottle of tapatio, onion, cilantro and limes.  We were able to share.

The horchata was ok.  I wasn't impressed, but maybe dinner is better?
