We had eaten here two times before, and it was pretty good, which is why we returned.  However, on this last visit, I found a 2.5 inch long bone in my chicken.  When we showed the server, she appeared unfazed and didn't apologize, nor did she offer any type of compensation.  I didn't eat the meal and was still charged full price.  Then, to make matters worse, they asked if we wanted more chips, to which we agreed.  No one said anything about charging for the additional chips; however, we were charged for them on the bill.  This visit turned us off, and we will not likely return.
