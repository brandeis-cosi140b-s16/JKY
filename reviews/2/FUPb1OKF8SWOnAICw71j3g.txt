The food was mediocre. I have also been to the Hilldale location - which in my opinion was much tastier than here. 

We were not served water until about 5 minutes after our arrival and not until after we ordered our drinks (they all came together). The waiter was very pleasant and responsive but also dropped the check off without us asking for it and even before I had finished what I was going to eat of my meal. 

Overall, the experience was OK but I will not be returning to this location.
