Terrible service.  Stood at the hostess area for at least 5 minutes before we were greeted.  Once we were seated, our waitress was MIA for the most part except to take our order and bring our food.  We had to ask our server for Chips and salsa, which are usually the first thing to hit the table.  And that didn't come for another 5-10 minutes.  

The food is your standard Mexican restaurant fare - nothing to write home about though.  

While we were waiting for our server to come by so we could get to-go boxes and the check, Baby C started fussy.  So instead of being "those parents", I took him outside and got him car ready.  I do all this thinking that his dad would be heading out in a few minutes.    

After 10 minutes pass, Im starting to wonder WTH was going on...so I grab the baby and head back inside.  J is still sitting there at the table waiting for our server.  He gets up and asks someone to go get her.  A few minutes later, she comes by....she was apparently tending to silverware.  Yeah, lets forget that you have customers at a table lady.  

We probably wont be back, which is a shame since this is right around the corner from the house.
