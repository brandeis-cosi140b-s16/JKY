I have been in here a few times since they have opened, the food is good and I love their tortillas unfortunately their service still has not gotten any better. I waited almost 30 mins in line last night. Unless they can figure out how to make their line more efficient and it runs smoother and faster I can't see this getting any better. No one knows what they are supposed to be doing and the entire line is so discombobulated you end up having to shout over people. I don't think I will be back in.
