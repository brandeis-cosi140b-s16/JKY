**HAD TO EDIT REVIEW**

*FIRST REVIEW*I am finding it is hit-or-miss with this location. Although, things have been better there since the new ownership. It is definitely much cleaner than it used to be!!!

Sometimes the food is really good, and sometimes it is okay. I guess it just depends on the cooks. Sometimes the service is good, and sometimes it sucks. 

Just plan on a long line in the evening on Tuesdays for $1 taco night, the chicken taco is Muy Bueno!

**EDITED - NEW REVIEW** - This place is going downhill again, FAST! Food consistency is crap. Either the chicken taco's are too spicy or very bland, or the green chile burrito is too hot or barely spicy. The dining area is getting gross and dirty again, and the staff is rude again. They also raised their prices. A bean burrito that used to be about $2.50 is now almost $4!!! For a BEAN BURRITO! I give up on this place........
