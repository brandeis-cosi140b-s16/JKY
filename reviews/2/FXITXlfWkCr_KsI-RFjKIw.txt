ok, the area was a little scary, but I heard the food was good.  Well, it was authentic mexico, and not in a good way.  The service was poor and some of the food came out wrong and they did not care.  The food mosty tasted good...  The place needed a good cleaning as well.  Found much better places to be for this type of food here in Mesa...places where they actually care about the customer!  I think one of the best palces used to be one of these, but sold and cleaned up....I go there...
