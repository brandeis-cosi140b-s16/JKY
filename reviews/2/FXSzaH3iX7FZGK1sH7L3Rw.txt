Okay, maybe Del Taco is not what I remember it being when I was when I lived off of it in LA, but overall this food court is terrifying.  It feels like your ship has dropped anchor in a Disney Pirates Of The Caribbean ride port.

The woman behind us, at 11:30 on a Thursday night, had her 5 week old baby with her, that was about the quality of the food, facilities and people all around.
