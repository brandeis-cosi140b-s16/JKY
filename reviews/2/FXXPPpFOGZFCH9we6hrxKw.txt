Came here for the first time last night-- was with a group of about 15 for a birthday dinner. We all met up at about 8 pm, so the dinner rush was over, and the place had more empty tables than occupied.
Here is why I feel this place is 2-star worthy.

-Waitress was a really nice girl, but the food and drink ordering was very poorly orchestrated.

-Drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point.

-Food was coming at different times. By the time the other end of the table had gotten their food, we were done eating.. even though we all ordered at the same time.

-My order was not correct. I was hungry and ate it anyway. When I told the waitress, she brought out the correct food for me and didn't charge me for it (which I insisted otherwise).. I thought that was really nice.

-The food itself was just mediocre. Living in AZ, you know good mexican food. This place misses the mark.

Just an ok place. Maybe I would have had a different experience if it weren't a group venture.
