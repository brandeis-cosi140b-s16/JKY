Meh, we weren't that impressed with our latest visit to Top Shelf. It's decent enough, but they don't have anything in particular that will keep me coming back for more or craving anything in particular from the place.

The side of guac we got was also kinda crappy. Seemed like it was old or had some other prob. Maybe they made it in the morning and it didn't hold that well till the time we ate dinner there.

On the positive side, no lard is injected or slathered on their refried beans, so the plethora of dishes that include beans are safe for vegetarian consumption.
