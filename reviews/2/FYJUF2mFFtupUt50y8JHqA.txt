Ok, family-style review.  We ate there recently with our teenagers on the patio outside.  I like the atmosphere.  To me it's a little touch of a bar atmosphere, but not too much, a chance to give the kids a feel for more adult atmosphere w/o feeling like we are too permissive by exposing them to drunks.

I had the relleno.  Whatever it was coated in was too cruncy and fried.  I love rellenos and I did not care for the Gringos version.

Rest of the family liked their food and we will probably return.  Is it the best Mexican food, no, and it probably wouldn't be the first place we would think of when we are hungry for Mexican.
