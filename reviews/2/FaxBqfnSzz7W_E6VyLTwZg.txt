I went there with my mom right after moving in, because it is the closest restaurant to my place, and we had heard some good things from my real estate agent.  The chips and salsa were pretty standard, if a little bland.  Little did i know that the blandness would only continue.  I had steak fajitas, and I swear, they were completely unseasoned.  While there is something to say about enjoying the taste of the meat, the steak used was not exactly USDA prime.  My mom had the spinach enchiladas, and she said they were flavorless as well.  The worst part, is that the large helping of refried beans I had in my plate, had several uncooked beans that were, in fact, crunchy.  

This Mexican restaurant that messed up standards like refried beans and steak fajitas does not have a repeat customer here, despite its proximity.
