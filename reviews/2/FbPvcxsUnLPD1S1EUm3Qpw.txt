I want to love this place.  From the palm tree in the parking lot to the bright, clean, cheerful interior and very friendly wait staff, there is much to make one smile.  The complimentary appetizer of tostadas and ceviche is a very nice touch, but the ceviche is devoid of seafood flavor and, but for the fresh red onion and cilantro, would be flavorless.  I ordered fish tacos,which should be a standby.  They were unlike any I have seen:  small breaded cubes of tasteless fish, fried to a greasy and limp consistency.  My friend had shrimp,tacos, which were somewhat better but could have been crispier.  The corn tortillas were soggy and oily.  It was as if the oil in the fryer was not at a sufficiently high temp, which may have been the case because we ate on the early side.  We also ordered a ceviche cocktail.  It had lots of shrimp and octopus but the seafood was overwhelmed by the V-8 flavored liquid in which it was served.  I am accustomed to ceviche that is "cooked" in a citrus-based acidic liquid, not tomato juice.  I will give this place another try because I really want to love it.
