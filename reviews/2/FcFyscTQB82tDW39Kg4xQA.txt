This is the 3rd location for this restaurant in the less than 10 years I've lived in Las Vegas. Unfortunately, three is not a charm for what used to be my favorite Mexican restaurant in town. At the first 2 locations, everything about the food was excellent. 

Tamales-yes, my passion. This place had tamales like no one else's. They were generous in size containing big chunks of pork. Now, they're shrunken and inconsistent and the rice and beans are now bland instead of flavorful. All of this in spite of Bobby Mercado's insistence that "everything including the chef" remained the same as the previous locations. I guess the long hiatus between reopenings has caused the chef to forget how to cook.

In addition, they've gotten so much further away from my home that with the bland food, it's no longer worth making the trip. 

I'm highly disappointed. Now, after all this time I have to start my search all over again. I'm starting to think there's no such thing as authentic, great-tasting Mexican food in Las Vegas, Nevada.
