Check your food before you leave the drive-up!!!
I've been going to this restaurant regularly for over 5 years and can count on one hand how many times they have gotten my order right.  This is the only restaurant I've ever frequented that I have to literally open up the bag, pull out by burrito, unwrap it, and peel open the tortilla to MAKE SURE it is what right!  Unfortunately, they make it wrong 90% of the time and end up having to make it again.  You would think a small business would get tired of throwing away food because it was made incorrectly, but you would be WRONG.  On one occasion I didn't  check it before driving home and found out it was wrong so I drove all the way back to have it made correctly;  they made it again and STILL SCREWED UP MY ORDER!  
The food is very good and a decent value.  However, the frustration of dozens and dozens of screwed up orders, coupled with a very dangerous location where you are approached by panhandlers WHILE WAITING IN YOUR CAR in the drive-up, has left me as an ex-customer of Armandos.  Never again will they screw up burrito!  Is it really rocket science to make a frickin' burrito with ONLY CARNE ASADA AND CHEESE AND NOTHING ELSE???
