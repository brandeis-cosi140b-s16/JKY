"Meh.  I've experience better." 

I find this fairly overpriced for the quality of food.  I think that the decor of the place and the witty menu drive up the "like" of this place b/c it's modern and fun... but it all comes down to the food, and it's not something I'd think about again when I leave, but I wouldn't object too heavily if someone asked me to meet them there again.  They staff is nice, when it's busy they're a little slow.  The food is spicy, like the guacamole and house salsa - I like spicy, but it didn't really add flavor, just made my mouth burn enough to get a second margarita (which was strong - good, but strong w/ low-end tequila, yuck.. paid the extra $$ for better liquor).  The pico de gallo, my alternative to the spicy salsa, was as bland as they come so I settled on "virgin" chips.  Everything is just mediocre and pricey... meh.
