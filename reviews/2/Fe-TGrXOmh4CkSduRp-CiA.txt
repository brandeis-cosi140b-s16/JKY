I love Taco Bell for years and is one of the o my fast foods I eat.  This location I was excited about but every order in the last 8 visits they got wrong.  Wrong ingredients, wrong orders, sour cream on everything.  It seems like they don't know the menu and just throw whatever together and it should be good. I will not go to this location again.
