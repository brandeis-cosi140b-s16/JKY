This two star review is ONLY FOR THEIR SERVICE. I give their food 4 stars, however I cannot go any higher in my opinion because of their service. When I was a kid, I grew up on Garcias. It was on Alma School just north of Warner. It is a childhood favorite. When they closed, we didn't go to any other one for quite some time. About a year ago, we found out there is one by us here in south Chandler and were very excited!!

Each and every time we come here, the service is just terrible. I don't understand. From today, we have been a total of 4 times in the past year. Every time, horrible service. The hostesses are not friendly. They are so bland and so unexcited about their job. You don't feel welcome. They always feel bored. 

Every server we have had doesn't listen to us, unfriendly, feel likes we are bugging them when we are just simply providing our drink order. Food has been wrong because they didn't listen. Slow. Cannot handle more than one table at a time and just really take away from the experience. It is really sad. No one is happy there and it is a poorly run restaurant. 

I do have to compliment their food. AMAZING food. BEST shrimp tacos. My Mom has been eating them for years. Generous chips and salsa, great on the refills and just overall good food. Their environment is very comfortable and very open. It is a fun place to be. Just a drab with their people.

Most people would never come back. However, it is a place we enjoy so I am sure we will eat in again, however I think we will mostly just call in our order and do take out to avoid the bad service. I truly hope they see what is wrong and ramp up this place. It could be a lot better in this awesome part of town!
