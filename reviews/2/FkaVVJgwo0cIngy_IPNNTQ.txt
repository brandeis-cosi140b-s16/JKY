I had high hopes for this restaurant, especially having come from New Mexico.  I have been to this restaurant at least 7 times, most recently today. I will not be back.

The food is unimaginative, the quality is going down, and the restaurant has no personality. Given the size of the place (less then 10 tables), I expect a more personal touch, especially when on several times we have gone, we were the only table. You should also expect to have long wait times for your food.

When we first started going, the sopapillas (which are more indian fry bread) where included. Now, they are $4.50. The taquittos came from a box today and were not home made, despite the claim of having home made food. 

Had the Gil not decided to take the US Airways approach, I might have given another chance but not now.
