Me and my friend decided to come to Nacho Daddy's (Summerlin Location) for her birthday. When we walked in the hostess just looked at us and gave a blank look, quite rude. She leaves and another employee comes to answer the phone doesn't ask if we've been helped and walks away. After five minutes of standing by the front door, my friend decides Ricardo's on Decatur/Flamingo would be worth the drive than to further subject ourselves to this experience. The only reason why I gave 2 stars, is other reviews say the food is great, perhaps I'll never know I've never eaten here and simply because they kept the front doors open.
