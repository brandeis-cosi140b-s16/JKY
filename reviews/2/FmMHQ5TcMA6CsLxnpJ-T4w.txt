Service was friendly but the carnitas I had looked like they were 5 days old. For those that dont know how carnitas should look just imagine pulled pork they are almost identical. I dont recommend eating here if you want to get what you pay for. The only reason I gave it two stars is becasue my wife liked there shrimp tacos.
