Maybe their cooked food is good, but I was disappointed with Agua chile, it wasn't salted, the shrimp were warm and the "Agua" part was exactly that "Agua"(water) instead of lime juice. Besides that, they don't have camarones a la cucaracha, AND they put mayo on my mother in laws salad instead of ranch.
