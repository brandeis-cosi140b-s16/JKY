Not really impressed. The patio is great and they have some great beer specials. The problem is I can't get past the smell of vomit surrounding their bar area! It smells so bad. I used to always get their melted cheese dip and go out of my way to stop here for it but the smell is so overwhelming and the service is never that good. I won't return.
