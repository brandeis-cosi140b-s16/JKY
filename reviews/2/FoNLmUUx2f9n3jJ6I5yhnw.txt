I was excited to try this place, I live 2 minutes away and the reviews are good..... It was not impressive. They forgot our steak quesadilla, I asked for sauce on the side mmmm nope. And the food was really just mediocre. Meat was okay, beans and rice were sub par, definitely skip the horchata.... Taco y taco is way better down the street.
