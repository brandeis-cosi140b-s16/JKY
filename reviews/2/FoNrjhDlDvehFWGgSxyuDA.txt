I had a resaurant.com GC so we went there to use it.  After we sat down it took like 10 minutes for us to get a water.  I HATE when waiters and waitresses walk right by you and don't serve you.  I thought this place was expensive for the food you got.  We got a shrimp appetizer and it was super small.  I got the fajitas which were nothing special.  They gave my sour cream that looked like milk.  I didn't use it.  My wife got a margarita and it was expensive and not very good size.  Anyways, i thought the food was average and the price was large.
