What is all the hype about? Two-thirty in the morning and no where else to eat...perhaps. My tacos where missing the Guacamole and the cabbage tasted more like sauerkraut to me. The salsa was yummy and I prefer flour tortillas to corn. I saw that they accepted credit cards online however it was cash only the night I went.
