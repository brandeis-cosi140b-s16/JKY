If you're thinking about eating here, there are almost certainly better places you could go. I ordered the chiles rellenos and was pretty disappointed. Ingredients seemed low-quality and overall preparation was subpar. Everything was drowned in a red sauce that tasted canned. I have made this dish better at home. The place also isn't kept up very well, and the view from the patio where we sat was a little depressing. However, our server was a really nice guy. Overall I'd give the place one star based solely on food and atmosphere, but I bumped it up to two for the service.
