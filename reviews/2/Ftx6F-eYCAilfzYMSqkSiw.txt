I ordered a machaca and egg burro. It was dry and flavorless. The advertised jalape√±os were close to non existent. To top it off there was no salsa to accommodate the burrito. Growing up in the southwest this was a first for me. The cashier also seemed to think that providing eye contact was not necessary for taking my order.
