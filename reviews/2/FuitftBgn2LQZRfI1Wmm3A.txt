I have given this spot 10 tries on faith and vibe alone.  Great people, hit spot and awesome kids menu with ice cream but food lacks originality and depth of flavor. Combos are bland, presentation is hurried and just frankly not that good. Anyone who has traveled to spots with cool text mex will know it!   Sorry.  Overrated.
