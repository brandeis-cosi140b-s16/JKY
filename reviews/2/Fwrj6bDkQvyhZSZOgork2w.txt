I would give it three stars, but I just didn't think it was "A-OK". Went here for some afternoon margaritas. 

House margarita with rock and salt was just ok. I have had worse, way worse, but I have also had better. If you would like to know what place is better see other reviews. Anyways, I sat at the bar with my guest and had a couple of margaritas and a couple of beers. 

She decided to get something to eat. Quesadilla. Pretty easy and consistent. They were cheap, which I liked( happy hour price). When they came out they sat in this salsa which was running. Problem, it made the bottom of the quesadilla soggy and not that great. 

Total for 3 house margaritas, 2 beers and 1 quesadilla was $25. It was happy hour though so I imagine dinner hours would be a little more expensive.

Overall. Drinks were okay, but it is not hard to make a margarita, or take the top off a beer.
