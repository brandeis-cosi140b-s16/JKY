If you know what you're getting into it's probably ok.  The salsa and chips is not like other Mexican restaurants in any way.  I was not a huge fan and they charge if you want extra chips.  Tacos are mostly authentic style with cilantro and onions not American with lettuce, tomato etc.

It's a small place and as others have said the service is sufficient but not overly impressive.  The prices are certainly reasonable, but I will check out some other Mexican restaurants to see if I can do better.
