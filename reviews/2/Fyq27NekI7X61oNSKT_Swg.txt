The drinks are good, hence the 2 stars... but the food quality has gone way down in recent years. I had the arroz con pollo and it was ground chicken (tasted like out of the can) mixed with greasy cheese and Mexican rice with undercooked onions and peppers. I doubt that anyone who has ever ordered that dish has actually liked it...
