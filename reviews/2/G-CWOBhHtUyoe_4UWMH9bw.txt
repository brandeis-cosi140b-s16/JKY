My overall rating dipped a star from my last visit.  The service here sucks!  They appeared to be fully staffed during the dinner hour, yet it took more than five minutes for someone to acknowledge my presence at the wait stand.  Employees were milling around tending to more important stuff, I guess.  Not sure what ranks above a potential paying customer. When I was finally seated and attended to, it didn't get much better.  The waiter was curt and impatient.  

The food wasn't bad.  I opted for a house margarita (no bueno/poorly made) and two of the appetizers.  I must say the appetizers were great. This restaurant offers a twist on what I consider traditional Mexical cuisine.  They do a nice job so the flavors aren't so outlandish and out of line with what you're expecting.  They also provide you with chips and salsa to start.  The chips were light, crispy and freshly made; however, the salsa left tons to be desired.  They brought two varieties out with the chips and I didn't care for either one.  Both lacked flavor. 

Los Sombreros could really improve in my eyes if they acted like they gave a damn about their customers.  I didn't get that impression on either visit.
