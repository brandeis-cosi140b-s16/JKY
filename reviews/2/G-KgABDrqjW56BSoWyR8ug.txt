I would love this place if it wasn't for the food. I like how it is painted on the outside and inside it is all bright colors with different colored chairs. And I think the cheesy décor is pretty cool, too. I love the giant margarita glasses and Mexican Talavera pottery style birds everywhere. The service is passable. But I just can't eat here. Not that this location is particularly bad food or anything. I just really don't like Macayos. Way too much cheese all over everything. Their chips are like cardboard and the salsa never tastes fresh. The tortillas are not authentic Mexican at all. The one thing I do appreciate is that they give you the option of having calabacitas (sautéed diced zucchini and corn kernels) as a side dish.  I wish other Mexican places would have a veggie side as an option in addition to the usual rice and beans (they do offer black beans, too which is also nice).
