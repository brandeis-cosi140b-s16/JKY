This place used to be really good, now they've got a bunch of kids working there who take breaks to snack on chips or talk to their buddies. And both of the last two times I went there they put virtually no salt on the chips, and when I said something about it the second time, very nicely I might add, the manager rolled her eyes and dumped about a pound of salt on them. I didn't want to use about 10 of their salt packets because it was a large box of them but of course they make me feel like I'm just a bitchy customer.
