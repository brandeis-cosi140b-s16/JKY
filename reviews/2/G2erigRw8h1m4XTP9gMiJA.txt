Slow. Just incredibly slow. 

The food is good, as always. But the service at this location is slow. If you have limited time for your lunch break, be warned. You won't get out of here in less than 20 minutes. 

Don't even try to order online, you'll end up waiting LONGER than if you waited in line.
