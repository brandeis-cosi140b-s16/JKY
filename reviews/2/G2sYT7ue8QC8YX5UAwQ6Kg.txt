We have long been customers at the original location but, since DC Ranch is closer, decided to give it a try.  Let me first say that I would consistently give Jalapeno Inferno five stars - it's one of our favorites, along with our entire family down to our grandkids.  So maybe our expectations were too high in thinking service and food would be as good at the new spot.  But sadly, this was not the case.  
While the restaurant itself is nicer in appearance, apparently that's where the good news ends.
I ordered two enchiladas but requested flour vs. corn tortilla.  Our waitress said everything is pre-made so they would not make a change.  I told her I do this all the time at the other location and she just shrugged and said to choose something different.  No offer to check with the kitchen and no apology.  And let me add the place was barely half full so that was no excuse.  Seriously?  Even Taco Bell will allow tweaks upon request!
So I ordered something else and was disappointed that it was barely warm when served.  She never asked if our food was good and we finally had to flag down another server just to get more salsa.  We both only ate about half our meals and instead of askiing if all was ok she just set down our check.  
The meal was so disappointing and honestly, we won't go back.  In fact it will probably be a while before we go to the first one again, just because maybe they have pre-made meals now too and lost their customer service attitude.  
Bottom line - if you want Pre-made Mexican food served with attitude, don't spend the money at Jalapeno Inferno.
