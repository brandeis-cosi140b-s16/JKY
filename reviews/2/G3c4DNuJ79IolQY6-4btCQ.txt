I wanted to like Pure Taqueria. I really did. And we tried a variety of things, but they all left us very disappointed. In a word: BLAND! From the salsa & chicken tortilla soup to the pork tacos, chicken fajitas, and the black beans... flavor was missing from everything. Ugh. The best thing about the meal: my $5 Texas Margarita that was on special. The server was good & did offer me a sample between two margaritas I was considering (skip the prickly pear option!), so that was nice. Other than that, we were not impressed in the least. I'm sorry to say we will not return.
