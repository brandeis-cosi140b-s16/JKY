This was my third - and likely last - visit to La Cazuelas. Previous visits were unremarkable, while this one miserably failed.

The hostess seemed disappointed that we intended to eat in. The place was pretty full and the hour not late - not sure what that was about. Our server appeared to be seriously inconvenienced by my query regarding the availability of a fish taco (not on the menu - but hey, I'm just askin').

This is a place where I have observed most of the clientele are offered the option of soup as their complimentary appetizer, but I have never been offered anything but the standard chips and salsa.

We ordered the vegetarian burrito. It was stuffed with a strange assortment of vegetables, the likes of which I've never seen in a Mexican place. Cauliflower, carrots, snow peas, broccoli - wait, I recognize this combination! Good ol' frozen mixed vegetables. Yep, they even tasted a little bit freezer-burnt. They also had no additional seasoning that I could discern. The rice and beans were missing from the dinner, but by the time the server checked back with us we just wanted to finish up and head out, so we didn't ask them to correct that oversight.

The good: the chips were fresh and hot, and the salsa was tasty. For this reason, La Cazuelas earns an extra star from this reviewer.
