Went to Tacos Jaliscos today and ordered Pozole. Was told they were out of it. So I ordered the tacos at $1 each. I ordered 2 de pastor and 2 of lengua. I must say that they were not fresh at all and they did have a TON of cilantro and onion mix on there. I really didn't like the tacos. Now, the drink place next door is really good. Probably won't return unless I try the Pozole.
