I know not to expect much out of airport food but I was hoping for more out of this place.  Sadly it is slim pickings in this terminal so you have very few choices if you are hungry.  The server was not very attentive, not good if you are in a rush.  The menu is very very very small.  The food was decent, but I have had much much better in other airports.
