Since the renovation, I have had two poor experiences there.  I got turned onto their seasoned chips by a coworker which are wonderful.  

When they were freestanding in front of Quail Corners the service was excellent.  I could pass up a $5 bag of Lay's Tostito's at Harris Teeter for a huge bag of theirs for less than $3 being in and out before my groceries started defrosted.

With the new layout, there is no way to "jump the line" if all you're getting is chips.  I have spent upwards of 15 to 20 minutes shuffling down the line after saying all I wanted was a bag of chips to go behind other customers having their order assembled.

Bottom line, love the chips but hate being subjected to a cafeteria line just to get them and pay.
