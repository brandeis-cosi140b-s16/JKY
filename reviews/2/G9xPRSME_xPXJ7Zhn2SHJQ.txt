Years later, James O., a self-proclaimed fan of Roberto's, convinced me to give it another try. Unfortunately, it was just as I remembered...ick. I think one of the biggest issues here is lack of flavor. Hint: Be sure to ask for both red and green sauce, and extra of each. You've got to smother the meat in the sauces to make it even edible. The carne asada nachos and fries are great in theory, and they don't lack for toppings (but more cheese would certainly be appreciated) - but they totally lack flavor. The taco shells are too greasy and have just a small pinch of meat in them. Where's the beef? Even James O. said he didn't like the tacos this time around. So perhaps the culprit is this particular location? Or perhaps James O. only actually likes Roberto's when he's really drunk and/or hungover? Bottom line: This is not where I will be purchasing my tacos.
