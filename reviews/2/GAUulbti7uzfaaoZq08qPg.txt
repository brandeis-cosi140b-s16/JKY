Stopped by on my way to work to get something to eat for dinner on Cinco de Mayo.  I was extremely disappointed.  My food was cold when I got it - the cheese wasn't even melted in my cheese enchiladas.  I had to microwave it for a minute to get it nice and melty.  The beans were good, but only after reheated and the rice was weird.  It had really large chunks of carrots in it, something I've never experienced in all my Mexican food eating.

Not sure I will be eating here in the future.
