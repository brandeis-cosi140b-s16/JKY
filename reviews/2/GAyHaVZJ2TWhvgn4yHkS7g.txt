I mean the prices are really affordable but seriously? I ordered some chips & guacamole at $5.32 & they gave me this miniature container like those salsas containers with a bit of chips to the side. I was like is this a joke? I went back to complain if that was it & sadly it was so I just rolled my eyes & took it. Rip off!! As far as my food I ordered which was a burrito its okay if you're not expecting the real flavors of mexican food. I recommend it if you're hungry & it's your last resort. But don't order the chips it will disappoint you.
