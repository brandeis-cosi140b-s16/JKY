Mediocre Food even worse service. I had to get a steak picado because that was the only way the would serve the steak I had to send it back because it was so tough to bite into and got a shredded beef chimichanga which had no flavor. Also THEY DO NOT SERVE HORCHATA! Tf? The waitresses ignore you and avoid you until tip time. Did not have a good experience.
