On our way home from golfing and needing a good Mexican meal with a ice cold beer or better yet a Margarita. We stopped here not know there's NO alcohol! WAH - Huh?  We stayed anyway. I ordered the lettuce wrap and yummy it was, but there was only ONE - one lettuce wrap for $6.95 I would expect at least 2 wraps. It's wrapped in LETTUCE for goodness sake? I did lick the plate, it was good.  As I looked around I noticed there were no Hispanics eating there, why is that?   I won't be back - me needs alcohol.
