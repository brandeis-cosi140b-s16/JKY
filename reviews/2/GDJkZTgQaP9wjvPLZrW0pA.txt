* Shark tacos - I thought the shark meat gave an interesting twist.  The shark meat was slightly on the salty side though.  You'll need to add salsa to give it some taste.

* Brava burrito - Stay away from this creature.  Rice and beans makes a bland burrito.  The beef inside didn't add to the taste at all.  Needs salsa to give it some life.

* Nachos - This is one thing they sort of got right.  Well, it's mighty hard to mess up nachos.  This was probably the best of the 3 items I tried.
