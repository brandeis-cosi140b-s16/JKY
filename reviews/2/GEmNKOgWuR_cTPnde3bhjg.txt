This is the first Pink Taco I ate at...before the one in Century City opened up.  I had...of course...the Pink Tacos :)  It is a dish with three little tacos with carnitas with marinated onions that are pink.  Food is all right...what do you expect, it's corporate food. I had also had Pink Taco Margarita which was very refreshing after shopping  in the heat.  The atmosphere is cool: lucha libra posters and masks; low rider bikes.  This place should've opened in LA first.
