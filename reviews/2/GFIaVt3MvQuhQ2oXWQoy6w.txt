Food was just ok. I got the salmon and it was chewy and the sauce was so overpowering. Grilled vegetables were pretty good. We sat at our table for about 30 minutes after we were already being rushed several times to pay be the waiter.  Then as we were walking out the hostess said "finally" in Spanish as we walked out. Such a rude staff. Definitely won't be going back to this place.
