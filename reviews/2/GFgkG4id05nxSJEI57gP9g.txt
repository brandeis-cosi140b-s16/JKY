Great that Pasquals took over the old Fyfes Bistro!  The bar area is great.  When we got sat in what is slmist a varn like area adjacent to E. Wash Ave, things went down hill.  The noise level was out of control.   People where yelling, louder than a Badger game while eating on a Fridsy night.  The wait staff are good - no complaints.   I will not be back unless I sit in a quieter area.  Great food snd staff, very poor surroundings.
