Overall pretty disappointed in this place.  The food might rate a 4 but you factor in prices and the poor quality service and there is no way I can give it any higher than a 2 star.

Some examples,  for $15 you get 4 mini size tacos.  The guacamole has so much lime it is overpowering.  They are going after the boutique Mexican food place yet their flavors just don't justify the overpriced menu.  Salad choices are limited to 2, greens salad which isn't bad and a Mexican chef salad.  When asking if 8 can pay to add the grilled swordfish the answer is NO but I can add chicken? ??.

If this was a sub $15 per person pricing level (6 people our bill was $150 with only one appetizer ordered pre tax and pre tip) it might rate better.

As for service.  They being out one plate at a team from the kitchen.  The last plate took 10 minutes from the first plate (last plate was the salad).

If you are stuck at Red Rock I suppose this is better than Albertos down the street but not by much.
