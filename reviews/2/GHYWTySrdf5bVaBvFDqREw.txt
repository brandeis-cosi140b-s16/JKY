I came in thinking that this restaurant would be great because of the building and the interior. But, everything was just the opposite. I ordered the chips and salsa, which was weird because chips are always free in Mexican restaurants, even in little fast food restaurants the chips and salsa are free for dine in customers. But, I got the chips and salsa, the lunch chicken enchilada, and a coke. The chips and salsa were beyond bland. The salsa was lack luster, and the chips were overly salty. I was hoping that my entrée would make up for the chips and salsa, but no. It came out looking absolutely stunning (like food porn on Instagram stunning), but was once again bland. The rice was the biggest disappointment (I love Mexican rice)...it was worse than the salsa. Absolutely no flavor at all, even with the green sauce that came with my enchilada. I thought the enchilada would make up for it, since it was my entrée and it looked beautiful, but the chicken was super sketchy and it was dripping in sauce, which made the tortilla soggy and me unhappy. 

The only reason I am giving this place 2 stars is because the interior and exterior of the restaurant are beautiful, it has a fantastic drink menu (for when I can drink), and the people at the bar made me laugh with the conversation they were having. They really need to step up their food game if they are going to be charging these prices, because 9.95 for ONE lackluster enchilada makes me never want to come back here.
