Aint nothing better than good ol' carne Asada fries! 

This location is pretty ungenerous with their portions.. Unlike their other locations! When I order carne asada fries they limit the amount of meat they put on it. And 90% of the time when I say "No Beans", they always  give me beans! 

I've only been inside once and I suggest just going thru the drive thru. So you can avoid coming out smelling like carne asada. The drive thru is pretty fast surprisingly. 

There's always this homeless man at the end of the drive thru trying to wash your windows. It kind of creeps me out because he won't stop talking to you.
