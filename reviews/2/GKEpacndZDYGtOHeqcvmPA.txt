Meh. This is a Mexican version of Applebees, just mediocre food with lots of flair. My husband and I came here after striking out at Vogue and Fresh Wasabi (both closed on Sundays). We weren't expecting a lot, so i guess you can say it met our expectations. Chips and salsa service was prompt. The chips were warm and fresh and the salsa was good too. It kinda reminded me of the salsa at Chili's. I ordered a Margarita, which was large, but had almost zero alcohol in it (this is coming from me, a small Asian who gets drunk off 2 Budlights). It tasted of pure, syrupy margarita mix! I ordered the carne asada which had decent flavor, but was overcooked and tough. They advertise it as sirloin, but tasted more like cheap skirt steak. My husband had the chicken fajitas, which is pretty hard to mess up. His chicken was not seasoned and just tasted like smoke from the grill. The refried beans were a bit bland, but the homemade flour tortillas were fresh and piping hot. 

I don't think I will come here again. I think Chili's makes better Margaritas and fajitas.
