First impressions were quite positive.  Loved the ambiance inside.  Mexican music, decor, lighting etc...were all very pleasant.  The freshly warm corn chips and salsa (very fresh cilantro) were destroyed by the Mrs. and me within a few minutes and they promptly brought out another fresh batch.  Service was polite and very accommodating with some minor special requests for our entree order.  All was right with our little faux Mexican world.  

Then the entree came.  Tempura Fish Taco, Chicken Burrito and a Beef Chimichanga.  Nothing really wrong with any of them, just not that good.  Quite underwhelmed after the positive beginning to the dining experience.  The shredded chicken in the burrito was too soggy inside and the fish taco was just lacking in sauce and overall zip that great fish tacos bring.  Again, nothing really wrong, just all a little boring and run of the mill.  

FYI: My wife ordered the tempura fish tacos as well and requested they grill non breaded fish (she's Gluten Free).  They were happy to accommodate but after dinner she got a pretty bad gluten reaction so there was still gluten in the tacos somewhere...such is the plight of a GF person trying to dine out :(
