Came here because it was the only sit down restaurant I could find in be airport. 

Not the greatest food - it tastes like If Chevy's had a fast food company that was completely packaged. Seriously, very bland. 

I would say come here for the drinks, but I ordered one Mimosa without asking how much it was and it was more than the two meals we got combined - $16.00.

The service is friendly and the restaurant is clean so that's really how this place earned its stars. 

I would skip this place unless you really want the restaurant feel while waiting for your flight. If you just want a bite to eat, you might want to consider another eatery.
