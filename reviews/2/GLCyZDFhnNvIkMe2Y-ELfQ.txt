I must live in an alternate universe. I went to Pedtritos hoping (based on the reviews here) for a good, simple inexpensive meal. It was inexpensive and simple, but bleh! My friend and I went twice, ordering different things each time. The meat in the buritos and enchiladas was dry (and looked 2 days old) and the taste of everything but the chorizo was on par with eating something like a hot pocket. I don't intend to go back
