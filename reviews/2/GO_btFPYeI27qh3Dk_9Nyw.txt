This is not your father's Senor Frog's.  My wife and I have fond memories of dining at Senor Frog's in Coral Gables, FL in the 80's.  It was an excellent Mexican restaurant with a variety of tasty, well prepared Mexican dishes.  So, when we saw Senor Frog's smiling frog face at Treasure Island we were excited to relive the experience.  DIDN'T HAPPEN!!!  This Senor Frog's is basically an over sized bar, serving bar food quality dishes and the noise level is so high that it is difficult to have a conversation over dinner.  It isn't even a Mexican restaurant anymore.  Although, they do offer tacos, enchiladas and burritos and a variety of other things including spaghetti, hamburgers and BBQ.  The chips and salsa, which aren't complimentary, are not worth the 5 dollar price tag.  Seriously, we've had better salsa out of a jar.  Can anyone spell PACE?  We had the cheap margarita.  If, you can call 11 dollars cheap (top shelf was 13 dollars).  It was served in a small plastic mug and didn't even come with a lime wedge.  And, to make matters worse, they weren't very good.  If you want a really good margarita, go across the Strip to Jimmy Buffet's Margaritaville at the Flamingo.  Jimmy knows how to make a margarita.  If you want really good Mexican food and margaritas, then, go to Lindo Michoacan.  There are several locations in Las Vegas; but, none are on the Strip.  So, you have to drive.  But, the drive is worth it.  

We had lousy chips and salsa, 2 lousy margaritas,  an over priced order of 3 fish tacos and an over priced chicken quesadilla for $62 including tip.  We'd have been better off putting the money in a slot machine.  The return on investment would have been better.
