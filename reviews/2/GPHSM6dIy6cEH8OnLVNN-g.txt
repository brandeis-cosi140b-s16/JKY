The space Yo Rita occupies used to be occupied by this fantastic Mexican restaurant called The Iguana.  I miss it.

I wonder if it is my longing for The Iguana that makes me so disappointed with Yo Rita.  The food is small, uninspired, salty, and over priced.  The tacos are ok but they are seriously ridiculously expensive and just not worth it.

The restaurant feels sterile and its loud.  You also have to deal w S Side parking to dine here.

The staff is nice, but Yo Rita just does not float my boat and I've dined there several times.  There is better fare to be had on the S Side.
