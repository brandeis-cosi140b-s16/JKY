I had a celebration with ten friends here last night.

Food is an issue. Ordered hard shell tacos, but I was told they don't have hard shells, only "soft tacos with corn kernels," which were not crunchy or satisfying at all. The beans were watery, and the rice was inedible for me, like quinoa grains mixed with undercooked rice and a Mexican flavoring. I took a box to be polite and gave it away.

Service was OK. Server was nice enough, but I asked him to do something special for my friend's birthday, and he waited until after the checks arrived. One of the girls actually tried to leave once we got the bill, and it was awkward to explain she couldn't go yet without saying why. Not a big deal, but it could have been handled better.

Best part was the drinks. More of a chips and salsa and drinks place than anything else, honestly.
