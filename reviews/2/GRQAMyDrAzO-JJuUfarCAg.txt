Ole? 

Oh no. 

I can safely say I tried it, right? They have an extensive menu, reasonably priced lunch specials, and decent salsa, but that's about it. Guacamole that came with my chicken fajitas looked like someone had driven over it with a Mack truck and it didn't taste much better. Chicken was grisly and lacked flavor and the peppers were so over cooked they melted in my mouth. Not in that good melt-in-your-mouth sort of way. In my quest to find the best of the Mex in the Midwest, Laredo's didn't have it. 

Got a rec? 

Let me know.
