We love this food for a quick weeknight meal .  But this location is poorly managed and sloppily maintained.  Our call in order has been wrong 6/10 times.  The food prep seems sloppy compared to other Rio's we've visited.  And the customer service isn't what it should be.  The staff seems rushed, annoyed and short.
