Should have believed the old but correct Yelp reviews.  

Yes this is a Filibertos but it is literally inside the gas station market.  They had specials listed on the board by the cash register and I pointed to the Green Chili Burrito special.  I paid and stepped aside then saw the drink included in the ad and inquired.  The cashier said I needed to order the special to get the drink and the burrito in that special is much smaller.   I asked to change to the special and he responded that it was different and not possible, probably since the order was already being worked.  
Oh well...

For my $4.80 it was finely chopped meat, green sauce and flour tortilla
