I want to love you, Chipotle.  Really, I do.  But it just seems that I find myself unable to do so.  It is not you, Chipotle.  It is me and me alone, when Qdoba and Salsarita's make it so easy to walk in and figure out what I want to eat.  Even if I find that I have no idea what I want to eat, I will look lovingly at their comparatively simple menus and assembly lines and I can figure out what I will have.

Is their food made with integrity?  Do they support local farms, as you purport to do?  Probably not.  But when I am hungry, that is not what I care about.  When I want to eat, I want to figure it out quickly, and find a place to sit, not stand like a moron looking at five seats while my burrito drips down my arm because I did not think to order it in a bowl.

Now that I think about it, it is not even that the menus at other places are simpler, because your menu is about as simple as it gets.  But for whatever reason, your menu confuses me, and frankly, Chipotle, it just is not that great.  At least service generally comes with a smile.
