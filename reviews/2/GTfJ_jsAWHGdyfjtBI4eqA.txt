Since moving to Arizona, I've found an appreciation for mexican food (except for beans... I dont know why, but I just can't get into them). We went to Rosita's on a double-date- my boyfriend and the other couple used to go there a lot "back in the day" and they all love it. I guess I just don't fit into the mold. 

The chips were average... the salsa too- not very spicy and a little watered down even. I ordered a combo plate, trying a beef enchilada and a chicken taco. Both were average... nothing to write home about. Equivalent to Filberto's for about 3x the cost. 

The atmosphere was not my favorite... lots of families there at 8pm... with lots of screaming kids. Why did each adult couple have 7 kids with them??? 

My favorite part of Rositas = their huge glasses of pop. I only needed one refill of my diet coke :)
