I'm a chipotle fanatic but ALWAYS disappointed when I go to this location. 

The employees are consistently clueless and slow, as if they have never made any of the menu items before. While they appear to be well staffed, only 2 people work the food line while the others disappear to the back when a crowd arrives. 
You can count on spending a long time waiting here and your food will not taste as good as it Chipotle should. 

This location does not represent the company well. Drive 2 more minutes and go to the Chipotle at Scottsdale Pavilions instead. It is so much better!
