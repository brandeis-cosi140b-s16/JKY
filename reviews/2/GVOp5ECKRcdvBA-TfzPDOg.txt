The food is fresh and edible, but very forgettable.  I had the mango chipotle chicken salad without the shell.  Overall it was okay, but the chicken portion was very small - maybe 2.5 ounces.  The menu choices overall are hard to choose from and unless you get a salad without the shell or a single taco, the remaining choices are 700 calories plus.  A veggie burrito for example is 800 calories.  It has been awhile since I have been to Baja Fresh and I suddenly remember why. I will not be returning.
