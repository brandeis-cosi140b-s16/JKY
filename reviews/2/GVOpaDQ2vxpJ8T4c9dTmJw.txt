Decor has a cute Dia de los Muertos v+ modern urban feel. Seating is comfortable.  Pretty good draft and bottled beer options.  

I tried an Al Pastor and a Carnitas taco. Both were too greasy but were seasoned ok. But they were a big disappointment because both the corn tortillas and meat filling were cold. I hope I don't get food poisoning from the under temp meat. It might have been hot when they scooped it onto my plate, but had gone cold by the time I paid and sat down. This is even though there was only one person ahead of me in line. 

They had 2 assembly line workers during lunch rush - just not effective to move the line fast enough. It only got worse after I made it through the line. And staff were initially friendly but showed their stress as they got more and more overwhelmed. Tables weren't being wiped down either, so you had to clean a place to sit down. If you come in and see only 2 people working, walk out and go somewhere else.
