After my third visit to Vida Vida, I feel victim to a bait-and-switch. My first visit was about a week after their opening and I was impressed. Tacos were great with plenty of guac, pico, and flavor. Margarita was fresh and authentic. All of this for less than $15 was great.

Then came the second and third visits. We tried different drinks and tacos, along with some of the same we had the first time. Drinks were terribly sweet and very weak. I could not even drink my jalape√±o margarita; it tasted like I was drinking a green pepper, bitter and earthy. The tacos no longer had the healthy dose of guac and pico. My carnitas taco had about a teaspoon of guac. The ingredients had lost all freshness and just tasted meh. 

Will return once they regroup and get back to the food and drinks they were originally pumping out.
