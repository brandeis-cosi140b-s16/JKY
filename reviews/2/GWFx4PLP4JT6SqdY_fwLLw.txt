Stopped here for lunch. The girl inside was nice and the menu prices are fair. The carne asada burrito I had was lacking flavor and a bit fatty at times. I wasn't impressed with the quesadilla however the fried taco was so-so. I thought it was weird they had Christmas decorations up in September and inside could have been cleaner. The whole experience was under average I don't think I'll be back.
