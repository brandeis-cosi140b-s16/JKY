This was about my 10th visit to Verde, but the first time I have written a review. Overall for those visits, I would say that the margaritas are awesome, the food is sometimes good, sometimes just ok, and the service is slow.

For this visit we had a table of 9. The chips and salsa were great. The guacamole is pre-made, and over processed (no chunks of avocado) for my taste. For the $9 price, I have had much better fresh, table-side preparation guacamole in California, Las Vegas, etc.

I wanted fish tacos but the only fish is tilapia, and no other fish is available. So the server strongly recommended the seviche special which as mahi. I also ordered the TOSTADAS DE FRIJOLES. The tostadas was ok, but did not have much flavor, and it was really difficult to eat the corn shell that was so hard to cut. The seviche was terrible. I tasted one bite and it had the taste and texture of old fish, with no flavor. I let two other people at the table taste it, and they had the same reaction. I never send food back, but I did tell the server that it was bad and she took it off of our bill.

An even bigger disappointment was the service overall. It was really slow, and the food came out at different times for the 9 of us. Some people ordered tacos and asked for sour cream when the ordered, but sat and waited for quite a while after their tacos were delivered to actually get the sour cream. It also took a very long time to just get our check.

Everyone was frustrated by the service, and since I suggested having dinner there, I promised to do the yelp review. Overall I think the others in our party liked the tacos, but those who ordered enchiladas didn't finish them and they didn't want to take the leftovers home.
