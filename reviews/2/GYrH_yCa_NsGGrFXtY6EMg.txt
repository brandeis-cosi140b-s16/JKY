The water taste bad.  Give me a Margarita.  Ã¡ndale
The chips are fresh, warm and crisp.  The salsa mild and bordering on sweet.  Other reviews rave about their chips and salsa,  I wonder if those reviewers are seniors that just don't routinely eat spicy food.
My Albondiga Soup was okay.  The meatballs had good flavor but we're really firm. The flour tortillas on the side were super hot and the butter I requested on the side was forgotten so I had to ask again. Server brought out some melted yellow stuff that was flavorless and grainy.  I did manage to talk my server into trying again and this time he succeeded in delivering the goods.  
So while I'm enjoin my tortilla with montaquia I notice there's an abundance of silk plants all over this place.  Pictures on the wall include photos of what I suspect are menu items.  Subliminal sale perhaps.
The dining area is somewhat dark, perhaps to help disguise the excessive decor.
Hmm.  Well I need to look away from all of that and focus on my dinner.
I will tell you this, the soup I had served wasn't even half as full of stuff as the one I saw pictured on Yelp.  I did take a photo and the difference is obvious. I needed to use my spoon to bring the contents toward the surface.  That other picture shows a bowl heaped FULL of veggies and such.  But even though it lacked in content the flavor was pleasant and filling.
We come here maybe once every couple of years and I think with the price of menu items, the dated atmosphere, and the mediocre food that will be more than enough.
