Didn't live up to the hype for me. Service was sub-par, rang in a totally different meal for my friend than what she had ordered. Menu doesn't specify all of the spicy ingredients in all of the meals. Salsa and queso is overpriced. I've had better mexican food at cheaper restaurants. Best thing about this place was the back patio on a nice evening and the margaritas so I would go back for happy hour.
