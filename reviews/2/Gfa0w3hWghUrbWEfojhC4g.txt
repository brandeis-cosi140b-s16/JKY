I have been coming here since they opened. I love their food, but today I was disappointed in service. I had a coupon from the Entertainment book for $10 off any purchase of $20 or more. The coupon was specific to the Maricopa location and expired 8/26/15. The restaurant wouldn't honor it as they had decided they were no longer going to accept them. There was no sign published and when I called Entertainment customer service they had no record of Tacos n More to be removed from the program. The food was good, but I am not happy with them not honoring their advertisement.
