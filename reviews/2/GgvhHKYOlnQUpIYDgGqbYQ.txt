Being from Texas, I am a fan of Tex-Mex which believe it or not, is hard to find in these parts.

I love mouth scorching spicy food but you get the impression that the dishes have no flavor because of the overwhelming spicy flavor is all you can taste.  The service was virtually non-existant and we got the impression that we were a burden to the waitstaff by dining there.  So, the search continues...
