We went there on New Years Eve. My husband got fajitas, and I got quesadillas. My husband said his fajitas were very oniony, had a few spicy peppers, and very little anything else. My quesadillas were permeated with onions and spicy, spicy soggy green peppers (which I don't recall as being warned of those on the menu) so I took one bite and couldn't eat any more of it. It was gross and waaayyy too spicy for me to eat. The only thing I liked was my husband's strawberry margarita, which had booze in it, compared to my non alcoholic version (I'm pregnant). I had a sip of his and it was yummy. My daughter drank most of mine. She ate a lot of chips and wouldn't touch my quesadilla. We won't bother eating there again. What a bummer.
