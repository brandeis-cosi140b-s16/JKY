The salsa was great, especially the green. The main course was just okay. Wife's soft tacos were a soggy, nasty mess. My burrito was not bad actually, the chicken was tasty. Rice and beans are BLAND; rice seemed too old, a little crunchy like it was left over from lunch. Overall, not a good place compared to other places in the same price range. I will go here again for the salsa and margaritas, but not the food.
