We went for a casual lunch on our anniversary because of the great Yelp! reviews. We have mixed reviews, ourselves, though. The lunch crowd was small...not a good sign, but it is near South Mountain, which isn't a hub of excitement during the week day lunch rush. Inside, the place is old and worn, but clean. The tables aren't very inviting. There are fish tanks with large fish in them. The place is warmer than we like, so the overall effect was a bit dark and muggy.

The people who work there are wonderful--extremely helpful and nice. Honestly, that is the only reason we decided to stay--didn't want to turn around and walk out just because it looked kinda grungy inside (that is, because the food reviews were all so good.).

The bottom line is this: Everything on the menu is seafood,and it is Mexican. We did NOT love our food, but we did not get sick later, either.

There are no other meats. If we were at the ocean I think it would probably be fantastic, but inland, uh....no. The fish tacos tasted extremely FISHY and not in a good way. The crab meat enchiladas were authentic, dang it, but unfortunately the verde sauce was too tangy and there was pimento in the mix. It left a "stale" flavor in our mouths.

We would love to know the day of the week the fresh fish comes in. If we knew, we'd go back on THAT day. Otherwise, skip it.
