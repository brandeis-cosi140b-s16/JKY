How has this place stayed in business for 36 years serving the weirdest, unauthentic Mexican food ever presented on a plate? It might be because Bill Clinton ate here in 1999 and they are still getting food tourists? Not sure, but I did snap a photo of Clinton's table and that earned the extra star. The place is a mishmosh of small rooms and is old looking, but seemingly it retains its customers somehow, The guy next to us said he has been eating here once a week for the past 20 years and the waitress must have been here from day one. Have you ever heard of a waitress being too efficient, doing her job too good - kinda weird concept, but maybe somebody will get it.
    Even though, waitress informed pop that the fajitas were cooked in Teriayki sauce (WTF?), she said they were good and he took the veteran's bait. Big Mistake because our regular told us later that they just cook the chicken in Worcesthire sauce. His plate was swimming in salty, black liquid, only one tortilla was given, the guac had no chunks and looked like green toothpaste and the original salsa served with the chips was a watery mess of slightly hot red liquid (nothing in it). The $1 chunky salsa was better, but still on par with a chain or something (no offense to the much better chains in the area). 
    My $9 combo was a mess covered in a tasteless green sauce. The enchilada tasted like stale tortillas were used and the green corn tamale was all fluff and no green chile or corn present. The chile Relleno might have been the best item, but they used a green chile, not the traditional poblano.
     Pancho needs a break, a new menu and can someone mention to them how to cook fajitas properly because that crap should be taken off the menu forever. Clueless restaurant and even more clueless people who think this is real Mexican food. It aint.
