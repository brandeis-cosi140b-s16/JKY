Went to Tias for lunch.  Not extremely busy.  Had to flag down a waiter to get service.  Wasn't offered the lunch menu either. Ordered our food and mentioned that we needed to place a to go order too.  Server told us to remind him to place the order.  Isn't that what a server is for?  Reminded him after we got our food and when he checked on us.  Got our tab and no to go food on tab.  Paid bill and then he asked about to go order.  Told him not to worry about it.  He didn't apologize and acted like it was no big deal.  Won't be back for a while.
