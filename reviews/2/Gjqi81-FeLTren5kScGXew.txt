They still get two stars because the margs are typically delicious, and food is fresh. The service, however, is TERRIBLE. 

There was a wait to sit on the patio on Tuesday night so we got drinks at the bar. Everyone ordered traditional margs on the rocks. Then when we were seated we ordered another round. This second round tasted nothing like what we are used to (we come almost once a week here), was very sweet and syrupy tasting. We complained but the sever only offered, "I'm not sure why you think that, they all come from a mix." If 6 people think their second margaritas taste different than their first they are probably right, and he should have brought them back and double checked with the bar. 

A little girl a couple tables over complained to her server that there was a bug in her soda. Instead of offering her a new one she simply said, "Oh yuck. That's gross" and walked away. 

We will still come here because we like the fajitas and margs (especially when they are half-priced), but really hope the service improves.
