Based on the reviews, I had to to try this place. I had the pulled pork with potato salad and some sweet tea. I was no where near being blown away like many of the other reviews suggest. At best, my meal was just shy of mediocre. The pork was reheated in a microwave and the bbq sauce was bland. The potato salad was run of the mill with a factory fresh quality. I suspect it is purchased and not made in house. Even the sweet tea was lacking. It's probably closer to micky d's sweet tea than anything you will get in the deep south.

I will say the place does offer value for what you get. It's just that the food is not special. What is special is the place itself. I will go back again and bring family or friends just to see the expression on their faces. 

It's more about surviving the trip than it is about discovering a tasty hole in the wall.
