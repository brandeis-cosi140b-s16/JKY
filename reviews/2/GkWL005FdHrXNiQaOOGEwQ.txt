I love the quick service food. I think it's a healthier choice than most.  However I received very poor service while ordering my lunch.  Both women who waited on me were very confusing to work with.  I was holding up the line while trying to get them to understand that I (one person) didn't need two guacamoles and just wanted a side of chips. Man!
