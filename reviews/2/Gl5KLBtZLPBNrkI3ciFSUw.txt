I took my Mom here for a painting event and was excited to try a new place not too far from our new house.  The service was mediocre.  The margarita was tasty and I saw that they serve a massive sized one as well, but only had the normal.  We ordered the cheese and spinach dip, but the spinach was not cut up at all and made it difficult to get the dip on a chip without it dripping or falling off. It was happy hour when we got there, but the menu didn't say what  that included and the bartender didn't let us know either, so I just didn't bother ordering anything else.  Doubt I would go back.  It wasn't terrible, but there are much better executed Mexican restaurants I would travel to enjoy.
