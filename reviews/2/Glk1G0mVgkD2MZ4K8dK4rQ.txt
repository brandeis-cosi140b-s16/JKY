We were looking for Mexican food today in Scottsdale and happened upon Blanco. Nice location, well-appointed, and adequately staffed. We came in well after lunch but before dinner - 'Linner." I got the fish tacos ($13) and my husband got a cheese enchilada ($10). I was served three tortillas no more than 3 inches in diameter with bits of chopped stuff and one piece of fish the size of my thumb in each. I'm a small person, so this was okay, but the fish was almost inedible. Awful stuff. My husband's enchilada was in a small iron skillet and had a sugary sauce. Disappointing. I couldn't get a regular iced tea either - they only had passion fruit and green hibiscus. I got a pomegranite/grapefruit margarita which was pretty good, but pretty light overall. If you were looking to party, you'd have to down several of these $9 concoctions to really feel it. Total bill, with tip, for this affair was just under $40.

Skip it if you're looking for a nice meal. If you're looking to hang out with friends, munch on some appetizers and drink, then it's sorta kinda okay.
