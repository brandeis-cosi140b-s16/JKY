Yelpers should get out more...if this is 4 star fast Mexican food.  Pico de Gallo was 90% onions and otherwise bland. Chips were not warm. Carne Asada was more like hamburger crumbs. Wendy's chili is much better meat quality. Tacos used soft tortillas and didn't see any cilantro or onions. Generally this was just average at best. Not terrible, but only a minor step above del taco or whatnot. Is there ANY good food in Anthem?
