The Open Air Salsa Bar creeped me out.  Clean or Unclean it looked like a Bacteria breeding ground.  The Salsa was room temperature.
The Food ?  Was warm placed in the To-Go Boxes neatly.  But the best part of the  # 17 Meal was the warmed up Flour Tortilla and meat,  the Rice was luke cold and the refried Beans were watery - again this happened before.
  
I won't return or recommend  this place.
