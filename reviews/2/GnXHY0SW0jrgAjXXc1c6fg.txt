DO NOT get the tacos! The moment I picked them up, the entire tortilla just disintegrated and everything spilled out. I was at Sams club yesterday and the tortillas I sampled there were at least twice the quality. The ingredients we're decent quality for airport food, but i had soggy tortilla bits mixed in w/ them. Soggy tortilla. Not my fav topping.
