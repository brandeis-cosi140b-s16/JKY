The Service SUCKS we sat in the bar at 2-00 in the afternoon the bartender/waitress spent most of her time in the back showing her new baby.We could have D&D she was back there so long. Nachos were good beer was cold. But service is questionable. Was hungry but made me and my wife loose our appetite
