Blah..that's all I got...been here twice and will not be back....not sure when it became kosher to serve bland mexican food and cover it in cheese....perhaps because they are catering to the over 65 crowd in FH???

Go to senor taco...the food is authentic, the people are friendly, and you will walk out with alot more money still in your pocket.
