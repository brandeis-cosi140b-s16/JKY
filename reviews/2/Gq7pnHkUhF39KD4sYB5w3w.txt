Tried Cabo Wabo in Vegas because the outside was eye catching. The food was ok, I had one of their burgers (can't remember the name of it) and their Mai Tai. The Mai Tai was delicious! The decor was cool but the music they were playing kinda didn't go with the whole vibe the place. The hostess looked like she was 10 years old w/tattoos all over, that was a bit creepy and we had no idea who our waiter/waitress was because they kept changing and no one told us anything or introduced themselves to us, so when we needed something we were kinda scratching our heads, because one minute someone was coming to our table asking if everything was good the next they weren't trying to help us but someone else would (& not that we kept calling them over because we weren't, maybe once or twice). Leaving the place was difficult. We couldn't find anyone to give us our check, all of sudden no one was around for like 15 mins, that was odd. Will I recommend this place to friends, probably not.
