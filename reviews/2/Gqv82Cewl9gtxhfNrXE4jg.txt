While this used to be one of my favorite mexican style eatery...fine dining taste @ fast food prices, it no longer well get my five star rating from me. Yes the food is fresh & delicious but it in no way justifies a 50% increase in price on nearly every item on the menu over night!!! WTF for these same prices I might as well go to a regular mexican restaurant & not a fast food joint & get charged the same!
I would only recommend eating here if you want to pay fine dining prices from a fast food joint!
