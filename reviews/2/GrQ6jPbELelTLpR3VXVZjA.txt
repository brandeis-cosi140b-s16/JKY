Have been going here for 10 years. My wife really likes the Camarones Baja (sauteed shrimp). But this time full of salt. Sent it back; next batch just as bad and inedible. Server and manager apologized, but no offer of replacement or even a dessert. Was a chef mistake. Just took the item off the bill. I didn't make a ruckus in the crowded dining room, but very unhappy. And the vegetables were oily too. Maybe it is time for a change.
