a buddy of mine couldn't say enough great things about this place, so we met him and his girlfriend here last night for our first try. 

it was very quiet and quite empty, but that didn't turn us off. i started with the calderita margarita, a very large and tasty drink with a peppery kick. we had the fish taco appetizer and i thought it was very good. the mango salsa added a nice spicy/sweet flavor. 

my entree was a seafood "soup" in a white sauce. honestly though, as i was eating it, it didn't have any mexican flavor...it was more of an italian style dish. plus, several of my clams weren't steamed open, which means somethings wrong. the very least, they should've removed them from the dish. i've read if you eat unopened clams, you can get extremely ill. my wife had the shrimp diablo. yes, they were very hot, but at 24 bucks, i thought she'd get more than 4-5 shrimp. 

the chips and salsa were fine. we had to keep asking for more chips and never got the salsa's refilled...big disappointment. they did not pass the water glass test. our server was sweet, but hard to find. what disappointed me the most was what our dining companions had to say. his g-friend had the calderita as well and had to send it back. minutes later, my buddy had to have his calderita sent back. he was disappointed in his normally outstanding pasta dish. they both apologized for suggesting Caldero and said our experience this night wasn't indicative of their previous dining experiences there. 

and they advertise as a tequila bar, but we never saw a menu for tequilas...maybe if you sit at the bar. overall, i thought our dishes were overpriced and lacked Mexican inspired flavors. our friends will be back as they had previously good experiences, but we have other places we want to try so i doubt we'll be back.
