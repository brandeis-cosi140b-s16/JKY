Went here for breakfast. Selection was slim and essentially the same thing with one change. Scrambled eggs, bacon, with tortilla, and potatoes. Food was out fast but the eggs were not real and tasteless. The potatoes were seasoned (with a lot of salt). Way too expensive given the food quality, options and food taste. Service was fine.
