Just ate there at the suggestion of a local since I'm from out of town...it was very tasty, super cute atmosphere even in ridiculous heat. BUT!! Even though the taste was there (at least for the price) I had a hard time getting over 1) the hair in my cactus taco and 2) the fingernail in my fish taco. So..two strikes, so two stars.
