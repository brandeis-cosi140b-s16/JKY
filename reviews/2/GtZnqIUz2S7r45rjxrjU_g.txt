The only good thing about the food, was the taste of the meat.  You can tell the logistics are off, they don't have a great system or and also the presentation and proportions of the food.

I recently had jaw surgery so was looking forward to one of my first meals, and wanted to check this place out.  The girl up front took my order wrong, I said I wanted 1 Medium Carne asada Burrito (really small), 2 cabeza tacos and 1 pastor.  When I opened the food up there was 1 Burrito and 2 carne asada tacos.  So no cabeza and no pastor which I really wanted to try both of them; so was really disappointed because it wanted it to be a special meal.  I can really honestly say that I can make better tacos at home with better presentation and of course the meats I like.  Hopefully they can work the kinks and make themselves better!
