I was really excited to try Braddahs because I'm always on the hunt for good fish tacos. I heard this place has great ones, it was closer to me than rubios, so I gave it a try. 
It has a chipotle-like ordering style where you pick everything you want in and on your food. 
I got the three fish tacos to go with the hottest salsa available, black beans, cheese, cabbage, and fresh jalape√±os. 
When I got home I thought they looked nice but when I bit into them it was so underwhelming. The salsa wasn't even hot, the fish was dry and bland. The black beans were good but that's about it. Seriously the fish was so dry I couldn't even bite through it. 
If you're looking for a decent fish taco avoid this place.
