Eh. I almost want to give this a 1 star. The only thing preventing the downgrade is the fact that it was warm out, and I wanted a cold margarita. And they delivered. And it was half price. 

If I had to pay full price for that margarita and for my "fajita wrap" that was mainly lettuce and bland chedder cheese I'd have gone with the 1-star for sure. I went here with a group of women. If it wasn't a work event, I wouldn't have even gone. I heard miserable things about this place and I should have listened. 

Save your money. Go to a local independent mexican restaurant. Skip this adventure for better, more flavorful and adventurous dishes. If I wanted crappy mexican/southwest food, I'd have gone to Chili's.
