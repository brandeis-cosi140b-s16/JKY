Been here a few times now, food is mediocre at best. Had a waitress take my order down wrong, brought out a completely different dish. Last time I was there the waitress was very nice and accommodating, ordered the chicken quesadilla, the chicken was super dry. It's hit or miss with this place, but mostly a miss.
