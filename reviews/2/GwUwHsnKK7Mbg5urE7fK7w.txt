Usually Chipotle is pretty consistent but this one more than often lacks. 

Staff is friendly but the quality of the food just doesn't cut it. Portions are pretty bad too, I only got about a half cup of meat today...

The quality is just off, lettuce tasted dirty and the pico seemed to look blended instead of diced.

2 stars for friendly staff and pretty location
