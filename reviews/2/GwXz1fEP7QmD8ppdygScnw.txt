I am going to have to echo Alexander C's review about the variability in the quality here.  I have always thought of Rio Mirage as the best of the best for authentic Mexican food, but honestly my last time was not so great.  I am going to try again though since I realize any restaurant can have an off day.  Hoping for better next time.

My last visit I got it take-out.  Food was overly greasy, so much so I could not tolerate it.  Beans were good, but rice was not so tasty.

There is another Rio Mirage off of Bell Rd that is newer and is good, so may end up having to "switch" to that one.
