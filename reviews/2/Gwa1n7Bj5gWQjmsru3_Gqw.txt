For a city with a Tex Mex place for every 10 people, you've got to bring your A-game when you show up in the Queen City. I went to Texicali a few nights ago before the Sara Bareillis concert. They were completely unprepared for the foot traffic before the show. There was hardly anyone in the restaurant when my friend and I showed up, yet we stood in line behind about 8 other people for 5-10 minutes without seeing a hostess.  Since it was just the two of us, we thought the bar might be our best bet. The bartender was clearly frazzled and it took, in my opinion, much too long before he was able to take our drink and then our food order. The food was decent. I ordered two different types of fish tacos.  They could have used more salt.  And our food came out before the appetizer -- like 45 minutes before the appetizer. 

However, my order came out wrong -- one of the tacos was a steak taco when I ordered the Baha Mahi.  No big deal -- the promised they'd correct it and check on our appetizer also. Forty five minutes later, the appetizer came out and then finally my replacement taco, after I flagged down someone and asked about it... again. 

Accidents happen, but I was surprised they weren't more on top of it once they realized their mistake. They comped one of the tacos and our app, which was a nice gesture. I probably won't give this place another chance for the sheer number of better Tex Mex places in Charlotte.
