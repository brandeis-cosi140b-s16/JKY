Has anyone noticed that almost every Mexican joint in Phoenix claims to have won some award for their tacos. Someone needs to study this disturbing trend and clearly none of those awards could possibly be related to the taco Tuesday slop they are serving up to the customers. I did notice that a comedy night was also underway when I arrived and if you are ever thinking of attending (free) don't waste your time. It is clearly amateur night as bunch of people off the street are reading their routines right off the pad in front of the crowd. Oh, a heckler could have a field day here.
   The bar at this place is pretty small and full of smokers which don't add much to anything. Maybe some bar will get some balls and just ban smoking totally. Doubt it, but why the hell not?
    Ok, the tacos were not too good. The tex mex ground beef was luke warm, overloaded with lettuce and a semi-stale Ortega shell. The grease factor here was very high and the meat tasted of the Jack in the box variety. The $2 chicken taco has some good shredded chicken going for it, but everything else they threw in there didn't do it much justice and made it a watery mess of sour cream, tomato juice, bagged cheese and some chicken grease. Keep it simple should be the motto. I did like the corn hole arena, but this backyard needs to be renovated. They can make better use of the space in my opinion. Nobody greets you at the entrance, so you need to hope the servers find you when you seat yourself. Not that crowded on Tuesday, but other days, it could be a long wait.
