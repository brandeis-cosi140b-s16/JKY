After moving to Phoenix from Newport Beach I was thrilled to find a taste of home here in AZ. The food at Sol is still wonderful, but never have a received such poor service. The restaurant was practically empty at lunch time on a Saturday, yet it took at least 15 minutes to get a drink order in. Once approached by a server, he apologized and blamed the hostess for not telling him we were here waiting....Same server had been standing 5 feet from us chatting with kitchen staff the entire time. While trying to get the attention of other waitstaff, they made clear eye contact only to walk away without saying a word. 

I always remembered the other location for having superb service as well as a varied and interesting menu, but here in Scottsdale, we were ignored our entire meal and treated as an annoyance. Sol has always been a wonderful dining experience; Great food but even better service. While the food was tasty as always, what could have been an amazing dining experience was ruined by the rude and inattentive staff. I loved this restaurant before, and had always been a loyal patron to the Newport Beach location. But Scottsdale, you have fallen far short...Never will I waste my time here again.
