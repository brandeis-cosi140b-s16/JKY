So bummed! You know when you're starving either everythinng taste great or you dont really taste it at all because you ate it so fast. Well We were both starving and I give it a 2.  The only good things here were the tortillas and a plus for serving coca cola product. Plates were full and cheap prices but still not worth the $11.00 for us.  Shredded beef burrito was runny and full of super sweet tomato sauce! I asked ahead of time if the beans were homemade the cashier said yes. Maybe they are but I ddn't have to taste twice to know they're fresh out of a can w/o being doctored up
