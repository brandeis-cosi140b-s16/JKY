Bad Mexican food in Arizona?!  Is this even possible?

We ordered a taco salad, it was hamburger meat with no seasoning in a soggy shell.

I ordered a burrito and didn't finish it.  The tortilla was terrible and something inside was burnt and acidic tasting.

This is the food you get when you are in a mexican restaurant in the northeast USA.  Tortillas are powdery and taste like flour.  Ground beef replaces carne asada and machaca.  Nothing has any flavor.

It's the mexican food you'd get at applebees.  Skip it, go anywhere else.  You know a hole-in-the-wall place called Bob's or Burrito Hut is gonna have better mexican food.  Don't deny it.
