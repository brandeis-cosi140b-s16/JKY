Stopped by for take out and ended up waiting about 30 minutes on some wings, 2 burgers and Chencho Fries. I found out that this wasn't a good idea. Their food is not as tasty if it's not fresh. I wish they would have used nacho cheese vs string cheese on the Chencho fries. It dried up as one big piece of cheese on top. With all that being said, I didn't have the best experience this day but maybe next time I'll just try the pizza, a FRESH one!
