If you're prone to getting seizures, this isn't the restaurant for you. They have tv monitors ONLY playing Motley Crue's live shows with TONS of flashing lights. It was really annoying to see it in the corner of my eye, in front of me, EVERYWHERE as I tried to eat.

Our waiter was really nice and accommodating. The chips and salsa were pretty good! Warm crunchy chips, and not bad salsa. 

I got the pork enchiladas $13.95- and it was yummy. Very cheesy, and a good amount of everything. It was inhaled. 

My mom got just a bean and cheese burrito, but she didn't enjoy it very much.

My dad got tostada plate for $12.95 and he really enjoyed it. He loved the guacamole, but I actually thought it was kind of gross. LOL. 

Wouldn't come back though.
