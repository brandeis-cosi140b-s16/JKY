I went with my Living Social coupon to try this place again after a long absence.  It's not that I didn't like the place originally - it had turned into a Chucky Cheese on the weekends since kids now eat free.  I had fond memories of the Cajun Nachos which I had there several times and absolutely loved.  The dish was the single reason I went back.  My friend and I sat in the bar area...no kids - perfect.  I presented the coupon as directed and the waitress came over quickly.  We ordered only waters and between that and the coupon, the waitress' demeanor turned frosty to say the least.  I open the menu and discover that the Cajun Nachos are gone from the menu.  Not one to let things like that ruin a good time, I found spicy shrimp nachos that sounded pretty darn good.  We decided on those and the BBQ Chicken Nachos.....entree size for both.  Waittress came back to take order and we ordered drinks (I had the Pamatini which was quite good).  Waittress's demeanor defrosted immediately and she was just fine the rest of the meal (except for the nacho issue....see below).  I can't say the same for the Nachos.  Shrimp was better but neither blew me away.  They say they make all the chips fresh and while I don't dispute that, I was NOT impressed with the chips at all.  They tasted kind of stale and got mushy FAST.  I have had tons of good to great nachos over the years...these didn't make that list at all.  Btw...I asked about the Cajun Nachos (they have both spicy shrimp and andouille sausage on the menu)...I got a blank stare from the waittress.  Surely something could have been thrown together in the kitchen?  Nachos aren't rocket science after all.  Her tip settled at a a flat 15% after that.  I usually go closer to 20%.  Apparently there is a new chef and the presentation of the nachos is totally different and the menu changed....not for the better.  Bottom line:  I won't be going back.  I'm done.
