Decent mexican tacoria, I got the pork carnitas burrito. It was filling, but definitely greasy. They don't offer free chips like most tacorias which is a bummer. If you purchase a drink they do offer unlimited refills (horchata included!). I also shared the carne asada fries with a friend. That was a huge serving and had plenty of meat, I was not disappointed. The only problem was that you got really sick of eating it. 

Would I come here again? Yes, but its not a spot where I'd suggest going to first. 

-1 star for no free chips, -2 for mediocre food
