This Baja Fresh really didn't impress me.  It's pricey considering that all you're getting is meat in a tortilla.  It doesn't have that Mexican feel to it and is unoriginal.  There were bugs on the wall.  The food is good however.  Nothing special though.  Since it's a corporate chain you can't expect sizzling flavor but I was left unsatisfied.  There are better Mexican food places to go to.
