Nah, not great food, but at least it's cheap. Food gets 2 stars, but price gets 3 stars.

3 tacos for $5.25 - tasted like it was from taco bell.

2 chicken tostadas for $6 something - tasted like mush, but cheap

salsa & chips for under $2 and they gave a lot of salsa.

Is this place great? No. 
Would I go back again? No.
Is it cheap? Yes.
