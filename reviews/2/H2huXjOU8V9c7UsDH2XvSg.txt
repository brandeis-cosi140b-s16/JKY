This restaurant chain is.. Decent. My bf and I have visited this location a couple times when we are craving mexican food and can't find anything else. 

The beef tacos are pretty darn good but everything else is just ok. Beans and rice are very.... Bland just like their customer service. Now that I have discovered los taquitos on 48th and elliot featured on Diners,Drive-ins,and Dives. Boy is their carne asada worth the trip and gas. No more mediocre mexican cuisine!
