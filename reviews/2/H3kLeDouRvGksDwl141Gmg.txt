Only giving it two stars because our server, Allison, was so outstanding!!! Actually, she deserves a full five. The food was extremely disappointing. Our appetizer was the Crab Corn Cakes, tasted of canned crab (more like tuna flavor) and grease. The burger ordered by both my husband and nephew, was a soggy mess. The pizza I ordered claimed to have shrimp and cilantro pesto, but, neither was detected by eye or taste. We were hoping that this could turn into our go to place with such high reviews, unfortunately, I think my personal kitchen could produce far greater results.
