Ok here is the thing, I went back another time and it was good. 

About a month later we came late with our roomie. It was bar service only since it was late. 

The bartender a middle aged over weight red haired guy went to get our chips..


I watched him walk over to the chips and grab handfuls of chips with his bare hands. HE IS THE BARTENDER HANDLEING MONEY AND HE WAS JUST HOLDING A DIRTY RAG.

I asked him for a new batch that was "hand picked" he said it was all bare hand touched. 

I told him that was fine for the food preparers that dont handle fecal, infectious disease money!!

He acted like I was retard, I didnt eat anything after I saw this but we did have a few bites and the food was not good.

It wasnt aweful but it wasnt good as before, AT ALL!

Get it together over there


more like 2 and a half

P.S. If the owners read this, he needs to be schooled. I wish I knew his name, he may have had a mustache?
