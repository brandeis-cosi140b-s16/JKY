I was here last night for my birthday. We started at the bar drinking their $3.50 Margaritas. They were delicious ! The bartender was nice and kept our chips and salsa filled . I'm a huge fan of Emiliano's but the drinks were way cheaper here so we decided to stay for dinner . The food was OK. Very far from "delicious". I'd go for drinks again but will not eat the food-- mostly because I've been sitting in the bathroom since about twenty minutes after I ate ..... I'll save yinz the details.
