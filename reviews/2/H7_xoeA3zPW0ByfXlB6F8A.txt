So disappointing. In Vegas for a convention and noticed the Yelp deal for a free margarita with check in so my coworker and I planned our night around Cabo Wabo for dinner. Let me tell you - the Yelp deal is SO NOT WORTH IT.  

The on the house yelp Margarita was way way way way too sweet.  It was like a bunch of sugar with a tiny splash of lime and tequila.  I would have rather dined at another place than wasting my time.  My carne asade tacos themselves were good, but the rice and beans were cold.  Like they were just sitting in the back in a silver bin waiting to be served to the next victim. 

Lastly, the server seemed attentive but really wasn't.  After asking him - TWICE - for some hot sauce for me meal he then questioned why I would need it and asked wasn't the salsa on the tacos hot enough?

Thanks yelp for the incentive but next time I'll definitely pass.
