Okay so I go in to get my enchilada on. I asked for ground beef and was loudly told "no ground beef, only shredded." So I decided to get 1 chicken and 1 cheese. The cheese was not melted in my enchilada and the chicken was a pinkish color. I was somewhat worried about food poisoning. :( I will not be returning.
