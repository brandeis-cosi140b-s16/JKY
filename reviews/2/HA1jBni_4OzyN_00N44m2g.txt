Second review , because this time they were actually open, yay. They get 3 stars for the sand volleyball, horseshoe pits, cornball, and close proximity to the baseball games at Peoria Sports Complex. BUT the service was whack, so I took a star away. Took forever for our waitress to come, then took forever for our beer re-orders.  The "award winning" margarita was just meh. The carnitas tacos? - don't bother, super greasy.  The one food plus - the calamari taco, yum!  Bottomless chips and salsa? Laughable- waiter took our chips mid-service and never returned, lol.  Insane service. 
Go for beer and sit at the bar.
