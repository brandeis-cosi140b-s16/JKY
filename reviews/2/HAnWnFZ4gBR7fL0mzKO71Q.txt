How does this place have four stars? We came in at 6:30 on a Friday night and it was empty except for one one table.  There were two girls working who were less them excited to help us or the gentleman waiting in front of us. I asked for a steak bowl and there was literally 4 little pieces of steak in the pan..I told her I really wanted Steak,  and she said they only had chicken or carnitas. We both said we really wanted steak,  the girl (Hispanic wears glasses) turned around grabbed 3 pieces of steak from a covered pan that was NOT hot cut it up and put it on my bowl. Lame!

My food tasted like microwave saltiness,  and my boyfriend got a steak burrito and said it was chewy, salty, and rubbery.

I give them one star for cleanliness,  and one star for having coke products. I wouldn't give this place a second try.
