We had high hopes for this place based on "Diners, Drive-ins and Dives" but have tried it twice and both times the place was WAY too loud to enjoy/talk/share...it was a nightmare of noise, with awful thumping music coupled with shouting clientele.  Food is very unremarkable, with a staff that is very young and not clued in.  I asked for blackened fish but got gooey drippy bbq sauce all over...and portions were not great.

The only positive was the salsa.

Not worth it, as there are much better Mexican joints where you can actually hold a conversation and enjoy your friends while you eat great Mexican food.
