The food was not amazing and we literally spent 30 minutes arguing with the manager about our bill.  The prices are listed differently on the menu, we ordered food from the menu (even pointed at specific drinks) but were surprised when the prices came back as double. They also added gratuity for 8 people where there were 6... Bad experience. 

BUT they have us all a shot of tequila at the end for the huge struggle.
