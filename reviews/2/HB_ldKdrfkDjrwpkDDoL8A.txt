Tacos El Gordo is a bit of a zoo, even at 2 am. I took the time to skim the Yelp reviews before walking in which helped. I knew about the individual lines for the various kinds of tacos and i knew there would be a language barrier if I didn't speak Spanish. So be it, I can point and smile and I came out with actually more tacos than I wanted...but oh well. The drink station is not very well thought out or placed, you get your cups after you pay . And the cashiers were nice and friendly and the horchata wasn't that bad.  

But it's a taco place..and the tacos...really aint all that. Lengua....not impressed, as it was actually kinda cold when I got to try it...I ended up not eating all of it. Al pastor...was nothing special either. But I really looked forward to the Adobada...and it was the only taco that saved me from going home hungry. If I go back it's the only thing I'll buy again. 

That being said Taco y Taco's adobaba blows El Gordo out of the water...it's not even close. 

Recommendation: If you're stuck on the strip and don't want to pay strip prices it will shut your stomach up. But if it's not late and you can drive a bit, there are much better choices available.
