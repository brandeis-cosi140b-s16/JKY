Food was OK. Have had better and also worse. But check your bill before paying. Just had 3 people add the bill and all 3 had different totals. Seemed like the server was trying to get away with adding additional gratuity ON TOP of the already added gratuity for a larger group by "adding wrong". That doesn't sit well in my book. Check you bill people.
