Was craving a torta Tuesday night 7/3, and I knew that my fave was already closed by 830pm (Tortas El Guero). Also had my g/f that night, who'd never had one. She ordered the Paquime, and I had the Cubano w/o beans. I was highly disappointed. Those two sandwhiches are nowhere approaching the same league as my fave, or Tortas Del Rey. Tiny, thin, and so-so on the taste. 

My g/f loved hers, and kept wondering why I was disappointed. On July 4th, I called and found T El G was open, and I promptly took her there. Then, and only then, with close comparison, could she understand the vast chasm of difference between a true TORTA, and those two jokers we had the night before. 

NOW, I want to be clear I'm only disappointd in their sandwhiches. The place is large, clean, friendly and OPEN late. I saw a salad and a plate dish or two coming out of that kitchen for which I WILL RETURN to sample.It's just that when I want a REAL -DEAL TORTA, it won't be there.
