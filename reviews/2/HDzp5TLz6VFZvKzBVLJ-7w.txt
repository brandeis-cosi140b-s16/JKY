Best chips and salsa in town! However, there's something funny with the guac (I love table side prepped guac and this was NOT that).  It came prepped and strangely sweet. 

Weird. My son (a toddler) chose an uncrustable for lunch (I know, how lame), I was thrilled it was an option honestly. However, they microwaved it!!  No No No! It specifically states DO NOT microwave on the box - My son got a soupy (and hot-pocket-esque) mess. Was soupy and gross. 

Things just seems to be more around cost cutting and not as "fresh" as you'd want a mexican place to be. My husband really liked his carne asana tacos... But we won't be back.
