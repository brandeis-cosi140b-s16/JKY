We tried chicken & carne burritos & a salad. Really good flavors across the board. Food itself is fine, no complaints there. Major problem is their service & line setup - it wasn't all that busy the day we tried it and yet they rushed us through the line like there was a fire. I get the fast casual concept, but that was ridiculous! There's no point in pushing people through choices when there was a bottleneck at the cashier and we didn't get our food any sooner had they taken a second to clearly explain options or give us a chance to even see what all toppings are available (they didn't design the queue well and you don't see your options until you're right on top of them). Staff didn't communicate well & just about made the wrong burrito before my family noticed and spoke up. Also they just assumed everyone wanted rice & didn't ask. Price is high too for what you're getting. Chipotle & Costa Vida are superior. Likely won't go back but flavor of the food is the only reason they rank higher than 1 star.
