I just had my thrid meal here, the food is VERY good... 
I just don't know if i will go back... which sucks cause i like the food...
so they have signs all over.... 1/2 price maragritas thursday with several brands of tequilla listed underneath that sign saying all are 1/2 off... so i ask for a patron margarita and he says just house is half off.................sign clearly states otherwise, i point this out and the waiter all of a sudden has a hard time understanding english??? Not cool for me.. i did not get a margy... and am sad i had a bad experience here.
