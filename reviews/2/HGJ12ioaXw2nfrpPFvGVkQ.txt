Man, it's so hard to find good food without having to go someplace upscale it seems. I get that it's airport food but does it all have everything have to taste so artificial. My chips tasted like it was made of low grade corn tortillas. My carne asada was like powdery textured meat. I'm not feeling satiated and I just blew another $25 on tacos and beer. If you're in bind, this place is fine but you'd probably get fresher options from Starbucks
