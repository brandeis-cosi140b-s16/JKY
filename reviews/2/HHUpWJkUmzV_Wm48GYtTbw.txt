Although my first visit to the Martinez Taco Bar wasn't stunning, I do think this place has a lot of potential.  It's clean, cute, and the staff is friendly.  Their prices are extremely reasonable.  HOWEVER, I had the al pastor burrito wet style and the meat was so incredibly salty I could only eat a 1/4 of it.  They accommodated my desire for both red and green sauce.  The sauce was delicious, but also a bit too salty.  I was hoping their salsa bar would be more like Chipotle's or Roberto's instead, each salsa had a sweetness that didn't appeal to me.  My husband had the carnitas taco special that came with a soda.  The sign said it was $5.99; we were charged $7.99 and didn't realize it until we left.  He did love his tacos, however.  I really hope they read these reviews and implement some changes because as I said, I do see the potential.  I do plan to visit again and really hope to raise my review.
