We almost did not enter as the place was empty about 7pm, but I had read about the 16 salsa's and we pushed forward just as one other car pulled into the dimly lit parking lot. The Mexican restaurant next door was packed, so we probably should have went over there. This regional brand of Mexican food might appeal to non-gringos as most of the food was quite unusual and hot and some food was just downright bad. The 1/2 order of guac had large chunks of avocado, but also has raisins and a liquidy kind of taste. It was not what you would expect in a normal Mexican joint. The steak tacos I ordered had to be sent back due to excessive fatty pieces and the chicken tinga tacos were way too spicy for a normal palette. The spicy theme continued as nearly all 16 salsa's had a version of heat that ran too hot. This was a sweaty experience, so gringo's stay away. On a positive note, the pregnant waitress was very nice and helpful.
