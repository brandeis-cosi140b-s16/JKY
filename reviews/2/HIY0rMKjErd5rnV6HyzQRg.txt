Seems I always get the shakey table in these joints.  Been here two other times and was satisfied but this time, the tAble just rocked too much for me. Why don't I say anything? Because a class establishment would notice this, that's why. And then apologize and give me another table. Food is kind of dry today as well. Will I ever be back? If you're paying I will
