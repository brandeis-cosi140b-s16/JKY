While visiting the area recently, we were told that this was a great Mexican restaurant to try.  Well we did, but we won't again.  First problem was encountered in the parking lot when we came upon vomit in a parking space near the front door.  Not a good first impression.  The salsa was okay but a bit spicy for our tastes.  The cheese dip that we ordered first was watered down and really tasteless.  One in our party had a small change to her order which didn't happen in the first round, and when it was brought back, it still wasn't right.  The "small plates" on the menu came out on plates the size of pizza pans with lots of beans and rice to fill the space.  In some cases this would be a good thing but when you're looking for a small plate, not so much.
