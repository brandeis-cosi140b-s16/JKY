Pub crawl stop 3: By this time, the rum drinks, vodka and beers were catching up to me as I made my way to Chronic Tacos. There was only one other person with the Light Rail shirt on, so maybe they didn't know either. The flyer promoted 2 pints of Bud Light, Land Shark, Stella, Kona or Widmer...I ordered Stella and it came in a plastic cup for $4. The bar was packed with people, both inside and outside...I sat at a booth and worked on my drink...I finally had to find the bathroom and I wasn't impressed with that either. It appeared to be a one-person room, but typically two guys went in together. It had an open seat toiled and a urinal, but I would classify it as recommended for one person...so I was a little displeased when another guy walked in with me. After sitting back at my booth, I was starting to feel a little hungry and thought mmm tacos...but maybe that was a different part of the bar? The portion I was in only had drinks and I didn't see anyone else eating...which in my drunken state of mind I wondered why is it called Chronic Tacos if there are no tacos? 

I didn't like this place because I was screwed on the drink price, I wanted a taco and the bathroom situation.
