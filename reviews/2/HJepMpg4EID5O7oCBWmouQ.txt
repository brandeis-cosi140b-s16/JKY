This particular Filibertos location has consistently been among the worst I've been to, and I've been to most of them. I don't know if this franchise has different recipes or just gets their ingredients from other lower quality sources than others, but whatever they do differently, its not good.

Beans are always bland. In fact, nearly everything at this one is more bland than others. Burritos tend to be smaller too. Even the hot sauce is weird at this one.

On the plus side, they have an every day dollar menu, which most simply don't have.  This includes cinnamon chips!  Those are awesome and I wish every Filibertos had them. 

Go to Val Vista and Baseline. Its a close alternative, and FAR  superior food.
