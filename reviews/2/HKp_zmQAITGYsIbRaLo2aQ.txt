The place is interesting. We ate outside, and ended up here on a recommendation to the couple we were meeting.  First, we didn't find out till we were leaving that you have to ask for chips.  They are free, but, they don't come without asking.  Second, the waitress, although they are pretty new, didn't seem to care out our table.  One of four orders were incorrect.  The witness really didn't care.  She must have told the manager though, as she came out, and made an attempt to fix things, but was less that stellar on the solution.  The food was fine, but maybe it isn't my cup of mexican food.  There are so many amazing places to eat in a square block space down there, I don't see a need to go back.  Hope others have a better experience.
