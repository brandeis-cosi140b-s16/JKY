Been here twice! Our first experience was beyond terrible. Servers and hostess's were bad! First time, the server never showed up to offer us any drinks etc, we were waiting for over 20 minutes. We left. It's really nice inside. But the service and food is just all around bad. Tried the tacos, $5.00 for a dam taco? Have had way better tacos than that. The chicken taco was drenched in fat, the only one that was semi-good was the adovada taco? I think. The salsa was delish! I'm a salsa freak, so I would know.  The rice was gross and the beans?? Don't even get me started on that. On a scale of 1-10, 10 being yummy, I say their food is a 3!! Overall, too expensive, bad service and "blah" food.
