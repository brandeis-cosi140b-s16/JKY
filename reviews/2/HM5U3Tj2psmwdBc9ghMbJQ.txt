I was very disappointed in the Cantina mexican restaurant. The food was mediocre at best. My husband does not like " wasting " money so this place was a bust for us.  A little walk down to Marilyns cafe would have been better. From the chips and salsa to our main course, mine being the seafood relleno to my husband's chimichanga. The servers where pretty good but not as awesome as Marilyns cafe. We used our 2 for 1 coupon so we didn't waste too much money.  Steer clear of this place and head over to lindo michocan.
