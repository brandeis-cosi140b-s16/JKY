We went to Top Shelf because we had a coupon from our Entertainment book for a buy one, get one free entree.  When we got to the restaurant, we hung out in the waiting area for a few minutes before the hostess came to seat us, but we enjoyed looking at the fish tank while we waited.  Our waitress was nice and kept our drinks filled and the food was pretty good, but maybe a little pricey for the portions.  When the bill came, we gave the waitress our coupon.  She brought back the bill and our kid's meal was the one given to us free.  When we asked, she said she tried to give us the second adult entree as the free meal, but the manager wouldn't let her.  She then had the manager come talk to us, but he wouldn't budge on the matter.  I have never been to a restaurant that considers a kid's meal to be an entree.  It seems this company is more concerned with making a couple bucks than good service that brings back return customers.
