So maybe I just have crappy luck with this place but every time I go in, which isn't often, they run out of chicken. Ugh. How does a chicken place repeatedly run out of chicken? And every time I go in I wait forever and a day for my order. The two stars are because the food is decent and the cashier was friendly.

I'd like to say I wont be back but....
