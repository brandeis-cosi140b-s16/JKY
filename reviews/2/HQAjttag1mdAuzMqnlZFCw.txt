After seeing this place start to chain out everywhere I decided to give them a shot. Seems like a good idea but I left after waiting in line for too long. There was only one couple eating and 2 people ahead of me but nothing moved. I guess I wasn't in a patient mood but I had to leave frustrated. I'll give them another shot sometime. Two people working on a busy Friday night while ASU is in session won't cut it.
