We went to dinner at L.P. last Monday and were really disappointed. We sat ourselves, then waited for awhile before anyone came to take our order. The food was pretty good, but then after we had our check for about 15 minutes, I finally stood up and started looking for the waiter, who hadn't appeared. Another waiter asked me "What's wrong?" and I told him we wanted to pay and get out of there. He took the check, apologized for the wait and finally came back with change. Our original waiter seemed to have gone home. Bad service for a rather slow day. Won't go back.
