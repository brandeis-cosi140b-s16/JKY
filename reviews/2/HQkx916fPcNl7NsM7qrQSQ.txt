The green corn tamale was hard, cheese enchilada was OK. Rice was good and beans standard. What gave it 2 stars is the service. A kid at Taco Bell is friendlier. I sat at the bar and I think the bartender talked to me once, and it was to see if I wanted anything else. UM... NO! Service makes everything. It can make so so food better... This service made the bad food stand out more. I will be going to El Encanto Dos instead. It is out of the way but it is better service and much better food.
