Dirty... Floors, tables, waste cans. Salsa bar was watered down and tasteless. Cashier was handling the food with her bare hands--patting the burrito shells on the grill and transferring the cooked food to the trays...seriously, this is a health violation. The food was good, but could have been better. I am not overly sensitive, but this was too much.
