Sorry, but the second try did this place in as far as we're concerned.  Slow, slow kitchen.  The "Burro" was eh - good meat but poorly flavored filling.  The "cowboy" beans were lousy, as was the tasteless rice.  My wife had the lasagna-style Chicken (Chickaquiles or something like that) - pure mush with very little chicken.  Charles, you need to spend some time here!!!

The drinks were good.
