Salsa is ok. A little bland. Went here once and service was not good! We got our food and it was nothing special. We asked for more salsa and she said ok and never brought it out. We were halfway into our food and asked for it again and she still never brought it out. I don't get what's so hard about that. We asked for it again and she said they were getting ready to bring it out. What? There is no way they are out of salsa. Horrible.
