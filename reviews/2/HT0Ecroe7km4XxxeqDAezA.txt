There's fast food and there is sloppy food.

The Qdoba is sloppy. How sloppy you ask?

So sloppy that the black bean that fell onto the counter is tossed back onto your nachos. So sloppy they they give you a ton of sour cream and barely any queso. So sloppy that your quesadilla will be soggy and drippy and contain no melted cheese. 

This is why everyone loves Chipotle across the street.
