I am a huge fan of Gardunos in ALBUQUERQUE but not Scottsdale.  It seems like when they opened here in Scottsdale, they forgot to make sure the food tastes good.  I have been here many times and it seems like the food was frozen prior to it being served.  Also, the service is not too good.  If you sit at the bar, be prepared for an over eager, spikey haired bartender to offer you a drink.  Also be prepared for him to forget that he took your order.  Yes, this HAS happened to me.  The margaritas are WATERED DOWN and the BEERS ARE FLAT!  The best thing about this is their happy hour.  They have a lot of free food.  Of course, be prepared to get SCOWLED AT if you pig out on the food and don't have more than one beer. Haha.
