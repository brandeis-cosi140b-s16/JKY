I do not want to bash this place because the food was OK, but as other reviewers have said you do not see the value here as opposed to other taco shops.  The place is pretty clean, that being said on my experience there was not a clean booth to be found, we retrived napkins, wetted them, and cleaned our own table.  The temperature inside the restaurant would have been too cold in the summer, I do not think they had the heat on, probably a function of keeping the bills down.  In addition to their keeping the bills down the portions are rather small, there is no salsa bar with fill your own salsas (Other Armando's have this), and the $2 upcharge on the rice and beans is barely worth it, only a taste of each.  Given the limited choices in the area I think this will be a burrito to go stop going forward.
