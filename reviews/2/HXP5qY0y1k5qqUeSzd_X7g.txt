I was really looking forward to eating at Richardsons but was unfortunately let down. My wife and I ordered 3 dishes and only one was worth eating.  The ceviche comes in a bowl of salsa with little fish. The garlic plate was okay but nothing to write home about.  Our final dish was the carne adobada. I loved this dish but it was a little too spicy for my wife.  The service was great however our first round of drinks tasted watered down and at $13 per drink, I would like it to taste like it contained alcohol.
