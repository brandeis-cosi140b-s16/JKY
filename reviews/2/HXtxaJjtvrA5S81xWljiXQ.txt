We were seated immediately which was great but thats when the pleasantries started to tamper off. Our waitress was very absent minded and quick to leave our table. The complimentary chips and dips were not fresh and the bean dip was very cold. It took several attempts to get our drink order filled. I finally had to ask one of the bussers for new dips and an more water. He helped immediately where as our server was non existent.  Food was ok, kinda pricey for the quantity but I am not planning a return anytime soon.
