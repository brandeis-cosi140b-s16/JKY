This past weekend, I went there because the homegirl raved about how good it is. So I got dragged along. I thought the combos were generous and looked tasty. You know how you're looking forward to something after some has talked it up? Yea well, when it takes a serious dive to hell you never want to listen to that person again.
Filiberto's is a no go. The chicken taco was bland. The beans were decent but not great. The burrito was filled with DRY DRY DRY stringy, shredded beef and nothing else. I barely made it through the taco. 
The service was nice but they were under staffed for Sunday lunch rush.
No no Filiberto.
