Not impressed took almost 25 minutes to get out carne Asada fries. I overheard the girl say we burnt the fries what do we do.  Out Asada fries have hardly any fries I have literally 1 pound each of guacamole and pico de gallo. I wanted Asada fries not a guacamole plate. Very disappointing Will probably never be back
