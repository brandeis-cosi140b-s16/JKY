I'd like to give this place more stars (especially since it's in Champaign) but the reality is that as far as Latin-fusion goes the food here is horrible.  I went late evening with a friend and paid $15+ for some watery mole and burnt beans.  Sadly, this is the best Champaign has to offer, but if you want some real high-end Latino food stick to Chicago.
