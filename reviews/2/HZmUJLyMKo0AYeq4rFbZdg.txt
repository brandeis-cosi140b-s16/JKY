Ricky's is a Mexican restaurant in Old Town Scottsdale with no Mexican food? I went over the Labour Day long weekend after reading a lot of positive reviews, and with a craving for real Mexican food. It took quite a while for my friend and I to be seated. Despite the fact that the place was half empty, most of the tables were still covered in dirty dishes. When we were finally shown to a table and given menus, it took quite a while for a server to come and take our order. My friend ordered a Corona and I ordered a margarita - we were told that they were out of Corona. Really? It's CORONA. It's not exactly in short supply. So we changed our drink orders to share a Bulldog and off the waitress went. 

She came back about 5 minutes later without our drinks and asked to take our dinner order. We each ordered fajitas - and at that point the waitress rolled her eyes, tossed her hair and said "Ok, we're out of beans and rice and tortilla chips, but we'll take $2 off any order that comes with those items as sides." Really?!? It's a MEXICAN restaurant - EVERY dish comes with rice and beans! Again, it's rice and beans! Go to Costco and get more! There isn't exactly a shortage of them. 

We agreed that we didn't want to eat there s nothing else really looked appealing on the menu, and we left. It would have been considerate of them to tell us this before we even sat down, rather than wasting our time while the hangry-ness set in. We also learned that nothing is open past 9pm on Sunday's despite it being a long weekend - so we ended up with disgusting take-out pizza. Boooo
