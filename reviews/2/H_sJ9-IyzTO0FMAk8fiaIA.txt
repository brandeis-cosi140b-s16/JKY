Really disappointed all around. The service was mediocre at best and it took a significant amount of time to receive any of our order. I ordered the frozen peach margarita, crunchy pork street tacos, and Spanish rice. 

Margarita: my margarita was not blended at all--the  syrup, which was room temperature, sat on the bottom of the glass...gross. There was also a disproportional amount of syrup (probably 1/3 was the peach syrup) making my drink very weak. In addition, I asked for my drink to have a salt rim, which it did not.

Tacos: My avocados on top were dry as if they had been sitting out. The pork was overlooked and dry. 

Spanish Rice: I never received my rice, which wasn't surprising given the subpar service. The only bonus was that they did not add the rice to my bill.

The only reason I gave this place a 2 instead of a 1 was for the relatively low prices during Happy Hour. I will not dine here again.
