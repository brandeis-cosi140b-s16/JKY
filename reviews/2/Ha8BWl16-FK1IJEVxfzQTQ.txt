Where'd that come from?

Reminds me of the brothel in the model town from Beatlejuice.  A tourist trap, cookie-cutter "authentic Mexican Cantina" located on the strip.  They have a Margarita bar with slushy machines spinning and some allegedly hot wings.  Unfortunately it's a dive bar that's been polished up and shoved into a tourist locale.
