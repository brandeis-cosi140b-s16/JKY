I have to downgrade Some Burros.  I have been here a few times since the last review and ordered some of the other items and they just did not measure up to the tacos.  

The burrito I ate had an excessive amount of tortilla and not enough carne asada. The Mexican pizza shrunk in size- it was smaller than I recalled and really was not very tasty.  I don't care for their green chile beef, which was a lot spicier than I expected.  

And really, the salsa they serve is not very good.  I think Pace Picante tastes better than what they are currently serving.
