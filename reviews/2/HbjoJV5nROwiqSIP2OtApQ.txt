Out of all the Chipotles in the city, this one is by far one that is operated the worst.  Portions are weak,  they need to work on thier cleanliness. Service is subpar. You do not get your monies worth from this location.  I think it needs an overhaul with better management. hours are horrible,  they close at 10 yet the line was out the door till 1030. They need to revamp thier customer service. Maybe I should have just settled for a burger tonight.
