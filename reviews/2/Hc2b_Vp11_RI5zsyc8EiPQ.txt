I have had better food. We were very disappointed when we dined in. I understand the cashier was new but there was no manager or anyone else to help this poor girl.  It threw me off the the tacos come with beans inside. I have never been to a place that does that. Service is slow and nothing extraordinary. The pineapple agua fresca had an aluminum after taste so I don't recommend that either.  They have decent cheap combos but make sure to tell the cashier you want the combo because she said there were no combos and everything was a la carte. Just overall disappointed with the food and service.
