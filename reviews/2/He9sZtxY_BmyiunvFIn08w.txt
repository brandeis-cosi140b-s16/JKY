Stopped by America's for 2 bean burritos to go: an XL America's and Terry's way; and a reg America's way, plus pineapple and no cheese.

First attempt: XL perfect but reg burrito has beans only. I'd just eat it, but it's like $1.50 to add anything on (which, btw, is nuts for like a tablespoon of diced jalapenos.)
Second attempt: guy at register is super nice, confirms order (America's way, pineapple, no cheese) before putting the order in again. Burrito has jalapenos and pineapple... and cheese.
Gave up.

I don't know, maybe just don't get food to go?

Total for 2 bean burritos (including tax/tip): $16 and change

Come on.
