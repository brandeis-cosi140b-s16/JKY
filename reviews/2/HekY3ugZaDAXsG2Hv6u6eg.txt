I was totally disappointed from the food to the service the food was barely edible. the service was slow waitress did not know the menu or the ingredients. We ordered the  top shelf margarita we split it, it was nothing to write home about. The only thing on my plate that was absolutely good was the grilled vegetables they were crunchy and seasoned well. The talipia was bland and saturated with oil is very greasy yuck! 
The have a beautiful  view of the courtyard with lights.
