I really like eating at El Pollo Loco but I will never come to this store again. The chicken was under cooked and the restaurant was dirty. Most the tables were un-cleaned and the salsa bar was disgusting. After I finished eating I went into the restroom to wash my hands and was disgusted by how filthy it was as well. I am surprised the health department hasn't dinged them. That said I will still be going to the El Pollo Loco on Cheyenne as it is always clean, the chicken is cooked properly and the services is good. I'm giving it two stars only because I know other stores are better.
