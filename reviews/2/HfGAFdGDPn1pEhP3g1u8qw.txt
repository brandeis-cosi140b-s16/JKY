I really use to like this place, but lately not so much. I asked for black beans instead of the refried, and the refried showed up. Then it was $11 for two small tacos. I really didn't believe it, but checked my bill and there it was. Don't think I'll be going back. Very sad. I always wanted this to be my default mexican restaurant for my Slow Carb meal plan in 2012. :(
