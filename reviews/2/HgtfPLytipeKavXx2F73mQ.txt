Great Ambiance, Inconsistent Food...

I've visited The Carlsbad Tavern off and on over the years, and I REALLY want to be able to like it unconditionally. The drinks are good, I LOVE the ambiance, and the service, while varied, is generally good. This is a great place to have a drink or two and just enjoy being where you are. 

My challenge here has always been the food. I won't refer back to past food disappointments, but once again on my last visit during a busy happy hour, the meat in my Angus Beef Filet Mignon Tacos was dry, and in some instances hard. 

No matter how great the atmosphere, even if I'm getting happy hour priced food, basic quality standards should be in place.
