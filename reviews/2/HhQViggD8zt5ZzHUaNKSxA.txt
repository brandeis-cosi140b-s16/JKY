The food here is very typical mexican american food and definitely sub par if you fancy yourself a food lover. The prices are pretty good for the amount of food and the service was great. Warning....the chile relleno has no pepper. It was literally beef and cheese melted on a plate. WHAT? Pretty sure that's blasphemy in any mexican restaurant.
