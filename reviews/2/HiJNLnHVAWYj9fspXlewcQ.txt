Dear Carefree Station,

     What has happened to you? You used to be one of the few good places out here, but now it seems you are Sybil......Like one yelper said...Are you American? Are you Asian? Are you Mexican? You used to be what I would call Southwestern. My husband and I loved your prime rib tacos and half price drinks in the summer....sitting at the bar or outside in the courtyard. I could overlook your multiple personality disorder, if only your food was good. The last 3 times I've been there, the food came out cold, was poor quality, and just didn't live up to what it used to be. 

Carefree Station, I believe you are hanging out with the wrong crowd. Your servers are not acting in your best interest. They are so SLOW (here, let me say it again....sssssllllllllloooooowwww), unfriendly, and overall seem unhappy to be there. Based on this alone, I will not come back. (Recommendation: don't sit on the rooftop deck if the bar isn't open.....you will never see a refill on your drink if the server has to go back down the stairs to get it...and if the server is 'kind' enough to do it for you, you will have to put up with his snarky attitude). This is a consistent theme.  These people are taking advantage of you and costing you money....

Carefree Station, I am very worried about you....I think you are in a bad place and if you don't pull it together, you may just go over the edge. I think you need to see your therapist, get back on your meds, integrate your personalities, and hang with a new crowd. If you do this, I will be able to be your friend again.....

Sincerely, 

Jennifer


P.S. (I gave you two stars simply for your ambience....)
