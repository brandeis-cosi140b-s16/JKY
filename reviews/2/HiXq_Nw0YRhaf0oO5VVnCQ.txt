I live right down the street from this place and have been there more times than I can count. At one point we were going about once a week. The food is just okay, but the margaritas and guacamole are very good. That's the main reason to go.
I've had two BIG problems with this place. First, they take reservations but don't honor them when you show up. We had a reservation, but when we showed up (on time), they simply put our name at  the bottom of the waiting list. And then told me that's how they do things. We left and didn't return for about 8 months.
Second problem came when I took my mom there for lunch. I ordered the taco plate, bit in and broke a tooth on the taco shell, which was NOT fresh. It was hard as a rock and yet gummy, like a stale shell had been steamed. First time I'd had a problem with freshness here, but it was an expensive problem. Anyway that was 4 months ago and I won't go back.
