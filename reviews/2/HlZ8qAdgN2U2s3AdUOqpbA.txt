I stopped in here because it was the only restaurant in the Delta terminal at the Phoenix airport that also had a bar. I started off with a bloody mary, which is my traditional drink either before or during a flight. They had a 'Hispanic twist' on theirs and I wasn't too big of a fan. Then, I ordered one of their regular classic margaritas. It was pretty good and much bigger than I expected. The food was all from the restaurant next door and was mostly tacos and burritos. I wasn't really in the mood for any of those, so I just ordered a side of chips with guacamole and salsa. They were pretty average - good enough to eat but nothing to write home about. If I am in that terminal again, I will probably eat at Wendy's and then get a drink at this bar.
