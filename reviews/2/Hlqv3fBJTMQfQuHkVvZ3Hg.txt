Went here for the soft opening with 5 others.  Had the guac (free, thanks to someone on the table joining the vida club or whatever before we came).  I agree with most everyone else that said that it was the best thing on the menu.  That should be sign enough to stay away, the best thing they make is something that isn't cooked and is put together table-side.  We also ordered the queso fundido as an app...it came out as pretty much a block of cheese that we had to cut into pieces and put on our flour tortillas.  The baking just made it into a globby mess.  I had the carnitas tacos which were flavorless.  I don't recall what everyone else had, but I do remember that all of us left disappointed.  Unfortunately it lived up to my expectations for an Epicentre restaurant.
