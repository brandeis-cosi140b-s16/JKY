This was my first time having dinner at Hacienda de Rosa's, I recently relocated to the Mesa area from the Bay area (Northern California).  My experience here was less than stellar.  It took about 30 minutes for our party of 7 to be seated, not a big deal.  When we were seated we were greeted fairly quickly by our server, who introduced himself and quickly filled our drink orders.  After a few minutes he returned and took our order, seemingly with no issues.  He returned several times to make sure he had a couple of people in our party's order correctly.  It appeared that he was having difficulty entering our orders into the point of sale system.  

The first time the food runner came out with our meals he had three of them, one was incorrect.  He left and returned with the correct one.  After a few minutes he returned with two more of our orders (that makes 5 of 7).  After a few more minutes he returned with one more order. ( 6 of 7)  The food runner asked me what I ordered, I told him and he went to the window and was there for several minutes.  He then took the order ticket to our server and they talked for several minutes.  The server then came to our table and confirmed what I had ordered, he then left and I continued to wait for 10 more minutes before our server came back with my fish tacos.

My fish tacos were lukewarm.  the cod fish taco was all cabbage and little cod.  The salmon taco was quite tasty, but wasn't hot.  The beans had a nice flavor, but again were cold.  The majority of our party commented that it wasn't the same as before, I learned that they had had a fire and had just recently reopened.  That might explain the general disorganization.  It was overall a very lackluster experience and I would be hard pressed to return again.
