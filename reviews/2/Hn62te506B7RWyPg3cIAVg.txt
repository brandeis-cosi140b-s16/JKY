Sorry, I wanted to like this place.  Very nice owner/server.

First this is a very tiny place.  Someone posted they ordered a marguerita and I cannot imagine this place ever having a liquor license.  Beverages were pretty much in the can or from the soda fountain only.  That was no big deal but we were hoping to go somewhere where you could have a few drinks.

Had Carne Asada tacos (just OK), Tripe tacos (better than the Carne Asada), Carnitas (probably the best choice) and Adobada (the worst).  We were there with no one else in the place.  Salsa is very good but chips are obviously from a bag (no surprise as this is a tiny low volume restaurant).  

We ate our tacos and left wishing we'd tried something else.  Again not bad food but after seeing all the hype here on Yelp, we were very much let down.
