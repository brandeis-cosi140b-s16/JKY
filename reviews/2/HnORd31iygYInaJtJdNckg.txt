After waiting in line for about 30 minutes (no big deal), and having about 6 groups of people pulled out of line because they knew someone working there (annoying), we finally got in and were met by some of the worst bartenders I've ever experienced. We waited patiently for someone, it was saturday night and the place was packed, and one of the girls actually stopped serving drinks and spent the next 5 minutes dancing with the other bartender, leaving no drinks coming out while about 10 of us waited. Couldn't get a jack and coke right, first one was all coke, 2nd was all jack, gave up on a third attempt and just had a beer. I will say the place was loud amd rockin', and that's why we went there. Excellent atmosphere, and a big crowd if thats what you're into, but we came to drink and that was a disappointment.
