The best thing about this experience was our server Greg. He was a tall
Older gentlemen with a surfer type accent. Very cool. Once we were seated no one came up to our table for a little while, I am not a complainer but when I have to bring up the wait time for anything to my husband you know it is not good. Thankfully, Greg noticed us and took us on as one of his tables. My husband ordered the shrimp and steak fajitas which were about 16 dollars and I ordered the shrimp ones which were close to the same price. It was pretty bland and your typical franchise tex-mex place. We usually go to Rio cafe by our house and we will be sticking to it because at least there the taste is authentic the portions are bigger and so are the shrimp. For the price we paid at on the border it was a rip off. We won't be back but if you are in the mood for an overpriced unauthentic Mexican style cuisine then go here and make sure to ask for Greg!
