Heading into hone depot and hungry.  I was lured into the taco bell drive thru after seeing signs on their window advertising the new chicken biscuit taco.  Sounded good. I try to order and chick in drive thru has no idea...she then tells me there is no such item. I leave drive thru thinking I must have been seeing things....but NO I wasnt....I see the sign again and this time I called.   Girl answers and says it's only served for breakfast.  Signs do NOT say that.  What a waste of my time.
