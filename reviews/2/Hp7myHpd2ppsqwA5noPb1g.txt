GOALLLLL My co worker and I lucked out, showing up right as mexico vs France world cup game started.

I was excited a good looking menu, many energized fans, large screen TVs and a large salsa bar.

The menu is in Spanish and the items are much more eclectic than your usual beef burritos and tacos. Out of my weak spanish skills I orderd the chillie rellno plate. $5.65 and a plate of chips.

The red salsa was great spicy and a hit of smokiness, the green avocado source was great too, and the chips were quite unique.

My chillies rellno while spicy, was a bit under cooked, and also seemed a bit grainy and unpleasant esp toward the top. This is why i a gave the 2 star rating.

I also saw some great fun being had by the soccer fans, I am not sure if this is a BYOB place but some one showed up with a 30 pack, hey its 11am and it's the world cup!

My coworker enjoyed his tacos however they were small and a bit pricey considering where we were.
