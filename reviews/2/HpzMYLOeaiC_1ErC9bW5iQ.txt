Mundo was close to the Smith Center, and had been recommended to us by friends. Very cool place, design-wise. The decor is impressive. The hostess sat us right away at a table for two, near the bar, which had a big TV running. It was a little confusing visually--is it a high-end dining establishment, or a tavern? Still, we were impressed overall by the decor.

Chips and salsa came right out. Salsa was basically fresh tomatoes, with some tang. It wasn't spicy whatsoever, and when I go out for Mexican (or even Latin inspired) food, I expect salsa served with chips to be at least a little spicy. Chips were just OK--keep in mind, we are Mexican/New Mexican/Latin food fanatics, so we are pretty critical, even of chips. That is your introduction to the meal, after all. The chips were sort of "chewy," not super crisp.

We ordered 2 margaritas, which took a VERY long time to arrive. They were freshly made, so we forgave the fact that they tasted a little "odd." They were good, and fresh, but did not have a familiar margarita flavor. Not very sweet at all, and VERY lemony. I ordered the Pollo Rosticado, and my wife the Carnitas. The food took again, a VERY long time to arrive. I am a chips and salsa freak, so even though I wasn't overwhelmed by the chips and salsa, I had eaten WAY too many chips by the time the food came out, which is rare for me. Both entrees were very good, and well prepared, which made up for the delay. I wish I could have finished mine actually, but again--too many chips.

Overall, we enjoyed our dinner, and had a nice time. We will probably try it again, the next time we go to the Smith Center. Would we go back, just to have dinner there? No. Why? The service was just below expectation for a pricey menu, and the location requires some planning for us.
