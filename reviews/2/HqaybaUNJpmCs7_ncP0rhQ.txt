Why is it so hard to deep fry your frozen rolled tacos to a crispy finish so I can enjoy a crunchy experience the whole way through? Only the ends seem to ever be crispy at any Valley taco shop. The middle remains a soft mushy mess of frustration time and time again. After I eat your lousy rolled tacos, I can never go back because if you can't accomplish that feat, then the rest of your food will likely fall in line. The six rolled taco combo was also kinda cheap-ass. They only put guac on the things, no sour cream, lettuce or anything. Let's also throw in the fact that you must pay for the hot carrots and your lack of a salsa bar is ignorant in 2013. Oh, yeah, the cheese quesadilla was the only redeeming item I purchased. After four green beers, usually most Mexican food tastes good, but this meal was a glaring exception.
