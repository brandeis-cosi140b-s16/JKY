I mean, it was okay. Why someone felt the need to fuse Hawaiian cuisine with Chipotle is beyond me. They offer their homemade sauces, (3 of which I tried separately) and they were primarily sugar. Like lots of sugar. Like, a hummingbird would reject because they're too sweet amount of sugar. I lived in Hawaii for years and I never experienced anything in the islands comparable to that syrupy, bottled papaya, factory fake, kinda sweet. But amazingly, once applied to the bland, room temperature rice, it improved the bowl of whatever I had. 

The girl behind the counter was super nice and helpful. Here's a tip though: if you're trying to upsell with guac, maybe try replacing the container with more than a spoon scrape amount. Your guests can see it, you know.
