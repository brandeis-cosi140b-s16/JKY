been here a few times es before.  My rule of thumb is give a place 3 chances before rating them.  I have eaten at many  filibertos in my life and generally they are good with huge burritos and don't usually skimp on the ingredients.  This one however skips on everything and charges $8.00 tax not included for a Carnes Ada burrito w cheeses and sour cream only.  They are tiny 1/2 the size in comparison to other filibertos that I have eaten at.  Today was the topper when I got another tiny Carnes asada burrito again.  It must be management being super cheap and rationing the burrito fillings here but three strikes and your out.  I will literally cross the street and get a bigger better tasting burrito next time.
