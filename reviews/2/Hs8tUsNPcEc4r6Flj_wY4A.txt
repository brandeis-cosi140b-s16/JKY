Meh. I was pretty enthused about this Mad Mex. Huge open area, valet parking, close to the house, plus the Big Azz Margaritas; I mean what's not to love? Well... first of all, that huge open space? Somehow no air gets in. It's so stagnate in there! Please, get some fans going or something. Second, I think the hostesses are still working out how to seat people. They shoved everyone in this long bench area while nice booths were sitting there empty.  Finally the food was seriously Meh. My shrimp were cooked to a rubbery car tire consistency. Now, the plus is that they have great drink and food specials, so I suggest eating past 11pm when food is 1/2 off and drinking past 10pm when Big Azz Margaritas are $7.
