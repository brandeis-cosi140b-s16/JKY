I have tried this place twice now and both times I left extremely disappointed. I keep hearing great things about it, but I just don't get why. 
The counter that you have to order from is so high I couldn't even see over it, so when they're standing there just looking at me waiting for me to tell them what ingredients I wanted, I didn't have a clue what the options were! I know I'm only 5'3", but come on, this is ridiculous, a lot of people are my height. 
The people making the bowl/wraps didn't even speak English well enough to answer the 97 questions that I had. So I eventually gave up asking. 
Then the sticker shock comes when my total is almost $15 for just me! 
To top it all off, I finally sit down to a sticky table and crumb filled seat, only to look at my order for the first time (now that it's not hiding behind what feels like a 9 foot prison wall) to find what can honestly be a bowl of 50% lettuce! Seriously? I went through this stress and paid an hourly wage for a bowl of lettuce with tiny drops of who-knows-what sprinkled throughout? 
Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me. Cafe Rio, I'm not allowing you a third strike...
Zabbas, here I come!
