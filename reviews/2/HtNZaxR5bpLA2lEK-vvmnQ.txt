I really wish I could give this nice little Mexican restaurant a great review, being close to my house and NOT a chain. However, the food is mostly average at best and the service is variable. The complementary chips and salsa (+ bean dip) is the best of the meal. We have enjoyed the quesadilla (adult style, with chicken) and fish tacos. If you like spicy food, this isn't your place.

Their plan for seating tables is difficult to understand - nights when the weather is beautiful, only one or two tables will be seated on the patio and you're told that they don't have servers to serve you out there. Meanwhile, they have both rooms inside filled to about half capacity? Huh? On other visits, they've indicated they are only seating the main room in front and will make you wait for a table, but they have a couple of tables seated in the back room? Again, huh?

The decor is very nice. Beautiful wall paintings throughout. Perhaps we'll go back in the fall/winter when there is a chance that they might seat us outside on a nice night. Then again, do we want to risk it?
