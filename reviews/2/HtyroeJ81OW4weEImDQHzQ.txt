I seriously have no idea why people eat here where there are 100 better alternatives for Mexican food in this town. We had a shredded chicken chimichanga, green corn tamale, and chicken enchilada. All 3 were bland and tasteless at best and all three were very greasy. If you think Taco Bell is great Mexican then this is your place, otherwise, steer clear, go home and pop open a can of processed tamales from Del Monte, you'll get a better meal.
