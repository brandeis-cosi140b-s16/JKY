Been going to pasquals for over 15 years and have watched the quality go down further every year.  The menu has shrunk considerably.  They have 5 ingredients that are rearranged to give the appearance of choice.  They have decided that they're making money of the margaritas and screw the food.  Last night had a chili verde which used to be hearty stew.  I was given literally a green salsa with chicken and beans added.  No broth just pepper
Juice it was inedible.
