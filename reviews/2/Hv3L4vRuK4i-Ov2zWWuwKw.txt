For a Mexican place, the salsa with chips was disappointing!  I walked in and I was excited to try a new place, but once it took forever to get my Margarita which tasted like cheap tequila and to add to the bad salsa I knew I was done.  I was starving and with no waiter around I couldn't even place my food order.  I paid for my margarita and went somewhere else to eat.
