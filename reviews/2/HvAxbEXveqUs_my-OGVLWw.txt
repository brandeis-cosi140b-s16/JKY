Oh, Ajo Al's.  You have deleted items off of your menu and try as I may I cannot find anything that i like in what remains.  Add to that an extremely lackluster server on our last visit and it will be a VERY long time before i return.  It's the small stuff like checking back in a timely fashion and not just saying "i'll SEE if i can get that taken off for you" since i clearly only had two or three bites.  and then as you're halfway to the kitchen remember to come back and ask me if there's anything else i want.  Don't drop the check before asking if we want dessert.  We did, but we went out for frozen yogurt instead since you had already dropped the check off.
