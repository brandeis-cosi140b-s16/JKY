Me and my boyfriend started coming here after class and wanted to do it regularly every week because of the friendly staff, delicious food, & large portions. It always seemed clean & the people who served us were always so kind. However, one experience had me thoroughly disgusted. It was an empty lobby and we grabbed our food to sit on the booth area which was unoccupied. After I finished eating, I looked to my left and next to me was a roach that just appeared (since it wasn't there when we sat down). So, obviously I felt nauseous because it's not a sight you want to see after you eat. We told the front cashier and his reaction surprised me. He simply said "Oh ok." As if roaches are a typical issue for this restaurant. And as we grabbed our stuff (while I felt like throwing up), he stood there waiting for us to move so he could get it. He didn't apologize or say it doesn't usually happen or that it wouldn't happen again. Good food, nice staff (usually), but never coming back again and warned everyone else I know.
