Awful service, just okay food.  Ordered fajitas which came with only 3 tortillas.  Asked for more.  When I got the bill I saw they charged  .70 cents for extra tortillas.  They said it was the Managers decision to charge for additional tortillas. I know .70 cents but it's the principal.  The guacamole that came with condiment plate for the fajitas was tasteless. Processed store bought slime,  Makes my stomach queasy just thinking about it.   The chicken rice bowl was decent.  Had to flag a waitress down every time we needed something and they were not short on help and were not busy.  Overall unfriendly service.  When we came in they were all gathered around the hostess desk chatting it up.  One actually sitting on the hostess stand. The people in the booth next to us arrived after us and got their food first.  They had 5 people and we had 2.  I hate to say this but they were Hispanic and knew one of the waitresses because she sat at their table for while and a fun time. Had lunch at Bonito Michoacan on S. Decatur today and the food was far more superior.  Employees were friendly and the service was spot on and they had a full house.
