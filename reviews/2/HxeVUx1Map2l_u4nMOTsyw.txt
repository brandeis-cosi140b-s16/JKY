I moved very near this restaurant about a year and a half ago.  The first time we tried it, we loved it enough to keep going back several times.  The food was delicious and original -- not what you get at a typical generic americanized mexican restaurant.  
The place has really gone down hill a lot in a short time.
The latest time we went will also probably be the last time we go.  The food simply stank.  Everything came with a pile of hard purple cabbage, which unlike the typical but useful pile of lettuce&tomatoes, was nothing more than garnish.  (this cabbage can be seen in just about all of the photos others have posted)  Dishes that had been consistently good over several visits were suddenly changed, and not for the better.  

My daughter's shrimp tostada thing was a portion size almost half of what it used to be, and if she's going to order something that costs more than what I order, It'd better be worth it, dammit!

I know Parrilla Suiza has long been considered agreat place, and not your typical mexican restaurant, but it just isn't the case anymore.  

I am curious if any other former long-time customers are recently feeling the same?
