I love authentic mexican so when this place opened I was tempted to try it! i was not impressed! i ordered chicken tacos. When I received my order it was a big plate of onions with some chicken pieces in it, I hate onions by the way. I tried to flag the waitress down but was too busy chatting with a coworker. We were never asked how anything was or if we needed anything so I never got to tell them I didn't like what I ordered. I ended up not eating it and our drinks never got refilled. I was not impressed! The tortillas were obviously premade from a bag because they broke as soon as you touched them! I will not be returning and the name is quite misleading! This by far is not authentic mexican food! I would not recommend.
