After reading the other reviews, my friend and I went to try this out wanting good Tex-Mex. I was surprised how mediocre it was. I had the enchiladas (my typical go-to dish at Tex-Mex restaurants) and just found them very ordinary. Even the margarita just wasn't that flavorful. After having some other Mexican that was outstanding places like Milagro Grill earlier in the week, this was not up to par.
