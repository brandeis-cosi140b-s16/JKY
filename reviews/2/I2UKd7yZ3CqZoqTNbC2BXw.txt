This place is pretty bad.  I met a friend here on Monday night at 5:30 for dinner.  The restaurant was pretty dead during this time frame and our dinners still took like 30 or so mins to come out for some reason.

I ordered the steak street tacos and they were really bad.  My tortillas all broke as I was eating my tacos - never had that happen before.  The steak was super fatty and gross and chewy - not a fan. The meal also came with sides of beans & Spanish rice. The rice had obviously been sitting out forever under a heat light and was so dried out and gross - I only had a bite. I didn't even attempt to eat the slop of beans.

It was pretty pricey for the quality of food I got - I didn't even ask for a box to bring the leftovers home to my husband who isn't picky at all since I didn't think he'd even want to eat this food.

This place is a huge miss - I wouldn't go back.
