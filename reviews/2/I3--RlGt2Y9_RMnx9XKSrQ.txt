Went to this location a couple of weeks ago for my husband's birthday. I was pretty disappointed this time around. Usually OTB is pretty good. The waitress was a bit of a pain. When she was getting our drink orders I had asked what drink choices do they have since I could not find any listing in the menu. She proceeded to again- in a much ruder tone- ask again what are we going to be ordering. After that whole thing, it took forever to get our food back even though there was hardly anyone in the resturant at the time. Then she didn't ask any of us if we needed any refills seeing that 6 out of 11 of us had ran out of our sodas ages ago. Probably won't be going back to this location for quite awhile...
