I been checking out places in the area trying to explore and decided to come here‼‼

BLAHHHHH‼‼‼

The food is so blah there is like no flavor taste like some stuff the microwaved it wasn't appealing at all  hard beans that come from a can and hard rice not very tasty... 

The only good thing was they made I call it "red beer" I can NEVER remember the name  

Other then that smh I probally wouldn't come back if I wanted microwaved food I would've stayed home
