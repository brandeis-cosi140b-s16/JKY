Have always loved this place, however recently went in for dinner and the service was not only bad but the attitudes are horrible!!! We were greeted by a short hostess by the name of Dora (?) ...didn't smile &seemed like her night was going bad or something but her attitude sucked! She was complaining to another worker that she didn't do something correct right in front of customers...very unprofessional &bossy. She sat us and my husband& i proceeded to order, eat &leave as usual...oh &we had to ask for a water refill numerous times. As we left not once did the chubby female manager(who also acted like her dog just died or something) NOR did the hostess smile and say goodnight...attitude is everything people &you're going to start losing customers if you don't begin enjoying, or at least pretend to enjoy your job.
