Had a party of 14 seniors, and came here the on recommendation  of several of them.  Service was worse than terrible.   Some of us got their order the rest of us got the wrong thing  and we all waited 1 to 2 hours for our correct order.  had to beg for drink refills and even for our check.  The food was good but not hot enough.  Will not be coming back
