Over priced and way over spiced. Burritos are huge as my forearm but almost empty of anything inside. The tortillas are as large as a sombrero and 2" thick on the ends. Lots of folded flour tortilla. They will actually stick 2 Chile Rellenos and a splash of pico in one of those huge  tortillas. Good thing we ordered a large drink as it took 2 refills to try and wash down our order. Service was slow, but friendly. They must have been crowed just before we got there as most of the tables need cleaning. To pricey ($7 for baurrito) and spicy for us,
