This kind of creepy chain with a very creepy statue that greets you has succeeded in taking all the Mexican and Mexicans out of "Mexican Food." 

While the balance of salt and fat on the large plate was pleasing to the tongue, it seemed pretty clear to me that nothing gets chopped or really prepared here, just reheated.

There was nothing wrong with the food, but I do not know why anyone would seek Abuelo's out. Maybe the pictures on the menu make people feel safe?

They are very generous with the chips and salsa. And the flaky light chips are especially addictive.
