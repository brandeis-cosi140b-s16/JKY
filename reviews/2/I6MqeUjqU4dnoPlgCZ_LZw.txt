I only came here once and refuse to go back. Upon first entering the restaurant I was a bit disappointed that Blue Moon wasn't an available beer option. Since being to other Chipotle restaurants in Vegas I'm guessing it's a Vegas thing, as they used to have Blue Moon at my usual Chipotle in CA. I opted for a different beer and ordered a steak burrito. The steak was so chewy and full of fat it was difficult to eat, let alone enjoy. My friends ordered shredded beef, which they said was good. It's possible that I showed up on an off-day or something but it was enough to turn me off from this location.
