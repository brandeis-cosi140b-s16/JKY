I usually go for margaritas and it's great.
Ate lunch there on Sunday afternoon, and I was VERY surprised. The food was lacking in flavor and spice...rice was soggy and I could taste the flour in the beans.  All the adults were done eating before they brought out the nachos my 4yr old niece ordered. I had bites from my sister's plate and hers was equally as bad. Overall, the food just wasn't good. Sorry Oaxaca.   They do get points for the tortillas and the margaritas.
