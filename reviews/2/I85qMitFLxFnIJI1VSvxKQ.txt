the place has changed , last night i ordered the fish bowl , margrita with a corona in it , when it arrived no corona , waitress said well um we just pour the corona in the margarita now , when i pressed her she said well the bar tender messed up and just poured the beer in , i ask if she thought that was ok , not much of a responce , i said just take it back , had chips and fundito , nice as allways , ordered 6 pack of tacos , a couple were what we ordered a couple not so much , mentioned it to waitress , not much of a responce , ive talked to the manager several times before when hes come by the table , nice guy , after the drink order mix up i had ask to have the manager come by , we were there about an hour and a half , never seen him , i like the place but there are alot of choices around
