If I want cheap, fast tacos, I get Taco Bell. If I want to sit down and enjoy chips and salsa, I go to Viva Mercados. This place is an awkward limbo that doesn't really seem relevant in my restaurant repertoire. I appreciate local joints that are trying to make a buck, but this place charged an arm and a leg for so-so tacos. 

I ordered their "special" of the day which was two crispy tacos, rice and beans, and a drink for $7.95. My boyfriend got the Carne Asada fries and our meal was $16.47 which seems fairly pricey for the food we actually got. The tacos were desperately missing a delicious salsa, the chicken was dry, the shell was over cooked and overly crunchy. 

It wouldn't have been bad if the total for the meal came in at under $10. It's not bad, but it certainly isn't deserving of my loyal patronage.
