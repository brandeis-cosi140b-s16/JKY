All I will say is the I liked the refried beans.  Really, you ask? Yes.  After two visits and trying a few different things Tijuana Flats is not worth the money and time.  My first visit I ordered a Taco Salad, which was decent.  The bottom of the taco shell was filled with stale rice and and topped with a pile of lettuce and tomatoes and maybe 10 pieces of chicken. The chicken was cooked well, but nothing great. As for the salsa bar, or hot sauce bar, UGH! All disgusting in my mind.  Tonight, craving Mexican after a long day at work I thought I would give them another try. I ordered the duo, a chicken burrito and a beef taco. A burrito is warm with sauce and cheese on top, right? No, this was a cold flour tortilla rolled up, basically a rolled taco. The beef taco was decent, but had so much lettuce and tomato it was hard to enjoy anything else.  And, the most disappointing point of both the burrito and the taco was that both had no meat filling.  I had a spoonful of beef and maybe less than 10 pieces of chicken.  With Bakersfield so close and Moe's down the street TF will not be my go to Mexican in the area. Sorry, I so wished more for them.
