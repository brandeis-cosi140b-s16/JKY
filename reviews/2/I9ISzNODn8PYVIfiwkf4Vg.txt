We always see this lil restaurant when we pay a visit over to CJ's next door but I only remember it from the days of the original owners of BeeGees :(

Anyway, we were craving some Mexican food so we decided to give them a try. When we walked in, there weren't very many customers so we were kind of weary at this point about continuing with our little adventure, but we proceeded on and ordered our food.

I ordered a plate that had 1 tamale and 1 chile relleno w/ beans and rice. I'm not asking to blow me out of the water, but the flavor on my entire plate was non-existent :(

Honestly, I'm no health inspector but I am pretty sure that the hot sauce containers have to completely be in ice, not just the bottom portion of it... AND there has to be the usual sneeze guards or at least covers not just random containers on a table in front of the bathroom?

Staff was uber nice but-- I'm sorry, not returning.
