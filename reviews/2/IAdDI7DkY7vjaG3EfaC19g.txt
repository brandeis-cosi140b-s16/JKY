Made me very sad.  For a while, I was really liking this place and looking forward to some excellent Mexican chow.

Last time I went there, I got good service, but not so good food.  The salsa tasted like tomato and onion. . .missing. . .something. . .a lot. . .

I literally could not eat the rice or the beans--they tasted awful.  The beef enchiladas were so one-dimensional in flavor that I couldn't even finish them.  My wife was similarly unimpressed.

I usually clean out a plate of Mexican food when I eat it--that's how it has been here in the past.  I just left food on the table this time.  Some time back, I got a punch card from here where you can get $5 off a meal after you order 9 entrees.  It's got three punches on it.  I didn't get a punch on my last visit because I don't foresee myself coming here again.  It's really too bad--I used to like this place.  What happened?
