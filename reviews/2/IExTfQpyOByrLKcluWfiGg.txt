I love Roberto's burritos! My fave is lengua and their shrimp burrito.

I order most of the time the lengua burrito with cheese and beans and with guacamole and sour cream on the side

What I just don't like is, it is so hard for the 2 different cashiers to  understand what I like. " Lengua burrito with beans and cheese". They always assume im ordering 2 burritos and always charging me different prices. They even charged for $15 for it. But I'm glad they stick with one cashier now who knows what I always order.

I find their store pretty busy too for drive tru. I wonder if they customers got their orders right all the time, since as for me, I always check my order and end up having them change it. And the guacamole on the side is always missing. I always have to go back and ask for it. Sad to say this is the closest one from home so I got no choice
