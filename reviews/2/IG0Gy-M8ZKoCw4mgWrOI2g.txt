Stopped in after seeing the Ad on the Glendale Star's web site. The offer of 1 dollar margarita's is False. We stopped in on Thursday and asked for the 1 dollar special margarita as posted on the ad, but were informed that is only on Monday's. I questioned the waitress about the Ad, but to no avail she said no. I question the Ad polices of the local paper for not checking if the customers Ad's are false. Never going back to a business that false advertises.
