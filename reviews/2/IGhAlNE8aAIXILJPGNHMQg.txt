Occasionally service is good. 90% of the time the employees are disinterested, rude, and untrained. 
Two things that really bother me:

- The employees are not trained well. How hard is it to teach your employees to drain the beans so I don't walk away with a soggy, falling apart burrito? Or that "light sour cream" means less than a full spoon.

-The restuarant can be empty with the parking lot completely full. 

Honestly, if you have the time, I suggest driving down to Baseline.
