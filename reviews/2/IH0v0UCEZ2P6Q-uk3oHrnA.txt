If you're looking for good Mexican food, keep looking.  This place served me some of the worst Chile Colorado that I've ever had, despite the server telling me it was "really good".  The chips are bad (light, cheap, flavorless), the salsa is over salted and generally no better than your average grocery brand.  The Chile. . .  I don't even have the words - too salty to eat - but even barring that it was beef chunks in a brown gravy (!) with a nice film forming on it.  The flavor was shallow, dull, thick and generally poor.  I took literally one bite, asked for the check, paid and left.

The rest of the experience was fine.  Cleanliness, service, etc are certainly within acceptable margins for a chain restaurant.  Some people are passionate about food.  These people are not.  If you are, you'd be much better served at a place like Casa Ramos which is about a block away.
