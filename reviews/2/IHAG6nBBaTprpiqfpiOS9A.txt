Here I was thinking for some bizarre reason that their carne asada would be better than morenos or mi casita in chandler and boy was I wrong.  I had come here for (street tacos) carne asada tacos hoping I would find another joyous Mexican place I would be fond of.  Their carne asada had a very weird texture or lack of I should say with very little flavor or crispiness in the slightest its almost like they boiled it and threw it on the stove and swished it around til it got hot but not crisp obviously.

If their carne asada was amazing id be in heaven with how ginormous the size of those things are. I wish someone would have warned me that they are no where near street taco size they are like street tacos on steroids.  I am in love with the usual street tacos because my stomach will only allow a max of 3 in my stomach at a time.  The pico de gallo has a lot of minced jalapenos so beware. My spicy tolerance is slowly diminishing where I can no longer handle extreme heat like that. I do happen to like their red sauce though  it is spicy enough for me to handle to dip my not as spicy food into to add the heat with each bite.  

Not much to really say besides I wasted a lot of money for two tacos. So overpriced and the longest wait known to man for 2 tacos. 30 minutes for 2 tacos is crazy.  I understand you are busy but 30 minutes really?

I doubt ill ever return to this establishment.
