Very disappointing experience.    Place was empty on a Saturday night at 8 pm.  Chips and salsas were very good.  Drinks were nothing special and the house margarita was quite sweet. Decor was dusty and dirty in the bar.  Our dinners were exceptionally salty on all fronts.  The grilled pork was inedible due to over salting.   The beef was well cooked but also very salty.    Disappointed and we will not be coming back here. The video games at the table are a distraction and should be done away with.  Our server was very nice and did a good job waiting on us.  This place is trying to be the Olive Garden of Mexican food and it shows.
