Usually I'm not dissatisfied with this place. But I ate here Saturday night and 2 large parties came in after us. We ordered our food Arroz Marinero and a carne asada quesadilla. The quesadilla lacked cheese it was pretty pathetic and tasteless. The Arroz Marinero was excellent like always. Our appetizer was queso fundido with chorizo it was cold and stringy. They servers spent most of their time catering to the large groups and after we got our food didn't return to the table to see how everything was or to see if we needed anything.  We had to go to the front cashier for our check.  I think its sad that they didn't treat all their tables with priority.  I will never return again.
