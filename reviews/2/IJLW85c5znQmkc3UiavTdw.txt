Dinner Tuesday, 5/14/13.  Service efficient, but not warm and friendly.  Maybe because we walked in at 8.30 pm?  The chips and salsa: chips tasted stale and store bought.  Salsa was okay, but seemed to get its heat from a generous helping of hot sauce rather than integration of chile peppers.  DH ordered chicken carnitas and was very happy with his meal.  I ordered Burrito Loco with carne asada.  90% rice with 8% beans and a small amount of tough, unseasoned strips of beef.  I didn't care for the tortilla it was rolled in----tasted flour-y and raw.  Green chile sauce undetectable.  Guacamole was good.  Ice tea was good and served with a generous wedge of lemon----waited refilled several times.  All in all, I found my meal pretty bland bordering on tasteless.  But it was filling and fast and as I said, DH was happy with his.  I probably won't insist on going back, though.  I know there is better Mexican out there.
