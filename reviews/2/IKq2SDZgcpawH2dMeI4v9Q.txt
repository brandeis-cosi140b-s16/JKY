This used to be our favorite spot but it has gone downhill tremendously. Myself and my sisters boyfriend both ordered the fish tacos that said they came with a few different sauces on them. What we received was a dry lump of fish sitting in a tortilla. When I asked why we didn't get any of the sauces that the menu claimed it came with, the waitresses response was "that's not on the menu.." Ummm excuse me? Ok then! Staff is not trained well, drinks are EXPENSIVE and food is low quality especially for the price. I now know why it's never packed anymore!
