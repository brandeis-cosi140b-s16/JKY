Food was bland and terrible. I give it 2 stars only because service was good and attentive.  I get it, it's airport food, but they are so bad even the worst airline wouldn't serve it on a plane.  I had the tequilla lime chicken tacos.  The chicken tasted like it came out of a can.  No hint of taquilla or lime. As a matter of fact, they couldn't be bothered with salt or pepper either, it was literally straight out of a can. The salsa was store bought so at least that has some flavor. The black beans and rice that came with the tacos were pretty bad too. The black beans were just heated up from a can, rice tasted like it was from a lipton packet. Really not worth your time or calories.
