Yes, this place was kind of lame.

The salsa was unmemorable, and that's a crying shame.

I got a spinch-y burrito of sorts, which was less than amazing... the spinach didn't taste particularly fresh... but at least the whole thing was drenched in cheese - a plus.

Considering the wealth of other Mexican restaurants in town, I doubt I'll return.
