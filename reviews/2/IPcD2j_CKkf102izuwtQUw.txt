Same staff and food as when it was Los Favs.  

This place is ok when your craving a quick fix or after a night drinking.  My biggest complaint is the food seems to always have to much salt.  Lately I'll only order a sausage breakfast burrito as the bacon burrito is like eating salt rocks. 

Staff is always super friendly and the place is clean. Although if you come during cleaning I suggest take out as the bleach smell can be overwhelming.
