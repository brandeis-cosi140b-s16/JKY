Honestly I really wanted to love this place. It's very kitschy and super bright inside!! The menu was on the small side but it seemed to have all the tex mex options represented. I would really love to get ONE good tex mex restaurant in the area but this one is not it. First of all they don't have a hot salsa option, not really. Their salsa was okay pretty standard fair, my roommate makes better at home.  I ordered a chicken burrito and I'm going to be honest their was like no chicken in my burrito it was mostly filler (beans). The pricing is pretty cheap considering where the restaurant is located so I guess you get what you pay for. I hear they have some kind of nacho buffet and some other things so I may give this place another shot once they've had a chance to be in business a little longer.
