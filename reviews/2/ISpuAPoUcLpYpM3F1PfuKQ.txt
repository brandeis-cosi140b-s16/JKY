I found this place on Yelp while looking for places to try on our mini-vacation up in Scottsdale this past weekend and this came up rated really well so we went. The place looks nice and has a great patio area (which was full so we had to sit inside). We ordered the Queso Fundido to start and it was good, I really like the flavor their beans have, but i would've liked more cheese because there was only a tiny blob in the middle. I ordered the chicken taco plate with a side of their House Rice. The chicken was dry and flavorless and the salsas weren't the best either. The guacamole was average, I've had better, I've had worse. The rice it was great but then as I started eating it, the cumin flavor overpowered everything else! My boyfriend ordered some sort of chicken torta which was "really good" I don't know because he wouldn't let me try it, but it looked very appealing. It came with a slaw salad and I did try that and wasn't impressed it was basically cut cucumber, radishes, and carrots in oil and pepper.Another thing is that they do have a lot of regulars (our server knew almost everyone's name) but in turn kind of ignored us Overall this place was OK but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there.
