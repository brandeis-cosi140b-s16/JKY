We went here on a recommendation from a family member. Other locations may be better but this location was not worth another visit. It's not terrible but certainly not good either. 

Specifically I had the enchiladas and they were very dry. There was very little cheese and saucy goodness. For a sit down place I definitely expected more. 

The service was good but couldn't make up for the food. I would much rather go to a place like tortilla fish instead next time.
