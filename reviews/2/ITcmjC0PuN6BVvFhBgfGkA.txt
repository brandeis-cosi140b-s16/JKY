My burrito was tasty enough, but a) I was over halfway through it before I got a bite of meat, and b) I ordered a carne asada burrito with guacamole, and not only was there no guacamole, but there was chicken instead of beef. Now, I'd be more forgiving about this if the place were busy, but I was literally the only customer in there. The only reason it gets two stars is because, well, it WAS a relatively good burrito.
