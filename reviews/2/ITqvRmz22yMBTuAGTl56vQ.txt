Had a 2 hour layover on our way to Myrtle Beach and decided to eat dinner here. We ordered the chips and salsa, (not complimentary, but 4.99) and we also had the chicken tortilla soup and chicken quesadillas. I ordered a margarita, which was awesome, so I ordered another, because we had time :) We received our bill and it was 51.00. I asked my husband what the heck did we eat? And I looked at the bill and was shocked to find each margarita was $15.00. Wow, that is a record margarita price...most expensive I have ever seen. Food was ok, service not so much.
