Came here last night with a restaraunt.com coupon.  Sat outside and the patio was nice and our waitress was great, now lets talk about the food,  the menu has changed alot since we were here and not  for the better,  we ordered the guacamole $6.99 for a very small portion of flavorless guac we had to add so much salt just to get any flavor out of it, we ordered the chicken fajitas and it had about six  strips of very dry chicken on a bed of greasy onions and that's it, veggie fajitas were onions and peppers a few mushrooms and a couple pieces of zucchini, everything was so overcooked and caramelized it was just a greasy mess. The rice tasted exactly like rice a roni and the beans tasted soured.  Never again so glad we had the big coupon and didn't pay full price for that crap.
