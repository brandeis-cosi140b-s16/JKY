One star for cleanliness and another for quick service. 

The restaurant felt fake, trying too hard to be a Mexican restaurant with pop Spanish music. Please people, Mariachi is the music of authenticity. Uninspiring food that felt like I could do better at home. The salsa especially was so bland and tasteless. 

I have to give it a thumbs down. Never will go back.  If you get my husband to say he experiences more joy eating from chipotle bowl than eating here then you don't earn the title Mexican restaurant.
