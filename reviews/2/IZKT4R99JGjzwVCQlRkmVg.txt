We've been going to Valle Luna on and off for years.  

The last time that we ate there, we were less than pleased.  The food was bland, the sauces all tasted the same.  I ordered tamales, my favorite, they were as hard as rocks, so dense and heavy and unpleasant.  The rice was blah.

My daughter decided that rather than order from the kids meal, she would order a 1/2 price happy hour appetizer.  The happy hour menu was standing up in the middle of the table for all to see.  When we tried to order off the appetizer menu, we were told that those items could only be ordered in the bar and that the server was unable to accomodate us.  I decided to go into the bar and order the appetizer to bring back to our table.  On the upside, the bartender was very helpful and said that it was fine, nothing worng with bringing it back to our table and then offered to bring it to us when it was done!  So helpful!   We were very  disappointed that the server was so unwilling to help us solve the problem.  

We went home with tons of leftovers because none of us thought the food was any good.  Don't know why we took it home, it just ended up in the trash. 

I guess we'll continue our quest to find the best Mexican food restaurant!
