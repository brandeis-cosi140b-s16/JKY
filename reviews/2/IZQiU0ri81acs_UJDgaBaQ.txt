Usually don't review fast food but just had to after a not so great Taco Bell experience. Usually I love Taco Bell and rarely have any problems. This one however, was a problem. My food was kind of cold. Very unusual from Taco Bell (for me at least) because usually its piping hot. I got the new Mini Quesadilla and the cheese was not fully melted and both my chicken burritos were warm at best.
They get a sympathy star added because the girl working the drive thru was very friendly.
