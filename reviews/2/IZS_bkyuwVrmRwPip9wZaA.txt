Let me preface this review by telling you, I'm the biggest Chipotle fan there is.  I visit them whenever and wherever I can.  I love it so much that I've been a long-time (small) shareholder of CMG stock.  So it pains me to say that I'm not sure what the deal is with this Chipotle, but the staff here just seems a bit off compared to other locations.

First, nearly every other CMG I've been to around the country takes great pride in cleanliness.  On my last few visits to this one I've had to wipe my own table clean on more than one occasion.  

Second, they just do not seem well-trained.  My wife made the mistake of ordering a margarita one night and the guy working had to scrounge around for the materials and even ask a co-worker how to make the drink.  Another example, yesterday, my son ordered a cheese quesadilla and the crew basically forgot about it and what resulted was an overcooked crunchy slab of goo.  

Lastly, their speed lacks a sense of urgency you find at the other stores.  Again, on yesterday's visit, the guy working who was our first point of contact..you know the guy that grabs the tortillas or bowls based on your order?  Well, he had to change out the bean containers with fresh beans.  This process caused a huge bottleneck because none of his co-workers down the line from him felt the need to jump in and help him either with the beans or with getting us started.  What was a relatively short line of maybe 6 people quickly grew to one reaching the door for no good reason.  


I would hope Mr. Ells makes a visit to check-in on this location and somehow rights the ship.  Until I hear different, I'll stay away from this store and go to the one at Power/Ray or Val Vista/Baseline.
