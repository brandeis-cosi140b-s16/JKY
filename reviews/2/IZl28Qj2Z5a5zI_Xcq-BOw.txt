I'm guessing from the crowd on a Friday evening that some people like the food, but we didn't. Over priced and not nearly as tasty as the menu descriptions would lead you to believe. 
Everyone was nice, the long line to order went quickly. The meals we ordered just weren't satisfying. My daughter couldn't even finish her quesadilla. We tried it, won't be back.
