Ive been here on multiple occasions and I have never been fully satisfied. The wait staff is poor. On one visit, two other couples had been seated and received their drinks before we even saw our waitress. Another time, we were the only ones in the restaurant and still waited 10 minutes before we saw our waitress to ask for the check. 

The food: It comes out fast which is kind of scary. It makes me think that they are just popping in the microwave. I watch a lot of kitchen nightmares :-p

The chips and dip served when you arrive is more filling than the food to be honest. 

I liked the margaritas...Good pricing!

Finally the best part: The chocolate mini chimis.
