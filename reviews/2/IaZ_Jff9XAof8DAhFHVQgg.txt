Before I get started, I'll admit right out of the gate that Zapata's deserves a 2 1/2 star rating.  But since that isn't available I'll round down.  My review has a lot to do with my past experience and how far I believe they've fallen off.

I lived in Ballantyne for about five years, but moved closer to center city about six years ago.  While I lived in south Charlotte, this was one of my favorite places to frequent.  Huge plates, tons of fresh veggies, everything cooked great.

Well, after visiting this past weekend - boy things have really fallen off.  To be completely fair it is relatively on a par with most other Mexican restaurants.  But I don't pay $18 for a plate at any other Mexican place, and if I did I would want it to be better than Zapata's turned out.  I opted for the steak, shrimp and veggies (okay, I admit that isn't a typical meal at a Mexican restaurant).  Steak was waaay overcooked, as were the shrimp.  The veggies were good, just not as many as I had come to expect.  All in all the meal was just "eh".

A big point of frustration for my fiance came when she ordered drinks for our group: two girls and two guys.  When the drinks were brought to us, there were two large glasses (given to the guys) and two small glasses(given to girls).  The bar had ran out of clean dishes and - instead of washing a couple of cups - just made two sizes and charged her regular price for all.  In fairness they did make it right, but who wants to have to go complain about something like that.

All in all, Zapata's is not a terrible restaurant, but for the price I can eat a lot better.  I doubt I'll be back.
