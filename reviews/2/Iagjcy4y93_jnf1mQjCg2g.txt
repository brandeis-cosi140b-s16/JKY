Not what I remembered.

When I was in college on the east coast, it was all about Moes, and Chipotle was just the new kid on the block with the weird corn in their salsa. Plus, Chipotle didn't even give you free chips with your burrito!

Well, Moes has really gone downhill since I used to eat there. Not even their paint-like white cheese sauce can save the smallish burritos, stale chips and congealing ingredients. 

The problem, I've realized, is traffic. When I was in college, every Moes had a line out the door. It was IMPOSSIBLE to not to get everything fresh. They had a staff of 12 working on the line. A whole employee solely dedicated to churning out chips. It was perfect. 

The Moes over here in Vegas have ingredients sitting for hours and if you are lucky, maybe three people at the most behind the counter.
