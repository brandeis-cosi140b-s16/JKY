It was my first time ever eating at this restaurant and I will never go back again. I had the Nana's Breakfast and there was something very strange about the over easy eggs. The yolks were very pungent and were way to thick for my liking, almost gummy. I could only eat half of one and moved the rest onto a small side plate. I am not a finicky eater at all but I just could not finish it. Then I moved on to the red chili. I could not eat this stuff. I was soo spicy hot, It was inedible. I did however eat the hash browns which was difficult because the egg was starting make a reappearance via a burpy aftertaste. 

So now I will forever respectfully refer to this place as La Ca-Nasty!
