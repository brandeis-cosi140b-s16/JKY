First time to try. Ordered mexican taco platter. The menu says I get to choose 2 but they allowed me 3 options, so I tried chicken, steak and carnitas. I took my food to go but was back at work within 10 min. The food cooled down really quickly but I don't think that was the cause of flavor loss. The food was pretty bland unfortunately even the pico de gallo. I couldn't even taste the cilantro or onions! And No I don't smoke! Maybe more seasoning or salt is needed. Thankfully lime slices were provided. I even added lime to the beans to perk them up. Portions were good. So was the guac. The server was very kind and able to answer my easy question on an allergy I have. I don't think my other allergy requiring a more complex question would have been understood as well thou.

Probably wouldn't go again but maybe worth a try of something else.
