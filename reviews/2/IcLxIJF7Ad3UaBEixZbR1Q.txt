Dry, dry, dry is the only thing I can say about this place.

I went with a few friends who loved their meals, but I wasn't entirely thrilled with mine. I had a steak quesadilla which was incredibly bland. The soft shell as somewhat pita-like and warm, which was nice, but when everything is so dry--it lacks in taste.

The only reason this place gets a second star is because the service was good; our waitress generally cared and helped me out because I have a food allergy to onions. Very, very sweet waitress! I'd come back for the service and maybe to try it again, but for now, I'm not entirely keen on it.
