Bummed!  I normally love chipotle but today when I tried to order online, no carnitas was available.  So I called and they said to just write in the comments that you want carnitas, asked if I could order on the phone and they said Yes, hold on and never came back!  So ordered online following the instructions that were given to me and get back to my office and I have no Carnitas!  ARGH!!
