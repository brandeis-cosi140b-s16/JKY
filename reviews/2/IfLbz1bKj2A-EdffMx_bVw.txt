We went there for the first time tonight, the food was just okay, nothing great and WAY overpriced for the type of restaurant it is.  We went because of the reviews but now I am thinking they were all written by staff and family.  Don't get me wrong, the food wasn't horrible it just was about twice the price as I would expect to pay for what it was.  The guacamole was very good, homemade and yummy.  The service was slow and I wasn't sure why, there were at least 3 ladies serving at it wasn't very busy.  We waited about 15 minutes for our check.  I doubt we will go back, there are better Mexican restaurants that cost less.
