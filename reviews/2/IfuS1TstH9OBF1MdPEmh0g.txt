I asked server for best burrito they have. She told me it was there Carnitas Suer Mex Green Chili Burrito, so that's what I ordered. The size way impressive, almost a meal for two. If that was the best burrito on the menu I would hate to have the other ones. There was a good amount of pork in burrito but was very plain. fished about half of the burrito then figured I would just finish the meat. opened up the burrito but it was all gone, good thing i didn't start with the other half. Probably won't go there again. Salsa and chips are to be expected but having a no taste and no heat salsa as your only option was disappointing as well. Person who was with me said the Shrimp Tacos were great. so if I do go back maybe I will give them a try.
