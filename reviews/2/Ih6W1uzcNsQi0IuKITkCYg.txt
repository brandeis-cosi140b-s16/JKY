Food:
The food is average at best and over priced at regular prices. I don't know who this famous Sandoval guy is but he must not think very highly of himself for serving store bought chips. Even low end Mexican restaurants have fresh chips. The salsa, both medium and hot were boring.. "Celebrity chef" Sandoval needs to take notes from the salsa offering at the taco bar in Mariana's grocery store park lot.
The rotisserie chicken has good flavor but was dried out. The rice was decent. Black beans have no flavor. Very bland mashed up  black beans. I mixed the salsa in to add some flavor but the salsa needed help itself.
The crispy chicken Milanese torta was average. Light corn breading on a thin piece of chicken breast. 

Service:
Counter service. You order get a receipt bit how do you know when your food is ready. I went and sat down. They took my name but never called my name. I sat and sat and sat.... Eventually I got up to ask where my food was and it was just sitting on the counter.
