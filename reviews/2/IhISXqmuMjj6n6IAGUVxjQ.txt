May be I went on a bad day for the kitchen, but the dishes I had was well below the average touristy level.

- the salsa that came with the chips tasted generic and canned
- the menudo was a quarter chunk of a potato, half of a carrot cut in two and some blobs of flavorless beef
- the mexican pizza was soggy and chewy (no, not in a good way)
- the green corn tamale covered in chilli sauce is the only thing that made me think the kitchen can be better

La Fonda Del Sol is a place that I pass by a lot.  But it looks like I'll have to keep on passing on by.
