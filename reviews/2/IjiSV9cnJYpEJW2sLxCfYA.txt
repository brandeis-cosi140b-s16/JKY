If you are looking for a nice, casual place for drinks and app's, this would probably work well. As a restaurant, it does not work.
The food was flavorless and bland. The tuna ceviche may have been the worst I have ever eaten.  The only thing you could taste in the fish tacos was the corn tortilla. No spices, no cilantro, no spice, no flavor.
The music was just loud enough where you could not really have a decent conversation if you were sitting inside.
Overall, drinks on the patio would be the only reason I would go back.
