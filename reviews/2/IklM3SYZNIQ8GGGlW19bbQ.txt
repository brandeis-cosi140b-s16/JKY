We like the food here and actually go out of our way for the queso, which is why I think they should at least be accurate about the hours they say they are open on Yelp, Google, and their own website. At least update it if it's not consistent with the hours you are ACTUALLY going to be open. One star docked for every hour they said they'd be open tonight and were not. Thanks for the wasted trip.
