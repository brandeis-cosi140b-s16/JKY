What a difference a year can make. I honestly created a Yelp account to rave about this place. It used to be amazing. However, the second location opened pretty recently, and it was a extremely disappointing the last time I had it.

Being a frequent customer for the past year or so, I did not hesitate to buy $40 worth of food for the family. I always tell my friends about this place. Unfortunately, something happened here recently (maybe a new chef), and the quality decreased significantly. Here's the meal we had:

Fusion Burrito: Soggy. Extremely soggy. It tasted like somebody drenched the greens inside with water and removed any semblance of rice and meat. I could barely eat half of it. This used to be a favorite of mine!

Fusion Quesadilla (with spicy pork): Also disgusting! I don't know how you mess up spicy pork and cheese. I got this for my little niece, and she barely had two bites. I thought something was wrong with her, so I tried it too. Straight to the trash... How can a quesadilla have a weird aftertaste?

Shrimp Taco: The shrimp was definitely old. The aged seafood smell spread strongly throughout the house.

We had a few more things, and they were adequate I guess. The aforementioned items were the worst.

I'm so, so disappointed. I'm tempted to leave one star, but I put two out of respect for what the restaurant once was. Maybe I caught them on a bad day, but what I received was inexcusable.
