First impressions, only been to this place once: The place was packed on a Saturday night around 8pm, but it's also a fairly large space so we were able to find a seat. I ordered the 3 taco combo plate with rice & beans, along with a fountain drink--price came to just over $9. My friend ordered essentially the same but with chips, his order came to $11. This place feels like a fast food place to me, not a restaurant. $11 bucks is too much for fast food IMO. For me, prices get a  thumbs down. 
There was a large group of people near the register waiting for their orders, we found a seat & waited too. No kidding we waited for about 40 min for 6 tiny tacos, chips, beans & rice. We had a gig at Cactus Jacks, which shares the same strip mall so we actually were trying to kill time but under normal circumstances--I would have asked to be refunded. A few people complained about why things were taking so long. I don't know if that is typical service, but I'm gonna have to give it a thumbs down. 

The food was actually pretty good, but Not worth a 20 min drive for me. If I happened to be around that area, I might stop in & try a few more menu items. Maybe.
