Been here a few times now...cant say I am impressed.
Couple of reason's why...
1. Staff members sometimes don't speak very good English...if your going to put someone on drive thru, please have them know how to speak English. 
2. The fresco menu isn't available till 11am...WTF? Why?
3. The parking lot and interior is always pretty dirty, dirty tables inside. 
4. The food always seems smashed, like its smashed or is leaking out something, cheese, sauce etc.
5. they forget items, screw up the order.
6. All items aren't listed on the drive thru menu. 

This place is close to my work and a healthier option then BK and MCd's down the street. But this place needs work...same shit every time I go here.
