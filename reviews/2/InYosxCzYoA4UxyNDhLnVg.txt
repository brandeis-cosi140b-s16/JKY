I've tried Pink Taco at other locations and this one was by far the worst.  I usually enjoy Pink Taco but ugh... definitely not here. Slowwwwwwwwww service, they kept confusing our orders, and it took us 5 times of asking to finally get our waters/drinks. The food is okay and the ambiance is super cute... but shit if you have a set schedule, go somewhere else. Or if you're super starving and grumpy and not in the mood to be patient... go somewhere else.
