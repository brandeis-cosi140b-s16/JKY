Chips and salsa were good. My boyfriend liked his enchiladas. However I ordered the seafood quesadilla and was disappointed to find it full of nothing but imitation crab. There were several shrimp and scallop options on the menu so I expected some of that in there but got nothing but bland fake crab. Very misleading. The cheese was also barely melted, the tortilla was flabby and the dish itself was overpriced. It's like they were up charging for seafood that wasn't actually on the dish.
