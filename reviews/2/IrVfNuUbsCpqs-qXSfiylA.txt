I hate to be the only one to swim against the dominant paradigm, but this place left me wanting.  Went last week and the service is absolutely phenomenal!  The food, however, is just above Taco Bell.  I ordered a Chimichanga.  It came out without any sauce or cheese on the top and looked and tasted like it had been in a grilled sandwich press.  Also, more tortilla than filling.  Only one type of beans are available - refried, instead of ranch style or something better.  They serve no alcohol whatsoever, so I could not even have a beer with my dinner.  I ordered iced tea and it was clearer and weaker than the water I was also served.  The one chink in the service is that I was never asked if I wanted a refill on my tea.  Sorry, folks, but raise your game.
