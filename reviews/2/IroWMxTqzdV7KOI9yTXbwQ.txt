Being a foodie transplant from California I obviously gravitated toward the FOX Restaurant Concepts group of restaurants.  I love the modern decor, innovative menus, and overall aesthetic qualities of their restaurants.

I unfortunately have to say that of the FOX Restaurants, Blanco is one of my least favorites.  I have to admit that their margaritas are amazing but I have been three times now and have always been disappointed in their salads and entrees.  I may be a little picky and love good Mexican food but I find that my food tends to be bland and definitely leaves something to be desired.

My friends and I now only go to Blanco for drinks after work and then decide on a different location for dinner.  If this is your plan then I definitely recommend heading over for some of the best margaritas in the valley.
