Dear restaurant owner, you may not want to only cater to only one type of clientele. You are in a PRiMe location with 5 bars within a mile radius. What do people love to eat after a night of drinking..??..?.?.. Mexican food!! Make sure EVERYONE can read the menu, put some flavor in your food and stay open later on the weekends. With these tips, you will do great. Without....I don't see this place staying open through the end of the year. 2 stars since the staff was friendly and the place was clean.
