We were very disappointed. Although seated immediately per our reservation, it took too long to get drinks. The restaurant is so dark they offer flash lights to help read the menu and when your food arrives you can't see it. That is part of the experience. 

They also seat you on top of each other.  Our table was eighteen inches from the table next to us on both sides and our table was broken and wobbled.,they fixed it promptly but it was awkward. 

The food was ok...not great . La hacienda at the fairmont is far better.
