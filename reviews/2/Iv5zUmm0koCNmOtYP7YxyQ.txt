I can't really explain the joy I felt when I first heard that a Mad Mex was opening on Highland. The thought of not having to sojourn to the suburbs and to never again return to Oakland was almost too much.

Last night, after months of drive-by stalking, it was time for us to meet. I was so excited for the complimentary valet parking I'd seen advertised on the sign outside. But when we got there, the sign was gone, there was no valet parking; it was as if I'd imagined it.

My boyfriend and I ordered chips and avocado tomatillo salsa (our fave) and a burrito each. I ordered a side of sauce with my burrito which arrived not on the side but inside the burrito. Refills were hard to come by. The chips and salsa did not arrive until we had finished our meals, and the salsa was sour and terrible and not even close to the avocado tomatiilo salsa we know and love. And I'm going to sound super old when I say this but IT WAS SO LOUD IN THERE.

The prices are higher, probably because of the complimentary valet, the hip location, and because this is, for serious, the handsomest Mad Mex ever. It would have been worth it had the food been of typical quality and the service remotely adequate. But alas, I'll be driving back out to the suburbs for Mad Mex because there, at least, they love me back.

*Because this review isn't long enough already, I'd like to take this opportunity to remind all restaurant goers out there to please keep your shoes on. Other people exist and are trying to eat.*
