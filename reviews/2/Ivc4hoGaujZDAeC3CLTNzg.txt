I came for the great Diablo Wings of old and got wings drenched in Texas Pete (new recipe) instead.  The manager came out and brought me a new order which was supposed to then have the Diablo sauce on them. Yet, he comes back with extra Texas Pete drenched on my wings. The server then asked if I was happy with the wings but of course I was not. My daughter loves Mexican food while I'm not a huge fan. But once again, I loved their Diablo wings. Welp, if you want wings drenched in Texas Pete hot sauce then this place is for you. 

P.S
My family really loves this place. My family gives it 3 stars. Food is not terrible but not something that they're dying to get back to.
