Yelp has paved the way for businesses to receive honest, constructive criticism that they otherwise never would have received, so it amazes me how businesses don't use negative Yelp reviews to their advantage. 

This Chipotle obviously doesn't give a s*** because they've never changed. My visits to this location are far and in between as the employees have a profoundly SOUR & UNWELCOMING attitude. Rice is almost always uncooked. Chipotle on Thomas is ALWAYS A LAST RESORT, I need food like now and don't want to wait kind of situation. Bleh.
