Apparently they have now discontinued the jalapeno rings and now have jalapeno poppers - which are not stuffed peppers. They are cheddar-cheesy stuffing with chopped up peppers in them. Not bad...but not the rings. Bring back the rings!

But they still have Inferno sauce...and the occasional shrimp tacos are good.
