Disappointing... The food was mediocre at best. The chips served were warm and glistened of oil. Three types of salsa were very good. I ordered beef tacos and rice. I had the option of ordering shredded beef for $1.25 more, but I was cheap and went with the ground beef. Big mistake... The grease actually dripped from the tacos. We ordered a small cheese crisp  which was not fully cooked. The green chili burro was ordinary. The re-fried beans and rice were very tasty. The atmosphere is vintage and seemed like it needed a good cleaning. I didn't check the restrooms.
