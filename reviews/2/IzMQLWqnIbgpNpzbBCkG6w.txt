It's OKAY. I don't go here regularly actually I only come here for lunch break at work. It's not too bad but not authentic. Their pollo fundido chimichanga is good rice and beans not so good. The service is not so great the food is better than the service. If I had a choice between here and else where is see what the other choice is first lol.
