I am what you would consider a mexican food snob. Small, hole in the wall type places are what i live for. 

I had the mini chimis (5) with beans and rice... Cost me $10 which is a little steep for me especially given the quality of food. 

The chimis had cream cheese and beef in them. More cream cheese than beef. They were sweet. Almost tasted like they were made with a flaky pastry dough or something. The rice was nothing special but their refried beans were delicious. I wish i would have had the option to get chicken ones. 

Their salsa bar salsas were nothing special to me, flavorless.  Their avocado + salsa verde one was pretty unique and delicious though. 

The restraunt was super clean and a little over the top friendly. Im from the south and enjoy being greeted with a smile, but 4 different times while i am trying to eat? Overkill. 

They have a fried ice cream milkshake that i would love to try! I might go back to try that, but that's about it. This place definitely isn't Carolina's/los dos melinos status.
