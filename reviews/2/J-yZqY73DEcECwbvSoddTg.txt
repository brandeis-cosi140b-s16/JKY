Hummmm, we took a drive from the Silverado area, to go there, because of our Groupon that we got. Well, it was OK, not worth driving over there again for. If your in the area, and don't want to spend alot of money, this might be the place for you. 
It's not like taco bell, so just something different. 
Yes we noticed it was geared towards teens and young adults. Not that that bothered me. 
I got the Enchiladas, and the fish taco, baja style, it was OK, my husband got the Carna Estada Tacos, he said it was OK. 
They said they make there own Salsa everyday, the chips actually tasted better without the salsa. 
I just say, don't go out of your way to go here, if your in the area......Then check it out for yourself.
