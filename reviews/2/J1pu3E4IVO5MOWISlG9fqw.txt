Went in to check out Happy Hour as well as the new digs.  Small bar and restaurant.  Give it 2 because a happy hour margarita was $5.50.. I would think a batch margarita out of a coke keg would be less.  The margarita itself was terrible.  Tasted like the bottom of a sour mix, not refreshing at all. Bartender salted the rim like a Chicago driveway in a deep freeze, yuck.  The beer price for happy hour was $4 which is a much better option than the margarita.  Still for happy hour the prices were high.  Location is also a tough spot. The bartender was nice and social, doubt I'd give this place another shot.
