Food was great like always but the the people who work they're don't seem to care about the customers they help at all.  The looked clueless and completely un-energetic. Maybe they just don't want to be at work but it translates to poor customer service.  The location is nice and the inside was done well like most Chipotles but the lack of interest by the workers just made the whole experience forgetful.  I think the next time I'm hungry I'll pass on this place.
