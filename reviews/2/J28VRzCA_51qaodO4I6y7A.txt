Our friend brought us some Filibertos because it was 3a and we were hungry. It was okay. The tortilas were a bit stale and dry on the burritos. The guac isn't good. It has value going for it though; the portions are cheap and gigantic, especially the carne asada fries. They seemed like a giant plate of frozen fries that a few carne asada tacos were emptied out over. And since it was 3a, even not-great Mexican food was greatly appreciated.
