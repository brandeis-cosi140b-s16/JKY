The place is small and dark , I like to see what I'm eating . The green tamale were OK but the sauce was blah. The beans were cold , but salsa was ok not great but ok.We never got the same server  twice. One of the server look like she hated her job she never smile. It would have been nice to felt welcome not like a bother.
