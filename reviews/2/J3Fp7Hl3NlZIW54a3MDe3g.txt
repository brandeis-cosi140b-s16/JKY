I had planned to get a barbacoa bowl with pinto beans. What I ended up with was mostly black beans because they were out of pinto beans and some very fatty barbacoa. Not their best work. On top of that, every time someone went in or out, the door got stuck wide open and the cold air would blow into the already chilly dining room. A few of us got up to close the door several times. We saw a Chipotle employee walk by the open door more than once and didn't bother to close it. And these people want $15/hr.
