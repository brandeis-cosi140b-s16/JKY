I went to The Twins quite a lot in my college hayday, with most of the time being a very late night affair.  My friends seemed to be enamored by it, but I personally sort of despised it when my drunken buddies dragged me there.  To understand my displeasure, i'll refer to my "Mexican restaurant checklist":

Free chips/salsa? - Nope.
Margaritas? - Nope, but I believe they do serve some alcohol, but I was never personally interested in it, because whenever I came here I would be coming back into sobriety
Big Burritos? - Check, but i'll elaborate on this further below.
Family run establishment? - I'm not sure, but i'm inclined to say nope.
Cheap? - Check, but you pay for what you get.
Open late? - Check.

They're missing quite a few ticks compared to other nearby restaurants, such as Francisco's Cantina.  Beyond all of this, I have one complaint that makes me dread going to Los Gemelos:  Almost all of their food sucks.  Note that half of the time i've been here, i've come after several drinks, and i'm still able to say that.  It's quite an achievement if your food doesn't hit the drunk spot.  The only exception i've found to this is the vegetarian nachos, and i'm personally not in the market for restaurant nachos, as I make danker ones at home.  Their burritos are bland, their quesadillas are more like gigantic fried cheese curds, and the ingredients in their salads are of low quality.

I'm giving this a 2 mainly because I reserve my 1's for places that are true hellspawns, but this one is close.  It doesn't help that their service is very meh, and that there's better places nearby for late night Mexican food (See:  Francisco's, Taco Shop).  Here's hoping I can convince my drunk friends to go to those places instead!
