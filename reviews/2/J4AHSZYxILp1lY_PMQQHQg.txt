This place is pricey and while the food is delicious, it comes in very small portions. 
I know it's Vegas but c'mon now!
I got 3 tacos for $6, i got 2 al pastor and 1 chicken the al pastor was okay, not bad but just very average, and the chicken was dry and not flavorful at all. 
Will come back to try the bistec tacos because i see those are a Yelper's favorite.
