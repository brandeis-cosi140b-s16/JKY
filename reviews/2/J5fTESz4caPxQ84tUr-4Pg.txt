Don't bother with dollar margarita Tuesdays. They're so syrupy it's impossible to drink an entire glass. I recommend splurging an extra two bucks and going over to Madison's where they serve a delicious, fresh $3 margarita on Tuesdays. 

I also was not very impressed by the tacos. I don't get why there are such mediocre restaurants in such a prime location in Madison!
