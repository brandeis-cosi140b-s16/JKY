I went to this place because of the reviews. Maybe my expectations were too high. My usual standard that I judge a Mexican restaurant by are its chips/salsa and a beef burrito. I have to say the chips were some of the worse chips I have ever had. They were extremely dry and seemed old. The salsa was more of a pico and again very dry. Mostly chopped tomato and onion. The burrito could not have been more disappointing. The tortilla again seemed old and dry (sorry about the theme here...but dry was the theme of the night) and while I ordered the burrito wet, not only did they not put enough sauce on it, the flavor was mediocre. The beef was actually pretty good, but again...a little dry.
