This place is only considered good because of how bad it is for you. I wouldn't eat here due to the fact that all their restaurants use lard for EVERYTHING. It was all extremely greasy and on occasion, the food I would get would be overdone and too salty. Its a very cheap place, and the food/experience is reflected by that. Every time we eat here we run to the toilet. I've had much better mexican food that doesn't use lard  and actually tastes like its been cooked perfectly. The only good thing about this place is the price. That, and maybe their carne asada fries.
