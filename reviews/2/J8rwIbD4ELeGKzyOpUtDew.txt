I had high hopes after reading reviews and seeing the menu. I'm a fan of a burrito restaurant and like that you can build your own. 
The problem being that the rice inside our burritos was basically raw, totally crunchy, so it really ruined the whole burrito. When we ordered, there was a girl training the order taker and she was very short and rude and made him hustle through the lunch rush. A line through the restaurant and she just stood there being ugly. 
The queso here is pretty great though! We will probably give it one more try and hope they have it together.
