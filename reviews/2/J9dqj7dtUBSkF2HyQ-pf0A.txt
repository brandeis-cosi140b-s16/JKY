Went up to Vegas to help my son move back to his old home. Stopped here for a late snack before we headed out on the road.. What a SLOW Del Taco   this has to be the slowest and worst managed Del Taco I have been to in quite some time. This place needs to be avoided if at all possible unless you have a long time to wait for your order.... WOW a long wait!!! we sat here for 15 minutes after we ordered. it seemed like they got confused and were making each order before starting the other... not like Del Taco
