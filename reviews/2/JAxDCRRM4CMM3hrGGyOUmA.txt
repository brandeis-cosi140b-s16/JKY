The waitress we had was a school teacher working during her vacation to supplement her school salary. She was the best part of the experience.. The cheese crisp was so so, the beef chimi's were not the best or worst we ever ate.The buss service was terrible, no setups on the table . We finished our cheese crisp and the buss person brought our chimi's, never took the empty plates. I asked for additional verde salsa it never came.. To be honest with usually go to Nando's on Mcdowell but they were closed for the holiday.Rosa'a can't hold a candle to Nando's.
