Agave-how I wish it weren't so:
1. Terrible service- no hostess when we arrived. No utensils when we received our food. No server to take our payment. Everything was just slow. I'm wasn't in a hurry, but having to wait for everything makes any average person a little anxious.
2. Food- Crispy quesadillas - chicken and corn versions: nice corn masa shell but bland fillings. Then we had the fresh fish tacos. They were soggy and a mess. The fish had an old fishy flavor and I couldn't get past it. If I'm able to eat fish sauce like it's ketchup, I think I have a pretty good tolerance of seafood/ocean taste.
3. Ambience- surprisingly nice. From the exterior, I wouldn't never have thought it was that well put-together in the interior. It was a great blend of the colors, the lighting and a Large center bar. But I'm here for food first and thought did not impress.
