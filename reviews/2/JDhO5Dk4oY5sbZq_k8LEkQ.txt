I was so excited to try this place.  I think maybe sometimes anticipation makes for a huge let down.  
I'm from LA.  I am Korean.  I live in Ktown.  I grew up on the best home cooked Korean food around (shout out to my Ma!)
I also have access to the BEST Mexican food around.  LA has it going on.

So maybe...just maybe...these things worked against me in this instance.

I wasn't impressed with the Korean or the Mexican aspect of this place.  Neither really stood out.  I was thinking like Street taco style tacos with Korean spice.  
My mom pointed out that she and I could probably do better putting kimchee on street tacos in LA.  

I tried the chicken, pork and bulgogi tacos, the kimchee fried rice with spam and Spam musubi with fried egg.  
-The tacos were just okay.  The meat in all three really could have been kicked up a notch.  They weren't memorable at all.  Not even the slaw on top had any flavor.  I had to drench with hot sauce (sauces are really good.  they come in a holder with 3 sauces) and tons of lime juice.  I do really like that you can get them with tortillas or in lettuce cups.  add a star for that. 
-The kimchee fried rice was just too...mushy.  And the spam was chopped so fine and tiny that I couldn't taste it.  Either add more or don't cut them so tiny.  I want to taste the spam.  Why else would I order it?
-spam musubi with egg.  can't mess that up really.  

Service was kind of slow.  We had to ask our server for stuff or just get up and get it ourselves.  A few times she just ignored us completely.  Whatever.

I don't want to knock this place. I give them mad props for the creative aspect.  Another star for that.  They have a good following here.  I'm just saying...if you're used to really good Korean food and really authentic Mexican food, this isn't the place for you.
