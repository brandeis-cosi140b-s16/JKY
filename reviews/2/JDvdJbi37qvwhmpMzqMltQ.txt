Food is decent, but service is horrible! I always give restaurants second chances and the second time was just as bad as the first. Slow, not friendly, and my $30 lamb was well done instead of medium. Completely ruined it. 

(PS-this was before the apparent "ownership change", I hope it really has changed. Maybe by getting all new staff that isn't horrible.)
