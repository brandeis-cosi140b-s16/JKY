I don't know what happened to this place. Perhaps ordering a meat dish at a place that specializes in seafood was an error in judgment on my part. I ordered the molcajete de carne. I did not like it at all. The meat was so overcooked and tough. Am I eating beef jerky? The beans that came with it was so oily and greasy. Chorizo had no flavor and it was a crumbling mess. I took one bite of the cactus and didn't eat the rest. The only thing I liked was the Mexican cheese.

Also, noticed the shrimp was not deveined in the aguachiles so cleaning shrimp poop was a joy. They didn't honor the free horchata when you check in which I was turned off by. It irritates me when businesses don't honor stuff. The waiter looked peeved too when I asked about the check in.

I don't know if I'll be back. The service was good until the check in part at the end. The empanadas were good and I have enjoyed other shrimp dishes there on previous visits but damn, that molcajete turned me off.
