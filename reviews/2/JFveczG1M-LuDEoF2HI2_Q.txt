I am sure on any other night, we would have been able to give a better review. Although our server was very good, we barely got to see him because they were so understaffed. They explained that they didn't expect the rush but the day before a three-day holiday weekend, come on. I work in the restaurant industry most of my life and everyone knows that those are some of the busiest days. And one of our companions never even received a drink they ordered at the beginning of the meal. They should try and make up for it by giving us a free appetizer on our next trip, however the location it's so far out of our normal area, and the food was so OK that nothing would probably bring me back there.
