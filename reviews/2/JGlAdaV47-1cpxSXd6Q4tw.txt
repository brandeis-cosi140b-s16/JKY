Not a fan.  Brought friends from Canada to the DC Ranch Market Place location for dinner a few weeks ago.  No one in our group of 9 thought is was very good and some where annoyed we wasted dinner at this place in lieu of all the great restaurants available in the area.  We had dinner on the inside balcony.  No tablecloths or nice looking tables, plastic cafeteria or pizza joint cups...go elsewhere for Mexican!!!
