I love Chipotle in general. I hate their anti-GMO stance and their inability to prevent horrible outbreaks of terrible diseases, but that risk is MINIMAL. Go ahead and take that as a given in all of my Chipotle reviews. I'm reviewing each of these Chipotles independently.
This is BY FAR my least favorite Chipotle. Over the course of about 2 years, our workplace would do regular lunch runs to this Chipotle, and I'd say about 50% of the time, they screwed up someone's order. Sometimes it was simply switching names, but more often, it was something really nuts like adding corn when nobody on our fax sheet asked for corn. About 25% of the time, after I'd call to confirm the order, they would have issues with their fax machine. Sometimes I'd have to read every person's order or I'd have to re-fax to a different number. And maybe 10% of the time, I'd show up after having confirmed and the order wouldn't be ready, and I'd have to wait for 10 minutes or so.
Eventually, our frustrated manager called up their manager and yelled at him. The Chipotle manager apologized and offered free food. Our manager declined, pushing that he just wanted the correct orders to come through. We had a few more wrong orders, before we ended up just not using this location or choosing other lunch spots. It may be completely in my head, but it also seemed to me like I got a few dirty looks from the manager afterward. Real nice.
If you're faxing your order in, I'd recommend the Thomas location.
