The NEW La Piñata is a major disappointment !!

This is a great place if you like your food served tepid.

The WAS one of our favorite haunts ( 200+ visits over a number of years at the old location).

Since their move in October 2015, things have deteriorated.  The service is now mediocre and slow.  The noise level is profoundly louder.  The food is not served hot.  The lunch special menu variety is greatly reduced. 

Our LAST visit at the new location was today (our third attempt for a satisfactory experience at the new location):  We asked our waiter to make sure our order was served hot.  The food was barely warm.  We opted to take our food home to heat it.  When we asked for a container to take salsa home - the waiter informed us that the charge would be 75 cents.  We were insulted, especially since we had unsuccessfully asked our waiter three times for our first salsa refill.

In spite of all of this the restaurant seems busier - since the move. 

I am truly happy for the owners - but WE will not be returning.   Three strikes and you're out. 

There are too many better alternatives.  For example: Jordan's Mexican Food on 7th Street has vastly superior service, good food, and is pleasantly quiet.  It is only about 5 minutes away from the new (not improved) La Piñata.
