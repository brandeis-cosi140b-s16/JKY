I came to Mariscos Sinaloa with high expectations because of all the good reviews but unfortunately, I was disappointed. I ordered a shrimp cocktail with agua chile and my expectation was a spicy shrimp cocktail with cooked shrimp but I got a combination of cooked and raw shrimp which I think should have been mentioned in the menu that it would have raw shrimp.Most shrmp cocktails in other restaurants come with cooked shrimp so I think this is reasonable expectation. I didn't like raw shrimp in my cocktail. My sister ordered camarones chapeados dish and it was tasteless and not good. The ceviche tostadas was chewy and taste was bad.Some of the food was good like the breaded fish.the price was expensive especially considering how much of it was left uneaten.It was around $130 for 5 dishes and one appetizer.The Mariscos Chihuahua restaurant chain in Tucson, AZ  has much better quality of food and prices are more reasonable. Not sure if they have those in Phoenix but I bet they do.I'd say it might be a good experience in Mariscos Sinaloa but you have to be really careful with what you order here.
