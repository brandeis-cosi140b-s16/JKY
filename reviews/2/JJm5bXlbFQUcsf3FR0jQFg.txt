This place was ok. I was hoping to be wowed since people really seem to like it. It was a little pricey for what it is. We ordered the chips with the salsa flight. We paid the $6 for the refillable chips (which I think just is silly, seriously, if every other place in AZ can give me free chips, you should, too. Charge me for the salsa flight, sure, but chips and your average pico de gallo really can't be breaking the bank for you.) We wound up not even getting a chip refill so that was a waste (we just couldn't eat that many chips). The pico was average, the other two were pretty decent. Husband ordered the carne asada tacos. They were pretty good. The tortillas had a nice bit of char on them which was good and nice big slices of avocado which was nice. I ordered the grilled steak salad. Pass. There were three tomatoes in it, literally one chunk of avocado and it really was a tiny salad for what I paid. The steak on top was pretty good but all the other elements were so scant it really wasn't worth it. The Sonoran margarita was pretty good. The house ones were just average. Overall, I wouldn't come back most likely for full price but may come back for happy hour.
