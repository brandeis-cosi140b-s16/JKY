The food here is pretty good, but expensive for the amount you get.  The three times I've been here, they have always screwed up my order or the order of the person I'm with.  I contacted the owner about this, and he offered me a gift card which I never got.  Lastly, the TVs are so loud you can't hold a decent conversation.  But the food is pretty good.  That's about it.
