I've been going to this chipotle since attending asu in 2008 with absolutely no problems other than an understandably long line. This past month, however, I've visited the Mill location two times, both very disappointing. 

Both visits my barbacoa was not chopped enough and I had to deal with pretty large chunks of meat. 

The service was beyond unacceptable. Staff were talking to each other and ignoring customers, as well as chatting with customers making the already long line even longer. 

It even seemed as though some staff were poorly trained and could not properly prepare or serve a meal. I had to repeat myself multiple times to get my correct order and ended up with a sloppily made burrito.

It's unfortunate that this location had some sort of a slip up... I'm most likely going to have to start going to the Tempe marketplace store if this kind of service keeps up...
