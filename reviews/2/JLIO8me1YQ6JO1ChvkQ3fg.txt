Went to this location to pick up dinner for the family tonight. They had an outage sign on the door indicating that they were out of black beans. Okay, no problem. 

Problem at this location is the fact the front end staff don't have consistent quality control of meat and rice portions. I ordered a burrito with chicken and white rice and the portion that was placed on the burrito looked like it belonged on the kid's menu. I inquired about it and the line server said more when be extra.  Based on my experience with other chipotle locations, I knew what she served was incorrect.  We ordered two bowls as well. She did the same thing with the chicken bowl. Someone else made the steak bowl, so the portion was correct. 

I hope that this location will stop skimping on their chicken and rice portions. Otherwise, my family will no longer be patrons.
