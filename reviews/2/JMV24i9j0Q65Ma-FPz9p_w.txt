I've gotten food from here twice. Experienced good customer service however the food taste bland. Not sure if the food is made "fresh" or to order. I ordered a side of Spanish rice and the lady put a ziploc bag of rice in the microwave (that I had to wait 5 minutes for). I would rather drive down the street to Roberto's for Mexican food.
