Sorry, very disappointing. The Salsa was ok, very mild and watery. The chips were decent, no complaint there. My wife ordered beef tacos and I ordered a Chimy. The beef was absolutely tasteless. 

The red sauce was pale and just as flavorless and didn't even cover the chimy . If you really want flavorful Mexican food.. This is not the place for you. If you cant stand spicy Mexican but you want to see a plate that looks like it has mexican food on it, then this is the place for you. 

The real tell tale sign was when i saw a couple with a toddler that were feeding her spoons of the rice.
