One of the best views of the Valley, especially at night.  
The food it's pretty good, but it's not the best I've ever had.  I had the taco's.
As for the margarita's, they are made with sweet and sour and are horrible and weak.  I prefer mine to be made from scratch and at least have some tequila in them.  The ambiance is nice, but it's really loud.  
The service is good.
Would I recommend this restaurant to friends and family?  No.  There are better Mexican restaurants out there, but if you want a nice view this is the place to come.
