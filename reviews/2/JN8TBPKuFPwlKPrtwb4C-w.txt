I've passed Pepe's Taco Villa for years and decided to stop in for what else? TACOS! Well... Big Time disappointment! I had the # 13, Crispy Chicken Tacos, side of rice & beans and a Guacamole Cheese Crisp.  The Tacos were exactly like the ones served up in grade school; Come on Pepe, taco shells out of a box!!!! Chicken was bland, and the rice & beans were average. The Salsa was more like Katsup with chili peppers. The Cheese Crisp was Great but It takes a lot to mess up a cheese crisp. I give 2 stars for the guac, it was the only thing that tasted "authentico" to me. Too Bad oh soo sad. Now I must tend to my heartburn. Adios!
