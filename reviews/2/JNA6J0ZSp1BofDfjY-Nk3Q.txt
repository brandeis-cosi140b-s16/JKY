Went for lunch the other day. Friends and I all ordered burritos. The girl taking our order asked if we wanted beans and rice in our burritos. Now, beans and rice are pretty standard fare in a burrito. (I personally don't like beans, but every burrito in town comes with them standard.) so my friends get both beans and rice, and I get only rice. Come to find out, it's $1.75 EXTRA, PER ITEM, PER BURRITO!! Wow! Upon further inspection of the menu, if one were to get cheese on their burger, they'd like pay $1 more. After the long wait to get our order, I asked how much ketchup was if I wanted fries... The food it self was average. Nothing special or to remember, nothing horrible either.
