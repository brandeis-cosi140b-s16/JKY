I had heard good things about Don Pedro, so when a co-worker suggested we go there for lunch on Friday, I was excited to try it out.  However, I was not terribly impressed with the food or the service.  For one, they were extremely slow in terms of service.  Then, they messed up 2 orders at our table of 4.    I was not a fan at all of their salsa -  it had way too much onion.   The lunch special I ordered was meh. I doubt I'll be going back.
