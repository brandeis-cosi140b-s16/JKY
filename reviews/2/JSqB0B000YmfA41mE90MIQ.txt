No. Just no. 

So small inside. When I sat down to eat my food in the corner I felt like I was in time out. Dead on a Friday night. 

Ordered the #2. Three different mini burritos. Great way to showcase three times in one visit that I don't like your food. We were told the salsas were spicy but they weren't. Chips were ok, a little salty. My burritos that had meat inside (pork and beef) were very dry. Not appetizing to me. My husband had a breakfast burrito and said they used fake eggs which is a pet peeve. 

We won't go back- Rubios is around the corner with $1.50 fish tacos on Tuesdays that are actually yummy. Sorry America. I don't like the food.
