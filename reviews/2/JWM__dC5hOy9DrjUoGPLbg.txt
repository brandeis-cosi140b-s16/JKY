I had a Sonora dog and a small burrito. The Sonora dog was good but not the best in Phoenix. If you want a really good Sonora dog you can go to 19th st and Indian School on the south side of the street, I think they're called Nogalas dogs. As for the burrito.....I asked what was in it and they said the meat, cabbage, and beans. I asked for one with just meat, guacamole, and sour creme. She said we don't do that but there's guacamole in the lobby. I still ordered the burrito but did not put my own guacamole cause it did not look good, it was more of a whitish looking color. Anyways back to the actual burrito. It was not good at all and had no flavor whatsoever. I don't know if it was a bad night or that's how the always taste. All I know is I will not return there again.
