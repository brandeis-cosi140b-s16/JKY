Food, excellent as always. I've been dining here for nearly 20 years. Service, horrible. Last night was the worst I've ever experienced there. Lots of waiters doing nothing, managers holding up the bar, maybe one busser in the restaurant. Took forever to get a water. Took forever to be followed up with. Oh, and when you order an appetizer isn't it supposed to come before the main course? 2 stars for this visit, and that's only due to the cooks doing their job right.
