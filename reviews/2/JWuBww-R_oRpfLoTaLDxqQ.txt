We went on a groupon and the food was Ok but it seems their more Hispanic friendly the waiter didnt even come back to check on us I ordered more salsa which I never got and I agree with one other comment it seems they raise the price on groupon customers the chimichanga in the menu said 12.99 but they charged me 15.99 plus 2.00 for carne asada so at 17.99 it wasn't worth it Robertos is better for half the cost will not be back and I agree with other comments as far as the manager they don't have good customer service my sister had an encounter with the manager which my sister left she didn't even wanna eat there.
