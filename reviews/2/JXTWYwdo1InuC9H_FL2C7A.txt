The food at Barrio Urbano is pretty good, but it isn't up to par with the original Barrio.  Also, the quality is inconsistent over the two times we've dined here.  

The real problem here is the service.  The waiters don't always seem to know what's going on and seem confused and forgetful.  We ordered our drinks, and I asked for a water in addition to our other drinks.  Water never came and I had to ask 2 different people 4 times to get that water.  We ordered guacamole (the best guac in town), but our entrees came out 20 minutes later.  Our server was nowhere to be found, so I had to ask another server why we didn't receive our appetizer before our meal.  She offered to make it right then at the table, but instead our server brought the cart over and made it after another 5 minutes.  

The food was all good, but we only saw our server once during our meal.  When we finally got our bill, our server ran my card but forgot to bring the receipt to be signed.  It was another 10 minutes before we could find him to get the receipt and be on our way.  

The staff just seems too inexperienced/young to even handle the job of serving guests in an adequate manner.  I will be back for the food, but hope that the restaurant starts implementing some service standards with its staff.
