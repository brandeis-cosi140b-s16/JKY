Average.....at best. Went for dinner tonight with my wife and two kids. They did pretty well on service, the staff was friendly and attentive. The tortilla chips were stale and the salsa didn't have alot of flavor. My wife and I ordered strawberry margaritas, mine on the rocks, hers blended. After several minutes and what sounded like a blender over the wall by the bar, our server came back to inform us they couldn't blend anything, so she took hers on the rocks too. The drinks had too much sour mix in them and neither of us could taste any tequila. I'm still not sure why they add $.025 on the bill for the "strawberry", it looked like they had poured flavored soda in it, no fruit whatsoever. My wife's chicken fajita burrito had good taste but certainly wasn't the best ever.  My Cuco's Burrito was delicious but a little heavy on the cilantro. Bottom line, if you want to survive in Madison as a restaurant, you'd better master the basics and find a "wow" factor to keep people coming back. I'd consider giving them a second chance and maybe I will a long time from now, but there's much to choose from that excites me more.
