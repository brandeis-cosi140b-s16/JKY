Went with my wife thru the drive thru. Got two combos. One was a salad and a drink. The other a burrito and a drink. Not worth the $14. Burrito was ok. Nothing great. Mostly filled with rice. It came with a little bag of stale tortilla chips. Wasn't impressed at all. With other fast food choices available, prob won't choose this one again.
