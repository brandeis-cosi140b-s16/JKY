So we finally tried Rivas a couple of weeks ago after driving past it so many times. It is just not that good. The cashier girl was more interested in chatting with the person in the kitchen and her coworker than doing her actual job-- but no big deal, you come to expect it from most of the younger generation. The food was below average. I ordered one of the combo plates-- which looked nothing like the menu-- and it was virtually tasteless. I mean tasteless to the point that even hot sauce couldn't save it. Probably will not return to see if the food/cashier get any better.
