Located inside Sun Coast.

We stopped by and were looking at the menu, it was unimpressive and didn't look appetizing.

The restaurant was completely empty with only the staff that worked there. We stood for awhile looking at the menu but no one came out to greet us or welcome us in.

Judging by the unattentiveness and lack of patrons, I doubt we would ever eat here.
