Yeah, they load up your burrito but they load it up in rice and beans then proceed to skimp out on the meat. Don't bother asking for an little more because all they will do is literally add one piece of meat and then threaten to charge double for meat after that. Yes it is good but not worth $7 dollars good. They even hesitate to add more salsa in your burrito. So basically you are left with a bean and rice burrito with meat on the side instead of a meat burrito with rice and beans. Hate restaurants that skimp out on food you payed for. Will not return to chipotles again
