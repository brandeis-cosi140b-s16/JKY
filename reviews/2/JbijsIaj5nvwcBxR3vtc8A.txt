Went to the original location and was not impressed. We asked for a mild salsa and were given a bowl of tomato juice. Not a single piece of solid food in it. The carnitas were really dry.
The beef and shrimp fajitas were very tasty. I was served a huge mound of sizzling food and almost all of it was onions and peppers. Fortunately I like onions and peppers but the meat shrimp were nowhere to be found. I didn't hate it but I wouldn't go back. There are many better restaurants in the area.
