Waited 30 minutes for 1 takeout order. The taquitos were burnt. The person ringing up had to write down orders with paper and pen, with lunch rush line to the door. Food was nothing exciting. Average at best, but that's the norm for Vegas Mexican food. Guacamole was good, everything else average. Also, they're grade is a C which I rarely see. I wouldn't have gone there knowing that.
