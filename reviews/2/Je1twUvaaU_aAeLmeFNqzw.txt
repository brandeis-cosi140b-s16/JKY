This Del Taco has very poor management. 

The size of your order will vary. 
Make sure you get what you pay for:
 They have a tendency to make the order small to save money for the company.

They have had three or four managers in 2013 at this location. On Taco Tuesday they did not have sugar for the ice tea. Three days later they still did not have sugar. I guess they expect us to poison ourselves with aspartame.

As you can tell by my review I'm pretty upset! I would issue only one star for this restaurant accepts food is good when you finally get what you order.

I heard from a former manager that this restaurant got 33 demerits during its last health department department inspection.

If you have a choice, I would pick a different Del Taco restaurant for your business:
