Came here on my lunch break and ordered two tacos to go. Similar set up to a Chipotle, where you go through an assembly line and customize your tacos, burritos, etc. Unlike Chipotle, Panchero's doesn't offer "responsibly sourced" ingredients and GMO-free options. A plus side to Panchero's is there was no line at 12:30pm on a Thursday... but that should be a warning sign that the restaurant is sub par. There were only two people eating lunch when I was there. 

As soon as I started driving away, I noticed wet spots on my passenger seat. The tacos were leaking through the tin foil, through the paper bag, and onto my seat! Ugh! Less than two minutes away from the restaurant, and it was a mess. Rather than drive back to the office, I pulled into a parking lot to eat my tacos. I didn't want to risk having them leak even more during the 7-minute drive back to work.

Even though I had just ordered the tacos five minutes earlier, the tortillas were soggy. I like the concept of cooking tortillas on the spot and having them freshly made with each order, but I cannot stand for soggy tortillas. I ordered one steak taco and one carnitas taco. The steak was very chewy and fatty - it was difficult to eat so I only had a few bites. The carnitas were tender but not very flavorful.

If I decide to try Panchero's again, I will definitely be eating in the restaurant rather than ordering take out. I don't even think they should offer "to go" as an option considering the mess the tacos made on my front seat and the fact that the tortillas get soggy after only a few minutes. I'm not sure if I'll be back - I'm not sure it's worth the risk when Chipotle is just a mile away.
