At one time this was our favorite Mexican Resturant and happily drove the 20 plus miles to go there.   Sadly, that is no longer the case and after multiple 2nd chances it's not likely we will be making the trip here anymore.  The service which was always impeccable has become mediocre at best, long waits to be acknowledged after being sat, long waits for food that has been less than acceptable, cold, or completely wrong on multiple occasions. The salsa is still amazing and when the food is right it's very good.  But it's become a crap shoot.  And if you enjoy multitudes of children running free screaming, hanging over your booth, this is your type of place because the servers and management have no problem letting this go on.  I'll pass from now on.
