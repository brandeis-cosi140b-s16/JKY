I'm gonna have to lay down a star reduction for this place, unfortunately.

Had breakfast there Sunday 2-20-11.  With tip, came to $11.

Went with the protein punch, the "Carne Asada Platter" with two fried eggs.

I was hoping for some "seasoned" carne asada, which most places give you these days.

This was just a short, skinny section of over-cooked flank steak.  VERY tough.  Hard to cut with a sharp knife and hard to chew up.

Eggs and re-fried beans were nothing special.  Beans basically tasteless.

The one semi-bright spot was the salsa served with chips before the food came out.  It was good.  Not excellent, not VERY good, just....Good.

I'm gonna have to say this place is hovering between "slightly below average" and "average."

Won't be going back.
