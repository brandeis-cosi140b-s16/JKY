Well not impressed.  The only good thing was the chips and salsa and my Dr. Pepper which was self serve.  Had the carne-asada burrito.  It was dried up beef with guacamole that lacked flavor.  I ask for the pico on the side and they brought me another bowl of salsa (great).  Well the cheese crisp was good, but fell apart as we were eating it.  The wife like her Chicken Burrito with green sauce, but in my opinion it was the stewed chicken place in a tortilla and the smothered with sauce and cheese then put under the broiler... All this for $22, well, last and only time...  OH...  The service and employees were great...
