I want to create a time line showing how Bajio went from my favorite early release destination way back in high school to its current situation. I can only guess that the brief period that the restaurant closed down only to be reopened under new ownership was the tipping point into bad food territory. 

Thanks to Henry Ford, this place uses an assembly line to create the Americanized Mexican food that it churns out for its customers. I usually get a plain bean and cheese burrito because I'm not a big fan of most of their toppings. I've always liked that the food comes with free chips and salsa. 

I've tried other menu options like salads and chicken burritos, and everything is just so-so. I want this place to return to its former glory with the shouting for tips such, but I think that the current environment is here to stay.
