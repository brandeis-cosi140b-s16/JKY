Food is decent...when they get it right.  My co-workers and I go here a lot.  One day a co worker ordered the grilled chicken salad when it was brought out to him he opened the box and only lettuce, tomato and a few avocado slices - NO CHICKEN!  On a recent visit another co-worker and I got our order to go.  He ordered the Carnitas burrito he asked for cheese, pico and cilantro in his burrito and paid extra for it.  When we got back to the office he did not get any of what he paid extra for.  Kitchen staff is soooooo sloooow!!!!!!  "Manager/Owner" ? (Thin guy dark hair and beard) just stands in front on his phone text or looking at facebook, never offers to help with orders no matter how busy they get.  Like I said food is decent however so many other downfalls.....
