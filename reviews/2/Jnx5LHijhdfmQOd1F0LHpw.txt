Charlotte being my home airport, I'm typically not eating at the airport when coming or going. However, I was in Washington DC and flew through CLT to visit Fort Lauderdale and with a two-hour layover here, I thought I would give it a try. You can't miss it, located at the top of the C concourse (inside the secure area).

The food is fair-to-good, considering that it's in an airport where they will have limited use of certain implements (like knives and such) that will handicap their cooking abilities. I went with a simple quesadilla - two flour tortilla's with spicy cheese and chicken, grilled into a sandwich sort-of thing. It arrived with small bowls of sour cream, guacamole and salsa. It seemed that the guacamole and the salsa had been prepared elsewhere as they were not as flavorful or fresh as I have had elsewhere.

I opted for a margarita on the rocks, which arrived in a very pretty shaker with plenty of salt on the rim of the glass. The drinks menu cleverly does not have prices, so I was a little surprised that a regular (not top shelf) drink was $8, though there was enough in there for two. Not very strong.

After eating, I stayed at my table for another hour waiting for my flight. I had to call over the waitress to clear my dishes, after which I brought out the laptop and signed on to CLT's free wi-fi network. It was quieter than the rest of the airport waiting areas, though the TV's were tuned into some sports event.

For airport food, it is certainly different than the run-of-the-mill Chili's or Burger King nearby. If you have the time, make this place your stop.
