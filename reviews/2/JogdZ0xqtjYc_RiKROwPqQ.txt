Pedro's is a place that I remember fondly from my childhood. We used to eat there from time-to-time when I was a kid.  

Sadly, the place hasn't seemed to evolve much since the 80's.  We went for an early dinner one night before seeing a show in Madison.  We were seated at about 4:30 pm, and were the only ones in the dining room.  The decor is 80's "americanized Mexico." It looked exactly as I remember it from years ago.  It did seemed to be kept up.

I was really looking forward to the hot fresh tortillas they used to serve.  There is a tortilla maker in the middle of the dining room.  Unfortunately, the machine wasn't running.  I can understand that since the place was pretty empty, but the tortillas they gave us were dry and hard.  They had been sitting out for awhile.  That was a bit disappointing.

I had a burrito, it was ok.  Nothing too exciting.  In the 80's and 90's it would have been great, but Mexican food in Wisconsin has gotten so much better over the years.  

I still love their chips and salsa, though!  However, that probably isn't enough to bring me back again anytime soon.
