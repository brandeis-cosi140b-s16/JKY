I have to be honest, I'm not really impressed with the Some Burros, any of their locations. People go crazy for it and each location is always packed but there's something about it that doesn't float my boat. I feel like all of the ingredients look cheap and not as fresh as any other places I've been to. The lettuce is all watery iceburg, cheese looks meh in texture (clumps together), and the sour cream is definitely not grade A product. It is relatively cheap and fast though, so I suppose most people are willing to adjust their tastebuds for those factors. Myself, however, will always turn this place down unless it is a last resort.
