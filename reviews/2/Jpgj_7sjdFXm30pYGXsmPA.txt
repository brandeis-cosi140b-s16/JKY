The staff here is absolutely awful. Out of the last 10 times I was only happy about 1 time with my order. They move so slow and are consistently messing up the order even though you just told them it. They're constantly on their phones and almost seem stoned half the time

The one bright spot in the staff is this kid cole( I think?? he has glasses). He just started (we go about once a week for food) He is friendly and attentive.

The food is sub par compared to chipotle, but better than moe's in my opinion. Will I continue to go back? Yeah. But only because it's closer than chipotle.

They'd get more stars if their staff wasn't so bad
