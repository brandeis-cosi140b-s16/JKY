My GF lives in the area and I was wanting some Mexican food. After reading the reviews I was a little iffy on going here but decided to try it. 

Saturday evening and we walk in to an empty restaurant, we were the only people there besides the staff. That should have been a sign to leave but we stayed. 

The chips and salsa was bland. Most of the Mexican restaurants have similar salsa but theirs lacked flavor. 

She went for fajitas trying to play it safe and the meat was so over cooked you could barely chew it. She didn't eat a 1/4 of her meal. 

I got a less than spectacular chimichanga and chile poblano. Rice was on and the runniest refried beans I have ever seen. 

Unfortunately we will not return. We didn't complain or want anything for free. The server got his tip as service was great (hence we were the only ones there) and he was nice.
