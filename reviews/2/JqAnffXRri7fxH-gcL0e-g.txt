Swanky little Mexicana restaurante here in Pineville NC. Wait staff is friendly and attentive. Salsa not so great . Food hot and fast to the table but sadly to say Not really good . I ordered flautas - beef and chicken. The chicken was awful the beef was better for sure. The rice tasted like it was cooked yesterday or older and the beans were just smashed beans - can't really mess that up . I'd say if you're starving this place could feed you but if you can last - I'd say keep driving - I'd rather not recommend it ... It wasn't  very good.  Again the waitstaff was really friendly the food not so much ... So the final question is when the manager asks How was everything is it better to say it was okay knowing I would NEVER come back here or do you say - it was awful - cause it was.
