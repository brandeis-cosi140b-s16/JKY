I've enjoyed Rubio's several times as it is a change from the usual fast food fare.  On this particular day, I visited the Bell location.  As I was walking in, I received a phone call.  So as to not be rude, I did not approach the counter...even though there were no other customers there.   After completing my phone call...about 1 minute....I approached the counter where "shift supervisor" James was standing.  I immediately noticed he was leaning on the wall with his arms crossed.  He didn't even greet me.  I asked if he was ready and he replied "yes".  Not even a smile.  I placed an order to include a plate and an ala carte taco.  After he entered the info into the cash register,  he read back the order to confirm.  It wasn't correct.  I asked again for the items and he began to berate me saying that is not what I said the first time.  I cancelled the order and left.  I won't go back to that location again.
