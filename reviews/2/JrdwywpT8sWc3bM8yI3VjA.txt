I really wanted to like this place...but, after giving a couple of tries, I just can't say that I'm all that impressed.  First of all...they are never busy when we go.  Not sure why, but we always feel like we will get great service since we are usually the only people in there...not always the case.  

A couple of times, I have gotten food to go...and would wait at the bar until my food came up.  TWICE now...I noticed that their glasses above the bar are FILTHY!  I mean...GROSS!  I mentioned something the first time...in a very nice way so as to not embarrass the bartender.  She seemed surprised, but took the constructive criticism  well...but unfortunately, when I stopped again recently....there they were again...those bacteria ridden glasses just hung there screaming...WASH ME PLEASE!!!!  So, I asked for a clean glass...and ordered a glass of red wine (it was subzero out...so no margarita for me)...and it was awful!  I get that it's a Mexican place, so margaritas are the standard...but, if you are going to have wine as an option, please don't serve rot-gut.  BLECH!

The food is mediocre at best...some days it was better than others...but the last couple of times it was sub-par...and the sides that they send you home with are really pittiful.  We ordered two dinners and we got maybe a half cups worth of rice...and a half cups worth of beans. 

I also agree with the other comments that chips and salsa should just be complimentary.  

I'm doubtful that we will go here again...
