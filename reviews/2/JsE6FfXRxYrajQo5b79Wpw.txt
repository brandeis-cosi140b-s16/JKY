I love Chipotle's food... and normally, Chipotle is a solid 4- 5 stars. Tonight, however was a different story. I walked to the counter and before I could finish saying "Hi", the girl puts her finger up to shush me and walks over to the Manger to ask for her break! I couldn't hear his reply, but it must have been the answer she was looking for, because she returns to the counter looking awfully smug. I tell her I'd like tacos, and as she slaps the tortillas on the grill for literally 2 seconds (they were cold and hard...yummm!), she turns to the boy next to her and starts rubbing it in his face, even more smug now that she can share her obvious victory in the matter. 
The ONLY reason I didn't give 1 star was this poor kid, obviously upset,  did an exceltionally good job of staying professional between the girl antagonizing him and the manager at the cash register texting. 
I will not return to this chipotle, this isn't the first bad experience here. Fool me twice? Well, you know
