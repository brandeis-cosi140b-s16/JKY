HOLY CRAPPY SERVICE!! Wow....so rude and unprofessional. I was reading all the other reviews and thinking....give me a break....but no, they are so rude. Only nice worker was the cash register. 

Barely any chicken left, so they decided to scrape out the little extra dry pieces. I refused and waited for new chicken. Then made my burrito and it tore....but just kept going. I asked if that's how they make all their burritos, she said no. I asked for mine to be re-made....she didn't appreciate that. Slammed my burrito in the trash. Told her thank you,, and got an "you're an asshole" half smile. 

Food- 4 stars. Loved the homemade tortilla and the chicken. Will come back and hopefully catch them at a better time.
