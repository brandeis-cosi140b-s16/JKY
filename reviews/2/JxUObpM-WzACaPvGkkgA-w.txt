I gave this 2 stars because that's how much I love chipotle. But when it comes to this new location, the employees here are not even trained to wrap a burrito yet. Minimum 15 min wait when you go inside and they laugh and joke with each other instead of hopping on the food line and giving extra help. Hire more people and train them to do everything before you open a new location. Writing this as I wait in line (been 10 min)
