For the price this place is pretty terrible. 

First warning sign was that 20 Vegetable Fried Rice. It's $20 and doesn't even have a protein, that's $5 extra. Twenty bucks for rice, vegetables and egg fried up?! Come on now that's just insulting.

Next, the baked pork buns were without a doubt the worst pork bao I've ever had. Try Noodles next door at the Belagio and you'll find the pork buns you're looking for. We couldn't even finish them. The insides were tasteless and the outside was a chewy mess. Oh, and they don't have spicy mustard for them and want to charge an extra $2 for some chili oil, explaining that it's made in house. We're talking about pretty standard condiments here.

We also got some tacos, the best thing I could say about them is that they were mediocre, and so was the service. We had to send 3 people back to finally get some soy sauce and never saw our waiter again after taking our order.
