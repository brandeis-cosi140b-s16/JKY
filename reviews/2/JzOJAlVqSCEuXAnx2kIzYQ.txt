Only been here once due to hunger desperation.  The employees appeared distant and uncaring.  They might have had a bad day earlier, I couldn't tell, but it's called "customer service" for a reason.  Don't complain about a customer right in front of people standing in line; it's rude, unprofessional, and upsetting.

They get two stars for having the 5 layer cheesy beefy sour creamy burrito thingy....but every taco bell has that.
