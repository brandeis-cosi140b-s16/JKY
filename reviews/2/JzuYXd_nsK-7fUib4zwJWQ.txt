I have been here on several occasions and the service is never great but today was horrible. Wait to order drinks is ridiculous. Waitress did not recognize an order for chile verde. Saw half the restraunt get refills of chips and drinks but we are not offered any. Food was fine but hate to see half the restraunt get service but if you have the wrong waitress expect nothing. No manager around apparently customer service has zero priority.
