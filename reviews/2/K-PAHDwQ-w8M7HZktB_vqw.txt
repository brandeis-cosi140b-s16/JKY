I will say, the food is absolutely delicious! The chorizo burger and the Relleno de camerones with the grilled corn...to die for

Service is terrible though. We were here last year when they opened and the bartenders and staff were amazing. They have new bartenders and they are friendly but lack the ability to check back when your sitting right in front of them. The newest bartender does not know how to make a margarita.

The only reason I will ever continue to go here is for the amazing food!
