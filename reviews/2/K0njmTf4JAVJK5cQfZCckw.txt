Have been here several times--food is relatively good, service is consistendly lackluster at best. 

 Asked for huevos rancheros since eggs are on the menu--overheard waitress at both our table and others say NO more times than yes--about everything.  Finally ordered a dish described with eggs over easy--then eggs were served like  were overdone hockey pucks.  Send them back? with whom? they were not very busy, but servers were unengaged--no one came back to check on us.  We felt like food cart patrons at a place with table service prices--and blaring TV's like the electronics dept at Walmart--cannot hear yourself think.

the food came up quickly and the interior was clean, but felt like we were an imposition versus welcome guests.
