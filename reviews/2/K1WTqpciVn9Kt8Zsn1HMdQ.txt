I wanted to check this place out being that there has been such rave reviews.  I will say that the idea of the ambiance that was created was very inviting and  had somewhat of an authentic feel to it. Once we were greeted and seated, we started to notice that there was quite a bit of disorder and chaos near and around the kitchen area.  The waitress took longer than most places to take our order. Once we received our food, which was mediocre to say the least, it felt as though employees were hovering over us.  We felt very rushed and uncomfortable.  I looked around and noticed that they were doing that with all the tables.  Just a word of advice, if you are looking to enjoy a meal at your pace without helicopter employees, I would not recommend Imperial Tacos & Beer.  I honestly think that with the proper training in this industry to bring it up to standards, this place could have potential.  At this point, I will not be returning.
