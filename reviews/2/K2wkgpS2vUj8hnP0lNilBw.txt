I have always loved Filiberto's, and of the 2 locations near my home, this one always beat out the Val Vista location.  I purchase their hot sauce by the pint, however lately, both the Val Vista and Gilbert locations seem to be adding tomato juice to their hot sauce.  It tastes tinny and is not the same as it used to be.  I will no longer go to Filiberto's if the Gilbert and Baseline location goes downhill.  I stay away from any of their "meats" (?)  Super Nachos meat is different than it used to be.  Almost broke a tooth on large piece of bone.  Have gotten raw chicken once in a burrito.  I love the Chili Relleno burrito and is my go to, but needs the old recipe hot sauce.
