This place sucks I've been waiting 40 minutes for my TO GO order. What's the deal? I've been waiting 40 minutes for 1 taco and a burrito good thing I smoked before and I don't have anything else to do but wait for this mediocre food that is conveniently placed a mile from my house. Thanks for the bad salsa and slow service. The food was good tho.
