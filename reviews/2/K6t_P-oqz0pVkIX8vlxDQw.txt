This place is ok to eat at.  I had Carne Asada and the sauce that came with it was just middle of the road.  The steak tasted great, was a bit under done (more rare than medium rare).  My husband had the Pork Tenderloin in a sweet sauce.  It was ok, but I expected a bigger hint of spice.  The homemade guacamole was great and so was the desserts.  The manager made up for some of our mishaps so I feel the service definitely tried to make up for any loss we had.  The pricing on the food was more than I expected but everything was fresh.  Fantastic server, fantastic management.
