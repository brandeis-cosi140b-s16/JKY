The food was pretty good, and that was the best part of our experience.  We were seated, told they were going to bring us menus, and left to sit...and sit...and sit.  After about 10 min, a woman said in passing that she would be there in a minute to take our drink order.  When she returned 10 min later, we ordered drinks and mentioned that we would really like some menus please.  She produced the menus fairly quickly.  When she returned with our drinks, we were quite anxious to order because we had already been at our table for 30 min.  After ordering our food, it took an additional 30 minutes before our food was brought out.  One of our entrees was incorrect (chicken fajitas instead of steak fajitas), but we didn't say anything because we were afraid it would take too long to correct.  Again, food was good, but this restaurant seriously needs to do something about it's speed and attention to customers.
