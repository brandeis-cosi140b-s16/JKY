So - I must say, our experience was probably prompted by less than desirable seating by the hostess.  It was a cold night so we opted to sit inside.  However, we were seated directly in front of the door to the patio.  A frequently used door by staff and patrons blowing cold air directly on us.  Yes, we could have asked to been moved, but it was a conversation piece!
Our waiter took forever to get to our table, and didn't have a busy section.  He came to our table with "Sorry it took me so long to get over, but at least I got here!".  
We were both dying for the Machos Nachos, however he forgot this order and only brought our entrees.  The wine I had was great, and my fellow had a kickbutt martini.  
Chips and nachos, yumm.
The Pollo Asado was good, not great.  He had the carne asada tacos...but didn't even dive in to the second one, so I can't say they were amazing.  
However...the sopapillas were a little bit of heaven and I had trouble sharing.

Overall - meh.  The food was good, not great and the waitstaff leave something to be desired.  I have been here previously and the tacos on the patio are a great late night snack with a beer!
