Let me say that Viva Salsa in Henderson at that Station Casino is more user friendly with spacious seating and a better, cleaner salsa bar with more choices! When we arrived, a supervisor at the casino was getting his meal and the cook Michel was handling his food like he was cooking for the Queen of England! You could see the steam off the food! I ordered what that guy had; quesadilla. This poor guy was very slow and not very personable with the public. As he was taking orders, a mean, chunky lady comes in and washes her hands and starts cooking! You would think that with her cooking your food would come out hot...NOT SO!!! Nothing was hot!!! I stood there and watched her cook!!! How can you cook food and it not be hot?!! And, the refried beans and spanish rice were not hot either! Looks like someone needs to take lessons from a solo driver at your sister casino!!! Will not be eating at this one again! And, since I am on Boulder...let me review my experience at the buffet two weeks ago....
