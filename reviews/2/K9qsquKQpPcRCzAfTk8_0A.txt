I'm really surprised by all the positive reviews of this place. I had 3 tacos: barbacoa, carnitas, and a cochinita. We also ordered guacamole for the table. 

The tacos are literally street tacos. The ones you can finish in 2 bites. I didn't think any of the tacos had much flavor or kick to it. Being priced at $5.50/taco, this is absurd!

The guacamole you can rave about, but it is $15 for a small order. Really? We needed two for our table.

I don't even consider this place a fusion. It just serves both Mexican or  Chinese food on the menu.

This is my first Jose Andres restaurant and probably my last.
