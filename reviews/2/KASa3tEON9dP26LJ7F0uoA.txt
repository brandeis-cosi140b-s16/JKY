Grease, grease, and more grease. 

I come here a lot because it's a 2 minute drive from my work. I always order the same thing, carne asada or lengua tacos, carne asada fries or nachos. Either or.

I never, ever order over the phone. There's always a language barrier and they don't seem to get my order right.

Other than, food comes out quick.
