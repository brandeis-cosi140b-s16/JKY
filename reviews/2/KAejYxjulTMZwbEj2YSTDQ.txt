Waitress needs the info about gf. I asked if they offer anything gf, she said 'anything with a gf next to it, I don't even know what gf means, lol". I told her she should learn what is, its on your menu.i know, that sounded bitchy, I just thought she should better informed. I think that was embarrassing for her to admit that to a customer.

Iced tea was extremely weak. 
The chips come in a huge bucket, that was something i have never seen before, was cool.We did not like either of the salsa's, bland.

The sweet potato fries were soggy and limp. I had a burger with no bun, the burger had great flavor. I also had a bloody Mary, that was super hot and i like hot but this was really hot.
