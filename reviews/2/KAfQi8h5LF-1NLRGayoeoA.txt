I popped in for a quick lunch this afternoon to check out Pure Taqueria because I had business to do in the neighborhood and needed a quick bite to eat. Unfortunately, the quality of the food and service don't match the shiny new storefront. I will certainly not be a regular, even if it is just up the road from my house...

Upon arriving, I was seated quickly and ordered a sweet tea as soon as I was seated while I perused the menu. By the time I had ordered and my enchiladas were brought to the table, I still had yet to receive my sweet tea. Although I was pretty parched, I ate a few bites and waited for my server to come check on me...and waited...and waited, until I finally gave up, flagged down a different server and asked yet again. Although my server brought my tea right away, I was still more than halfway through my meal before I even saw it. 

As for the food, I ordered the enchiladas of the day, which were the enchiladas suizas. Although the food was presented well and served very quickly, the enchiladas were relatively flavorless, even with the pico de gallo served on top. The salsa served with their chips - which were oversalted - was actually pretty decent but that's really all I can say for the place. Overall, I was certainly underwhelmed.
