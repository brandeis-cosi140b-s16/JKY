Went for lunch.  The food was ok but a bit expensive.  The baby back ribs disappointed - don't order that.  Drinks were good and expensive.  $60 for lunch, hmm, not worth it.  
Anyways, it's an open walled restaurant right on the strip, so quite popular.  But at over 100 degrees that day, it was very hot if you are sitting close to the street.  Inside get a bit of A/C.  
Learning - don't go for lunch.  Maybe ok for drinks or parties at night.
