My wife and I have eaten here several times before, and each time previous the food was fast, cheap, and delicious. Sure, it's named differently but anyone who is anyone in Vegas knows it's the exact same food and menu as a Roberto's.

That's not my issue, however.

My problem is the last two times we went, it was late at night since my wife works a late swing shift. I'm not sure how the training works for these franchises, but aside from the questionable customer service, I can assume proper food handling and safety is not a part of the training and I will explain why based on what I saw with my own eyes.

We go in to order, and the cook, who was also working the register, was busy taking care of a big order before us. He pauses to take our order, without ringing us up and continues to finish the order before us. After 10-15 minutes since we entered, he finished the first order and continues to work on ours. Shortly after, he finishes our food and comes to cash us out. We went to pay with card but he told us he didn't know how to work the register or the card machine. He suggested us returning the next day to pay, which was a bit off to us both.

Now I mentioned questionable customer service, and it honestly can be overlooked if it wasn't for the fact that while he was working on our food, he was not wearing gloves, and he had open cuts on his hand which were bleeding as he was making our food and touching the register(and believe me when I say these cuts were deep enough to visibly see the blood) . It completely made us both sick to our stomachs and we had to leave.

We don't want to go back there knowing someone is bleeding all over our food, it's just unfortunate since the times we ate there previously everything was good, which is why Im giving a fair 2 stars out of 5.
