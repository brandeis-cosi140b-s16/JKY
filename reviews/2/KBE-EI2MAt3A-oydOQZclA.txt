I havent been to a Roberto's Taco Shop in at least 5 years and I decided to try it again. I can't remember why I skipped this one out of my Mexican food places but now I think I remember why. It's not that great but if you like a quick Mexican fix, this'll do.  The place is simple, service is fast, and it's fairly clean and decent place to have a quick lunch. I observe a lot of people coming for to goes but the time I was here, none stayed. Maybe its me? Hehehe. Oh well.
