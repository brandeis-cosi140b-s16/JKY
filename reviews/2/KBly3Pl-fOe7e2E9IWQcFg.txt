I was so, so excited to give this place a try. Mexican food, guacamole, margaritas?? It's my perfect little restaurant trifecta. Sadly, my husband and I were in and out in an hour and we probably will not be back any time soon. 

We were seated at a comfortable table near the bar and offered popcorn. What? Where are my chips and salsa? Oh, we have to order them? Hmmm... I was slightly suspicious. I politely declined the popcorn and perused the drink list. The list looked good! My husband and I both wanted to try something different - I got the blueberry mojito and he ordered a fresh mango margarita with salt. Forever and ever later, our drinks arrived. Mine was fine. Just fine. His drink tasted like they had mashed up some frozen mango and it had thawed in his drink. It also did not come rimmed with anything. Small detail, but still... 

We ordered the guacamole trio as an appetizer. Whoa. A ton of guacamole. We probably should have asked another couple to sit with us and help us eat it. The guacamole concept, three different guacs, all a little bit different, is a great idea. Unfortunately, it tasted like pre-made guacamole that each had a little bit of something mixed in at the last minute. Totally disappointed. The chips were ok but also nothing amazing. 

Our meals were fine. Nothing exciting. My husband ordered three different tacos - he said the pork one was excellent, the other two were pretty blah. I also ordered a fish taco and it was ok. Nothing stellar. 

All in all, our entire experience took less than an hour. Our server was super nice, the bar was neat and clean and cool. But, unfortunately, the drinks, the apps, and the meal were all totally ho-hum. Such a bummer! I will try to get back in and give it another try but I certainly won't be rushing to do so.
