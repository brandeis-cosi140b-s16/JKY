Its a 24hour joint it does the job it feeds your tummy -Meh. I've experienced much better food. The place is run down it def. needs a make over. The tacos are my favorite there I give them a 4/5. other than the fish tacos i feel as though the food is bland and the salsa is waterie just a pathetic excuse for Mexican food... sad day for Mexican food in Arizona!
