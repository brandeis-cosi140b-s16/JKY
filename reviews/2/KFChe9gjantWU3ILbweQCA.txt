I have driven by this place for years and finally decided to give it a try for lunch. Wish I hadn't! Food was lousy, my taco was very greasy, the yellow grease dripped from it, I felt sick for two days afterward. They are apparently using poor grade of ground beef, full of fat. The salsa was also very poor, consisted of a thin tomato sauce, jalape√±o peppers, and tons of raw onions. Service was fine, price was ok, but there are much better choices for Mexican food around, I will not go back to this place.
