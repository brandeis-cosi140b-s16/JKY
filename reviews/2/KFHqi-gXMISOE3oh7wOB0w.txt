The word that was in my head was "meh" and that's the description of a two star.  Nothing was bad but nothing to write home about.  The servers were attentive and friendly, but they didn't really change anything from the previous Mexican restaurant.  I got my standard Chile Relleno and something fried.  Both were OK, but kind of bland.  Really just kind of a non-event.  Don't know that we'll be back with much better Mexican options nearby on Central.
