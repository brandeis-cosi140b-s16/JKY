I was so disappointed because I absolutely love Chipotle and when I went there with my sister before work, I had the usual Chicken Bowl the chicken was so burnt it was bitter, when I asked for extra sour cream and lettuce I didn't get that, but I didn't say anything because I didn't want  to be a rude picky person. But I took 2 bites and threw it away because it was so terrible.
