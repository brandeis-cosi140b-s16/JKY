The food is decent. I had the house specialty enchilada. The bloody Mary I had was good, but small. The service was terrible. Took what seemed like ages for a refill, and finally had to give our card to another waiter because our server was nowhere to be found. Other tables were having similar problems. We even saw one man and woman going to the server station and filling their own drinks! Won't be back.
