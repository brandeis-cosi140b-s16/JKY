The experience inside the restaurant was great.  Food was decent, drinks were delicious (and strong), and the service was very friendly, accommodating, and fast.  The deals for locals was really good as well.  The server was very friendly and although there were some issues with the bill, it was quickly resolved without question.

I was definitely ready to call this a regular spot, but the experience was overshadowed by the OUTSIDE experience.  Firstly, as others have mentioned, it's difficult to find.  We drove to the south entrance, and was directed where to go by the attendant.  After being honked at by the various strip club clientele, we made our way to the front of the building.  

Parking was plenty and easy to find, but it's still shared with the strip club.  That also meant a visit from a golf-cart parking lot attendant, telling us we couldn't hang around there.  We had finished our meal with friends and were chatting for about 5 minutes, had the parking lot attendant attendant give us the "you can't hang around here" response, which we responded with a "we're just talking with our friends", which then resulted in a "excuse me?  what was that?" (ie, 'are you questioning my authority?'). Fine we get it.  

We wrapping up our goodbyes, however, that was cut short as the guy came back with a cart full of a couple girls 2 minutes later and actually almost hit my friend.  I guess - what - as a warning?  Great.  I now don't want to come back to a hidden gem of a restaurant, because some parking attendant had a power trip.  Why subject yourself to low-class harassment when you could just...go somewhere else.
