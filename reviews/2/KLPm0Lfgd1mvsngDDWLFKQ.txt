I have been going to cafe rio for years, mainly in salt lake where it started. Love the food and my port burrito enchilada style with hot sauce was pretty good but the service was terrible. The young gal with the ray ban glasses thought it was more important I wipe off trays than it was to grab my food off the melter thing and ring me up. I'll come back, I just hope next time the employees treat me better and don't make it so obvious they're having a terrible day.
