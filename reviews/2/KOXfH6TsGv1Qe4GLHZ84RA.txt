Disappointed as we received good recommendations, the service was fast and friendly however the amount and quality of food received for the price was disappointing. Ordered table side guacamole $10.00 not with it! My wife and I both ordered 3 tacos for $10.00 each carne Asada tacos were bland tuff zero taste, shrimp taco and Chorizo tacos were good but 3 bites and they were gone. So $45.00 after tip I left still hungry and disappointed, my recommendation would be go to lo lo's chicken and waffles next door!
