First the positives about the place, its close to offices and the light rail stop. The restaurant and patio were clean. The staff was helpful in explaining the item on the menu. The menu had lots of choices to pick from, burritos, tacos, salads, individual items and even a daily special. The negatives, the food was just ok and the price was about $10 a person w drink for the combo i got. I wasn't impressed w the salsa and chip bar, the salsa wasn't much more like tabasco sauce. Not really my type of fast food mexican food but if your looking for something that is 1 step up from Taco Bell this might be up your alley. The wait to get your meal is pretty crazy, i'd say we waiting about 10 minutes for fast food mexican food that is just ok i'll pass next time
