I love arribas!  I love their margaritas and the hatch chiles!  I love their breakfast there.  I hate this particular location.  Everytime I go in there I get the worst service.  I had ordered a margarita and the guy poured it from a pitcher, which was fine.  I told him Id pay extra to have him free hand pour me one, and he said he didn't know how :? aren't u a bartender at a mexican restaurant?? well good thing I know how to make my own margaritas, so i told him how to make it.  Then we ordered some queso as an appetizer but that never came.  The hand made margarita was really bad so i ended up drinking water.  We waited for like 45 minutes for our food, and this whole time, the server never came back to the table.  so i have two nasty margaritas in front of me and no water.  We got our food and it was cold.  I was done.  Again, I love Arribas, but this one is Shits-ville!
