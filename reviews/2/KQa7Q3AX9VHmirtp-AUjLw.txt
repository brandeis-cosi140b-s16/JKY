While I am not willing to spend $3+ on an inauthentic street taco, I am more than happy to have someone else take me here and pay for me to eat a delicious (if inauthentic) street taco. (Let's remember, once again, I am a broke college student.)

The incredibly hip modern-American atmosphere with just a bit of kitschy beachiness to it is a wonderful nod to the decor finesse of all Upward Projects' styles.

I ordered the tortilla soup and split a quesadilla with the rest of the table as well. The quesadilla was tasty, and so was the soup (the soup was really spicy.)

I tasted my friend's rice. It was very rice-like, but lacked flavor.

Our waiter was also really slow at filling our water glasses.

I probably won't suggest going here, and will most likely contest going here if I have to pay for myself, but if someone else is paying, I'll give it another chance.

Take my review with a grain of salt: I really really like authentic taco places where you have to speak Spanish and drive south of the tracks. If you like Americanized street tacos, you'll probably like this place. Go ahead. Give it a shot.

Pro tip: Definitely give the salsa a chance. It's delicious.
