This place wont be here long. I came in two nights ago because the Yard House had a wait. It looked okay from the outside beside the 30-something girls dirty dancing on eachother. I should have taken this as a warning sign. I was eventually greeted by a bartender who was hard of hearing. For the most part he was nice/friendly and frankly I felt bad for him. There was no one at the bar but me unless you count the waitress who laid down ON THE BARTOP where i was eating to get a shot done off of her.

I ordered a salad and a soup. Both were good, although there wasnt much meat in my soup. Together they were 11.00, which isnt bad. 

This place caters to the 20-something college guy. Who in their right mind creates a place like this in a high-rent area?? The hostesses were 4's at best and were basically nude. The girls were all in bikini tops and shorts.  But whats the point of shaking you booty for no money??? I felt like they had no respect for themselves. Its one thing to be a go-go dancer, but I doubt any of those employees walks with more than 100 bucks. 

WTF PART: Me eating my meal at the bar. Midway through, a waitress lays down ON THE BARTOP maybe 3 inches away from me and a group of guys do body shots off of her. There has to be a heathcode against some chicks body/hair being that close to my food while I am eating. There were a bunch of college guys taking pics of it of course so I am sure I am on some random dudes facebook page looking at my meal grossed out.
