Dined at Havana a few times including hosting big family gathering on "salsa night". Service can be hit or miss, grandma waited an hour to get her food while everyone else got theirs. I ordered my favorites...pollo ala plancha, plantains, and a mojito. Went there to try their "$5 lunch specials...figured would take advantage of lower prices since the usual prices are a bit high for the food. Was very disappointed to see items like chicken fingers ( was this meant for kids?!) on their value menu. They could increase business by lowering their prices a bit....$16 for chicken with onions and beans is not the best deal.
