I found it kind of intimidating to walk into this restaurant. When I arrived about 8:30, the only customers were 4 men seated at the bar, all of whom turned to stare as we walked in. Music was blasting, and I was happy when the waitress asked if we'd like a seat outside - in what used to be the parking lot. There were a variety of different tables and chairs and it was dark except for Christmas lights. It was actually kind charming, and a nice option since there are very few places in Oakland to sit outside. We started with frozen lime margaritas.  If there was any alcohol, we couldn't taste it. I almost wonder if the bartender was chuckling at us since he had to know the drinks sucked. It didn't get much better from there. The complimentary chips and salsa were average but free and my husband and I  both ordered Chili Rellanos - breaded peppers stuffed with cheese and served with sauce, rice, beans, and sour cream. They too were average with very little taste.  - Not at all what you'd expect from these kind of ingredients. Price, portions, and service were all fine....
