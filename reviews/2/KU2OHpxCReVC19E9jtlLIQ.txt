I've never, ever used the word "meh," but I have to for this place.  It's really cute, decorated nicely and the waitstaff was great, if a bit slow.  Fresh homemade tortilla chips and salsa were the key to my enjoyment of the food here.  I pigged out on them!  Julia and I were in that "I'm so hungry I'm cranky" mood, so I stuffed my face with the chips forever.  Fresh baskets were brought often, as well as each of us getting our own salsa bowl.  Oh, and a complimentary bowl of guac can't hurt, either!
Then the entree came.  I was wanting ooey-gooey, cheese-smothered enchiladas.  I got the mushroom and spinach.  It came with a side of black beans and rice.  The enchiladas were made properly: the tortillas were soft-fried properly before adding the fillings.  But, not a lot of stuffing!  A few mushrooms, a few leaves of lettuce and that's pretty much it.  They were "covered" in a green sauce.  BARELY covered in green sauce.  I was disappointed, to say the least.  The rice?  Nothing fancy.  The beans?  MEH!
The only thing that saved my meal was the company (Julia and Dossty!) and the never-ending supply of chips.  
I probably won't go back.  Mariscos Playa Hermosa is right near there and I'd make that drive anyday!
