First time here. Met some family for dinner at their suggestion. The food was so, so. Chips were not authentic, homemade. Salsa tastes like it came from a jar. Drinks quality/taste was inconsistent. Server was a little clueless about customer service. Not very accommodating regarding our needs/requests. If I never darken their doorsteps again I won't miss or mourn it. I gave it two stars because we had a good time despite the not so great service. And like I said, the food was so, so. Definitely not great, but not awful.
