We tried this place in hopes of finding some decent Mexican food in the area. Again disappointed. The service was really poor, not surprising as they only had one waitress to cover the whole place. The cashier could have helped more instead of standing there watching. The place was not that busy yet it took almost an hour to get our food from the time we ordered. It's aggravating to see people come in 20 minutes after you and they finish their meal before you even begin to eat. Very poor organization. The chips and salsa were ok. The rest of the meal was disappointing. 
Probably won't be back. Trust me on this, I have been eating Mexican food for over 50 years. I would recommend Valle Luna in Chandler.
