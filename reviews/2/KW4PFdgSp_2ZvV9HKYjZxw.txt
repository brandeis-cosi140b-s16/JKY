Good, but not great.  The idea is not new, nor is it executed as well as Chipotle or Qdoba.  Both are better.  Maybe we went on an off night, but I wasn't really impressed. The people working acted like it was their first day on the job.  Maybe it was.  I thought it was OK, but my wife literally hated it.  :(
