I'm giving this two instead of one stars for the simple reason that it's a Roberto's, and if I wasn't already married, I would marry Roberto's.
This has the propensity to be the best Roberto's around because of the large dining room and view of the Strip from the beautiful, covered outdoor patio...BUT!
I'll forgive that they got our order wrong, but I can't forgive the FILTH!
Trashcans dirty and overflowing, dirty tables and drink areas, and disgusting  men's and ladies restrooms. No soap, no toilet seat covers, no paper towels. 
We were the only ones there, so they could have been knocking out SOME cleaning!
I hope I live to Yelp another day.
