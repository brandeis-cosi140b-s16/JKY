I really enjoyed their bean and dip snack because I love chips and beans :) and the beans were delicious. But although the restaurant had only two other customers they took a very long time to bring us out one plate my bf and I were going to share. 

Once we got it the food was alright at best. It was not bad but it didn't make me want to come back again. 

Mon-fri they have a to go special but you have to order 10. 10 pupusas for $.99 cents each. Otherwise they are like $1.60 each. 

Would I recommend this place? No. Not likely.
