Cuco's service deserves a zero-star rating, but some of their food redeems them to two stars (still nothing to brag about...).  My wife and I ate here shortly after they opened and were disgusted by the slow, uncaring service.  The food was alright--rather bland--but hearing "oh, I forgot" over and over from our server (when we could find her) made sure we didn't return until last night when we decided to give them another try.  Some things never change.....    The food was bland and the service was nonexistent.   We won't go back.
