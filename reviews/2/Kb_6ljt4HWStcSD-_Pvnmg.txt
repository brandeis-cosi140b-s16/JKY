A little pricey for what it is. Food wasn't bad tasting but it's the little things that get me. Serious lack of salsa for one. What they do have are in little tiny 1 ounce cups that you have to ask for, and when you do, they bring you one. Really? That's enough for maybe 2 bites. Don't skimp on the salsa!!
A bottle of Tapitio on the table, ok not bad, but how about a few other options?
I tried the empanada, there was a warning on the side: "Contents may have settled during shipping" There might have been 2 tablespoons of filling. Yes it was only 1.75 but still...
The pastor burrito was huge, but it was mostly rice and beans. The few chunks of meat I did taste was ok.
i can't forget the horrible music playing. 
It has potential but I don't think I'll be back.
