Not a fan of this particular Chipotle... This is the 2nd time I've been here within a year, and probably won't visit again for a long time.

I ordered a carnitas bowl with medium heat. There were many problems with the food itself. The carnitas meat tasted over-seasoned (I've always gotten carnitas-something so I knew it was off this time), and they totally skimped on the lettuce, giving me the few scraps from the leftovers they had instead of refilling the lettuce. Plus, as I saw the bottom of the bowl, there were a lot of juices. Not to mention the sour cream was icy cold compared to the rest of the ingredients, making it taste even funnier! :(

It just wasn't that great overall -- I'm really disappointed since I've always loved Chipotle.
