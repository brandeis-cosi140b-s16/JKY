My expectations were crushed. Phoenix needs a Tucson Tamale like place with a wide selection of fun and delcious tamales.

Alas the Steamed Tamale only offers two, A beef tamale and a corn one. Even more confusing is that by default the non meat tamale comes in a green meet sauce.

The corn Tamale it self was bland and their normal prices are not cheap. 

There are a few seats inside and a few dirty tables on the patio. Not very inviting.

This was a one time visit for me.
