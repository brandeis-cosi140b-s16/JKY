We heard that have great burritos, so we were in the area, so decided to stop.  Customer service was ok, and the burritos were a little below a 3, probably a 2.5  .  I got a green chili burrito and Megan got a carne asada burrito.  Mine was ok, a little bit overfloured.  Too much thickening, not enough meat.  Megan's carne was dry.  Would I ever stop here again, no
