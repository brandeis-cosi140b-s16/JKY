Had lunch at Los Gemelos, the one off of Odana Rd. It is located in the back of the Mexican grocery store. The menu is small, which is fine, the prices are decent. The chips and salsa were terrible, I hate to say that, but they were. The salsa comes out to you in squirt bottles, you are just supposed to squirt it all over the basket of chips I guess. The salsa is pretty spicy, I didn't care for it. I ordered a steak taco, it was edible, the ingredients seemed fresh, but it was so bland and dry, I squirted the lime on it, and put some of the salsa on it also. I also ordered the chicken quesadilla, again, bland, no flavor whatsoever, greasy fried corn breading fill with flavorless chicken, boring cheese and lettuce. My husband ordered the chili relleno plate with rice & beans, it also came out with some corn tortillas, he wasn't very impressed, he said the same thing, it was just bland. I think we will stick to Taqueria Guadalajara on Park St. I wanted to love this place, darn it.
