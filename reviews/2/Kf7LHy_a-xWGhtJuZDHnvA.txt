Came here yesterday for dinner. We got there around 5:20 and were told it was a 20 minute wait to sit on the patio. There were several empty tables but I assumed they had a wait because there were not enough servers. After 20 minutes we were seated at one of the tables that was empty the entire time we waited. Once we were seated we continued to wait about 5 minutes to be greeted by our server. We almost got up and left but for some reason decided to stick it out. The food was good- we had the table side guacamole, chicken avocado sandwich and enchiladas. The red sangria and margarita were also good but it took 20 minutes to get them. Overall just slow service and I couldn't really figure out why as they weren't that busy. I hadn't been here in several years and do not think I will be back anytime soon.
