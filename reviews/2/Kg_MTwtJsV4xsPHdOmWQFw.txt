Not sure if it was an off night but my 2 beef taco plate was subpar. The tacos were on the skinnier side than what I've had at other locations, the rice had chunks as if scraped from the bottom of the pot, and everything was super salty, more so than usual. Will try Faustos across the street next time for my Mexican food craving.
