Meat was definitely not carne asade (as advertised) but instead pot roast. I know this is a predominantly white area, but lying to customers about the type of meat being served doesn't seem right.

I expected them to have a sauce bar (like most Mexican restaurants do) so that's a big disappointment. However I cannot complain about the price, it was extremely affordable in comparison to other Mexican establishments. 

Note to future customers: their idea of an enchilada is a taco with green sauce on it-- not an enchilada, enchilada.
