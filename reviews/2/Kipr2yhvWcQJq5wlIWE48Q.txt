I can't think of any good reason my family would like this place except that it's in Glendale and that's where most of them live. Maybe also because the waitress' call everyone mija or mijo. That's cute. Siiiiiiiiiiyke!

The food is always just mediocre. If I want mediocre I will go to Denny's and pay less. Or cook at home and have a way better meal. I am not a fan of the Mexican breakfast anyway. I can make just as good if not better chorizo and eggs at home. The menudo is meh... The everything else is just meh... I don't know what to say besides meh...

Eat here at your own risk. I don't think you will get sick or anything... but I don't like spending my hard earned dollahs on crap. 

Don't know about you...
