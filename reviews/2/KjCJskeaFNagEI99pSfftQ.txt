My biggest gripe here is the service. They need to get it together regardless of whether they're having a bad day or not. Literally everyone working walked around without a smile on their face. I'm not expecting a welcome choir when I come in, but at least look like you wanna do your job.
Our server was Debbie, I joined my party late and had to wait five minutes before leaving my table and going to the counter to get a menu. And then I waited another three minutes at the counter while two employees looked at me and kept moving. I stopped someone and asked if I place my order there or if my server does it for me, and as if my question inconvenienced him, he said my server would do it.
Then Debbie comes to the table and without saying "hi, welcome to Nacho Daddy" or "hey, how's it going" or even "hi", she says "what can I get for you?" She REALLY made me wanna pay 15 dollars for two tacos.
She brought me water but didn't bring me a place setting. It'd be one thing if it was busy, but she had two other tables.
And then when we asked someone else for the check, because 4 out of the 6 people had been done with their food for a while, the guy said, in a hurried tone, "she's gonna get it, she's doing something right now."
Even if Debbie was legitimately busy, there still wouldn't be an excuse for the wait time of things & her attitude on top of that added to the not-so-great experience.

I don't know how my group was acting before I showed up, but even if they were some what of a hassle because they took too long to order, or couldn't decide or were constantly talking over each other, you're still in the service industry and your job is to put up with it and you deal with it every day, so buck up and deal with it. We all do things we don't wanna do.
