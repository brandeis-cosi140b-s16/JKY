So I went here late last night (midnight-ish) to grab a quick meal before I headed home. Usually around this hour, I'm in and out of the drive thru in about 5 minutes.

I waited 20 minutes (20 full minutes!) in the drive thru. Keep in mind, this is a Tuesday night and there were only 3 cars ahead of me. It's not like there was a line of cars around the block. 

When I FINALLY got up to the window, I received no apology, no explanation for the wait, no flustered cashier. What I got was the familiar blank stare of a fast food employee with zero fucks left to give. 

Am I shocked? No. Will I be back because I'm lazy and addicted to their bastardized version of Mexican fare?

Yes.
