I came to check this place out because it had four stars on yelp and my boyfriend and I were in the mood for Mexican food. I ordered the green chili plate and my boyfriend got the carne asada burrito and we shared the menudo. I was expecting the food taste more authentic but when we got our food, it was bland and not very tasteful. We felt like we could have just gone to Filerberto and got better food. The only thing good about this place was our food came out fast and the person who took our order was nice. Other then that, I will not be coming back to eat here. We left very unsatisfied!
