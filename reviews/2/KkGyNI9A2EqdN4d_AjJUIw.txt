Beware that the rating on the wall is 90.  I went for lunch with a friend as the $5.99 lunch specials were from 11am - 3pm.  Warning, the place is not fresh looking, the floor was grimy and I sat on a damaged torn seat.  The waitresses swept with a whisk broom while people were eating.  The waitresses were on their best behavior since the owner was cleaning the AC filter.  My friend's drink glass was dirty and had some sort of white coating smear.  The food was ok (nothing to write home about) was warm (not hot) and had to return it for nuking...  I was charged the regular price and just paid as I will not patronize any longer.  I was referred to Moraz√°n and also Loco Lime (now closed for business) and will continue seeking the best authentic Mexican restaurant on Central Ave.
