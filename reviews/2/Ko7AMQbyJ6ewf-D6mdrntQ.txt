I wish I could have liked this place more when I went, but this just wasn't that great of Mexican food in my opinion.  The plus side was the extremely friendly waiter and good, quick service; the fresh-made guacamole was flavored just right too.  However, when our main dishes came out, it started going downhill.  One of our orders was overcooked the first time around, but they were really good about it and got it sorted out.  I got a combo platter, and the beans and rice didn't offer much in the taste department.  As another reviewer said, it almost tasted like they came straight from a can.  The meal overall seemed like it relied and overdid it with cheese.  Despite this, I want to give this place the benefit of the doubt though, and I would give it another go.  It's got good reviews long-term for a reason, and maybe the dish I ordered just wasn't for me.
