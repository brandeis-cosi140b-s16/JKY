I'm a chips and salsa fanatic and never forget when I've had great chips and salsa. I also never forget when I've had bizarre chips and salsa. The salsa here has a very strange taste to it, unlike any other salsa I've had. They have this super hot almost tabasco style salsa as well, which is disgusting, but I'm talking about this main large bowl of traditional salsa they bring you. It is bearable, but that's it. The taste immediately always leaves me asking myself, "Why did I come back here?" Then I remember, the prices.

Everything is reasonably priced for a drunk college student who doesn't care about the cold food they're about to be served. Basically, everything on the plate will be cold except for the main entree, which happened to me multiple times. 

The customer service given by the ladies there is always great, and the comedian / cook in the back can be pretty funny over the intercom system. Those aspects may have been five-star but overall, not enough to make up for the lousy tasting food.

Great service, good drinks, poor food.
