I heard so many good things about this place......but I was just not impressed.  On a friday night, it's a long wait....I'm talking an hour.

The food was just ok.  It was not special.  There were four of us and we shared a little of everything.  3 out of 4 agreed that it was below average.

Maybe we ordered the wrong thing.....but I did not like it.
