I was very disappointed with this place after reading all of the reviews. The fist thing was that the floors were greasy and slippery. We had to hold on to the chairs so we didn't fall. The staff there didn't seem to mind the slickness. The second thing was the food was over cooked and mine was burnt. The service was good, The margaritas were also good. But I will never return there.
