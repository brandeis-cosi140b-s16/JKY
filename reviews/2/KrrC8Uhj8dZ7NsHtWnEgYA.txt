I've been going to Cafe Rio for over 15 years. Since moving to Arizona from Cali we were pretty excited to be close to the  one on Baseline which is about 15-20 min from where we live but that made no difference because we loved Cafe Rio in the past. That location was average, always out of ice and always trying to rush you through the line. The food pretty good which kept us going back.
When the San Tan location opened we were pretty excited because of its proximity. In the last year we've probably been 10-15 times to Baseline and this location 4 times. The other night we went and they were super chinsy on the meat we ordered 5 meals and each meal hardly had meat. Feels like Cafe Rio has gone down hill since franchising which is to be expected, but the prices continue to get higher. Get your act together Cafe Rio.
