I ordered a carne asada burrito and a beef taco here around 3pm on a weekday. The beef taco was pretty good, the cheese was fresh and the lettuce tasted clean. 

However, the carne asada burrito was not good, I tried covering it up with salsa,  still not good. The steak was burnt looking, maybe it had been sitting for awhile. I don't recommend the steak for anything.

The new breakfast burrito is tasty as long as they do not burn the eggs. This place is hit or miss.
