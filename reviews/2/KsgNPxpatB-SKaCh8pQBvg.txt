NEVER AGAIN!! Our group of thirteen; two five, one seven, one 11, well behaved! Two star food, 2  1/2  star service. Food $160.71 tax $13.33 = $174.04 AND $29.00 (18%) tip, yikes! = $203.00. If the food and service is 4, 5, star, 18% is cheap. The worst thing, this dump was my idea, every one else wanted to go to Olive Garden. Never got a bad meal there. If you don't see anyone coming through the door, it'll be me.
