I've eaten at R & T's always hoping that the something on the menu would have flavor, but I've been disappointed each time.  The ambience is charming in an old-Mexico sort of way, but the food is very bland.  Once I found Tony's Cafe (about 1/4 mile east of R & T's), I was in Mexican food heaven!  Tony's has much, much better food.
