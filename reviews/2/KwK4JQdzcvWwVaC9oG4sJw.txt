A year or more ago before Embassy Suites took over this restaurant, I would have given it five stars. Past few times I have been here, the wait svc and the kitchen have been extremely slow. Soup came out lukewarm but I did not send it back because I had waited about 30 mins for.it. Bean dip is not as delicious as it used to be, salsa is good but not consistent, fries were cooked in grease that tasted like it needs to be changed. It has changed to a place that's in a hotel, run by a hotel that expects a captive audience. It's a shame... As this place used to be the best kept secret in Tempe.
