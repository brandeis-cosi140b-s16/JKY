So we had our first, and last experience at Pancho's today. Decor gets 5 stars but the food is not good, bland on top of bland with an extra side of bland. Nothing we ate was good, service was nothing special, and the food is EXPENSIVE for what you get. I guess they figure they can price gouge you because its in downtown Summerlin.

The carnitas were tough, flavorless, and did not appear to be fresh. The carnitas burrito is $17.95, came topped with cold Chile queso sauce (bland) and not a side of rice and beans in sight. For 18 dollars.... Really? The side of guacamole was 8.95. For a modest scoop of once again, flavorless guacamole. I mean, there isn't an authentic thing about this place, the plates are garnished with parsley for goodness sakes. Where's the cilantro? The limes? The flavor?!?!?!

We paid our $71 tab (no alcohol) (for two people and a toddler) and walked out quietly. The first thing we said to each other when we got to the car was, "never again." Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, nope you won't fool me twice.

If you are looking for decent Mexican in the area try viva mercados on sahara and ft. Apache, or even better, casa don Juan on buffalo and lake Mead, or Frank and finas cocina on flamingo and grand canyon..
