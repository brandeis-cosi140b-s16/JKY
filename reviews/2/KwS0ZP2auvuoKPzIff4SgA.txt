I've eaten before, but tonight was just a social mixer. Let's start off with the obvious; Food...like the 2 stars headed "Meh. I've experienced better"  I feel like they try to wow you with the portions and the extra side of garnish with your burrito or what they call a burrito...  Really!? How about giving me something that taste good!  Service - no complaints, time and time again Maria Maria has showed me some Love Love.  The place is pretty swanky, low lights and nice decors of Santana's cover artwork.  Live music on Friday & Saturday nights, but you best hope it's not some rock band cause the place can get loud - wha? - yes LOUD!
