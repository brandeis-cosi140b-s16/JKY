The empty bar should have been the first clue to the mediocrity that is Cabo Wabo.

The food was ehhh ("tostada" was more a pile of oversauced food on a nacho)... The service was ehhh... The music was slightly too loud... And the karaoke (which consisted of two creepy, old male singers and no crowd) was pretty awful.  Quite saddening.
