I normally don't give bad reviews because I like to give the benefit of a doubt. But in this case is different and here's why: the food and price was good. Not great but good. I came to eat with my wife and it took them 45 minutes to give us a table having two tables open. When finally I pointed out to the server he said oh yeah you can sit here. So I'm thinking why in the hell would you make me wait for 30 minutes when you have two tables empty?!!! Anyways he came  and took our drink order and it took him 12 minutes to come back with our drinks then by the time we got our food we ask for a refill and it took him another 10 minutes to get it. By then we had already done eating.  They need more servers or some people that really can get this restaurant off the ground. Bad service in my opinion so that's what I'm giving it two stars.
