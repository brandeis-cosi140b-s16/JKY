Was a little disappointed by the quality of the food here. It was recommended by a friend who has been to other locations.  I just felt like the quality was mediocre and would be able to cook it myself. I ordered the carne asada tacos. The tortillas were pretty dry and the rice seemed like it was just a place holder to make the plate look fuller.
