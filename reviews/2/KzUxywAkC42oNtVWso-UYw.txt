I was SO excited about this location opening up so close to where I live, as I practically grew up on Chipotle (starting back in 2000 in San Diego). My first opportunity, I made an order online and picked-up on my way to class. However, I was a little let down.

First, my online order was not ready at the designated time, despite it not being busy. Someone just dropped the ball. Oh well, slightly annoying, but forgivable as there was no one else in line and I could oversee the construction of my bowl.

The fajita mix (peppers and onions) looked a little old and over-cooked. It happens sometimes and I figured that I just got there after a lull. No biggie. 

When it came time to leave, there was confusion about how to use the system, as it was a pre-paid online order. It took about a minute to clear up, but was thinking that for a brand-new location the staff should be better trained. Still, I calmed myself and ran through my imaginative happy place where Chipotle guacamole runs in rivers and their salty-lemony chips grow on trees.

However, the the final let down arrived when I started eating the barbacoa bowl. The barbacoa was rather dry and clumped together--immune to even repeated stabbings and twistings with a fork. Nothing could de-tangle it. I had to eat it more like meat on a stick style, which was actually a  little bit of a turn off and made for a unsatisfied Chipotle experience.

Put together, I was let down. I was expecting more for a brand new location. Perhaps the staff needs more time to get into the groove of things and maybe Chipotle should step up their training program a bit too.

I'll be back again soon to see how things have progressed, but please don't let me down again! My heart (and stomach) just couldn't handle it.
