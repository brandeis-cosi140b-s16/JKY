So lets just be clear here, I love Hole in the wall joints. Particularly Mexican hole in the wall joints. While I wouldn't actually categorize this place as hole in the wall, I noticed some of the reviews seemed concerned about that. I wouldn't be. This is like going to El Pollo Loco or Taco Bell. During my stay in Scottsdale I went twice. Once for breakfast, and once for Lunch. 

Breakfast was absolutely delicious, with one small exception. I had a Bacon burrito with rice added (I highly recommend adding rice to breakfast burritos! its good). It was well wrapped, not too messy, plenty huge, and easy to eat in the car. The one complaint I had was the cheese. It was this bright neon orange gelatinous stuff. It just tasted oily and not very good. 

I also had the Super Nachos or Nachos supreme or whatever its called. Same problem, the cheese was just too greasy and oily. It didn't have much flavor. On the plus side, they pile on the sour cream, guacamole, and meat. It would have been nice to have some beans on the nachos too though.

I would go back for a Breakfast burrito (sans the cheese), but thats about it.
