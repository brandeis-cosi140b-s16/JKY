Mmmm Good (and I'm not talking soup)

My first time to Rubio's was awesome.  The girl at the counter was very helpful and knowledgable. She gave some great suggestions and boy were they ever right.  I LOVED the Tilapia fish taco.  Somehow before I tried it the words 'fish' and 'taco' just never seemed to go together.  Now that I've had it, I'm still not sure. 
Thanks for a great experience.  I may try some more at another time.
