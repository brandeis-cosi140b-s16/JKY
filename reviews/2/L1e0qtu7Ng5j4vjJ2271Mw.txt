Sometimes you're better off with a happy memory of something than the reality of how things are in the present. I haven't been in Madison for a while, but remember how much I liked the food and service when I was a starving student and they were pretty much the only place on State Street that wasn't serving Gyros, Burgers, or Pizza. 

Our party arrived around 7PM, midweek. It wasn't crowded- there were maybe three other people in the restaurant. It took ten minutes or so for anyone to greet us. When we were seated, our tables hadn't been bussed and we had to ask for someone to clean them and bring us some menus. Things picked up when we finally got a waitress to notice us. The food arrived fairly quickly- I had a combo platter of soft tacos, with mole on the side. The tortillas and fixings were good for the most part, but the beans and rice were dried up to the extent where I wondered if it had ever been cooked completely, or just sat out somewhere for a few days. After getting our food, the waitstaff vanished. No water, no follow-up, no nothing. We actually had to look around for someone to give us our bill. Well, someone else's bill. We did get things straightened out, but sheese, how can you not want to get paid what you're owed?

I probably won't ever come back again if they're somehow still in business next time I'm in the area. All in all, a very disappointing visit.
