We were so disappointed when we went to Isabella's last week (3/4/15). We'd heard and read about it and so were looking forward to our visit. Not the case. Food cold and very mediocre!!  And not inexpensive either. The young busboy was the only bright spot of the evening. We won't be back. It was NOT good at all.
