When Mejico opened I was very happy to have another nice restaurant in the area.  My friend and I were able to finally get in a try the food.  We went on a week night so it was not very busy.  There were two other tables that had people eating.  We sat right down and looked at the menus.  It took about 10 minutes for our waiter to actually get to us which is a long time considering it was not busy.  We placed our order and got our food in a reasonable time.  The food was really underwhelming.  The flavor was just ok.  The price was terribly high for the amount of food and the taste.  There was nothing that made this food stand apart from anywhere else.  I got the enchiladas and they were around $15.  I could have gotten the exact same meal at about 10 other places in the area for about $7. I asked for sour cream because the food wasn't very flavorful.  They didn't have any???? The waiter brought out some kind of salad dressing?  Not quite sure what it was.  As for the service, our waiter was friendly but really did not take very good care of us.  We waited for everything.  Water, service...everything. All the while we could here him talking up a storm around the corner from the bar.  Our entire experience was just not good.  It is a real shame because it is very cute on the inside and inviting. I was really hoping for much more.  Disappointing.
