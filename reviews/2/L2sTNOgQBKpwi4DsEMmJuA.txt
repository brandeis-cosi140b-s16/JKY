Took my mother here for mothers day. It was very busy and we did not have a reservation but they did accomodate us and sat us at a table on the patio. We ordered our food and the waitress came out with cinnamon crisp chips and honey butter dip. It was amazing. I ordered the chicken fried chicken and gravy, it was supposed to come with green chili but the only green chili was in the mashed potato. The chicken was dry and there was very little gravy. My mother ordered the breakfast tacos. They had bacon egg and cheese in them. The eggs were dry and not fluffy overall very bland and they did not come with salsa, i asked the waitress to bring some and she did accomodate. My girlfriend had the juevos rancheros she indicated that they were very bland as well.
