i had such high hopes for Tacos El Gordo and i left extremely underwhelmed after my recent late night/early morning meal here :( with such high ratings and raves from friends, i knew that when we were at encore for nighttime festivities that a stop at tacos el gordo was a must! its a short walk from the encore and the strip mall is so brightly lit that you wont miss the place haha. came around 130ish and it was already packed with people! i wasnt feeling too adventurous so i didnt want to try any of the 'crazy' stuff like tongue haha...so i went with one of my all-time fave dishes - carne asada fries ($10)! these fries just didnt live up to the hype and i've definitely had better in OC and SD :( the carne asada tasted bland and the guacamole didnt seem fresh like it just came out of a package. i tried a bite of my friend's adobada taco and did enjoy that better since the spicy pork had more flavor. overall though i just left here disappointed...maybe i should give it another try when im drunker haha
