Its located inside Boca Park which is convenient (shopping at Target can really work up an appetite) I brought my 7 year old here on a lunch date and I was pretty disappointed. The food is kind of just thrown on the plate and covered in tomatoes. My daughter even said she didn't like it and she loves Mexican food and tomatoes. The cashier was nice but the manager seems to need an attitude adjustment. For a salad and kids meal 14 bucks seems pretty steep considering its not that great. The only plus is shaded out door seating that my dog seems to enjoy. I wont be wasting my money here again and I suggest you don't either.
