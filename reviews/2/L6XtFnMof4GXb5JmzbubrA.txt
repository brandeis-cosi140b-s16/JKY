As a local, I should be mindful of the other reviews...but I was in a "people watching" mood and knew this was a great location.

True, the prices are a bit more than what we locals would normally pay for food of this portion.  Food quality was great, especially assemble-yourself fish tacos, and the sangria's made the evening even more enjoyable....but the "ding" I have to give is on their service.

Nothing more can ruin a great experience if the service is horrible.  My memorable evening began the moment we sat down...the water server immediately came and poured water, but it was nearly 10 minutes before a server appeared and took our order.  Having to wait that long, we thought it was wise to order appetizers and dinner....with the words to the waiter "please do not bring the main course until  we've finished our chips and guacamole." Sure enough, appetizers came (guac but no chips until after we said something) and the moment we put a chip in our mouths....here comes a server with our main course.

I told the server to take it back as we just got our appetizers.  I then finally flagged down our waiter to let him know what happened, to which he replied, "I don't handle your table any more...they moved me..." and he walks away.  Incredible.  Great Customer Service, huh?!?

Moments later a young female waitress stopped by and asked if there was a problem and why we sent the meal back.  I told her what we experienced and requested fresh food (not our previous dishes that probably went back under a heat lamp) be served after we've finished with our appetizers.

Granted the floor manager stopped by to apologize and comped the guacamole, we just felt rushed.

Also, be prepared to talk loud as the steady "thump, thump, thump" of their music system will drown out any normal conversation.

Overall, the food and drinks were pricey but ok...just wish the hospitality factor was a little better.
