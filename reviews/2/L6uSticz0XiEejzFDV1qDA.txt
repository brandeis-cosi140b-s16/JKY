I wish there was a 2.5 stars, I don't want to give them a bad or a good rating. First, small parking lot, 2 entrances in the back, one in the front. Cool art on the out side walls.

Found an entrance, walked in and was greeted by no one. Saw several waitresses hustling about. Finally one saw me standing there and pointed across the room saying there are tables over there.

I found a long table, which all there was and sat down..... Just me. Few minutes I was finally noticed and offered a menu. As I was perusing the menu, the couple behind me got their meal. The female quickly sent hers back as there was something wrong with the taco. 

The two ladies behind me were upset because they now charge for the chips and salsa. Ummm... Okay, that's why I came here. Mexican restaurant no longer giving complimentary chips and salsa?

These two tables got to talking. The couple had a different experience the other night. He thought the morning and night cooks were trained differently. Morning was given smaller portions. The two ladies were patrons of this place for years and apparently something changed within the last month. 

With all that said, I decided to just walk out. Didn't even bother ordering.
