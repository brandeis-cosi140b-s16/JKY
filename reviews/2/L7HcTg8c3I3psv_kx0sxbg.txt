Definitley not one of the best restaurants I've been too. I wasn't very impressed with the menu and was frustrated that they advertised baja food when it wasn't really baja.  A lot of the dishes also have fruit in them and I'm honestly not a fan of strawberries in my mexican food. Valle de Luna or Zocalo are the best mexican restaurants in town. The only thing good about Tia Rosa was the tequila.
