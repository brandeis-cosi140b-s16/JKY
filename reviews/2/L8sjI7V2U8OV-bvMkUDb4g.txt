The only reason I go to this place is because it's across the street from the hotel I stay at when I'm in town. Normally the service is ok, but today was different. Waited 5+ minutes for somebody to finally come out of the back and take my order. When he did it really didn't seem like he was paying attention. Maybe it was the cigarette tucked behind his ear. I walk back to my room and nothing on my order was correct. I went back and returned it and asked for my money back. Guess I won't be supporting this business during my future trips!
