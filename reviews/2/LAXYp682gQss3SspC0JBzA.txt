I have been to the Nacho Daddy in Hendersen and had a pleasant experience, so I was excited that a Nacho Daddy opened on my side of town. 

Chips and salsa was good, but the experience ends there. My husband wanted a combo plate, but the menu was lacking in traditional combo plates like you see at most Mexican food joints. He decided to order off the a la carte menu, but it didn't come with all the sides or fideo soup like other restaurants do. I ordered the chicken fajitas which were bland and nothing memorable.

The service was extremely slow and we were asking other servers for help when we could not find ours. While their nachos look interesting, I probably won't be back. At lease at this location.
