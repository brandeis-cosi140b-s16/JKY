I am always on the look out for great Mexican food.  This my yelp friends was not great Mexican food.  The bill was 176 dollars before tip.  I have money and don't mind paying for good food, but this was not worth it.  The steaks my parents had were burnt and the crab enchiladas I had were mediocre at best.  Paying for chips and salsa is ridiculous at a place like this.....  I do not recommend!  Food is up charged and not worth the skyscraper costs.  

The only reason I gave them two stars is the habanero dipping sauce was good.  It's hard to make something with like that and have great flavor.  That is all!
