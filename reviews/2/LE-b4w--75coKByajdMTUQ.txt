I like the breakfast potato and egg burrito, buts that's about it. We have been here a couple of times but have not been impressed. The huevos rancheros are a joke, the tortilla is supposed to be fried like a tostada, it's not supposed to be a plain tortilla.  The burrito de cabeza were so darned greasy that they made my husband sick, the grease would drip from it. The chile rellenos Are ridiculously expensive as well as the rest of the menu. Do yourself a favor and head down to the filibertos in front of Tolleson highschool for food that is half the price and twice the flavor and quality
