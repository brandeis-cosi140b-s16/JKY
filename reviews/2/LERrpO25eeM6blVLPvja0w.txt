Better than the one down Sahara, but this location is horrible. Or at least don't show up at night. My whole night got ruined because I came here. Right now I'm pissed because of the stupid ass ghetto people around this area. They ruin the fucking mood when you walk into a Mexican taco place. They just come in and bother everyone and scream and shout. Shit man... If I ever come back I am getting it to go. Fuck this place and fuck all the other Tacos Mexico I am going somewhere else. Oh yeah for the record the Carne asada was kinda burnt. The lengua was good. The rick was dry but the frijoles were real good.
