I went in with high hopes...I love authentic mexican food! I saw some good yelp reviews, and live near by.....
Not at all what I was hoping for......
I had the grilled chicken taco salad..... ugh....... quality was just not there! Worst Grilled chicken ever!
My husband had the carne asada burrito.... he thought the same.... ugh.... quality was not there.....
Their chips and salsa was the only reason for the two stars, fresh, tasty, really good.
The rest of the food was not good at all.
Ingredients are not fresh or prepared fresh.
I get that they are family owned and operated...... but this is not quality authentic mexican food.
