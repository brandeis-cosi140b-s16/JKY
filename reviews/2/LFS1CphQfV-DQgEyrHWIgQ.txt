Good chips, decent service.  Overall the food wasn't very good except for a little pile of sweet corn tamale mash that should be highlighted rather than underplayed....as it was the best thing there!  Well, the steak fajita nachos were ok too.  They didn't mind kids being a little rowdy and the tortilla machine was cute.  I'll come back with kids.  But only if I can have a margarita next time.
