The tastiness is on par with the Chipotle across the street, but the quality of ingredients seemed dubious to me. The ingredients seemed like they had been sitting out for a while as opposed to the other Tex-Mex and Mexican places in the area. (I suspect this is a result of having a lower customer flow). 

I was also suspicious of the quality of meat. The meat was sitting in plastic bags which leads me to believe that they were prepackaged; to say the least, it wasn't the most appetizing presentation.

Lastly, one of the employees made us feel uncomfortable with inappropriate remarks. The management needs to make sure that employees are behaving professionally.
