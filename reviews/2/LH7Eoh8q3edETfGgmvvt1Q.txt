I Have visited this location about four times now, each with a different set of employees I hadn't seen the time before. Food is always good but service is questionable. Two times I tried to visit this location they weren't supposed to be closed for another 30 minutes according to the sign but the doors we locked and they waived me off.  The times I have been able to beat their inconsistent closing they looked like they didn't want me there very much because of the upcoming closing times. Wont visit anymore
