Heard rave reviews about this place so when in the area with two friends who were familiar, we decided to eat there.  "Meh" is a good description.  Expensive for what you get.  Slow.  And simply nothing special about the food.  They enjoyed their lunches but I think I could have given them peanut butter and jelly on rye and they'd have enjoyed it just as much.  There's plenty better out there.
