I am so sad !!!
we have being loyal customers of this place almost 2 years, we knew that the owner was kinda  sarcastic and a clown mix , but we never had a bad experience until today.we invited our family that are  visiting from California to have the best Raspado  there is around us!! We spend almost $40 and when my sis in law wanted to use the restroom they said was out of order.
which is a lie , because my nephew went to use  it  5 minutes before .
when we asked they acted like we asked for their kidney Rude and unpleasant!! The city of Avondale require for the food industry to have a restroom ,when your place has tables and chairs on the premises , there for you LIARS remove your tables and chairs and continue selling your product but one thing you want you to know ,,, you losing your customers because you are so arrogant !! You are in Us not in  México bad versión of Rigo Tovar !!! So go back to México And treat your people  like shhh&$&&; but not Us!! we Work hard  for our money and we go to spend our $$ in your place!!!
