Seems to be a typical Burrito, Chimichanga, Tostada type Mexican Food Restaurant, however, I did notice some new additions so it seems like they're trying to keep up with what else is available.  Not a lot of authentic or unique types of Mexican restaurants around North Scottsdale.  This time I opted for their Fish Taco's with Hawaiin Ono... should have known better, it tasted very much like the Chimichanga's and Tostada's and Taco's.
