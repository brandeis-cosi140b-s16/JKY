A horrible little place where one can eat flavorless quasi Mexican food and be baked by the evening sun blasting through the windows.

Staff hangs around their station most likely excusing themselves when a new customer is seated or if they have to serve food.  Their conversations take precedence over anything else.

If you have no taste buds and don't mind casually going through-the-motions service...this is for you.
