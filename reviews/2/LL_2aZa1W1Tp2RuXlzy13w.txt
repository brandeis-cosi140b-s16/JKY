I really wanted to love this place, especially as they offered such a nice deal (BOGO) for teachers recently. But I didn't, and it had nothing to do with the service as other reviewers have mentioned. We did have to wait in line for about 45 minutes, but I know it was because of the teacher promotion, and I was happy to wait my turn. The portions are, indeed, massive - but the food was only so-so. 

I was stoked that they had organic, hormone free chicken -- but was bummed that they were 'out' of it (and according to a friend, had been out of it for at least a month... due to a supply shortage?). Regardless, I ordered a double wrapped pork burrito and a chicken bowl. The chicken was really disgusting - super chewy, poorly cooked thighs, and the pork was slightly better but just tasted a little 'off'. The rice was slightly greasy,  and while the other toppings were ok, I went there for the meat, and having that be bad in both of my meals (I ordered one for the next day but tried them both that evening while they were fresh) just was a bit of a buzzkill. The place is also fairly pricey for a casual take out joint. 

I doubt I'll go there again, but if I do for some reason, I'll try the vegetarian option and update this review accordingly.
