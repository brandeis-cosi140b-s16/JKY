food was lacking, not only was there not much of it but it lacked flavor. the server. was rude and charged us 99 cents for half and shot glass of cheese and the meals were ridiculously over priced. we came to this restaurant because the chain Mexican restaurant in our area closed and it was in the area. the bathrooms were not well kept and the sinks were broken. chain Mexican restaurants are usually a gamble but save yourself the trip and make tacos at home for a fraction of the time and cost.
