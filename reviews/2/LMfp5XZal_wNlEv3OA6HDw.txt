Used to eat here all the time but the last couple times they have been horrible. food tasted old and chips are not fresh anymore. maybe they changed cooksi dont know but they are not the same Manny's with awesome food and reasonably price. :( 
Ive left a great review in the past and not my stomach churns every time we pas by this place :(
