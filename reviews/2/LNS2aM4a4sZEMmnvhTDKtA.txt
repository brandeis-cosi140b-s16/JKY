I go to this Taco Bell/KFC because it's close to home...and that's the ONLY reason!

The staff can be rude at times and doesn't give much thought to customer service. The employees are unaware of what actually comes in combos and will give misinformation. When eating here I always go inside to order so that I can ask  what food is fresh, that'll determine what I order.

I gave them two starts because the restaurant is clean and they've got a high sanitation rating.
