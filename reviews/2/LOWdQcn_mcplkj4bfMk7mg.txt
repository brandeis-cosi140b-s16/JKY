Overpriced for little flavor. Tacos are small and cost about $3.50-$4 each PLUS they're really not that flavorful. You need to eat about 3 to call it a meal. This place looks cool but I would recommend going to an actual Mexican place to get your tacos. It is severely over priced and the wait is very long compared to any other taqueria or Mexican restaurant I've went to.
