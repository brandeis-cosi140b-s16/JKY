Typical airport bar but sitting at the bar has left me a bit nauseous. Lots of smells fill the air including bleach, old beer, and tequilla.  The cupboards are worn out and falling off the hinges.

Bar tenders are fast which is nice if you have a plane to catch but for long lay-over folks, feels like you're being forced to choke down your beer to free up a space for the next customer.

Didn't try the food so no idea how that is but based on the smells, you'll want to try another place. Barbacoa quesadilla looked good based on the guy next to me but I couldn't bare the thought of trying one for myself.

My one positive comment is that the beers are cold and the margaritas are the best bang for your buck.  Go here if you want a fast beer before a flight but not if you want a relaxing chill spot to kill time.
