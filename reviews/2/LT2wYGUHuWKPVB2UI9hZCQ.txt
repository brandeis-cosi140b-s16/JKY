Comalapa tries for every south of the border flavor in our hemisphere - they have a huuuuge menu - but for us, nothing stood out. At all. Like eating shadows of the favorites we ordered, things were pretty blah.

Papusas - eh - mild in corn and cheese flavors, a little tough. Got the "cheese and veggie" ones, they came with some interesting orange slaw I'd never seen that had an odd black pepper thing happening. Most interesting part of the meal.

Rancheros - skip - chopped peppers, bland tomato sauce.

Rice - something chinese-fried about it. Unexpected and unwelcome.

Salsa, chips - watery, bland and fried waaay earlier, consecutively (to be fair, we hit them 10 minutes after they opened). 

Our waitress was sweet, and brought me some hot salsa. Not bad. All garlic. Owner guy greeted us loudly and enthusiastically, but if the food's meh...

I'd estimate 90 percent of the menu is meat, and I hope that's where they excel, because for veggies, this ain't a stop to make.
