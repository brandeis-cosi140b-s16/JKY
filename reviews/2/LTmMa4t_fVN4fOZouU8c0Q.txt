Everytime I go here, there is something wrong. Once, (about 25 mins before closing) they were out of chips, brown rice and cheese. They would not put out anymore even though several customers were in line. The next time I went, the rice was very hard and undercooked. I went again a couple days ago and they were out of 2 of the 3 kinds of Tabasco sauces.
