Absolute pot head that dealt with us at the window.  He was so stoned he couldn't even figure out how to swipe my card and was laughing hysterically at himself.  While my 4 children uttered "What is the skunky smell Dad?" as his odor emanated out of the drive-thru window.  Mind you this was 10 am.  Suffice it to say, our smoothies were as advertised despite this.
