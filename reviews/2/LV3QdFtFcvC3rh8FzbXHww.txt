The first thing I saw when I walked in was a huge, vaguely creepy statue and I noticed that the whole place smelled like bacon and old person.  I chose to eat outside.  The waiter, who was very nice and attentive, asked if I would like the queso with my chips and, like an idiot I said yes.  I got charged $5 for what was basically a dish of sticky Velveeta.  The beans also tasted of bacon and the chicken in the enchilada was very salty.  The quacamole and the rice were quite good.  If you want mexican food, La Hacienda or El Dorado Grill are much better options.
