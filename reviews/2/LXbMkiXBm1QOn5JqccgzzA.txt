I was not that impressed.  Went here for dinner a few months ago; the place was dead but was very loud due to the TV.  Service was good however, and the waiter was friendly when he wasn't sitting around watching TV.  

The food was fine, but as other posters have said tasted like cheap ingredients.  It's along the lines of "authentic" cheap Mexican food, however, and it wasn't all that cheap.  I've worked in various places in Mexico for over 6 months, and the food here costs $3 or less in Mexico.  

They do supposedly have tacos al pastor, but I have not yet tried them; I am assuming they're nothing at all like Mexico pastor, but I'm willing to go back and try it out.
