We arrived about 4:30pm, just before the dinner rush.  Not too many people at the time so we figured it would be great.  Well...with less customers to serve comes less attention to the customers there.  Sat in the back for about 10 minutes and had to remind them that they seated us.  Not once were we asked if we wanted refills on drinks or water, and I think the server finally realized we were not satisfied because she pretty much disappeared on us and didn't really come back.  The food was good....but nothing to brag about.  Service is what made this a 2-star rating.
