"Meh" is definitely the appropriate comment for this place.  The food was OK at best.  The best thing I had was the beans and hot sauce.  I ordered a shredded chicken burrito combo.  Although I was happy to see that the burrito wasn't bigger than my head (seriously, why do places serve such HUGE burritos?), I wasn't happy with much else.  The chicken was watery (literally - I cut into the burrito and water oozed out - gross) and didn't have much flavor.  The rice was bland.  The beans were tasty, especially with LOTS of hot sauce/salsa on them.

Can't say I'll be coming back.  I'll be looking for some burros elsewhere, thank you very much.
