This place was a bit overpriced. The tacos I ordered were not all that great...very salty. The staff looked bored and when I asked questions about the menu they seemed like they didn't know much. Unfamiliar with the menu. I received my food fast and that was nice. I may try there one more time and order something different but, I'm not really a fan. :/
