Every Tuesday Mercadito offers discounts on food for industry members. I had a card that said "receive 50% off your entire check" it did not list any expiration but being I received it a couple months ago I made sure to ask the server when we sat down if it was still valid, she stated it was. The server did not formerly introduce herself, when I told her where I worked her response was, "Rad"? I guess I expected a little more professionalism from a fancy restaurant. My mom than proceeded to ask her if they offer a happy hour, she stated that they did and referred to the card sitting on the table and said its either the happy hour price or the 50% off. She explained it so rudely with such an attitude it made us uncomfortable to ask any questions after that. She was very short, unfriendly, and very unprofessional. At the end after receiving my check there was only a 30% discount applied, I asked her why it is not the 50% her response was the card was old and they only do the 30% discount now, don't you think that would of been appropriate to tell us when we first asked and showed her the card instead of leading us to believe otherwise? Overall the customer service was so terrible that I will not ever be back, the food was great I might consider maybe ordering to go next time? Serving as a main point of contact for the resort I will not be recommending the restaurant...  I feel I could of went to mcdonalds and had better service.
