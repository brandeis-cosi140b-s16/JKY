We love this place. We live in Summerlin but we make the drive about once a week to eat here. The food is awesome. We ate there this afternoon about 3 pm because they advertised $1 carnitas & al pastor tacos. When we were done eating I looked at the receipt and saw a $100 service charge added to our $28 bill. I took it to the cashier who got a manager. They looked for my signed receipt but couldn't find it. That seems fishy to me; it had only been about 15 minutes since we paid and the receipts were all in a rubber band in the cash register. Somehow mine, with the extra $100 tip, is missing?  The manager didn't seem clear on how to fix it but said he did so I'll wait and see what comes through my account tomorrow. He technically said "sorry" but it didn't seem like a real apology to me. I realized on the way home that they also overcharged us for the carnitas tacos. 3/$5.50 is not $1/each. It's only $2.50 but they should know what their specials are and charge appropriately.  We'll most likely eat here again because we love the tacos, but I'll only pay cash from now on.
