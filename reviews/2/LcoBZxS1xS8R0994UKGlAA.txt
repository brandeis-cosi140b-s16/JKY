Underwhelmed in almost every way.

I'll start with the good--the ambiance and decor is very nice. Sitting outside is relatively comfortable even in 90-degree whether. That's about where the niceness ends, though.

The service is painfully slow. My table sat down at noon. It was 12:20 before any of us saw drinks, and 12:50 before we saw any food. The refills were slow, table clearing was slow, the check was slow, etc. I just don't want to make a 90 minute investment in lunch, not even counting transit time. The waitstaff has essentially no personality--no friendly conversation, no check-ins, no nothing.

The food is rather atrocious. I ordered a tuna melt with sweet potato fries and mixed greens. The tuna melt was cold when it came out, and was so fatty and salty that I could barely eat it. The mixed greens, on the other hand, were for some reason warm. When greens are warmed, they wilt. The sweet potato fries were cold and limp.. absolutely disgusting. I should not be able to fold a piece of sweet potato in thirds without it breaking. I could barely stomach the meal, but didn't complain because it was a business lunch.
