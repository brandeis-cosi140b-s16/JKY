**PLEASE NOTE**

I have received a formal apology from Juan Jaime Himself in regards to my bad experience. I think that was the right thing to do, he is looking out for his business and cares what his customers think. I also appreciate his offer to come back and try again at his expense.

Although I cant change my first experience Juan has gone above and beyond to make me a happy customer, that's gotta count for something. +1 star

Well, where should I start!

*Note to self, if  a place is empty at lunch time does it mean only drunks eat here at night?

That would be a pretty good guess!

My daughter and I were running errands all day and saw this place on our way home and decided to stop.

We ordered a couple sodas, some chips and salsa, which by the way they charge you for, even though they serve chips with your entree and have an open salsa bar??? Salsa was OK but the chips were stale and had been sitting in their own grease too long.

I got the 2 tacos, one carnitas and one mahi mahi.(see pics)
Greasy and Bland with Mushy Meat and just plain not good! Although I could see where someone full of tequila might think these were the best things they ever tasted, if that even counts, I Think not!

My daughter ordered the small burrito, which we thought was just a smaller version of the regular burrito. She asked for just beans and steak inside. 
Well no need to waste a flash on that one, it arrived just as plain and boring as the tacos and if there was ANY steak in that burrito it must have been pre-chewed.....cause I've never seen any steak like that before and been charged and extra $2.50 for it, 
where's the Beef Juan?

What a Total waste of money!

I agree with Eugene.T

I No Likey!!!
