So- I finally went to Tex Tub's. It was one of the last Food Fight restaurants that I had not been to, and my takeaway is "meh." I feel like the best mexican restaurants are either going to be very cheap ( a la Guadalajara on Park Street) or fine dining. I think this restaurant is right in the middle. 

The Chips and Salsa were okay, although the chips tasted a bit burnt.  I ordered the three taco platter with a side of rice and beans. I got one pork belly taco, one steak taco, and one fried chicken taco. All of them were okay- not much flavor. The rice and beans were bland too.

I ordered a  blended strawberry margarita because it was happy hour and they were only $3.00. It's exactly what you think a $3 margarita would taste like- very sweet, not much tequila. 

Service was great, which is why this gets 2 stars.
