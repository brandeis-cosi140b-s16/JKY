So normally I'm not that tough on places, but I think when you're serving Mexican food in Phoenix, there is a certain level of expectation.

They get one star for having decent service and another star for having quite good portions.  

On the other hand, the food was crap, especially for the price I was paying.  I had steak fajitas, not normally the cheapest thing, but for something between $12-$15 I expected something tastier.  If they had been the most delicious thing ever, I wouldn't have cared but I didn't even take the half of the food I had left home.  The steak had a funny after taste and a lot of my onions were burnt.  The beans were mediocre and tortillas were average.  

On the whole, it was a decent dining experience but not what I would have wanted for the price.  You can get a lot better Mexican food in Phoenix (and for a lot cheaper).  I'd recommend coming here only if it's the most convenient place.
