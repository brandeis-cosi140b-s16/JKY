"Before both of my feet fully entered Flicka's, I knew I had already contracted the Swine Flu.." Thanks to Georgie S, I now know why I have a sore throat, cough and achy body. Thanks Flicka's for giving me Swine Flu. 

This place is really disorganized, the wait staff (the bartenders the waitresses the bussers) are all really snotty and were all rude, not to mention slow as the second coming. 

The nicest person in that bar was the little Mexican flower guy who fell in love with me and gave me a pair of roses, free of charge. 

The one good thing about this bar was the cheap beers. My Corona was $2.50 and the Bud Lights were $2. 

The outdoor patio is cool, but it is filled with all the smokers so unless you want to catch lung cancer, it is smart to just stay inside. 

My friends band played (I have seen them play at least a dozen times in a variety of venues) and the sound was so horrible. You couldn't hear vocals at all. 

In between the 5 rock bands that played, they piped R&B music over the speakers. I thought this was a little strange.... and I also found the massive dance orgy that busted out to be a little strange.

Some dude sent his wing-woman over to the bar while I was getting drinks to try and get me to join their table. She was the oldest looking wing-woman I have ever seen. It made me immediately want to cancel my tanning membership. 

What a really weird group of people here. Seriously. 

I didn't really care for the food. I consider myself a nachos connoisseur now that I date Dallas G, and these nachos were sub-par. 

I highly doubt I will ever be back to this weird ass place!
