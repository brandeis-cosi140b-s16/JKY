Usually Chipotle rates high in my book but this location is far from what it should be.

My husband and I were passing through on our way to California. It was around 11:30, shortly after the restaurant opened. 

The line to place our order moves extremely slow compared to my other chipotle experiences, when I finally reach the counter they Are out of chicken, shredded lettuce and  fajita veggies, they tell me it will be awhile, so we settle for alternatives that aren't really what we want. We go to get silverware, that entire section clearly has not been stocked. There are no forks and knives, napkins all over the place. 

To top if off I stopped in the. Bathroom on my way out, the bathroom was a mess. Paper towels everywhere and almost no toilet paper. 

I would think that if you are opening and preparing for the lunch rush, you would prepare the key items for your store to run properly. Perhaps it was just an off day but I'm sure Chipotle would be disappointed with this locations representation of their name.
