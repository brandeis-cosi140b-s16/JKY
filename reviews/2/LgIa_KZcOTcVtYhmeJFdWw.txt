This place was ok. No this isnt going to be my new favorite mex rest. To be honest I was here since we had flipped a coin btwn Enzo's (across the street) and bc Enzo's wasnt open yet we came here. 
I was torn btwn the lunch fajitas $11.99 or the Crab enchiladas $16.99.  the regular order of fajitas was $17.99 (for 1) wow. ok. 
I went w/ the lunch order - and it came out less than 5 min. later. on a regular plate - not sizzling on the skillet like they do at any other restaurant I've ever been to and ordered enchiladas. 

I hoped my dissapointment didnt show too much b/c I've been known to show a "cara" when I get sad. It was 1/2 a plate of onions w/  4 slivers of fajita meat. 1/2 cup of rice and 1/2 beans. I'm glad the portions were that small so that I wouldnt eat too many calories @ lunch - but I know I'd never order that plate again. The meat was good (for the most part) but since there wasnt that much to judge, its easy to say it was good. 

SALSA: CAN you say PACE? it was sweet and gross. 

BEANS: the bean dip did taste good and surprisingly really good and authentic. how ironic.  usually the salsa tastes great and the beans are runny , however here the salsa sucked. 

SERVICE: VERY attentive. kind but like all salesmen trying to get you to order tequila, drinks, (at 11 am) beer, margaritas, dessert? anything? I hate trying to be upsold. If I said no 3x , you suggesting everything else on your menu isnt going to make me change my mind all of a sudden. maybe he knew b/c I didnt finish my plate that I left still kinda hungry. In all fairness Viva Michoacan is around the corner and is around hte same price bracket or lower - and tastes way better.
