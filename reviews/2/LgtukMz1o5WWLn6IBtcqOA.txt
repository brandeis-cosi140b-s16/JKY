Eh, I love & hate you CR...
Right now, I hate you! Tryed your online ordering for the first time and probably the last time. When I got there I went to the p/u line. You guys didn't even have my order online? Hmmm, lady at counter said it takes 15 minutes to come up after you order? Not cool but what ever. I've been charged for it already so I'll wait. Tick * Tock * 15 minutes pass, I get up and walk back over to the lady to see if it is up, it is. Woo-who! So she said they'll start to make it. Alright, cool. Took 35 more minutes!? Oh come on now, I just got off work, all I want is my damn cheese enchiladas and my chips & guac!
I know you guys get extremely busy but there was no reason for my order to take that long! Geez
