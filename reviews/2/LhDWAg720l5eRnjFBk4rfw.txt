Came here for a quick lunch which actually took over an hour. The service was slow and the food is one of my least favorite Mexican food in champaign, if not the worst. 

I ordered two enchiladas with rice and beans. The dish did not come with sour cream or a little bit of guac or salad. Just enchiladas, beans, and rice. The tortilla used for the enchiladas was too fragile and broke apart with a light touch of the fork. Sauce wasn't that great either. Spanish rice was disappointing as well - too salty and therefore could not consume. 

Their horchata is a 2/5 since it did not taste like any that I've tried at other Mexican restaurants. 

Won't be coming here again unless forced by group consensus.
