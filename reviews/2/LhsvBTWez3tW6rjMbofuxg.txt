This place is not even mediocre. Upon entering we were sat immediately, seeing as the restaurant wasn't all that busy. We were greeted at our seat pretty quickly and the server was friendly, and that is why I am giving this place two stars...it is definitely not for the food. Actually I take that partially back, the chips and salsa were good. The salsa was nice and spicy. I ordered the Mexican Pizza. It came on a thin tortilla with cheese, ground beef, onion, and a slice of green chili on each slice (I enjoyed the chili). I expect a Mexican Pizza to be thick and crunchy; however, this was flimsy and greasy. I couldn't even pick up a slice without it completely falling apart. In addition, I must have went through ten napkins trying to sop the grease from my hands. It was a little better when I piled salsa on top of each bite, but it was not something I would ever consider ordering again. My mom ordered the lunch special of two tacos with rice and beans. Now I cannot discuss the taste of her meal, because I didn't try it; however, the taco shells were just plain, out of the box hard corn taco shells. I've never understood why a Mexican restaurant wouldn't spend more time on the things that make Mexican restaurants great. Tortillas are amazing. I love them, and I think the majority of people feel the same way. This is why I cannot stand to see a boxed taco shell in a Mexican restaurant. I've made homemade taco shells at home in the past, and it is not hard. This one little thing would improve this place immensely. The service here was pretty good, but the food left a lot to be desired.
