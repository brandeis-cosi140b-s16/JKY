This place has been so hyped up we decided to give it a try for lunch one day. 

EVERYTHING IS ALA CART.

No service to be had. EVERYTHING is extra or on the side. If you want salsa or any sauce of any sort you have to ask for it and its a hassle because the service is non-existent.

I witnessed a male serving food and he had his bare hands on a lady's burrito before he set it down in front of her to keep it on the plate. I don't think that is acceptable. I just wanted a refund at that point, especially since the wait was terrible.

We had to ask how much longer our lunch was going to take as our break was almost over and we still had not received our purchases after waiting 15+ minutes. The food came out about 5 minutes after that. No salsa, no extra anything, back to the line... SIGH.

We will not be returning to Tia Rosa or visiting any other locations.

I wish they put as much thought into their food service and presentation as they did the wall decor.
