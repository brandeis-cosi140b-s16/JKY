Use caution when ordering the chips as an appetizer. The seasoning they use has a horrendous amount of salt, so much it was burning my lips.The homemade salsa had a lovely flavor, just left unable to eat d/t the awful chips. 

The black bean soup was had great flavor and texture but again was so salty I couldn't eat but a few bites. The blue corn bread was a delight!
