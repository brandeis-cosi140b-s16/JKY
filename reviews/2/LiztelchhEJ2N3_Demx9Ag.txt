You have got to be kidding me, we ordered our Cinco de mayo lunch from Macayos today and when our unknowing runner today got there to put the order in first of all she asked the girl working the counter how big the burritos are because she is a smaller lady and cant eat that much and the lady working the counter told her that the burritos are very small, just about the size of an enchilada and that she would need 2 of them so she ordered 2 for herself and 2 for one of our other employees and each one ended up costing almost $10 a piece and then I ordered the chicken Nachos which I thought would be priced normal and they where anything but that. 

I have added a picture of the receipt for the nachos.. You have got to be F-ing kidding me... They Charged $4.99 For the chips and then extra for every additional topping. What the hell is that about. Forget this place, I am sorry if you are a fan but this is plain robbery.
