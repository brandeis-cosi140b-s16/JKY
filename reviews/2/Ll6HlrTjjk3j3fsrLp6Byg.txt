I went back here not realizing I'd been here before... but I think it went by a different name? Tacos Atoyac? My review is somewhere on the old page. Well It wasn't until I was on 19th that I realized I was heading back to the same place. Since I was starving and its right around the corner from my dentists office, I decided to give the place a second try. Nope, same old problems. 

Got the:

*Carne asada tacos (1.50) - tiny portions, meat tastes funny to me like its been mixed in with other meats, which I suspect anyway since they probably use the same grill to cook everything. Still, I haven't had that issue at most Mexican restaurants I go to.  And the meat is also dry with some rubbery pieces. 

*Fish tacos (1.50)- tiny portion and the batter is just utterly bland. Rubios has better fish tacos. I don't care for the sauce they put on it either. 

*Spicy chicken tamale (2.25)- good portion size but comes with very little meat and kind of dry. 

*Horchata- its ok, almost has a milky, buttery taste to it. Not enough cinnamon IMO. 

I know 1.50 sounds cheap, but for the size and flavor, I don't think its worth it. Location is as hole in the wall as you can get in a very shady part of Phoenix. Even at 10am I still felt uncomfortable getting out of my car. And the construction around there is atrocious, although that is not their fault. They are building tracks for the lightrail to come through here. Service is friendly though. 

I really wanted to like this place but I don't think there will be a 3rd chance, especially with Taqueria Los Yaquis so close to here (too bad for weird hours though).
