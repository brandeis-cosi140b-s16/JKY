OK. If you are going to open a Mexican joint in the land of the southwest, please stand out amongst the greats, do something different. Please do not dumb down or Americanize what is suppose to be Mexican food. With my rant out of the way... The service flat sucks, Drinks were slow to be refilled along with the chips and salsa. If you are going to serve 'Tortas" make dam well and sure it is authentic. I have had excellent tortas in south phoenix for around $3 bucks that would make you beg for more. Tortas are served on Bilbo (spelling may be off) rolls that are soft and wonderful, not Chabata rolls! I asked our server if it was served on a Bilbo roll and he said no Chabata. I asked the waiter to explain what a Torta was to see if he actually knew. His response was that it is similar to a 'PO Boy" what a moron! Had a cold Carina asada torta. It sucked!!!!!! I will give this place props for serving a very tasty Chicken tortilla soup. Nice size portion for $8 bucks was a bit high, however soup was good. Chips and salsa are at best ok, one person in my group did say that the black bean and corn burro was very good. Will I be back.. Take a guess from my review!!!!
