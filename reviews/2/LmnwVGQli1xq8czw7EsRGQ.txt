Meh... I was not impressed. This was a recommendation from my sister. Maybe it's because this place is called Flaming Fajita and I didn't order fajitas but the food was not great. I ordered Rajas y Crema which is my favorite Mexican dish and I order it wherever I go and see it on the menu. This was not good at all. I question the age of the chicken and pasilla peppers because they tasted super old! And the "cream" was separating. So nasty. Needless to say I don't think we'll be back.
