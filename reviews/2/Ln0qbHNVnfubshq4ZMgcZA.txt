The food here is pretty good but for the price it isn't worth it. The steak is ALWAYS very fatty. The service here on 11/11/14 around 2:30 pm was AWFUL. The cashier was so rude and sassy. When I returned inside to ask for a lid to take my food to go she asked " Do you need something?" with a rude and intolerant tone of voice. No little miss teen, I don't need anything, just admiring the view. Honestly?!!!! Yes I need something. A lid, that's all. Then she practically shoved it in my face and said "You good?" HA. Sweetheart let's be real. You have a job because of people like me asking you for a to-go box. When I ordered my food the music was so loud they couldn't hear me ordering and screwed it up. I was YELLING my order and had to sit outside to hear myself think. Is this a bar or a restaurant in the middle of the day?! The trashcans were overflowing, the tables we all dirty, and the service sucked. Please lose the attitude and maybe I'll consider coming back for your yummy guacamole.
