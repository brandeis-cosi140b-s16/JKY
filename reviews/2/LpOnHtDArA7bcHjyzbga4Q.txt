Why does just about everything in Ayrsley suck when compared to other locations?  Is this development built on some cursed grave site?  The Portofino's is easily the worst of any in the area, the Wild Wing has been shut down twice for serving alcohol to minors and also received some pretty bad inspections scores, and now Moe's is probably the worst of any in the area.  

Every Monday is Moe Monday at all Charlotte area locations.  $5 gets you any burrito, chips, and a drink.  Last Monday, we went to Moe's in Ballantyne and were served very healthy burritos, a huge portion of chips, and made our drinks at the Coca Cola freestyle machine.  That Moe's was very busy.  Today I go to Moe's at Ayrsley and received two burritos that were skimpy on the meat and barely a handful of chips, plus no freestyle Coke machine.  I guess that explains why there was only one other customer in the place.  This isn't the first time we have have been less than satisfied at this location, and we have been to several others from north Charlotte to Rock Hilll.  If you're craving Moe's, go to a different one than Ayrsley.
