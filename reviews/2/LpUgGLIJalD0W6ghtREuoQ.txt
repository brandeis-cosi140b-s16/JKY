Caught happy hour here on Sunday. The service was ok and the decor is great. Very nice looking place. The portions of the food are terrible. Even for happy hour they are very small. I had a Margarita and it was really strong, a plus for alot of people, but a negative for me. Overall I probably won't ever come back. Just not for me, better places to go to.
