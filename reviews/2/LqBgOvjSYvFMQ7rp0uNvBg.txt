So disappointed!  I use to go the Phoenix location as a kid with my parents. I remember having a great time, great food, and great atmosphere.  We stumbled upon the Avondale location and I was excited to eat at Carlos O'briens again after many years.  My initial thought when I walked into the door, why does it look like a school cafeteria?  The atmosphere was just off!  The server was slow.  Our food came out before our drinks did.  The food was awful!  The only reason I ate my food was because I couldn't bear to spend 12.95 and not eat it. I'm not one to complain, but the couple I was with did and received a comp on their bill for one meal. Unfortunately, all good memories I had of this place were just replaced with utter disappointment!  I will not be returning.
