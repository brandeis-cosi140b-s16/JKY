Sorry, me no likey anymore. 
Since the commencement of the opening of Barrio, I have been enchanted by the giant fan and the cosmepolitan atmosphere. A couple of nights ago, the glass sealing was shattered for me. I arrived as usual with my husband and two small children. We waited for 5 minutes before anyone came to the hostess stand. The woman looked frazzled and put out. Sorry, that's your job, or maybe it is someone else's job and you are covering for them but, still, it is your job. I didn't get any warm fuzzies. 
When we were sat at our table, our server was very receptive to our needs. SERVICE HERE IS GREAT, which is the only redeeming quality. Food and prices are not. 
I ordered the "Seafood Experience," and was highly disappointed. There were two large shrimp on my plate and one fish taco with a very small portion of fish...$16.00 dollars later. The food was good but unless you are anorexic, really bad portions. If you haven't eaten for days because you are starving yourself and you think you may want to binge, try here. Because the portions will look huge to you. 
Seriously, this is not tapas, it is mexican food. I feel like a fatty saying that but let's call a spade a spade.
If you want some good, over-priced drinks in a bar that has a lot of old, ugly people, go here.
