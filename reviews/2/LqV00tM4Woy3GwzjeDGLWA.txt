Overpriced and Overrated. This was some of the most boring Mexican food I've ever had and on top of it I paid too much. We ate here for New Years and did not do the prix fixe. 

The chips were good, but overall the salsa was boring. One of them was smoked, which has a really good taste to it. 

The $14 Cadillac Margarita, was weak and tasted like it was mixed with Lemon-Lime Gatorade and crap tequila. Couldn't even taste the Grand Marnier that was allegedly included. 

For the meal, I had the skirt steak. It came out lukewarm at best and was undercoooked (I ordered medium) but I ate it anyways. Not impressed, the meat was nice and tender but also pretty tasteless. 

If you're looking for good Mexi in Vegas, get off the strip and head down to Viva Michoacan in Henderson for some good food.
