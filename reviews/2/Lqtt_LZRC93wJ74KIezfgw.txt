La Salsita's is o.k. for late night tacos, but the enchiladas, and dry rice and beans that I had yesterday, tasted like a Mexican frozen television dinner.  The menu is a also misleading as it has most meals priced at $6.99 (comes with beans and rice), and then the $4.99 specials.  What they don't tell you is that if you want beans and rice with the special (in this case chicken enchiladas), that it's extra money.  It comes out to $7.40+    For a few dollars more, you can get real Mexican food at Garcia's, or Filiberto's, Humberto's, Julioberto's and all the other Berto's.  There were also flies in the dining areas.
