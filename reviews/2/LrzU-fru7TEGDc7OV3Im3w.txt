I'm not one of those people who are too impressed by the fake sky and indoor canal in the venetian, so if that's interesting to you, you might enjoy this place more. I think the food here is good not great. We started with a queso appetizer and added jalapenos to it. It was just huge chunks of jalapeno and very little cheese and almost inedible.

For dinner I had the five tacos. The steak and pork were great, the fish was meh. $5 house margarita for happy hour was nice. 

Good place to stop for a quick lunch but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here.
