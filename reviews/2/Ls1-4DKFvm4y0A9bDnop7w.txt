been here twice and probably won't go back, unless i only have margaritas. the food was great the first time and very sub-par the second, especially for the price of the tacos. the pork ones were especially gross; extremely greasy and fatty and tasteless (i know pork is fatty, but it shouldn't be hard to chew). 

our service was good the first go round, as we sat at the bar and learned a lot from the bartender about their tequilas. the second time, service was no good. very slow and our waters went empty for entire meal, even after we asked for more. 

they do have great guac and chips and their margaritas are fantastic, and they should be for what you pay. but if you are looking for great tacos, skip this place. you'll be underwhelmed.
