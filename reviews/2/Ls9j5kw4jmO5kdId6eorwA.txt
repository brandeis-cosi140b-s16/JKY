This place is so lucky that it's the only non-fast food place in this terminal of Sky Harbor Airport. If there was a better option, we would have gone to that in a heartbeat. 

The place is seat yourself, which we did, but that meant that no one knew we were there until we had been sitting down for 10 minutes. We all ordered drinks and after the server brought them, we had to wave him down to order some food... he was very apathetic about his job which detracts from the experience. 

Good place for a beer at the bar, perhaps. But as a restaurant ... me thinks not.
