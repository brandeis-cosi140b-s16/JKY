There is something about going to an authentic little Mexican spot that passes down Grandmas recipes and you savor every bite.  Whether they have folded some paper napkins, or the server even speaks a word of English- you feel like you have been invited in as a guest and treated to a tasty dinner at often very low prices.  Now, if you are to take this wonderful experience and have admittedly some very nice tables and seating and throw fancy decorations on the wall, with mostly unauthentic servers, and have the same menu items at double or triple what it would normally cost AND your food doesn't taste near as good: that is what I experienced at Javier's.  At the end of the day I want to savor every bite.  I ordered the tampique√±a- a dish I have had before and absolutely loved at a family owned higher end place near Philadelphia, and I can't even compare the two honestly.  I tried a bite of a friends burrito and it was average at best.  Save your money if you're in the mood for Mexican in Vegas, and skip Javier's.
