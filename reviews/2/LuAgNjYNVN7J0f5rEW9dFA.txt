I think my experience and review of eating at the Cabo "Mexican" restaurant would of been different if I would of been slightly tipsy from drinking a  giant margarita...too bad I completely sober though!

The Cabo Mexican Restaurant needs to ante up (oh man, thinking about playing cards now ha)  their customer service.  My boyfriend and his family and friends and I waited more than 15 minutes to get our beverages. The Saturday night was no busy at all. The food took long too. Not sure why it was taking so long for simple quesadillas or to slap on some ground meat on a tortilla and call it a night. 

I ordered the carne asada tacos with avocado slices instead of guacamole. When my plate came I was surprised to find two sad looking dry carne asada tacos and almost 1/8" of a slice of avocado...should of just got the guacamole huh haha.

The one thing I really liked about eating at the Cabo "Mexican" Restaurant was that they had a salsa and chips bar. I shoulda just gone wild and filled up on that. NExt time, I'll drink up and chip/dip it up.
