TACOS? Not really.... first of all the tortilla was cold the shrimp was not good flavor wise and the fish one was ehh I also had a "carne asada" not good. The sides I Had white rice and Beans not good. the place is a cool hang out spot nice bar. If I ever come back it would be to have a drink at the bar but I wont even give the food another try. I have to say rubios is WAY better their tacos are actually good.
