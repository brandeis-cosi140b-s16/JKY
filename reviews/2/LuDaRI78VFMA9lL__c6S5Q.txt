Disclaimer: I only went to Don Lencho's for a Happy Hour drink. I didn't eat dinner. I've driven past Lencho's for years but never stopped. No particular reason why. I was near, and decided to finally go and get a drink. Staff was friendly. I got a seat at a table, read the menu & ordered a beer. They no longer sold that beer. Okay, asked for a different beer on the menu. Nope, didn't have that either. Found one that they still carry. Server brought out chips & salsa. Horrible! Chips were less than room temperature, hard & tasted like the chips came straight out of the bag. I doubt I'll ever eat at Don Lencho's.
