I was excited to see this spot open up. It's much closer to my house than the 7th Ave and St locations. I would always go to the 7th ave location and the food is great.

This location has issues that will hopefully improve with time. I've been twice

1st visit - I ordered 2 al Pastor tacos, one carne asada taco, and chips and guac. They forgot the pineapple on the al pastor tacos and the carne asada was grey and chewy (inedible).

2nd visit - Skipped the carne asada all together, and got two al pastor tacos and chips and guac. Pineapple made it into the tacos this time. But, the chips were stale and chewy. 

Not sure if I will make it back to this location.
