No offense, but Pittsburghers seem to love bad Mexican/southwestern style food, so when multiple people have negative things to say about a place that serves up 'corrupt cuisine' (ala burrito bowls and such), you should probably trust them. I just went here for lunch anyway. 
First off, the names for everything are so lame. I'm not referring to what I want to eat as a home wrecker. Nope.
 I was excited about the variety of options for your food item. I got a burrito bowl with rice, chicken, black beans, onions, corn salsa, pico, cheese, guacamole, sour cream, and and insane amount of cilantro. Chips are free, and I bought a thing of queso to dip them in. I also picked up two of the medium salsas from the free salsa bar. Unfortunately, nothing in the burrito bowl stood out aside from the fact that somehow, it all managed to taste so bland. Even the tons of cilantro didn't stand out. The guacamole tasted like the plasticy store bought stuff, the sour cream had no flavor, both salsas from the bar tasted straight up strange, and everything else managed to have no flavor. Well, I'll give the queso credit because who doesn't like nasty ol' nacho cheese? Moes is a bit more pricy than its competitors but I assume this is because you get "free" chips, salsa, and guacamole.
Service was service, nothing to really note about it except that someone did offer to explain the menu after I stared at it quizzically for a few moments longer than I should have.
Anyway, now I know why the line at Chipotle across the street is at least 30 people long while a whole ten people have walked into moes in the half hour or so that I sat there. 
Save your money and go across the street  where your food will actually taste like something. I wanted to love you Moe's, but your names are stupid and your food has zero flavor. 

TL;DR
Pros: nacho cheese, "free" chips
Cons: everything else
Verdict: Just say no.
