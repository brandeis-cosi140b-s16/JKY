fair to poor at best.   It has the classic 1970's and earlier Mexican restaurant feel to it, but, the food is lacking the same flare.    The food is more typical of Tex mex than anything you'd expect in Arizona.   If your looking for a classic Mexican restaurant Pedro's still has both the atmosphere and the food.  

Overall I can't say I wont go back, but, it's just kind of OK.   Sadly Phoenix as a whole seems to have this issue, where much of the Mexican restaurants are just OK, with a few, very few, standouts like Pedro's or Carolina's.    If you want actual Sonoran food, got me, I have yet to find anyplace here though venturing further south on I-10 will lead you to greater concentrations.
