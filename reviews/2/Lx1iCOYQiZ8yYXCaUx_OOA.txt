Waitress was great although everyone seemed overwhelmed ...maybe Bc it's fairly new to open 
The guacamole was excellent other than that everything we ordered was completely over salted :( our family of 6 couldn't finish anything they ordered Bc of all the salt .... Even the chicken and rice soup 
Wouldn't return :( thankfully we had a gift card so we only had to pay 80 dollars for food no one ate
