Meh. I've definitely had better. 

We sampled the chicken adobado, quesdailla, and beef burrito. Everything lacked flavor, zing, and goodness. 

Nothing was bad...just bland. Salsas, and sour cream were watered down. Literally. The sour cream was like fluid milk. 

Tortillas were fresh and yummy. Guacamole was good. It'll do in a pinch but nothing to rave about. Definitely didn't have that zesty Latin flavor I was hoping for.
