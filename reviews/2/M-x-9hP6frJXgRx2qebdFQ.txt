But it's a good two stars if that makes any sense at all. Better than taco bell (I would rate taco bell a one star). You are not going to leave and say what ever you had was the yummiest whatever. I've been here a number of times over the years and the last time I had a chicken taco salad. I don't know if it was a bad day for chicken but the day I had the chicken it was terribly dry and awful. I was afraid to order chicken again and since I don't usually eat beef on a salad I asked for fish instead. They gave me fish I don't know but I think it was tilapia. The fish wasn't oily but I could taste pre used sort of burnt tasting pan oil on it. My salad was very average with an unripe tomato wedge on it. I thought the salsas were good this time and it also was a good day for guacamole. 

My husband had the carnitas and they were not like he expected but thought they were passable. (see photo and you will know what I mean)

This food is just passable and sadly one of the better of the fast casual Mexi places in the area.

The $3.75 Margaritas are very strong and the food will seem better if you suck one down before you eat.
