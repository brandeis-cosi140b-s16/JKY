We had a nice tasting lunch, but it was marred by the bus boy slamming dishes into the boxes outside the kitchen door. The noise was loud, startling, and jarring. Even after I asked him to work more quietly, he continued. It disrupted conversation. We waited in vain for the waitress to pick up the check (delivered without any inquiry about dessert or coffee).  We finally took it up to the cashier ourselves. This was no way to treat customers whose bill was over $100. Disappointing.
