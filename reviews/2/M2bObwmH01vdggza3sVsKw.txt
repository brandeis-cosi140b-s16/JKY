Came here with a group on a Friday night before our dinner reservation- the bar is rimmed with cocktail tables for couples or those grabbing a light bite. We were provided complimentary chips and a trio of salsas, and drinks came out quickly. 

Unfortunately, our server was a total Debbie Downer whose initially peppy attitude did a 180 as soon as she found out we didn't intend to order a full meal. Our waters stayed empty, a bill was slapped on our table, and she repeatedly walked by and said "thanks for coming" as if to shoo us out early. 

Considering we each bought $10+ margaritas (the mango-jalapeno is tasty!) and tipped well, her attitude was totally unwarranted.
