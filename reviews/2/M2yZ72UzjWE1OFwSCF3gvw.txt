"Let me yelp this place really quick.." I said to my friend before we came in. What a mistake it was to give up that idea.

As you walk in, the place is clean and cosy. Service is fairly prompt, even though there was only one waiter working during lunch time.

I had a fish burrito that arrived ~15 minutes after ordering. It consisted of undercooked rice, a pinch of vegetables, and fried breaded shoe sole for a fish. Honestly I once had a better fish burrito at Del-Taco across the street.

My friend had chicken sizzling fajita, which was rushed in sizzling and smelling pretty good. Unfortunately, it lacked flavor and had the same undercooked rice and 97 year-old salad for sides. The guac and sour cream were fresh, though.

Worth noting is that the salsa was pretty good, full of flavor with just the right bite of hotness. So if you're looking for some chips/salsa and beer, go for it. Otherwise, don't do this to yourself.
