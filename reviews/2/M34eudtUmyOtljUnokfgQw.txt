Although the food was decent, our waiter was terrible. We are seated for a few moments before the waiter approaches to take our drink order. He returns with place settings. Few minutes later comes with our drinks and says the chips are on their way. Must have been coming right from the border because we waited about 10 minutes before we were delivered what was the bottom of the barrel crumbs. I ordered the enchilada and chimi taquito combo both with chicken, with rice and refried beans and my friend ordered the chimi taquito and mini burrito, both with chicken, with black beans and rice. The meal was pretty good, not the best I've had in town, but ok. However our waiter disappeared. We had to ask the busser Cody for a refill on our Pepsi!! He was the best part of our experience!!! When our waiter finally showed up he stood about 4 feet away from us like we were contagious! Well perhaps maybe he was afraid to catch a personality!!!!
I am sure I will eat here again but hope next time the service is better! 
Oh and if you are wondering, they were not busy. It was about 9:30 in the evening and hardly anyone there. The previous time we were there all the tables were filled and our server that time was on too of it!! 
They should make Cody a server. He was hustling out there!!!
