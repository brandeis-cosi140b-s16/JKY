I always come here bc the tacos are so good but every time I get the worst service. I keep giving them another chance but they seriously need to get it together with their horrible service. I timed it on my phone and it took 10 min before a server came over and that was after I flagged him down. He rudely told me to hold on. Exactly 20 min after being here we finally got our drinks. Food was fantastic. But once again service was terrible. They should have more servers on if they can't give good service
