Stopped by here with the bf on our way to Caesars Palace. The lady assembling the taco made us feel so rushed even though there was no one behind us. It was our first time here so we didn't know what we wanted as toppings for our tacos. She kept scooping up different toppings assuming that's the one we wanted with an annoyed look on her face. I believe the lady ahead of us felt the same way because apparently the other girl working put the wrong sauce on her tacos - she was rushing the lady as well. At that point, we felt like we were "bothering" her and left with some plain ass tasting tacos. We got steak and chicken tacos and it was so bland! Rice and refried beans also nasty. 

The only seating available was outside with the pigeon shit covered tables. Disgusting. 

Should have went to Chipotle instead!
