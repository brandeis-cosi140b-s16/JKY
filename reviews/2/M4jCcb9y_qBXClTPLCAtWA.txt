Going down hill fast with no end in sight! I used to live across the street from the old location. I blamed them for my belly!! I was really worried they would change when they moved. We went there for my birthday last week. No one checked on us for a long time. The place was not crowded. Chips and salsa took forever. Water took even longer. The food was ok. Kind of bland. I add a LOT of the hot sauce (If you can get it!!!). They used to give you a jar of it. Now it is handed out in tiny bowls like it is 20 year old scotch! Three people in my party got margaritas. They do not serve pitchers any more. So they got their own. They were expensive and according to all three it was VERY VERY weak. I really am sad to say I just don't feel they are worth it any more. Their service never was their best attribute but now it is dismal. You used to not care because the food was so darn good. Well that isn't the case anymore. Add in that the prices went up by a fair amount I think put a nail in the coffin for me!
