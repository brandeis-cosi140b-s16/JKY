I have been wanting to try this place for awhile and finally went to dinner with another couple. Honestly, the food was some of the BEST I have had in a long time. Seriously, the food was awesome and the service was very good. I probably won't go back, however. Now this is something I have seen in other reviews and I don't understand why the manager doesn't do something about this very fixable complaint...turn down the damn music! Why does it need to be so loud? You literally end up shouting to others at the table. One of my friends asked the hostess if they could turn it down, but we were pretty much ignored. Again, what is the point? There is no dance floor, it is definitely not a 'club' scene. Who are they trying to appeal to? Oddly enough, the music they were blasting was from the 80's. I loved the music (a sign of my age) but the twenty somethings that were there might not have. Regardless of the music genre, please turn it down!
