I've been watching this place for months and months with a opening soon sign. It's close to work so I was looking forward to it opening, operative word "was". Well it finally opened and I went to try it.

I ordered a carne asada burrito. It was asada, beans, cheese and I beleive sour cream according to the description. I liked the ratio, mostly meat with a few beans, could have used more cheese.

I took a bite and it was like getting a gulp of ocean water it was so salty. If you're on a low sodium diet, stay away. It took the hotter sauces to mask the salt, which also masked the flavor of the ingredients, which was insignificant, since the only flavor was salt.  The texture was fine, no grizzly pieces of meat to chew through, but the overwhelming salt taste ruined it. Except for the calorie intake, I could have gotten as much taste enjoyment out of eating a salt packet.

They have other meats available, they might be fine, I don't know, nor will I know, I won't be back. If I might suggest, directly across the street is Cardenas market, they have a cocina in the store with excellent food, I would recommend going there.
