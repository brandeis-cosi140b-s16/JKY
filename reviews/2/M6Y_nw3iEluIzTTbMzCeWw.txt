2 stars all because the hot sauce sucks now. 2 stars: 1 for a Buckeye Icon and 1 for most of the food is not bad. 
Service is bad and slow. Servers are not trained in good service skills. Dirt parking lot sucks, be carefull not fall into one of the holes.
Hope you are not handicapted and have to use the bathroom.....it's outside and to the left, suprised the Building department OK'd this place.
