Not sure how to handle this one. I really like this bar. If it were ever open. This place has good food, great beers and a really fun atmosphere.  However, it closes at 2pm during the week! I've heard of bars not opening until the afternoon/evening, but closing at 2pm and not opening back up for happy hour or dinner? That seems odd. It does seem to still be open on the weekend, so i'll try it again since I love their patio, but i just cant rate a bar that closes after lunch very highly./Art
