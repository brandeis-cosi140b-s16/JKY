Went down to check this place out for lunch. The atmosphere is nice, the prices are on the upper end for Mexican food but I'll forgive them that because the food is high quality and prices in the area are high in general. However, the service was poor. The restaurant was slow, and it looked like there were plenty of staff, but we felt like we waited too long to place our order and get our receipt. While the food is good, overall I'd rather eat at Casa Don Juan or Los Tacos.
