Got some carne asada for dinner tonight from La Palma. The meat was good quality but I wasn't too impressed with the marinade they use.

The marinade was pretty bland and didn't really add much to the meat. However, the price was decent compared to some so I guess it's a trade off.

Also, I was a bit disappointed with the guy cashier today. He couldn't stop running his trap to a friend, in Spanish, and take the time to devote his attention to me, a customer.

Meh, I've experienced better.
