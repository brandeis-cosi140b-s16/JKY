I will not be caught in this place alone ordering past 8 pm. The strip mall where it's located is a bit dubious. The restaurant itself is dark and dingy. Their salsa station always looks messy.Talking to the cashier on night shift is like talking to a robot. No attempt at customer service whatsoever. There are so many things they can improve upon. 

It's a shame because their tacos are decent with enough flavor and spices to hit the spot. This place is also open 24/7! From where I live, this is closer than having to venture out to downtown/strip to Tacos El Gordo. So if I have a taco craving, Roberto's can *sometimes* suffice, especially when pressed for time. I just order their adobada, carne asada, and fish tacos.
