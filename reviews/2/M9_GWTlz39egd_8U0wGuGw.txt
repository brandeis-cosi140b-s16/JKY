The food is great but the lady who works cashier at night has nothing but attitude. I would love to come back and eat there again but she's the reason why I won't! I came in one time and order rolled tacos and I told her instead of sour cream on top I want guacamole instead and that's all I said. When the food was ready she really told the kitchen crew to only put guacamole on top so I came back with it and ask her nicely if she could add cheese on top and she reply  with a lot of attitude and said  "no you never said you wanted cheese you only said guacamole" and I replied to her okay so I have to pay extra for it and she said "no but for the next time you will know how to order". Not only was that rude but I never told her not to put cheese or lettuces when it comes with it. If I didn't want it I would of said it. She just assumed that's how I wanted it. I didn't know I had to tell her I want cheese and lettuce on top even though it comes with it!!
