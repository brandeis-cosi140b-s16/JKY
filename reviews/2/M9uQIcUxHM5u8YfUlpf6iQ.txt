Pretty average place. Small menu. Nothing too exciting. I totally missed the Sonoran Hot Dog until after I had ordered, so I may goo back and give it a try.

We had the flautas and fish tacos. Both came with refried beans and rice. Just unimpressive all around. The beans and rice didn't taste very fresh. Not terrible, just cheap. Same with the guacamole.

One thing did shine, though. The chips and salsa were great. They give you a huge plate of chips and a tub of salsa. The chips taste homemade and were lightly salted, just right.. The salsa was excellent. Great kick! A little on the watery side, but hard to complain when it's so good.

Unless you just have to have a Sonoran Hot Dog, I'd say you can skip this place.
