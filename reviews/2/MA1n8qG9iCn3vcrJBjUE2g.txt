Hmmm let's start with drinks, I ordered a Reggae Beat and it was just juice with no flavor more like Ice water it had no alcohol at all. Food was just ok I went with a group a friends and me and my boyfriend shared the chicken-mania which was ok but very over priced for what we received. There was pretty much good music not great but it had us at my table dancing. I don't think I'll be going back anytime soon.
