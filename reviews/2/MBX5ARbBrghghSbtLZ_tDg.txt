Cheap looking food it was very greasy and I'm sure everything was heated in a microwave and tossed in the buffet line. The decor was nice but the music that was playing was only audible on certain areas of the restaurant so that brought the atmosphere down a lot. My recommendation to the owners is to get rid of the buffet and replace it with more seating, make everything fresh and have great drink specials. Liven up the different dining rooms or give them an elegance that allows for the secluded feeling. By elegance I mean customers shouldn't hear ice being dumped in the kitchen. That only subtracts from the atmosphere.
