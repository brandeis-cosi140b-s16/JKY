Ugh. Really wanted to like this place. Service was below par to put it nicely. 15 min to get drinks on a quiet night is not acceptable.  Will not be returning for many reasons #1 bad service #2 food was mediocre at best. Had the chips & guac= meh. Poke tuna was unmemorable tacos I heard were meh but not worth heading back. Service was horrendous! Margarita was ew. Not much more to say.
