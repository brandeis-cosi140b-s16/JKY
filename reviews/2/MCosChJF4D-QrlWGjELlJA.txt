What What?.?.?.... No jalapenos?!?!?!?
 
What kinda joint is this. well it's flavorless, at least thats my take. The Burrittos Blah! The Tacos Blah! The Nachos Blah! All eiether had NO flavor or The Flavor was off. Its a shame to fill a thin soggy tortilla with 80 cents worth of ingredients and wrap it in such a thin piece of foil that it splits and leaks out of the bag, and charge 8 bucks for it! especially when its as sad as these!!!
 
I tried it twice and have to pull the plug. My wallet will never again see the light of day in a place like this.

I will say the staff has always been friendly though.
