After getting out of the club Tao about 5: am we were very hungry decide it to go for some tacos it was crazy pack wrong move to go in there it was beyond insane after being in the line for about 20 minutes the security guy told me that I was on the wrong line he said to me " this line is only for the adobada tacos " move to the other line 35 minutes for me to be able to order my tacos they were super greasy the guy that made my tacos was super cool but the other guy that was making the alpastor Tacos I think he was the owner because I think the name el Gordo is cause of his size he was not cool at all I was talking to him ordering some tacos from him and he completely ignored me the orchata water was out of a fountain machine gross to end it all I think you can get better tacos at tacos pepes and they are cheaper
