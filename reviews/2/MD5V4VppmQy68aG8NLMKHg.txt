I have no complaints about the food, if you can actually get it.  I stopped going here because they keep messing up my order.  It's not like I have a complicated order, either, but when I want a bean and cheese,  I don't want a carne asada.  If I say no cheese, a burrito with cheese is not OK.  I once went here with two friends and they managed to screw up all three of our orders.  

Also, I went here with a lactose-intolerant friend and he asked them to clean the grill before making his food to avoid an allergic reaction.  They looked at him like he asked for space food.  We ended up going someplace else.

There's a Filiberto's up the street.  They've always managed to get my order right, so I don't bother with this place anymore.
