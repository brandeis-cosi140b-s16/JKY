When we're in Vegas, we like to eat off of the strip some. My grandparents are very fond of this place so we come at least once a summer. This is your typical mediocre chain. The portions are large and it looks like a basic Mexican restaurant. It's not the best I've had but not the worst either. I think every region has one of these "family" chains that the older crowd love. I probably wouldn't come back unless I had to.
