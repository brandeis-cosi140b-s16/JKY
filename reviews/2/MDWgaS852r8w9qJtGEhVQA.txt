Eh. Trying too hard is the phrase that comes to mind. Why, if they bill themselves as fresh Mexican food, do they smother everything in cheese and super salty sauce? I ordered the nachos and hubby had the enchiladas. First of all, his plate was pretty skimpy for $9. Two little enchiladas and a bloop each of rice and beans. My nachos were more generous, but what the heck is the point of nachos when the chips are too brittle to use as a scoop? The running everything through the oven was interesting, but again, what about "fresh"?
Employees were friendly enough and sang a round of "Nacho Man" when I ordered the nachos. It wouldn't have been so bad if the song hadn't sounded like a funeral dirge, but there was no other silliness.
Overall it was all right, but we wouldn't come back.
