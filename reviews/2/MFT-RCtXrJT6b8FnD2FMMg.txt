This used to be one of my hang outs, the staff was friendly the location is great, especially in the spring where you can hang out in the patio.  On to the food... What happened?  I ordered my quesadilla with oaxacan cheese and chili.  It never came but hey did bring me my burrito, a bean and cheese and they messed that up!  My wife ordered their tilapia which might I add was always a winner and it was over cooked and dry!
