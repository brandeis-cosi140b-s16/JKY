This location ALWAYS takes a very long time to prepare your order.  Call in ahead of time or expect to wait at least 20 minutes even when it's not crowded. They over socialize with one another and can't multi task so they stop and chat instead of preparing your order.  They put shredded lettuce on top of all your food, child rellenos, enchiladas, tamales etc so if you don't want it tell them in advance    This is my least favorite location
