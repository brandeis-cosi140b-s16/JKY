Was looking for some good carne asada tacos, thought I'd yelp a place close to home.

Found this place and UGH, so disappointed. I should have known it was to good to be true when I saw how much the tacos were. But decided to give it a try anyway. When our tacos came they were a little bigger than a half dollar coin. The meat didn't have any flavor, and ALL the salsas they offered were MILD. MILD! I couldn't believe it. I asked the girl putting more limes at the salsa bar which salsa I should use for the tacos she says "I don't know, I don't like any of them." WTF!? Are you serious??? I ended up just using the Tapatio at the table to get any kind of heat or flavor in my tacos.

If your looking for good tacos, your better off at a Sonoran hot dog/ taco truck in Phoenix. Will not be going back here again.
