Went for Sunday Easter "Champagne" brunch. My wife and I don't drink Alcohol, but I saw that mimosas were being freshly poured and I thought, well, We'll just have the OJ. The server said that we cannot just provide OJ, but only in combination with champagne, but you can buy a glass of OJ. My wife is pregnant and for over $13 for a buffet which includes Champagne or mimosas, but not just OJ is absurd. I asked for the manager and they would not show their face to me. Food aspect was average with the omelette station being the clear shining star here, it was the one bright spot on a sour meal experience. Mexican food sitting under a heat lamp for significant periods of time never bodes well for flavor, but it's was OK. Frustrated with the whole OJ experience, lacking manager back bone, and average to slightly below average food quality...we will not be back.
