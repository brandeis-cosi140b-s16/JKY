I want to like this place, so I gave it a second try.  Still a Meh.  The food was ok, pricing was a bit better since they have a pick 2 for 8.99 lunch special, but the service was bad (I think they had 2 waitstaff people for I'd say probably 20-25 tables outside - all filled with lunch crowd folks), and the only saving grace was that it was nice outside and we sat out on the patio and enjoyed the weather and people watching.  It was so very average, which is a pity because when deciding on a "lunch train" destination, it was the only sit-down mexican restaurant in walking distance from 2WFC.
