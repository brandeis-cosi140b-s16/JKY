I am so sad to say that this place is very disappointing. The ambiance and quality of food is great! However the service is terrible terrible terrible!!! I was so excited to have a Mexican restaurant near my house. We have given it about 6-7 chances and each time the service has been worse. They are so unbelievably slow and it seems like it's the same two wait staff and never more....for inside and outside. 


Please fix this issue....all you need to do is hire more staff then you'll be awesome! I am not sure when but I will probably give it one more chance in a few months.
