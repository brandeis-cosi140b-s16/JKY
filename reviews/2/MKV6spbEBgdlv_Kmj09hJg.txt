The margs were good for 2 bux they certainly did the trick fa sho!! $2 domestics as well during HH. It was a thurs and HH is from 3-6??? I think. The service was not so great the girl seemed a bit new she had to go "check" to see what the specials were she disappeared for 10+ minutes. Food and drinks took ages but we did endure. They could have dropped a few more $$ into their patio because seriously I dont think its up to code yikes its a really poor attempt if you try to lean on the rail you will see what I mean!! 

Wings = NO (prob frozen)
Salsa = good
Chile Relleno = pretty gosh darn good 
~~~I was thrown a bit because it wasnt breaded and basically all egg white so it was kinda weird but the sauce was soooo HOT you have been warned the green chili is DOPE no fire ass whiners aloud~~~

My paahtna ordered a carne asada burro first it came with mainly onions in it so he asked for one w/out onions, then I guess they thought it'd be funny if they put red peppers all up in it instead. He couldnt handle the heat (he's Italian shhhh) in it but the jokes on them cuz I finished it for him and had no problems. LOL It was good. 

Its close and drinks are cheap I'll sit in doors next time!! It would be better if they got a bit more structured with their specials  they ranged anywhere from 2.99 - 8.99 and maybe a bit smaller portions. I'm not really sure what I'd wait through to get some of that green chili sauce though it is BOMB!!!!
