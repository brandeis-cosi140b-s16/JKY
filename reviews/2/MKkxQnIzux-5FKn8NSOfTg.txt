With all due respect to the previous Yelper who gave this establishment five stars... I disagree, sir. I strongly, strongly disagree. 

I had just left Target when I saw their sign on Decatur and turned in. I was very much jonesing for some carne asada tacos, so I ordered a few of those and a burrito for my dad (I was on my way to his house). Yes, the place was empty and clean and service was ok, so no faults there. But what really got to me, and the big reason this place is two stars, is the following: when I ordered my asada, the guy pulled a tub of pre-cooked asada meat out and reheated it on the grill. That may be standard practice for fast-food places, but it's not what I expect from taco places. Not at all. I mean, making carne asada is the easiest thing ever: just grill up some flank meat, season it, cut it, put it on a tortilla. It's not like I asked you to bring me a space rock from the crab nebula, ok, so please don't re-heat my meat like you're saving all this time in a complicated process. No. The tacos themselves were ok -- ok in the way that you make yourself a grilled cheese at home and are ok with it. 

Flavor-wise, I would not return to this place. Re-heated carne asada wise, I advise you to stay away.
