I wanted to like this place. I picked up a burrito on my way to the stadium and ate it there. It was puny. It didn't even fill me up. There wasn't any flavors to savor or remember. I mean it was cheap like 8 or 9 bucks but I asked them for their most popular item and that's what I got. One positive is they gave chips and salsa which was ok. Nothing special.
