It says a lot about a place when the best part of your meal was the chips and salsa. The service was very attentive, especially considering the huge party of sixteen she had to attend to (that being us).

The food, on the other hand, is comparable to a fast food chain. I split a plate of tacos with a friend. The chicken tacos, soft shell, were decent. Literally, I could have gone down the street, and gotten them for cheaper. The rice and beans were sub-standard - nothing special. Other than the chips and salsa, the TCT was another shining point. A huge quesadilla, pizza-esque creation. It was pretty delicious. Authentic on the other hand? Not so much.

In telling my brother's friends where I was headed off to for dinner, they all had the same response: "Macayo's? Oh...". I now understand. It's pretty much a glorified Taco Bell with a cult following.
