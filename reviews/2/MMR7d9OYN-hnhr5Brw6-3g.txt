This is just about the service.. The girl who was helping us (I don't know her name) long pony tail blonde extremely skinny. We came in it was a group of five and we told her we were doing separate orders by two couples and one single guy she messed up our orders after we told her exactly what to charge on what which is fine okay everyone makes a mistake but she came back around we noticed she charged us all wrong and told her to correct it and told her exactly what cards were for what and she said she understood and shed void it and again she ended up charging us for the wrong thing basically she made the same mistake 3times. Also our other friend paid in cash and she didn't even offer to give him his change back she just pocketed the money and he was going to tip either way but it's a common respect thing to give the change back plus someone so dumb does not deserve 25% tip sorry
