This is a hard one. I went just for the chips which are the bomb!!!! Decided to get 3 hard tacos.... mistake... I had 2 shells with lettuce,sc,salsa and the 3 rd one had the meat. I want toppings on my meat not just eat toppings. Again I went for the chips and next time I will cut in line and buy just the chips and go next door to Einsteins!!!
