I'd give it 4 stars for the margaritas and the service. Our server was really nice and attentive. 

The food though, has much to be desired. Last night we went there and I got chicken tacos. They were so horrible that I only took one bite. My friend got the same thing and she also didn't eat more than one bite. They were that bad. The chicken tasted like it was canned. 

The chips are good and the salsa isn't too bad either. They're generous with the chips and keep them coming, good thing too since that's what I ate for dinner since my tacos stunk. 

Good place to go if you're just looking for 'ritas and chips.
