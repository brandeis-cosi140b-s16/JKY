This is an average Mexican restaurant . This place isn't really worth visting. The staff seemed very un organized as I had three sets of people as me back to back what I wanted to drink. I ordered the vegetarian burrito the food was bland barely warm. The chips and salsa were decent . Skip this place and try another recommended Mexican restaurant on my list.
