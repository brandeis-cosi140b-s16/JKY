Food is good or at least what you'd expect but the service is horrible. In the middle of my order the cashier takes a phone call without even saying "hold on please" then doesn't ask the person on the other end of the phone to hold while she completes my order. Just leaves me there standing. Then shorts me on my change, doesn't apologize when I point it out to her. And lastly, the restaurant was dirty and the bathroom was disgusting
