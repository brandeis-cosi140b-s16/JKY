My friends and I have made it a habit to come here before we bid farewell to the city of sin! The place is decent but the service is subpar. The waitress was almost bothered that we arrived and we felt extremely rushed when placing our order and through out our dining experience. I can't express enough how terrible service can lead to non repeat visits! No matter how good the food!! At least in my opinion!! Dona Maria you need an attitude adjustment or some classes in customer service!
