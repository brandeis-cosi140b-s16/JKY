This place was BAD! Ok, so the complimentary chips and salsa were tasty, but that was the ONLY positive. The margaritas were completely lacking tequila, and the carnitas in my taquitos were burnt to a crisp. My wife's carne asada tacos tasted funny, as well. I'm actually surprised she didn't get sick from them. We will never eat here again.
