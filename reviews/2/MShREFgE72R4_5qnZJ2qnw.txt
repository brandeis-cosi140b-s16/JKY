We went to the Atwood location.  Not impressed.  We all had Chicken Tacos and Chips & Salsa.  For one thing, they charge extra for Chips & Salsa.  Any other Mexican restaurant serves them up as part of the meal.  The tacos were swimming in water.  The chicken was not drained enough.  They completely fell apart.  They were also very tasteless. 

We seem to pass them all the time so we figured we would check them out.  We are from Dallas and can really appreciate a good taco meal.  This wasn't it.   We will continue to pass them up.
