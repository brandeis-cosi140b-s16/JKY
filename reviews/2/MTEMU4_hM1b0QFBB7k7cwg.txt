We have been to Macayo's for many years. We go for the chips and salsa and their wonderful frozen margaritas. We were dismayed to see the completely remodeled restaurant which has left the place without a personality. The revised menu has removed many of our favorites. The chips served to us were stale. The margaritas were without the amount of alcohol that we have had in the past - we could hardly tell that there was any alcohol at all. They were not frozen but very watery. The order for the drinks came out wrong and so did my main dish... sloppy service at best. We ordered fried ice cream and were very surprised to see that the strawberries have been replaced by a strawberry flavored sauce. Cost cutting measures have cheapened the entire experience. We spent our 16th anniversary with this restaurant - it was not the Macayo's we have grown to love.
