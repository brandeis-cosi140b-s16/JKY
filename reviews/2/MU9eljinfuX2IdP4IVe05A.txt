Once again the Mexican restaurant in Stations casinos has changed hands. No longer Guadalajara, but Cabo now.

My fiance and I decided to stop in here late on Friday night after I got off work. I really wanted a margarita to celebrate the completion of my training. 

We waited... A lot. We waited for the hostess to show up. We waited for chips. We waited for drinks... Lots of waiting.... I waited for a water I ordered that never came. So I drank my fiance's. We were never asked if we wanted a refill of our chip basket.

The poor girl serving us seemed frazzled. The busboy was of very little help.

The food was mediocre. My margarita was the star of the night. It was very good and blended well. They did honor the check-in policy and we got sopapillas, which we took to go.

I don't know why Stations Casinos keep changing their restaurants... But this change was not for the better. The only thing I'd come back for is another raspberry margarita.
