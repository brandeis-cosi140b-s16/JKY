Tried this place twice and both times there was confusion with our orders..not a big deal. I ordered the one Taco Meal with grilled chicken. You get one taco, rice & choice of beans (black or pinto) It was o.k. nothing to write home to grandma about..but it was over $9.00 with regular drink. I don't like the layout ..it's like a free for all at the drink station and there are so many employees there it's like their all in there own way..I will say the employees are very nice and apologized for my wait..which was nice. Also, they typically come around and remove your tray and garbage when done eating so you don't have to. I like the pinto beans (not the rice) and both times I went my food wasn't very hot but this was probably due to waiting for large (and I mean LARGE families to get all their drinks) I notice that a lot of people who eat there are quite heavy..The salsa is only pico de gallo..which I hate. I like smooth red or green hot salsa, no chunky stuff. When you order Nacho's or Chips & Salsa they sing this horrible 'Nacho Man" song that I guess Management thinks is cute but it's totally annoying and seems to be a distraction to a already distracted staff. I give the staff 5 stars but the whole concept and food 2 stars
