I usually order on-line for quick pick ups at the Cheyenne location and would assume all Chipotle locations would deliver the same results. 
However when you DO order online for this location, BE SURE YOU CHECK YOUR FOOD BEFORE LEAVING. This location always seem to fail at the online order part. 
I had guacamole that was not even mashed and toppings missing. Order was all but correct. 
There is much to improve for the online order for this one so I'll leave it at that. 
But gosh, MASH your guacamole right! lol
