Eh. Very greasy. The best part of this whole place is the salsa. Everything else could be better and more fresh somewhere else.

I requested a stuffed poblano pepper with rice and beans instead of beans and cheese since I can't digest cheese very well. They said no. I get it but i enjoy when a restaurant tries to accommodate requests.
