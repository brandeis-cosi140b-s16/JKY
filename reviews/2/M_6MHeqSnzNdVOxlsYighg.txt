Four of us went to dinner here last night.  We've all been there 4 or 5 times before and enjoyed the place.  Not last night.  Positives first:  the food was still great as it has always been.  We all had burritos, some chicken, some beef, some green sauce and some red sauce,  We all said the food was fine.  Unfortunately, they have cut back there beer selections to primarily mass produced Mexican beer.  They used to have two or three good craft beers like Oscar Blues, O'dells, etc.  The service was not good at all.  We all marvel led at the fact that there were 8 or 10 wait staff walking around and yet the service was terrible.  At one point my friend had to go looking for our waiter who failed to bring a drink that had been ordered 15 or 20 minutes earlier.  He found the waiter leaning on the service window waiting for and order to come up.  I understand that they were busy but that's no excuse for that kind of service.  I would still like this place if they would improve the beer selection and the service.
