still gets two stars.  I really think the food will get better with time.  

i really want to like this place.  Tonight we had chips and salsa with salsa gringo and salsa rojas, both of which were completely bland.  :(

the taco shells are GROSS.  Its like they took a flour tortilla, and fried it long enough for it to be soggy and soft but still full of fat.  it was just gross.  the carne asada tacos were extremely bland and when it was served they were SWIMMING in black bean juice so it was a soggy mess.  fortunately i dont hate black beans, so i was ok.  my friend got the tofu tacos which were EXTREMELY bland, but she loved them.

the high point of my evening, maybe my week, was the Yinzerita.  get the mango yinzerita--it was DELICIOUS and i was ROCKED.

The atmosphere is great, the food just straight up sucks.  the drinks are good, so this would be a good happy hour spot.
