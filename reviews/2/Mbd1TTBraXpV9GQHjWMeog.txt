Supposedly the oldest Mexican restaurant in the area, we were directed here by our concierge.  The place has a kitchy, almost 80's feel, but it needs some updating.   The menu is a bit too "American" for me; if you expect a truly authentic experience, this is not the place.  I think they get a lot of tourists here, who are used to the more Americanized dishes.  

To start, the salsa is extremely tasty - very fresh - although the chips seemed "bag" quality.  After that, it was all downhill.  Two stars is a gift - it's closer to 1 star.  For lunch, we had the machaca - dry, shredded beef with peppers and tomatoes, and a combo plate of chile relleno and a corn tamale.  The plates look like a disaster when served; sauce everywhere, very disorganized.  The plates came out so hot they must have been microwaved - not a good sign at a respectable restaurant.  Too much sauce, also a sign of laziness and lack of attention to detail.  The rice was not great - not made fresh, and also crisp on top from the microwave (or taken from yesterday's rice pot).  The refried beans were a flavorless mash of canned beans; avoid.  The machaca shredded meat itself was somewhat flavorful, but again it appeared that they make it day(s) earlier and then re-heat it after slapping it on a plate.  Not authentic. The flour tortilla was huge and actually the best thing I tasted, other than the salsa.  Americanized, large plates of re-heated slop.  My advice - find a REAL Mexican restaurant, and stay away from this joint.
