Waiter Pat was great but the queso was awful. Came out and was just like a slab of melted cheese and then re hardened with a ton of grease. It was impossible to eat with my chips so I just ate the tiny cup of salsa I was given. The guy next to me had nachos with chicken and black beans that looked pretty good.
