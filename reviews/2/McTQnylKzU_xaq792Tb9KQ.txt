Had a Groupon so I tried this place for lunch with a couple of friends. The menu was limited, the service was slow, the soda was flat, and the food was not to my liking at all. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.  The only saving grace was that the food was clearly fresh.

If you are looking for good, fast and inexpensive Mexican food, go to Laredo's down the street.
