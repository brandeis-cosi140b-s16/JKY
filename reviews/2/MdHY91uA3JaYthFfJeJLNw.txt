I'm really disappointed in this location.  The last two times I've been here they haven't had the kind of meat I wanted ready.

This Thursday night at 9:20 they didn't have any steak for my burrito.  The guy said it would be ready in about eight minutes.  I told him I'd come back another time and walked out.

This Saturday at 11:30 AM I was in and asked the order taker for chicken tacos.  We both looked at the container that should have had chicken and it was empty.  The lady said it would be about 4 minutes until it was ready.

I waited and got my tacos and they were good.

I think I'll give them a while to get their act together here before I come back.
