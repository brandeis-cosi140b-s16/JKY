$12, 1 oz shots? No fucking thank you. 

Especially after this heartwarming encounter:  


The bartender - a young woman with extensive tattoos on her arms and short black and blonde ponytails - picked a fight with a customer who's server had forgotten him and his wife in the back of the restaurant. 

Mr Customer tried to politely ask for his check, explaining the situation and the bartender defiantly stated that she could not help him and that he needed to pay at his table where his server had forgotten them for some time.

Mr customer very patiently restated his quandary after which he bartender, without a word, stormed off into the back of the restaurant. Upon returning; she didn't even look at mr customer and proceeded to go take a drink order from another customer at the bar (this all happened on 11/29/2014 between 515pm -530pm).

Mr customer ended up getting his bill and signing from some other employee at the bar.

My experience was fine until the check was requested with one last beer. The Same bartender as above sat laughing with another bartender, preparing several other drinks in glasses, and doing something else right in front of me for about five minutes before she finally remembered to crack a top off a beer put it in front of me and hit a button that printed my receipt all in under 10 seconds. 

Way to go to pay attention to your customers.
