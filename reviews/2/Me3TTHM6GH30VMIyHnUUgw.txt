So yesterday we had a going away luncheon for a coworker who is leaving today and we all went to Macayo's for lunch.  We had a group of 20 people so sometimes this can be a challenge but we called ahead and they said they would take care of us no problem.

So we arrive and the tables are all setup and everything started out great all the drink orders and getting us situated.  

We were checking out the new summer menu and a group of us decided to try the habenero lime hot wings.  So they brought them out and no habenero sauce on them what so ever.  I asked about this to our server and he said habenero is sweet and it's on there.  LOL WOOOOOOOOOW I couldn't believe this guy just said this it is one of the hottest peppers on earth.  He said well other people like them so not sure what to say other than I can bring buffalo sauce.  LOL 

Next came main courses a coworker next to me had her order totally wrong twice before the 3rd time it was finally right.  My street tacos were tiny and more of an appitizer than a entree like they were listed.  

So overall this will be my last trip to Macayo's and hopefully my review saves some people from a meal that they regret.
