What can I Say? We saw other friends reviews in the past and were eager to try....:. Sadly will not be returning. 

As avid lovers of Mexican restaurants this experience was not good.

Shrimp tacos were covered in a saucy concoction ..barely any shrimp. I actually didn't eat them and server was too ignorant to notice. Server pushed his own personal likes without regard to guests preference. Was very casual and leaned over the wall to address the table, he had a bad body odor that we all noticed so maybe that wall was a good thing. I saw other staff members on cell phones and goofing around. 

The good points were the chips and the guacamole.... The ceviche was good as well but it needed the salinity of the corn chip.  Margaritas were tasty but nothing special.  Service really needs work and training. 

We entered with best intentions but left deciding dessert as no menu was even available to present to us.
