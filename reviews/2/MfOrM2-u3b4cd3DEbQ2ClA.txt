Came in for lunch on a Monday.  Shame on me for not checking Yelp first before deciding to eat here.

I think Carlos 'n Charlie's is a nighttime weekend drinking spot, but definitely not a middle of the day lunch spot.  It was fairly empty, which is fine, but there was nothing there to make me want to recommend it to anyone.

The young hostess in the front was not particularly friendly nor welcoming.

Angie M. was our server.  She was a little gruff but friendly and attentive.  She made the guacamole at our table.  It was good but it just needed more salt.  Easily fixed.  I liked that she asked if we wanted the jalapenos in the guacamole (I didn't).  

I settled for the cheese enchiladas with red sauce.  They were just okay.  Not horrible, but okay.  JAS had the burger and I don't recall if he liked it or not.

It was just one of those places where I wish we had decided to have lunch somewhere else.
