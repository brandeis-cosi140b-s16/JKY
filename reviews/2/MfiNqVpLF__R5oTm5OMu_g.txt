So Container Park is super cute!  My friend and I went there for the first time last night and decided to grab something to eat at Pinche's.  We love Mexican food so we were pretty stoked on it.

I got the carnitas taco combo plate.  I was not happy with it at all.  I love the simplicity of street tacos, but that means the meat needs to be seasoned properly!  The pork was so bland!  And they don't give you enough salsa to make it taste better.  The corn tortillas were soaking wet so I couldn't even pick them up and eat them like a taco.  I looked like a real gringa using a fork.  The beans were also extremely under seasoned.

I'll probably just go to the BBQ place next door if I'm ever over there again.  Sorry!
