I've lived in Buckeye for almost eighteen years, and I've gone to La Placita several times to have a meal. When I was a child, I thought it was a nice place, but lately it's been disappointing.

Most of their food is mediocre compared to the many other Mexican food establishments within a twenty mile radius. If only they gave more attention and care to make their dishes taste better. The only thing I've ever come to enjoy is their red chile quesadilla. Aside from their chips and salsa, nothing has ever satisfied me here other than this.

Along with their food issues I've had, their servers lack any personality at all. Every time we go here, it seems we are almost forgotten about by our server. The restaurant is never busy when this happens.

But there are positives. The restaurant is one of a kind and a Buckeye original on main street, highway 85. It's expansive and really good looking inside and out with a cool adobe look.

I love this place because it's an iconic Buckeye restaurant, I just wish I would want to eat here.
