Mediocre at best.  My fiance and I ordered our old favorite, chicken fajitas.  The peppers were colorful, but not cooked all the way.  The rice and beans were adequate.

The chips and salsa were not homemade.. AT ALL.  The chips looked like they came from a bag and the salsa was definitely from a jar.  No flavor and nothing special.  

All in all I have yet to experience good Mexican food out here in Vegas and have had better luck back in NY where I came from.
