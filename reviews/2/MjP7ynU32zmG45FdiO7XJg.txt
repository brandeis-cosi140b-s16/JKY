i like this place and go in more often if it wasnt for the evening bartender on sundays (she comes in around 3 or 4 i belive) she always totaly ignores us EVERYTIME last time i went in and seen her i almost wanted to leave. We havent been back in awhile, and im sure if we can find a friendly enviorment we will switch

2 stars for the chips and happy hour prices.

One time we did come in earlyer on a sunday and the waitress we started with was FANTASTIC (than she informed us she was leavng and the evening bartender was comming in ) and thats why we came back. 

also i am a server, and if i served this this i wouldnt have my job long
