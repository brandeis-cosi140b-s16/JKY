I have been to this place twice based on glowing recommendations by locals.  Each time I was overwhelmingly unimpressed.  

As far as Yelp goes this has to be one of the more overrated restaurants on it.  4 stars!  This place is half a star above a Robertos taco shop on its best day.  I will say though, they always have a packed parking lot and seem to have a very loyal base of customers.  I always ask myself when I pass it; is it because the food is so good, or is it because they are no restaurants within a 5 mile radius of this place?  

The food is average and not made with the finest nor freshest of ingredients.  Sure it is cool that they serve albondigas, but it is a half hearted effort.  Once you have the chips and salsa you might as well walk out because you are in for a parade of dull/bland dishes to follow.  

So a 4 star place this is not.  If you are craving some mexican and you live nearby, I say give it a shot.  But, if you have to venuture to this desolate destination I would say you can go with any of the other run of the mill mexican joints you pass along the way.  

*One more thing did a guy really knock this place for having a bad salad with RANCH dressing?  A side salad at a mexican restaurant....who knew?
