I'm probably being generous with two stars. Service was so slow! Our server would take our order and would not be seen until he came back several minutes later to deliver said item. I am definitely a Mexican food snob and this sadly doesn't meet my standards. I did live in Pilsen in Chicago, so don't take it personal Mr. Macayo. I wish I could articulate better what I mean but the food was just generic and pretty bland. Kinda mushy...stuff. I will say the stuffed pepper looked amazing. Salsa seemed to be jar salsa but I wasn't in the kitchen so who am I to say :)
