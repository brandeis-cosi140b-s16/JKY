Went here a couple of days ago on a whim and won't be back! Chicken in the chicken quesadilla tasted like it was just boiled and the salsa tasted like it came straight out of a jar. My husband got tacos de tripas and del pastor. Those were good, but you can't have decent tacos without decent salsa. Not worth what we paid for, won't be back.
