I've had their breakfast burrito and didn't think it wasall that great.  It was like too much of nothing special.  If you're looking for just a big-o breakfast burrito to fill you up though, it will not disappoint!

I wasn't impressed with the lunch selection either except for the nachos.  I could feel my arteries clogging just smelling it and there's definitely enough for two or more there!!  If I'm ever up for it again, that's probably what I'd order - their nachos.  Everything else was meh.
