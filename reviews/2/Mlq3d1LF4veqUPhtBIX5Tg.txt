Looks like from all the previous reviews on here I'm not alone with my complaints. This location is not managed well at all compared to other locations. This evening they were understaffed and the manager on duty herself was not able to communicate well and was quite rude to us. I have also noticed that they have beem trained to flood the enchilada style burritos with sauce to the point that is all you taste. On my first experience with that I took the burrito back and asked for a new one with less sauce and I always make sure to ask for less sauce now on here.
My big complaint from today is how the manager on duty checked us out at the register and denied us any stamps because we bought the taco special meals for Tuesdays. I have always been given stamps even for taco tuesday meals. She tried to tell me it was policy but if I would have known that I wasn't getting stamps up front I wouldn't have come on Tuesday and I would have spent my $17 on a couple other meals and not tacos. If that's the corporate policy I would like to see it in writing and I fel it was a bait and switch tactic they have played me. I will no longer be a loyal Taco Tuesday customer and they will see me much less often there.
