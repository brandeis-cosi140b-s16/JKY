I really want to like this place but they completely messed up my order. My friends and I ordered 3 items (one per person). I had ordered a grilled fish burrito, no beans, brown rice, level 3 sauce, cilantro, and lettuce. I don't understand how I ended up with no fish, black beans, and the rest of the fillings in a burrito. Did I really just pay for a fish burrito without the fish and replaced with black beans that I hate? One of my friends got his order correct. My other friend got a steak burrito without any sauce. If I could rate the food alone, then I would give it a 1 star. Only reason is because I REALLY HATE BEANS. The service was very nice. The offered a little sample of their coconut bark as a thank you for being patient while they prepared the order. I am sure they would have corrected the mistake except for the fact that I went through drive thru and didn't discover the mistake until I got home. I don't live very close so it would have been a tedious trip just to get the correct order. It could have been a bad time to order 3 items through drive thru so, again, I don't mind giving them another try. Let's just hope that if I do go back, then they will give me the order I requested. Crossing my fingers but not holding my breath
