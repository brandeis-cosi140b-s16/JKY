I've been wanting to try this place since it has opened. It's close to my house and to have a good taco spot by the house makes me happy. I decided to take my mom out to dinner for her birthday since she wanted to try something new. Atmosphere and ambiance are definitely cool. As for the food it was not even that good. Everything we ordered was missing flavor. We started off with the guacamole with bacon. That needed ALOT of salt. And I don't even like salty food. I ordered the shrimp taco and the thai snapper. They were OK. You can definitely get better somewhere else for half the price. Their tortillas are weird too, too thick in my opinion. We also tried the corn and that was good, but again needed salt. Taco Guild needs to step up their game on FLAVOR!! I would only go back for a margarita and chips and salsa. Our waitress was not that great either. 2 stars is all you get Taco Guild.
