I'm drunk but I feel that I have a duty to rate this place! Tex-Mex hip hop! This place is not a regular hang for me but when I do stop in it seems to be very "dude heavy", the music always seems to be to loud and you have to yell at the person sitting across from you. I'm not really feeling this place!
