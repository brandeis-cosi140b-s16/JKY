Rude service!! Went thru drive thru and was never said hi too. Just a hand do we can pay.. As we were paying we did give 5.00 in coins and we told her it was and she drops of portion on the ground. Tried to pick it up and it landed in someones spit etc. she never said sorry for dropping it just opened window for an expectant .75 she dropped.. She then proceeded to toss our bags of burritos at us and we had to wait for our soda cause She forgot!!
