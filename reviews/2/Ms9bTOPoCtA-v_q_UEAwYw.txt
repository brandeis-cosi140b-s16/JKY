Here is the deal - I love El Pollo Loco in general.  We eat their chicken often, but this place is consistently slow, slower than the other locations - and it was really bad tonight.  So bad, I had to write about it.  I waited in the middle of the drive through line (where I was stuck, or I would have left) for 20 minutes because they ran out of chicken.  I was getting fairly frustrated and was considering never coming to this location again EXCEPT the drive through guy was so nice and apologetic.  

I didn't take it out on him - he was just the messenger - but he was immediately apologetic, gave us 10% off and a free side.  He was doing the best he could.  If the owner of this chain happens upon this review, I hope he/she will take some time to properly thank the young man who was doing what any owner hopes employees will do - care about the customer.
