We are regulars and enjoy the food; however, the service has started to get worse and worse. Sat for a good 10 min. before we were approached with chips and salsa. Another 10 min. for drink orders. Drinks came, no straws. Asked the little girl, who acted like Wednesday from the Adams Family for straws and she ducked her head, hair in face and went back to the register, playing on her phone. Sat for another 10 min. to order our food.  Our tea glasses became dry, no one came by to refill.  Dinner came!  The best part of the whole experience,as usual, was the excellent food. Please don't let this great establishment go to the dogs. The food is excellent. The service needs to improve.  We are currently searching for a new favorite Mexican food restaurant.
