Funny...when I return to my office after eating here, my colleagues raved about how awesome it it. Not as funny, I didn't agree. I did like the atmosphere and the service, but I thought the prices were a little high for lunch although the serving was good. I had the chicken fajitas which were ok. I thought it was a different kind of style than I am used to so I wasn't impressed.

I'd like to give it another shot before I totally condemn a place that is obviously popular, but it's back to Chuy's and Ernie's for now....
