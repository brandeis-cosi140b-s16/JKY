I'm not going to lie.  Roberto's shrimp burritos is a surefire antidote to tummy-grumbling and really hits the spot (especially when it's lunch time at work and a Mexican food fix is in order).  But, to actually get one here is a hard to accomplish feat.   I have tried a few times to stop by here on my lunch break from work for my burrito fix but it usually never ends well.  Being that I am on a 30-minute break schedule, I always call ahead to order my food so I can just swoop, pick it up, and get back to work on time.  I've done this call-and-order thing four times and out of these four times, they have never had my order ready when I get there.  The last time I just gave up and went to Subway instead because it was faster to get a sub than waiting for them to make a burrito.  Nice people, good food, but they can never get the timing right.
