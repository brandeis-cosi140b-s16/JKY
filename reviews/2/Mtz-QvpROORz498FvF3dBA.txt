They probably should get 2.5 stars, mostly for George the bartender. Happy hour Margaritas were good. Half order of nachos with carnitas, what's with the seasoned salt on the chips? They were almost inedible due to the salt but the carnitas on the nachos was very good. Huevos rancheros, meh. Nothing stood out. Beef enchiladas, average. Pinto mash was equivalent to canned refried beans, bland. The rice, how long has that been around? Dark, tasteless, and almost as bad as Chang Jiang's. 
New restaurants always need a bit of time to settle but my expectations were  higher since Pasquals has been around for years. The food should be refined by now. I could understand service glitches in a new location but had higher hopes for the food.
Overall I'd recommend less salt, rice that's not cooked days ahead, and more authentic seasoning (cilantro, cumin, lime, epazote.) The only fresh item on 3 plates was sliced jalape√±os on the nachos.
I'll give them another try when they settle a bit. Nice decor but it gets noisy. A few too many little kids in the bar area.
