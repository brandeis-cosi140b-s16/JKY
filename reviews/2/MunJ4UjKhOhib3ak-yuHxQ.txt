I think that Serrano's has a lot of hype because of it's been here so long and time builds memories of good times. I on the other hand have not had that I go places for good food I have not been impressed with any of the meals I have ate at a many Serrano's locations. I would really say greasy slop along with the chandler location served me a Fat Tire draft with a lime wow come on. So I say save your money and look elsewhere.
