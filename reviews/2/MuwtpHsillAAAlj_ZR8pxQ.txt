Super loud sports bar.   Food prices seemed high until I saw the portions.  Ok flavors.  But with so many better places nearby I have no reason to return.

Despite having ample room they poorly accommodated our group of 9 by splitting us up and sitting us at two booths - then adding the group gratuity.
