My order wasn't right; I wanted #7 Twelve rolled toquitos and got the #7 carne asada plate; yuck, no thank you very much. 

The fact that there's two menu's with corresponding numbers but totally different items is just plain confusing! Suggestion:  combine the menus into one = less confusion for both parties.
My Pulled beef torta was really good but it was incredibly skimpy.  I was expecting an enormous torta roll to be packed with meat; when instead I only got half what I expected.  

The meat flavor was awesome! But the fact that there were several menus, which was the reason why my order was messed up, really irritated me.
