I'm never coming back to this location. The line server I was serviced by was so rude and unapologetic. He didn't wait to finish my order before wrapping it up hastily and sending me away. I had to remind him that I wanted corn, tomatoes, onions, sauce, and guacamole (YES, he didn't even ask nor wait!). He just slapped them into containers and smacked the guacamole on top of the containers. Gross! I am tempted even now to demand a refund because that service was embarassing; there wasn't even anyone else there.. Didn't apologize and charged me the full $8.95 for this mockery he called service. I was so upset, and I never knew qdoba could upset me. Now I know.
