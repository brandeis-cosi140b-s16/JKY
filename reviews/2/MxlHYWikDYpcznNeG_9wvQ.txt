We have been going to Ajo Al's for 10 years. We have always been satisfied with the food, but not today. I usually order either a chicken tostada or a chicken and bean tostada or a bean tostada. Today, I ordered the bean tostado and it was smaller than its ever been. I didn't say anything, but more than likely wouldn't order it again. It seems to be a trend with restaurants right now to reduce their serving sizes. Well, guess what, I won't be frequenting the ones who do. We ordered two cadillac margaritas at $8 apiece. You would think the least we could have expected would have been decent size portions of food. Our total bill was $39 plus tip. No way, Jose. So, if you're looking for an appetizer, the bean tostada is a good choice. If you're looking for a lunch size portion, the bean tostada is not it. Hey, Al, feel free to comment.
