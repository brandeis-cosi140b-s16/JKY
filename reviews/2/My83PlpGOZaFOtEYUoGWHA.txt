Don't ask for an item with no cheese, because they won't listen. The cooks always add it, even though I've always asked them not too. When I ask, the man who takes the order says " we never put cheese on this burrito" and then I check and BAM, its there. Foods good when order is right, but just beware when you have special orders.
