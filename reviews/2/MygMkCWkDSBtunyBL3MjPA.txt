I had heard about this great Mexican restaurant called Filiberto's. Some of my friends seemed to talk endlessly about how good of drunk food they have. Last night, I was totally sober and looking for some quick food while on a short break from work. I recalled this location and my friends' words that it had great food. I sort of forgot they said 'drunk' food. 

I ordered an enchilada and burrito combo. I really don't know what to say about them besides it was remarkably unremarkable. I am not much of a cook myself but I felt that I could have made the same exact meal with minimal effort, possibly even make it better.

I doubt I'll ever go here again. If I do, I will make sure to be at least slightly intoxicated. Maybe the food will taste better then.
