No, the food is not good. It tastes bland. Nothing exciting about this place. The appearance is bad; falling apart, unkempt, dirty. And the exterior is just as bad. 

It's popular for some reason. You'll see plenty of traffic during meal time. And you may see some horses tied to the hitching post on the weekend. I can't see what other people see in this place. 

If you like Mexican food (and I mean tasty, flavorful Mexican food) then this is not the place you want to try. If you need a quick bite and any old thing will do, this will get you by.
