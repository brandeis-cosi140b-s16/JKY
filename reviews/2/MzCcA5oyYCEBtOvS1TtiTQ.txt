Charlotte airport does not have very many eating options fast food or more. This little Mexican place is a seat yourself and kill some time experience. Overpriced for what it is I at least didn't feel hassled and the staff were friendly while I killed some time with my QUESO. The menu is a bit confusing for no good reason, but airport eating is a low expectation experience. Despite my jet lag I would go back and get a full meal.
