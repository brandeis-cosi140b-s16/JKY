Okay, I lovvvvveeeee chipotle! And I been to this location twice. Most of the staff are nice but that dang short cashier girl is SO rude. She has an attitude every time or just hates her job, i don't know. But I work in the restaurant industry and even if I'm in a bad mood I don't act like that. I try to avoid this location just because of her. Otherwise food is always yummy!!
