As a restaurant, horrible. The waiters are not helpful at all. 
Our food was coming out and it fell, plates shattered. The least that could have been done was let us know, that there was a delay with our food. Instead the waiter came no where near our table. I had to call the waiter to the table and get info on how long it would take the food to come. Finally we got our food, I got the wrong meal. I had to wait another 5 minutes to get her attention. I told the waiter it wasn't what I ordered so she proceeded to look at her book, I know what I ordered why try and argue with a customer. 
My food arrives about 10 min later. She walks off. Literally, about 20 minutes go by my friends and I are thirsty and she is no where to be found. So I that to get up myself and go ask for water. Really!

As a club it's decent. Good music, okay drinks. The bull is the best thing the restaurant club has. 

I definitely don't recommend if you're looking for good food OR good service.
