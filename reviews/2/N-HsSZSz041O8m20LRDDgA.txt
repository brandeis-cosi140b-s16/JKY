We got a couple of Groupons for Chronic Tacos, so decided to give it a try.

The first time we went I got a pollo asado taco and a shrimp taco. They were okay. The chicken was pretty salty. I'm a big fan of salt, so if I thought it was salty, it must have been really salty. The shrimp taco was okay but not particularly memorable.

My wife got a carne asada burrito. It was okay. Nothing special.

The second time we went we got beef taquitos and a chicken quesadilla. I liked the taquitos and the quesadilla much better than the tacos and the burrito. However, I don't really have any desire to go back.

The decor is suited for teenage skater boys.
