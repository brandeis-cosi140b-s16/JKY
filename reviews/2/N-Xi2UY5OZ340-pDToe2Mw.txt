Been to this restaurant about twice now and both times the food has been mediocre at best. I do not in anyway recommend the rice as it came with an incredibly 'weird' after taste. If planning to dine here I recommend you just save your money and put it towards something else. Nonetheless I still recieved decent service, but definitely not enough to prompt me to make another visit.
