Not the worst Mexican I've ever had, but Taco Bell would be a step up. I'm not sure what meat the carne asada is made from but it definitely didn't look or taste like beef and we were concerned when we asked what it was and the waiter looked puzzled before saying, "I think carne asada." Definitely won't come back.
