I have always liked Moes but the pricing is ridiculous.  They charge extra for everything.  I ordered a side of queso and it was the smallest container I have ever seen.  Shouting "Welcome to Moes" seems like a routine job to the employees as something they have to do- not genuine at all.  One lady that assembles the food always looks miserable and acts as if you are bothering her when picking your toppings.  Manager always has a smile and is quite nice but staff. portions and pricing will reconsider another visit for me.
