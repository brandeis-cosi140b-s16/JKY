I'll start off by saying that I love chipotle, but this location is a constant hit or miss. I'm use to having to wait in line, but today was just excessive. Last time I stopped in, there was one person on the entire line filling orders during lunch time. 

There have been times when everything's great but today was just not one of them. This is the closest chipotle to my work, so it's inevitable that I will be back, it just doesn't compare to some of the other locations I've been to. 

All chipotles are not created equal.
