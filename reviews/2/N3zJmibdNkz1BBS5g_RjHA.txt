My family has enjoyed Rubio's for many years. I give an extra star for our previous experiences at other locations, but this location has provided two bad experiences. We will not be visiting this one again. The first time was a few months ago. We ordered a large catering sized meal with trays of different foods to build our own tacos. We picked it up and took it home, only to find out there were no tortillas! We had to drive several miles back for more. Last night was our second poor experience with this location. I observed a customer returning a wrongly made order. I ordered cheese enchiladas with rice and beans. I am vegetarian and do not enjoy meat (one of the reasons I love Rubios). My enchilada was served to me stuffed full of chicken. I returned the order and was given a replacement plate with cheese enchiladas. Looking forward to my meal, finally, I started to eat. They were out of forks so i had to use a spoon. The rice was half-cooked and still crunchy, and did not seem to have any flavor. My companion ordered cheese nachos and the serving size was much smaller than it is served at our preferred location. We both left disappointed and will not be going back to this location.
