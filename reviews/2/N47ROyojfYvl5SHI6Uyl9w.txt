First, let me preface my review by saying that I am not a Mexican food fan. I have Cuban and Puerto Rican family and really prefer these cuisines over Mexican. When I found out that my workplace's dinner to Il Pizzaiolo was changed to Las Velas, I was pretty disappointed. 

My coworkers and I started off dinner with drinks, and I selected the House Margarita. Personally, the drink was a bit strong in alcohol yet way too sweet. For food, we started with appetizers for the whole group; chips with guacamole and salsa dotted the table. This was actually my favorite part of the meal. The chips were perfectly salted and crispy. The guacamole was mild and smooth while the salsa provided a fire roasted kick. 

Though we were a large group, dinner took a very long time, approximately 1 1/2 hours from ordering to serving. We quickly became antsy, especially since our meetings started very early the next morning. We saw folks around us sit down and enjoy their food as we were still waiting for ours. Eventually, our food emerged from the kitchen, including my steak fajitas. The steak was a little chewy and tough while the tortillas were a bit hard. The leftovers have been sitting in my fridge, and I have little motivation to finish them.
