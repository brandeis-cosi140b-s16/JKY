Not like I use to remember this place.
Service was horrible and the waitress only came to our table 1 time and that was at the end to give us boxes and our check then we got a refil on our drinks right before we were leaving. The food definitely has gone down hill and I was let down by this. 
It is really hard to find a good Mexican restaurant and this place was not on that list.
