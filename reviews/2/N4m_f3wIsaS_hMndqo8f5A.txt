Holy mol√©...The service was bad, bad. We waited OVER an hour and a half from the time we go to the restaurant until we got served our food.

The wait staff was meh and we had to flag them down for water or chips or salsa refills, order, extra.  The manager was eve wandering around and did nothing to speed up the process- or even notice!

The food it's self is nothing special or exceptional. The only "special thing they have is a bowl of seasoned mayo along with your chips.. Would not come here again.
