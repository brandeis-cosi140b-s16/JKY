I hate places like this. Overpriced Mexican food that's really no better than a hole in the wall, only here you get to pay at least 75% more than they'd charge you. 

We got a seat at the bar overlooking the hotel lobby. This is the ideal spot to eat at if you're into people watching. Anyway, our waiter comes over and, instead of leaning in to the side and introducing himself (we were just about the only people there) he just stands behind me like a stalker and goes through his spiel. Could I have turned around? Probably, but isn't making that crucial eye contact his job? Doesn't matter, his service sucked throughout the meal. 

We each got the taco combo plate, which came with three street tacos (chicken, carnitas, steak), and rice & beans. 

For one thing, who the hell makes a street taco with only ONE corn tortilla? Vendors on the street selling actual street tacos use two. And even worse, these were like tissue paper. I had to cradle this thing like a goddamn baby to make sure if would keep together while I carefully guided it to my mouth. 

Chicken - dry. Steak - pretty good, nice spices. Carnitas - dry. 

The rice & beans were the same rice & beans you would get anywhere else. 

Once our food got dropped off, our waiter vanished until I flagged him down for the check. At least his crap service saved me some tip money. 

Save yourself more money than I did and eat somewhere else.
