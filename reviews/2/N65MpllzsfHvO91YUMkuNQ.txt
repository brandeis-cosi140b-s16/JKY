They have mexican soda so that's a plus. The good is cheap and the portions are huge. The only real problem I had was being ignored for almost 45 minutes. We were almost done eating by the time we were asked of the food was good. We wanted to order another drink but the sever never came back until 15 minutes after we were done eating. It seemed like she was avoiding us, cleaning the tables around us and not bothering to check on is despite our attempts to look pathetic and needy.
