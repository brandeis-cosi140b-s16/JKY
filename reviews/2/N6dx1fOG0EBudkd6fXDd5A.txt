This place drives me nuts!  It's very convenient for me to drop in and I'm mostly satisfied with their food, it's just that they are so slooooow in the drive-thru.  On my last visit I couldn't even order at the menu.  I had to roll up to the window and give my order.  It's not that the menu wasn't working, the gal just wasn't listening or hearing me correctly or something.  I had a question and apparently questions don't fly out at the menu.  When I got to the window and asked "can you leave a few fries w/o chili on them?" the look she gave me was complete bewilderment - like nobody had ever asked her a question before.  Frustrating.  I'll go here again because it's on the right side of the freeway, on my way everywhere.
