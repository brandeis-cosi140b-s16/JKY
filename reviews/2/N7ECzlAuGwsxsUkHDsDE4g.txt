Food and service was not on par. I first started coming here in 2010, and the food was the best. Staffs were not attentive to serving food. The place smelt like wet rag. Utensils and napkins were not fully stocked. Rice was undercooked and by the time I ate it, the food was no longer warm. Overall, the food was not the same quality as it used to be. Very disapponted.
