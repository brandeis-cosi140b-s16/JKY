Very friendly staff. Ample parking. Fun atmosphere. And that's where the good ends. This place is definitely more for partying it up and drinking, then going in to eat. Unfortunately food was sub-par. We ordered chili cheese fries and enchilada style burrito. The food seemed like the type you would get a generic airport restaurant. 

Really wanted to like it. They kept saying everything is "house made" which tells me not all houses have great food.

I would come back and get drunk. But not eat.
