I was at the Horizon Ridge location this am..other locations offer chilequiles for breakfast if you ask... Not here..other locations have "taco Tuesday".  $1 tacos.. Not here, I asked.. The cook said different managers, different specials....settled on a plato of chicken taco and chicken enchilada..with drink about $9. Food was lukewarm. But it was 9 am and since they are not 24 hrs...(like the others) and don't be fooled by all take out menus that claim 24 hrs...I guess the rice, beans, and chicken did not have time to cook.  I have been to other locations and will return to them...not going back here.
