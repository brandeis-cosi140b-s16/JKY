The young lady working the front could use an attitude check. Not only did she snatch my card out of my hand to swipe it, she had the nastiest customer service I have seen. I was ordering my meal and she stopped in the middle of writing down my order and offered to help another patron. The other customer commented that she could finish my order (I was not taking long I swear!) and I managed to finish up. The floors were recently mopped with a stinky mop that left the floor sticky and I can't stop fuming over the young woman taking orders. 

They charge $.50 to run your card as well. 

Food was good. That's the reason for the extra star. Our food was delicious.

The same girl taking orders came out next to our table and started sweeping the carpet. I asked her to please stop as we were in the middle of our meal and I didn't feel like having a seasoning of dust on my food. She sulked off to the back and began calling us sucias because we asked her to stop. I speak Spanish fluently and work as an interpreter so listening to her cowardly run to the back to talk about us was insulting. Rather than continue to listen and experience this behavior I left. I'm too tired to get into it with a little girl.
