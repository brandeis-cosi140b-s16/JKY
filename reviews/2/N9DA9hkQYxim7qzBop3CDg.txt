My friend and I went here today after she has been raving about it for weeks.  Loved the interior and feel of the place and had high hopes.  I ordered the adovado benedict but was really disappointed.  The pork wasnt that spicy like it promised,  very little hollandaise, way too much pork and the english muffin was super burnt - it was so burnt I could smell it and see it through the dark adovado sauce.  I kind of wonder if they knew the sauce would cover it and were too lazy to re-toast another one.  Unfortunately the waiter didn't come back for a good twenty minutes so I just ate a little of the pork and eggs.  Nothing about this was good, probably because it was just a heaping pile of pork with way too much sauce and all the other flavors were accents.  

I tried my friends "Heidi Pasta", which was good but kind of bland.  Had potential though!  

Overall, I think this place might be good and I just got a bad dish.  No, I got an absolutely disgusting dish.  Maybe it was the cook, maybe it was my taste... Who knows.  I was really pissed I paid $14 for like 5 bites though.  

I wouldn't be back unless someone else is paying, I still have a bad taste in my mouth.  :-(
