For the love of god, would someone open a Berto's of some kind downtown? I will literally give you a million dollars. I will do it $6 at a time in exchange for delicious carnitas burritos and so will thousands of others.

El Portal was sortof el crappy. The service was lackluster and the food meh.

"I think we are out of carne asada. Yeah we are out of carne asada."

How does that happen? Then the green chili was sortof a greenish mush of blahness and no one trained them to wrap a burrito.

I also got a quesadilla which promptly leaked yellow tinged grease onto my pants from boring yellow cheese in a boring tortilla. 

I also hate a tip line on a receipt from a place where you order your food at the counter and pick it up at the counter and fill your own drinks. 

And why did everyone else have real plates while mine was a Dixie?

Subway is next door.
