Yes its a classic, yes W ate here. Wish I could say I love it or even like it. 
First the dinning room itself. The booths are tiny - originally probably made for 2, but they consistently jam in 4. Not comfortable . 
The food, everything buried under a mound of cheap cheese, then thrown under a broiler and brought to you hellishly hot. No flavor, really doesn't matter what you order, it all looks and tastes the same. Don't you love scraping that burnt dead skin from the roof of you mouth.
