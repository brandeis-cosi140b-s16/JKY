My husband and I came here right before seeing a movie. We chose it based on the fact it is right next to the movie theater. The staff was great, prompt with seating and taking our order. 
Yummy watermelon margarita! The food...... Not so great. I got the chopped salad but couldn't eat more than two bites because the dressing was far too spicy. The waiter was nice enough to substitute my salad with a quesadilla, which was nothing great, but at least my mouth wasn't on fire. My husband got the rancho burrito which wasn't too bad. 
When we go back to the movies, we'll go somewhere else for dinner. I wouldn't suggest this place to anyone.
