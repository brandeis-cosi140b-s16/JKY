I was driving down Lake Mead with my Sister and Nephew and did a double take on this shiny Red Truck in front of Lee's Discount Liquor.  Well, I'm a sucker for trying new things and I was on a food truck high just having recently discovered Fuku Burger that past week....so, even though I was on my way to lunch I busted a U-ee and decided to have a taste. 

The operation is a one man show and the guy was nice enough.  So kudos to the humble service.  However, I can't speak too much about the food.  I was pretty disappointed.  Granted I had high hopes from the look of the truck and the overall concept of "Fusion Food," the Korean and Mexican flavors didn't quite well...fuse.   I ordered the pork taco and well it tasted under seasoned and the tortilla was just tasteless.  I was hoping for more flavor from the meat and maybe even just a warm tortilla would've have done wonders to add something to this very sad cold taco.  I really didn't even finish it.

I feel bad giving such a bad review, but hey...it's my honest opinion and I wish Hanshik Taco all the best and perhaps he'll try and put some more pizzaz in his food.

The only reason I gave 2 stars is because the seasoning on the fries were pretty yummy.
