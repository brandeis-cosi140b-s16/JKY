I haven't tried the Gorditas yet..I also think $4 for a gordita is too much...I tried the chihuahua quesadilla and it was ok.. Not really impressed..Didnt really have any flavor and the flour tortilla was burnt..I think I could make a better quesadilla at home...the two women behind the counter were rude and not very helpfull..
