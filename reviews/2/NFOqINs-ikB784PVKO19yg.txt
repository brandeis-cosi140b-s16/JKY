Food is good nothing to get exited. Unfortunately can't say the same about the service. It's slow understaffed not concerned about the customer and always think that apologies will solve the issue. Some and have no idea what customer service is. Have never been properly trained. If you come on Sunday's prepared to spent at least 2hrs and that is 1:15 minutes to get seated wait on take your order and bring you drinks if you have a good waitress. The other time is for food to come out to your table. I have been to the one on litchfield field and way far better service food is about the same bout your in an out in half the time. 
I guess the owners have no idea what is going on or choose to ignore it. But its their business.
