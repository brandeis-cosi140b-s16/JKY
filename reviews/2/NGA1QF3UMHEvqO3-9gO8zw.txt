My mother was staying at the Cosmopolitan for a conference, so I spent the day with her after picking her up at the airport. We hit up China Poblano because it was in the hotel and wasn't fine dining  and looked more interesting than the burger place next door. I was honestly disappointed. 

The food was average - some of it was very good, like the dumplings, and then some of it I've had better at super cheap joins in Chinatown. I was feeling boring and ordered tacos, and they were really bland. It wasn't BAD, it just wasn't worth the price. The cocktails were good and the service was great, however, so kudos to the staff. 

The worst part for me, however, was the seating. I would have enjoyed this experience infinitely more if I hadn't been expected to sit on a bench or a stool. To my eye (we sat on the "Mexican side" of the restaurant) there was only ONE area where any of the seating had a back - along a wall, which faced ... more backless, wooden stools. It was so impossibly uncomfortable, I found it really difficult to be objective about what I was eating. Half the seating looked like high school lunch tables. It was really awkward. I promise, there are chairs in Mexico! No matter how okay some of the food was, even if somebody offered to comp my entire order there, I probably wouldn't go back, just so I wouldn't have to sit there again.

Should have gotten burgers next door.
