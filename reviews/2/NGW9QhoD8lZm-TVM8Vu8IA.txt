Great food but service was lacking.  I went with a group of friends months ago.  I asked for my food not spicy at all and a friend asked for it very spicy.  When it came out, they had got it mixed up.  Mine was extremely spicy and his was not spicy at all. No big deal, just send it back and have it remade.  It came out the second time, and same thing, the food was the same.  Mine was still extremely spicy and his had no spiciness at all.  We complained to the waitress again.  My friend and I decided to switch food so I had his and he had mine.  The bill came and they charged us for both.  

While the food was amazing, the service was lacking.
