My family and I went there for the first time on a Tuesday, which is listed as a senior discount day (20% off) on their website.  Waitress asked the manager about the discount and he would not apply it and I am 75 years old and have all white hair!  Then, they limit you to only 2 small bowls of chips and any more than that costs extra, and there were 4 of us.  The service wasn't too good either and the waitress didn't speak very good English.  Lastly, the food was just average Mexican food. I have experienced much better Mexican food at other restaurants nearby.  It's very unlikely that I will be eating there again.
