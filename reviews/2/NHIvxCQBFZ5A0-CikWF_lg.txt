Three words: Too Many Colors. 

I was taken aback by the fifties-diner-esque magenta, sky blue and black tiles and neon lights all over the walls. My eyes were entirely too dazzled to comprehend that this is supposed to be a Mexi joint. 
We ordered a taco/enchilada combo plate and the chicken fajitas with a couple of margaritas. The food was nothing to write home about. American-style mexican food, slightly less flavorful than El Torito. The margaritas (well tequila of course, with extra ice), were not too watered down and had decent flavor and gave me enough of a buzz to run across the street on the way home into oncoming traffic to get "something sweeeet!!" at CVS.
