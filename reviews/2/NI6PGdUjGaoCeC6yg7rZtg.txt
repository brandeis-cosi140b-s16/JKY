Ok call me a picky bitch but because I was born and raised in Los Angeles, I am very discriminating when it comes to Mexican food. I know Mexican food damn it. My son is half Mexican. I have (ex) Mexican in-laws. I watch Mexican soccer and yell "goooooolazo golazo! azo! azo! azo!" too. So I know what's up. This place is the type of place you take people who are too scurrred to try REAL Mexican food ("is that a tongue on your plate?!").  This place doesn't even serve tripa, lengua, cabeza...you won't find Mexicans up in here! That's not authentic to me. Authentic to me is a place that serves the aforementioned body parts (yum) and bottomless horchata...when I came this place didn't even have horchata. WTF.
