I love their food. I have always gone here. However, this one first of all had no cheese, no salsa or peppers available. I asked to have some peppers and instead of telling me one moment the rude guy with the hideous pony tail asked me if I wanted him to scrape it out for me? What kind of customer service is that? I responded with no sir I do not want you to scrape it out while the rest of the workers just stared at me.
