Foodies beware of food poisoning.  My friend and I ate here late on 6/7/2012 and he experienced food poisoning  later that night.  I had the carnitas bowl with root bear and was fine.  He ordered the steak bowl and served himself a water with lemon. The only difference between our meals (besides the drinks) was that my bowl had corn and guacamole.  Neither one of us ate anything else after that so my guess is that the steak was bad.  Was it left out for too long or was is handled improperly?  Your guess is as good as mine.
