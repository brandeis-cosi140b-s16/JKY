There's one word that best describes this place: Ehhh. NO really, it's nothing special and it's definitely on my list of mexican places to avoid in Arizona. Yes, I'm one of those annoying people who like to compare everything to California... so this is for my northern Californians who are searching for a place as good as La Vic's :(

I came here last fall after a night of drinking, and of course, like any other drunk person I just wanted some greasy ass mexican food. I got the carne asada fries and I remember them satisfying my craving.

Fast forward almost a year, my bf and I were starving and just needed a quick fix in the middle of lunch and dinner. We head over to Filibertos (completely sober btw) and order the carne asada fries. What a freakin disappointment... the fries were super bland and I felt like I had to force myself to finish them even though we were really really hungry.

Moral of the story: Filibertos is only good when drunk. But then again, Denny's is like a 5 star restaurant after a night of drinking. So all I can really say about this place is ehhhhh...
