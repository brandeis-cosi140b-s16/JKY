I was really excited about this place opening so close to my house.  We went a few times before their grand opening.  The first time was really good where everything was fresh and tasty.  The shrimp tacos were really good.  But the two times after we went back they were inconsistant.  It just wasn't as good.  I tried the chile lime rice and it was mush.  I think we'll try it again but only after they've been open a while and hopefully get more consistant.
