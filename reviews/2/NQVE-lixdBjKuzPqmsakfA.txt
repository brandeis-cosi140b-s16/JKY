My husband went here on a whim despite the reviews. He asked for crunchy tacos for me, they made one crunchy and the rest soggy and soft. Not good. The flavored were strange and they didn't seem to compliment each other. All around the service wasn't good and neither was the food. We are here on vacation and will not return to this restaurant. So many other great choices here in Vegas! Save your money and go elsewhere!
