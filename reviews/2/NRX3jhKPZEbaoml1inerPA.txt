Stopped in for a quick lunch with a friend on a Wednesday afternoon. The staff was friendly and helpful and everything was impeccably clean and I enjoyed the decor, loved the tufted sofas we sat on! My cobb salad was pretty uninspiring for the price, however. There wasn't much that enticed me on the menu and I doubt I'd go back... maybe for a fancy milkshake, but the menu wasn't clear enough on what that entailed for me to lay down 9 clams for it. Just not the lunch spot for me.
