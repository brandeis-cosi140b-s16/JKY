Can't say I was real wild about the burrito.

I got an "all meat" burrito which was more expensive because I don't like rice/beans in my burrito and that's how they usually make theirs (now I know).

The carne asada itself was salty, not really great quality meat. It was chopped super fine which made it greasier and more mystery meat-ish to me. It was expensive at almost ten bucks because I didn't opt for the cheap filler of beans and rice. Not to mention they dripped some guacamole in it vs actually putting some on it.

Wouldn't go back and definitely wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Only reason I didn't give them 1 star is because at least the dude at the counter seemed cool.
