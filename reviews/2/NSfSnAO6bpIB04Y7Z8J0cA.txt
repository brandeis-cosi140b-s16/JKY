The service was very sweet and well-meaning, so as an experience where I sit still in an air-conditioned space and people bring me stuff, this was fine.

The stuff... not so fine. Let's get the party started with... stale chips. I am also skeptical that the sangria contained any alcohol at all. While I'm grateful to have not had a buzz on with a drive home, if I'd wanted alcohol-free fruit juice, I would have stopped at Fry's for a quart of cran-grape and paid less than the $6.50 that went with a small glass of mostly ice.

The steak fajitas consisted of a great mass of caramelized onion and seven small strips of the most gristly steak I've ever encountered. The fajita strips I buy at the supermarket are openly "meat leftovers we can't sell otherwise," and they have less gristle. I seriously worried about pulling a tooth loose while trying to bite through these and had to give up on wrapping the fajita fillings in tortillas, which is kind of the gist of the fajita experience.

Or not, since only two tortillas are provided. Do not look to the guacamole for flavor; it could well be the shortening-and-green-coloring kind sold at the supermarket.

Oh, and the free wi-fi wasn't connected to the internet. Um, what's the point of wi-fi,then?

I went into Manuel's thinking "I'll be adventurous, I'll support local business, I remember having really good food for cheapish at a Manuel's right after I moved to Phoenix." I left feeling that the proprietors were laughing at people like me for paying $15 an entree for food that doesn't measure up to most people's home leftovers.

That's the last time I impulsively stop at a restaurant before checking Yelp, as any number of people could have warned me.
