Today was my first visit to this new business. The outside is painted a bright light blue and is very inviting. The inside is very clean and new and has nice tables and comfy chairs. Staff was friendly and professional.

 Now- on to the food. I opened the menu and was presented with voluminous of all but impossible to read and understand items. The entire thing is in spanish with english subtitles printed in a white/black reverse over all these photos of the food--it might get clearer after a margarita or two. It was so confusing and hard to understand.

 Like many new restaurants they are obviously experiencing growing pains with trial & error. There are no traditional combination platters available but rather all the different food categories are listed out separate. 

 I ordered a tacos, the chicken was pretty good, grilled and nicely pulled, but the carne asada was inedible, it was almost 100% comprised of gristle and sinew, and sadly, had zero seasoning. The "spanish rice" is not spanish and is just white rice with frozen mixed veg (carrot, corn, peas, beans) added to it--very strange and unappetizing.  Even the salsa verde was lacking, this is just ground up pickled jalape√±os and does NOT compliment the food one bit.

I HATE giving such bad reviews on a new business, I want them to succeed, we need a great mexican restaurant in Monona, but unless they make some sweeping changes and soon, their days are clearly numbered, sorry to say.
