Went back for a second time, today was the worst. 1 1/2 hours later food came out. There were six of us 2 meals were right the other 4 were all wrong. I think the price is to high and the food isn't worth it. $3.95 for a Coke and they give you a small glass. I will not be going back to this place :(
