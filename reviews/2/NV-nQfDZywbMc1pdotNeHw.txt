I am very sad to say that I was disappointed with the food at Barrio Cafe. I ordered the carne asada tacos ($15.00 plate) and the meat was literally flavorless. 

By the end of the meal, the bill for two plates of tacos and a couple of beers was just shy of $50.00. The best part of the whole meal was the bottled beer. 

I was really hoping to like this place because I just moved down the street and was looking for a cool neighborhood spot to start hanging out. Besides the extremely high prices and the extremely terrible food, the service was exceptional.
