First time visit. I sat inside with a group of six around 8pm. Service was pretty good, but food was definitely of below average quality. Especially for the price. I thought the food would make up for the exceptionally sweet, and definitely a store bought mix, margarita, but it didn't. Outdoor area seemed nice, and it was extremely busy. Probably wont be going back. Pricy food for what you get, pricy drinks unless it's happy hour, and awful margaritas.
