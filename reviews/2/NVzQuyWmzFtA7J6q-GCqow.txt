Not the worst, but for sure not the best.

It is what I like to call American Mexican food. 

If your looking for authentic, this is not the place. If your looking for a large portion of beans and rice with still tasty food, this is where I would come. I'm not saying this is horrible food, I'm just saying that when I'm craving Mexican, I'm for sure not coming here.

The wait staff was quick on their feet, and the Margarita I got was full of booze. So no complaints in that department. Nice outdoor seating! Great Bar area!

I still giving this place only 2 stars because I have had good Mexican food, and this is just not it. 

If I had to rate it for decent food not as a genre.....3 stars, but there are so many other things I could eat for the same amount at better food joints.

To recap- If you are hungry for American Mexican, this may be your favortie place after one visit.
 If you want Mexican, no no no. Forget it.
