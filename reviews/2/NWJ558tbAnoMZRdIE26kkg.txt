Overall was hoping for fresher food. Ran here to grab some to go food and even though I was the only person in line to start a few people came behind me and it got disorganized, they kept stopping my order to get others started. Don't know why I had to wait when I was there first, I only ordered for two people, but that had a hard time with that. I got tacos ground beef and the pork. My husband got a chicken burrito. None of the ingredients looked fresh sitting in the pans. The pork had good flavor but was dry, the beef was super salty. I asked for a tub of queso instead of the small sides, they charged me like $12 for the queso ms chips? You mean chips don't come with it? Also, it's hard to mess up cheese dip but theirs really had no flavor at all to it. The only thing that was fresh was the chips.
