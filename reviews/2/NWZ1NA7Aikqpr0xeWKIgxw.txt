1 steak Burrito,1 chicken quesadilla..26 dollars,,,the burritos are very sloppily put together,and you have to specify NOT enchilada style or they will drench your burrito in sauce which will cause it to fall to pieces,service was terrible,the kids working the kitchen were joking about how "every day is a bad day at cafe rio"?!..very odd to hear before handing over 10 dollars for a burrito,the drinks(horchata,lime etc) were gross like they had been sitting for awhile..skip this place,you can get mexican food on every block in avondale and spend half what u would here...unless you like eating a 10 dollar plate of pinto bean mush....gross.
