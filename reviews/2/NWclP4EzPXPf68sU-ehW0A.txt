Gonna have to give this one a "no thanks" I'm afraid.

Went today at lunch with a couple of co-workers, and the food was totally underwhelming.

Nothing "special" at all about any of the items.  The guacamole seemed to have some sour cream in it to stretch it - tasted very bland.  Red and green salsa served with run-of-the-mill chips did nothing for us.

Meat in all the dishes was tender but not very flavorful.  Shrimp Diabla sauce was neither hot nor very tasty.

All in all, a disappointing lunch.  Won't be back, and with all the good options in town for excellent Mexican food, I was sad that we did not find a good new place to frequent.
