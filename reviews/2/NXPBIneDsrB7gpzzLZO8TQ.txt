Never again! Bland, boring, cafeteria style food. The beans tasted stale. The machaca beef in the taco was dry and tasteless. The rice has NO flavor. The only thing that was remotely good was the tortilla around the "red" burro which consisted of stew meat and beans. Nothing "red" about it. I requested the hot salsa to pour over everything just so it would taste like SOMETHING. Decor and customers are circa 1965. It was at least clean.
