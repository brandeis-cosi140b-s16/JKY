Me and the Madre went here a couple of weeks ago looking for a good place to eat in Mesa... we happened upon Susie's. We entered through their crazy awesome door that was HUGE! and was seated quickly. the menu was okay looking, lots of pictures... that's kind of a turn off for me. blah. Menus with pictures *shudder* anyway, the food was drab and not worth the fuss. The decor was drap also and everything needed to be disenfected. or atleast hosed down. The wallpaper and the countless tiles are all from the 70s. I didn't hate this place, but I won't be back unless I'm promised a VERY strong margarita.
