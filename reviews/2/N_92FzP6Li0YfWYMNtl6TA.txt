I came in here hoping to experience a delicious carne asada torta.  On the other hand, the carne asada was very hard to chew and not pleasing to the taste.  The restaurant's interior is clean and inviting with TV screens.  Many business professionals make up the lunch time customer base.  I was just dissapointed with the carne asada.
