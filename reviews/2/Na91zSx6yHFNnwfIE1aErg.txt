This place was a let down. They were out of almost everything. The taste was bland with no fusion or effort. The service was just okay. Nothing stood out. In a town that has a few Mexican restaurants, this did not seem like a contender. I heard they are a Phoenix wide chain. Hopefully they will step up their game.
