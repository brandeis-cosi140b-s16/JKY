I keep trying new taco places in Henderson/LV but they keep disappointing me! I don't know why i keep wanting to explore when I've already found a place that I love! (Taco y Taco)

I was craving a fish taco and put that into Yelp. Most of the results were Rubio's - which I totally would have been okay with because I wanted a crispy taco! But we decided to try out Las Famosas de Jose.

FOOD:
I got a fish taco and an al pastor burrito. My eating buddy got a Ferdo 3 lb burrito. Our total was about $25 which means the giant 3 lb burrito was about $15! Yikes.

The fish taco was soooo disappointing!! Grilled and the fish was in cubes. Very little flavor, I dumped a bunch of salsa on it. The al pastor burrito was better but it was mostly meat and I prefer a little more balance in my burritos. It also started falling apart when I ate it because they wrapped it in paper and not foil. The 3 lb burrito is HUGE, cut in half - each half was the size of my regular burrito. I had a bite and liked it! Just not for the price.

Salsa bar was ooook. Not too many spicy options and no cilantro/onion!

The workers were very nice though - I asked for a piece of foil to wrap up the remainder of my my burrito and a plastic bag to carry everything. I asked for a water cup but they said they were out of the small cups and couldn't give one to me. What??? Never heard that excuse before.

VENUE:
No frills place. You order at the counter and pick up your food there. They have forks, spoons and knives available for you and you can leave your tray on the table once you're finished. NO bathroom, but there's a hand sanitizer dispenser on the wall.

Location is a bit sketch so keep your eye out at night!
