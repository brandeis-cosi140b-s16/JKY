I was really excited that this place opened so close to my house being that I love breakfast burritos. First time I went, the burrito was great. Second time, I'm pretty sure I was served the potatoes from a few days before mixed with fresh ones along with a bunch of bacon grease. I gave this place another chance this morning hoping the last time was just a mess up. I saw the cook cleaning the grill with a cleaning rag and then directly reach into the container of potatoes and put them on the grill... before washing his hands or putting gloves on.. GROSS. If they are doing this IN FRONT of the customers, who knows what goes on when no one can see! I couldn't even eat the burrito, I was so grossed out. Guess I'll have to keep driving the extra few miles to Los Favritos.
