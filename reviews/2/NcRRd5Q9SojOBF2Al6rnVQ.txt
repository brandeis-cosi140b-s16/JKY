I had a friend come in from out of town and I wanted him to have the best/authentic Mexican food.  I asked a friend who lives in and is from Tempe, where I could take my out of town friend to get such food.  He said "Amados".  Since I trust this friends taste in food, I trusted he was right.  Ohhhh was he wrong.

First there is only like 4 parking spots, and the drive-thru would be hard to maneuver thru if the parking lot was actually full.  When we walked in, it looked dirty, and like the place hadn't had the floors mopped in days.  I got the chicken burrito with sour cream and guacamole.  Mind you, I paid about $2.50 for extra guacamole since I'm a guacamole nut.  When our food was ready, there was some liquid green stuff on my burrito and liquid green stuff in a cup that I could only assume was the guac.  First, the small cup they charged me for wasn't even worth the extra $$ I paid.  Second, the guac was horrible.  It should not be liquid; I understand that some may not like it lumpy, but IT SHOULD NOT POUR!!  I figured I needed to have an open mind, I mean, my friend that recommended it never stopped raving about the place.  As I cut into my burrito, it was liquid on the inside.  It wasn't grease, it was like the water from boiled chicken; which the chicken had a funny taste to it.  I also believe for what I got, it was way overpriced.

The bar that had extra salsa, carrots, etc I would not touch with a ten foot pole since it looked like it had been sitting there for hours and not changed out (it was on a mobile cart that had a broken leg).  Not once did any worker come out to check on the extra bar items. 

I'm only giving it a second star because the burrito was big and filling.  That's it. 

When I asked my friend why the hell he recommended it, he said because its open 24 hours, and late at night, its the best food to get.  I'm sorry, but I'd rather go to Denny's.
