I hate giving bad reviews, but this place is not good.  The roasted jalape√±o rellenos were terrible.  The Pollo Fundido is supposedly one of the more popular dishes, but was very bland.  The trio of salsas and chips they provide were ok, but nothing special.  The wait staff were friendly and attentive.
