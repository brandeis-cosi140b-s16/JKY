AAAACK?  Cozymel's where have you gone???

I was heartbroken this week to find that my favorite queso spot is no more.  So, we rounded the corner to Paradise to see how their queso game is.

It's not.

Forget about real cheese, I don't even think this was velveeta.  I'm pretty sure this is the industrial-sized canned cheese.  I didn't realize I was a cheese dip snob until visiting Paradise.   Avoid at all costs.

They get two stars because this is obviously a great place to come have drinks and watch a game.  Lot's of TV, sports memorabilia, stools, benches and friendly staff.

But I nearly choked to death on the tortilla soup which was 5 parts jalepeno, 1 part soup.  (they were good enough to take it off the bill....maybe because i was horizontal in the booth, red-faced, choking and sputtering...not one of my finer moments).

I'd say swing through for drinks, if you need a friendly spot to watch a game, but keep it movin to somewhere else for food.
