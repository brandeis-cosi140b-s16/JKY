I went here as opposed to the food court next door to it on the strip but was not in love by any means. The food was very mediocre. My party and I got two cali burritos and a two taco plate. It was medium priced which is expected for a place on the las vegas strip. The burritos had hardly any avocado and were just not that good. They charged us for a small thing of salsa and the meals came with no chips. 
Service was lacking, our waitress was blah, a very unenthusiastic guy asked to take a picture of us as some promotion (way to try get money), and the ambiance was poor. At first glance it seemed cool, lots on the wall, but we were seated in a booth that had almost no lighting. The music was random also, it didn't set the mood at all. It wasnt a one star experience, it was just far farfarrrrr from amazing. Wouldn't go back and am surprised its there.
