I use to go here ALL the time. It was one of my favorites. Went here last week and WOW has the place changed. 2 bowls NO chips or drink and my total was $17.50 ??? That's insane. The price could have been justified if my bowl had been completley full, but it wasn't. Maybe it was due to the 17 years old running the hot well, but honestly for the price and amount of food I was given I will not be returning any time soon. Such a disappointment because like I said this use to be one my favorite places.  oh well.
