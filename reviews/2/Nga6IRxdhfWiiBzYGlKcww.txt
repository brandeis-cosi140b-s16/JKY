Edible but in no way enjoyable. The "Perfecto Patron" margarita was far from perfect. The menu states that it's made with lime juice, but the taste was strictly syrupy mix. The corn tamale appetizers were a sacrilege: there is no reason to deep fry tamales, which is why I stupidly ignored the menu's description that they were "fried crisp." Unfortunately, regarding the tamales, the menu was accurate. The final disappointment was the shredded beef burrito, which was simultaneously spicy and lackluster. The one decent item that we ordered was also the least Mexican--the steak salad. And it was not a WOW! rendition, it was just, thankfully, not a What!?! It is also worth noting that there is a charge for the perfectly average chips and salsa. All in all, our experience was underwhelming and unsatisfying. I won't be heading back.
