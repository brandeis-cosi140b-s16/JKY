Good ol' Chipotle.  When you really want that oh-so-comforting food coma.

This particular location is quite convenient, but they still have some practicing before them.  The line is slow, the proportions aren't consistent, and they really need more practice rolling burritos.

But I will be back.  And then I will take a nap.
