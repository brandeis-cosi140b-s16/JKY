After reading the reviews I feel as if I wasn't at the same restaurant as the other reviewers.  Yes the place is pretty, but the similarities ended there.  Our server seemed uninterested, and slow would be an understatement.  It took 15 minutes just for the drink order!  When the food finally came, we sent a shrimp dish back, but it could've been 3 more.  Although one of our guests enjoyed his food, I would say we are not going to be back anytime soon.
