I feel so bad but, this place sucks.  They try hard but,  the chef must have burned his tongue or something cause everything is overly salted and the flavor is so boring.  

I mean even the guacomole tasted whack.  I had to do my own ghetto cooking at the table to make it taste better.

The reason why I feel bad is because they have some awesome tortillas and their shrimp ceviche is pretty good for las vegas. (which means it still sucks but, it doesn't taste like ass)

Don't go unless you get just tortillas and a beer.  It's too expensive for how bad the food is.
