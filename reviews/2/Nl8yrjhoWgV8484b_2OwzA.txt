I ordered an enchilada and a burrito lunch combo and couldn't tell which was which --  not a great start .... I had the beans with it so the whole plate was an unappetizing grayish- brown.  The chicken in the meal was the same color... 

Bland; not terrible -- you could live off of it if you were starving and that's about the best thing I can say about it.

The Salsa that came before the meal was EXCELLENT; so it wasn't a totally wasted lunch.  

Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing; and hit them on the wrong day.  I stay in search of a really good Mexican meal in the area!!!
