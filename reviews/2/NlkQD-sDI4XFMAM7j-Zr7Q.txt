Good effort decorating, reminds me of an old dingy Chili's restaurant. It was super dark during the day. What I did like was that they have a complimentary salsa/chip bar during lunch, they have really good enchiladas but do not get the chile relleno, the salad was bland and the tortilla soup was old. My bf ordered a chimi and although it wasn't greasy and gross the options for meat were gross, we're talking chicken, ground beef (?) and machaca. If you are looking for authentic Mexican, definitely don't recommend it, but if u r looking to drink and have some appetizers than definitely.
