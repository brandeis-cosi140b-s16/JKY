Open 24hrs. Which is probably one of the reason why we decided to go here, since everything else was close and we wanted to get our grub on. Came here with the family and order 4 soft carnita tacos, 2 carne asada fries, and a steak quesadilla. Wanted to throw in a few hard shell tacos for $0.99, but apparently that price is only good on Tuesdays, and regular price was $2.19. WTF?! Anyways, I was not too pleased with the outcome. The meat for the tacos were WAY too dry and the fries were way too soggy! When we asked for salsa and sour cream to-go, the cashier lady said that they didn't have any. Obviously, that is a lie! After getting her to admit that they do have it, and after charging us $0.65, we got our salsa and sour cream. Needless to say, we will not coming back here.
