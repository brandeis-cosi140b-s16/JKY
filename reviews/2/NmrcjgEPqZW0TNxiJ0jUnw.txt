Cadillac To Go is a little stand with two tables, just off the new Cadillac restaurant and bar, in The Golden Nugget. The food was all right, but man what a cluster! We went late night. Two of my friends ordered the same beer, but they only poured one. When my friend asked about her draft, after we all had our food, the woman responded with "I know" and walked away. I don't think she did know, though she eventually returned with the beverage.
I ordered a breakfast taco, that was supposed to come with eggs and hash browns. I was served beef tacos instead, and when I took them back, was given something else I did not order. I  gave up. I was hungry and it did taste pretty darn good. The full restaurant probably has better service, and we would have been better off eating at a sit down, time wise. 

I think that management needs to fine tune the service here. Based on how awesome CJ is doing next door, it is only a matter of time before they get this sorted out.
