I'm frequently in town for work and this place is within walking distance.  Of course, when I'm in a new town I plan out my culinary treats via Yelp.  I seriously could not imagine travel without it.  I had to say I when I set my eyes on nachos with feta and garlic sauce, I knew I had to experience it.  But what came out was cold and I left most of it on my plate.  I was hoping for a creative masterpiece and it was more like a paint by numbers done by a blind person.  I think the positive reviews must be by college kids who have not developed a refined palate or the jungle juice has dulled their senses.  Don't get me wrong, I wasn't expecting gourmet and I get down with dives...but seriously, at least flavor your chicken and heat your food.
