I came in here with 3 girlfriends to have dinner and drinks to catch up. After ordering several dinners, drinks, and appetizers our service drastically changed. We attempted to order several different bottles of wine, but because they were I'm between menus, they were out of everything we asked for. We then asked to buy a bottle of their fall wine from the manager, Alex. He completely ignored out request and didn't even bother to come back to our table for 30 minutes. He didn't apologize, just told us to Come back tomorrow night.  We have all been here at least 5 times and none of us will be making it back after tonight. The one positive was our waiter, G. He attempted to be helpful anywhere he could.
