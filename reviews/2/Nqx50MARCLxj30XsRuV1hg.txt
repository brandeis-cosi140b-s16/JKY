My family and I come here often. The place is always packed, wait time varies for a table. The food is good, never had any problems with service.

But the thing that gets me is, the chips. I know it sounds stupid. But they charge you extra for another round of chips. And when you have a family of 4, hungry and waiting for the food that is ordered to come through.  We are going to plow through that shallow basket of chips, like nobody's business. And I like having the chips with my rice and beans... Like most people. 

I don't think that a second helping on that shallow basket of chips is going to bankrupt this restaurant. Especially when our bill is usually between $50 -$65 (thats including the tip) I know your restaurant is making a killing especially on the weekends. We pay damn good money eating here. You need to stop being so cheap... Because we aren't!...Just saying. 

The 2 stars is little dramatic but I am hoping the restaurant see's this and other responses, in hopes that they stop being so cheap.
