Had lunch here on Thursday 4/14 at around 3:00pm. While most of the reviews i've since read complain about the quality of the food matched with the high prices for Mexican food, I actually found this to be a respite from what we had become accustomed to during our stay. For once, I thought the two nearly equaled each other, although again, we've had much better.

Had the fish tacos which were fine. The fish was grilled nicely, no bones, fresh cole-slaw on top. Nothing to really complain about. GF had some kind of pork sandwich which looked messy. She didn't seem too impressed as she didn't finish it and avoided the bread entirely. Good drinks to start (nice to see 'Chelada' on the menu) accompanied by warm, fresh chips and three types of salsa. Should have just stuck with that combo.

What really distracted me from the experience once again was the service! This time it was the hostess. We were greeted and when I asked if we could sit outside she said she had 'nothing outside'. OK, well can we wait? I asked. Irritated glance and pissy attitude in full display, we were told we could wait at the bar. Fine by me. Then when she came by not 7 minutes later, she asked if I had settled my bill with the bartender, as if we were the ones holding her up.

To top it off, she seated us at the back of the patio when there were many more tables that had just been cleared which overlooked the pool area. It later became apparent that she was either holding these tables for friends or for those who were willing to shell out for the extended service. Oh, and she didn't give us menus. The waitress had to go back and get them. Nice job.
