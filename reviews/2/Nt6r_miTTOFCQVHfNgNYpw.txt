Got a 5.00 small burrito bowl. 

1.50 extra for 'grilled' vegetables that were practically fresh and FAR from grilled that I threw out since I specifically asked for NO green peppers and none of it was cooked. An extra 1.50 for shrimp...got 6 of them in total. 

A little less than thrilled overall. Wish I'd just braved the line at Johnny Burrito...there is a reason there is a line there an not here.
