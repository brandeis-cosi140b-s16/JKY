First I need to say that I LOVE Roberto's, it is my new favorite Taco Bell/Del Taco etc.  Since moving here in Feb. 12' I can say that it is certainly my favorite little drunken munchies spot.  

Now, on to this specific Roberto's.  This is the third location that I have tried so far and this one is by FAR the worst; and this is coming after a couple pitchers with the munchies raging!  I ordered the rolled tacos with gauc which tasted just like the other 2, hence why they got 1 of the stars.  The other star is because the food was served very quickly, but alas, I believe this is why my second dish was not great.  

I got the cheese enchilada meal.  The sauce tasted okay, but the main problem was the cheese was not even melted inside, just a bunch of shredded cheese that I did not enjoy inside my luke-warm enchilada.  My friend also ordered our 'GO TO' meal, chimichanga, mmm mmm mmm; however, at this Roberto's it was bleh bleh bleh!  The tortilla was not fried nearly enough, the chicken was wet, not moist, wet, and overall it was barely even warm.  

I have marked this Roberto's off my list and will not return, which is a shame, because I was hoping to make it my local spot on Tuesdays as it's less than a mile from my local bar.
