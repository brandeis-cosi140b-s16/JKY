We just moved to AZ a few months ago and love Mexican food. We ordered takeout from Macayo's and had a sub-par experience. 

First, when we walked in we were not greeted by a host. When we asked for takeout it seemed like they didn't know what to do. It took us about 15 minutes to order 3 meals and an appetizer. When our food finally arrived, we think they forgot to take our money because we had to finally had to stuff money into the servers hands. 

Mind you, the restaurant was not full and they seemed short staffed. 

When we got home one meal was ok, one was great and the other wasn't even made to order (we ordered corn tortillas and we got flour). The chips and guacamole were great. 

Needless to say, we will not be back. If takeout was this bad...

Edited to add: this was the Casa Grande location
