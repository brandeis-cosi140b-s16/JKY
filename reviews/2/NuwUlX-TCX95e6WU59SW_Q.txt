It's Filiberto's. They are all similar, but differ considerably in food quality and service.

This one is the worst Filiberto's I've been to. Dirty, poor quality, and staff we encountered were argumentative and rude. I think my wife and I got sick from the food at this one.

Like any Filiberto's, the burritos come with pure meat. Wanna add rice or beans? It'll cost ya! Wait... they have to remove meat to fit the rice/beans. Rice and beans are cheaper than meat! Why on earth would anyone charge more money when they are saving money??!?  Senseless!
