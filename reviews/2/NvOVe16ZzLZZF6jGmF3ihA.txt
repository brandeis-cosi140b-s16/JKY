We went here for happy hour yesterday and I will not be doing that again. Not happy with any thing we had. I got the spicy chicken tacos and the machaca pork sliders. Sliders were very dry and it took a hole beer just to wash them down. They were the smallest sliders I have ever seen. Not very tasty at all. As for the tacos, they were bite size as well. I know they are only $5 but come on now these are rediculous. I felt like someone just stole $5 from me cause the only think i could do with these tacos was complain about them. I hate when you leave a restaurant hungry. My girlfriend got the sloppy joe torta. She said it was ok but after a few bites she was not into it anymore. I do like the restaurant itself and the huge fan in the dinning room is way cool. I think if I went here again I would try a burrito off the dinner menu. They were big and they had better be cause they are $10-12. The chips and salsa were great!
