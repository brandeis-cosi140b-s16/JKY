Guacamole was the the highlight of this meal.  The good friends dining with me too but that was pretty much it.  The a/c was not working correctly so it was unpleasant inside, my group considered going to a different restaurant in Tempe Market Place but stayed since none of us had eaten there before and when the appetizer (guac) arrived we thought we felt some cool air, but it only last for the next 20 minutes. 

I had the pork tacos.  For $16 it was a skilled of pork that was dry.  It had a nice seasoning but when the server placed the skillet in front of me, it looked as if it was sitting in the back ready for the past 30 minutes before it actually came to me.  It came with a little bit of beans, a lime wedge and 4 tortillas.  

My counterparts meals were okay, they didn't say really if it they liked it or not.

The strange part came towards the end of our meal, our waters were not re-filled, nor was my iced tea.  That bugs me especially when it was stifling hot in there.

 I am pretty sure the server was trying to leave b/c she kept grabbing for the bill, but we had not paid it yet.... I realized she wanted to leave but it was 10pm, hardly that late.
