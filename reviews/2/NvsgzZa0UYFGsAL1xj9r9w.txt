On the suggestion of a friend who thinks this is close to authentic Mexican, we went on a Sunday evening. The service was slow that evening and had some communication problems. We ordered their fresh guacamole which was very good...enough for 2-3 people. We ordered a classic margarita (special $3) and ordered a no-carb margarita. Very dissappointed with the no-carb and then shocked that it was $11! Total rip off. We ordered 4 entrees, steak faijtas and 3 burritos dishes. The entrees were just ok. Burritos had a lot of rice and beans...maybe too much. Some of the  meat was a little dry. Nothing on this visit would compel me to return.
