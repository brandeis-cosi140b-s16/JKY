If you visit the Sandbar and you are not a Scottsdale local you will be convinced that breast implants are a requirement for working there. Every bartender/waitress seemed to have implants. To add to that, across me ther was a young girl having the following conversation with some cougar: 

Young Girl: Yeah, my doctor was awesome.
Cougar: Oh yeah?
Young girl: yeah, he made them completely natural
Cougar: oh.....
Young Girl: You should totally get some...
Cougar: yeah, I've thought about...
Young Girl: here, let me give you his card

So in other words... if you like breast implants visit the Sandbar. As far as the food...who knows, who cares?
