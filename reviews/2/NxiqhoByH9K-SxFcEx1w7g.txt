The wait was ridiculous even though 90% of the tables were open. Tacos are tiny and $3.50 each. You have to ask for chips and salsa, they don't automatically bring it or ask if you would like it. The food is very good but I've never left a Mexican restaurant hungry, first time for everything. I've been to Barrio Not a good value for the money. Joyride, which is right down the street knocks Barrio out of the water with regards to price and a friendly, welcoming vibe.
