Well last week I heard about this place on the radio.  What stuck in my mind was homemade tortillas and upscale Mexican.  My husband and I were down the street and it was one of those nights where we were ready to go somewhere new.  

As mentioned it is where Roy's was at the Seville.  The decor is okay.  My husband said he thought it looked like they ran out of money.  I am okay with it, it is just bizarre where the hostess desk is but really I don't know that it could be situated anywhere else.

We sat outside and I was thrilled with the high above heaters although my husband thought it was too hot.  There were a couple of other tables on the patio and then inside there was one huge table which we were informed were media checking the place out.

Our server was very good, he seemed to be working hard on learning the menu and was well versed in his descriptions of the menu.  Realist that I am I know my husband agreed to this new journey as he was craving a good Reposado which is about the only alcohol we don't stock at home.   The server said they had so many tequilas and most we wouldn't know the names of.  He brought over the list and my husband had a hard time controlling his sadness at the list.  

For dinner I ended up getting the tortilla soup, garlic shrimp, and poblano potatoes.  My husband got the special which was Alaskan Halibut with a cauliflower puree, asparagus and mixed peppers.

I think the biggest issue was temperature control.  I sent my potatoes back as they were plum cold, my soup was lukewarm and my husband's fish way overcooked.  Heated up the potatoes were good, the soup was nice and the shrimp tasty.  I thought my husband's fish had a good flavor despite the cooking.  

The temperature issues can be worked out and perhaps there could be more forgiveness as it is a new place, but there was nothing about the food that stood out that would bring us back and for the price that means the  "Meh.  I've experienced better" is the perfect rating.
