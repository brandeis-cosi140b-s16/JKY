Nacho Daddy downtown on 4th St is really cute. Loved the decor and the servers were very nice if not a bit slow.  I ordered the steak burrito with red and green enchilada sauce on the side. The presentation was nice but the burrito was just okay.  The enchilada sauces were tasty though!! I might go back to try something else as I always like to give places a second chance.
