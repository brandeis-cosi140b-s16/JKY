The food here was just not good.  I've had better Mexican at Roberto's.  There was hardly anyone dining when we went on a Sunday afternoon which I guess should have been a hint.  The interior is a little run down.  As another reviewer mentioned the cracked seats are in need of repair.  Service was friendly enough but I see no reason to come back to this place.  I took the majority of my food home and my four legged family did not complain so at least it didn't go to complete waste.
