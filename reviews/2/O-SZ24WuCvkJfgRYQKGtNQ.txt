Vegetarians beware!  My boyfriend and I have been several times and are normally very happy with most.  I just left after one of the most unpleasant dining experiences I have ever had.  There aren't many veggie options on the menu, which is normally ok, since the avocado tacos I usually order are awesome.  Tonight, however, we decided to try something different, the cheese enchiladas.  The description labeled them vegetarian, and said they were served with rice, beans, and street corn.  We got the enchiladas and dug in.  When we took a close look at the rice and beans served under our enchiladas, we were surprised to discover a few pieces of chorizo mixed in.  We called over our server, who told us that the enchiladas were vegetarian, but the rice and beans weren't.  WHAT?!  You just can't label something vegetarian and serve it atop something meat-y.  So the server brought us a new dish and sent the manager over.  When we were talking to the manager, he said 'yea, we know, we have a new menu coming out soon'.  No offer to comp the meal, just acknowledging that they knew this was a problem and let it stay on the menu.  Needless to say, we won't be returning!
