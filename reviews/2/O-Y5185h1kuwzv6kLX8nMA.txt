What a disappointment. 

First off, lights would be nice. I seldom complain about the amount of lighting, but it was bloody dark in there. 

Petty complaint aside, the food was really uninteresting. The sonoran chicken was red, but had no flavor. The refried beans? Dry as a bone. On my wife's plate, they clearly had been sitting under a heat lamp for too long because they were cracked along the surface and very obviously dried out. Seriously? I'd say the service was fine, but the waiter let it come out looking like that, so points off for not bothering to notice. 

Second start is only because of the cheese crisp, which was tasty.
