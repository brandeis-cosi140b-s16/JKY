The owners of Some Burros need to do a secret shop to see what is happening at their restaurant.

We were in the mood for good mexican food and decided to give them a try.  When we came in and ordered, we began to feel that we may have made the wrong choice.  The kid at the counter had no interest in being there.  I understand that a job as a cashier is not ideal, but try your best to make the most of it.  My wife ordered a beer to which the kid responded "whatever".  I assume that is because he could not take the order due to his age, but his attitude seemed to be the norm at what is loosely described as a restaurant.

The food was horrendous.  My wife's taco shells were old and the beef tasted off.  All of our food was luke warm at best, just like the two beers we ordered.  The kid that brought out our food was kind enough, but his kindness could not make up for the quality of the food.  We left a comment card with my phone number so I could chat with the manager about the experience to give them the benefit of the doubt.  I don't want things for free, I just want owners to know what is going on so they can make their business better.  I did not get a call which leads me to believe either the comment card was tossed or the message did just not get through.

Some Burros could be great, but they need to get back to basics.
