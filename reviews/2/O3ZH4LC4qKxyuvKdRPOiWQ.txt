not impressed!

ordered 3 tacos al carbon at 1.49 each and total came to 6.47.  

$6.47 for three tacos?  "you didnt want the combo?  they want us to sell the combo."

i didnt ask for a combo.   cashier gets a manager and they started talking in spanish in front of me.  they had a little attitude afterwards

cashier, manager and food was disappointing.  

 i wont be back.
