First off this location is too busy, the line moves okay, but be ready to stand in it for 20 min or more. 

Think ordering online will save you time? WRONG. It takes just as long to get your food there. Why you may ask? They only have one poor girl back there with no help filling orders by phone and in person. 

What happens when this place doesn't staff their locations appropriately? They give you the wrong order, no joke missing items, wrong type of tortillas and cold, soggy food. 

I love Chipotle, but you would be better off going to a different location.
