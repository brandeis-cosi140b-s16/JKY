Blah! What a disappointment! After reading reviews I was anxious to try this place, but it was a total let down. We all ordered recommendations from the waiter- stuffed peppers, green chile meatloaf and tacos. No one was impressed.

I'd go here for drinks. The restaurant was really cool inside and the margs were great.

Pass on the food though for sure!
