Underwhelming.  First time back in 5 years or so and I was looking forward to eating here.  We had such a nice experience the first time.  We went on a Friday night, kind of late, around 7:45pm.  We were seated right away, outside on the patio, which is nice.  Good margaritas.  But, the service and the food, um, not so much.  We were really pushed, being served our soup before our appetizer and our entree while we were still eating our appetizer.  Also, the food, which we liked so much has really dropped off.  The pasta my daughter had was very oily.  My pollo margarita was dry and almost tasteless.  My son-in-law's ribs were good, but not outstanding.  Overall, a disappointment.
