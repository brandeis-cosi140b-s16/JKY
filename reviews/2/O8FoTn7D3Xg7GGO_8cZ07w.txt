Here's the deal, I have eaten there a couple of times and each time I have hopes that it will be better than the last time. It never gets worse but it really never gets better either. The food is not authentic like they like to advertise and when I first moved to AZ I had such high hopes. To this day I tend to make better mexican food then I can find out in Phoenix. And seriously, no chicken ALL day? What was up with that. The staff is NOT friendly at all and have the look of drones on their faces.
