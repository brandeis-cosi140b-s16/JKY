This is more about their customer service than their food..which admittedly is not bad.  But when you order takeout and get home only to discover the $4.00 8 oz salsa you paid for is not in the bag and have to go all the way back..it would be nice if an apology and an offer of complimentary salsa was in order instead of a stupid free drink.  The owner himself was not willing to comp the salsa and instead informed me he was going to fire his employees "because it was happening all day."  Not the way to provide customer service...really???  Over $4.00 salsa..Really??  Like I said...food is good..but there are like 20 OTHER mexican restaurants in Maricopa, so Tacos N More will be Tacos No More.
