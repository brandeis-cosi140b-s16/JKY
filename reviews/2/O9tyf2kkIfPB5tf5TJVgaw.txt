Dropped in around 8pm on a Thursday because my friend hadn't eaten here yet. We had to wait 20-30 minutes. The hostess was a pinch rude when I asked where to stand while we waited (everywhere you stand in that place you're in the way!). I got an a la carte veggie taco which was decent, just oily (enough to make me sick).

I think I'm throwing the towel in on you, Cabo. I'll take the 3 miles drive to Plaza to go somewhere worth my money.
