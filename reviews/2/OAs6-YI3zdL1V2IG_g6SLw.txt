This was recommended to me by lifetime fitness. I thought the food was terrible! guacamole had flavor.  the salsa was lackluster, consisting of tomatoes and cilantro in the little spices. THe shrimp salad nothing to write home about whatsoever. the tortilla soup consisted of the bland broth, chicken parts and guacamole and tortilla's floating on top
