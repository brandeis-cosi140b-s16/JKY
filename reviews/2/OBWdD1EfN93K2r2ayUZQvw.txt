If you want to go here stick to the drink menu. The margaritas are delicious!! The chips were good but the salsa was a little bland than what I'm use to. What started as a 10 minute wait turned into 40min. We asked for a new high chair as ours was broken and we watched as 4 more families came in with working chairs and we never received ours. The enchiladas left little to be desires. The chicken was perfectly cooked but everything was so bland. I've also never been to a place that uses sour cream and there was about a half a tub on my food. I would def go back for drinks though!!
