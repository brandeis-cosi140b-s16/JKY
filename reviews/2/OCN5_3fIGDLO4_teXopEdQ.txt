I was looking for a place near a work location that I visit often so I took a trip there this weekend and happened upon Juan's.

From the outside it looked like an uppity Mexican food restaurant.  Inside the decor looked unfinished.  It lacked structure to the different areas.  Not a big deal, just something that stood out immediately.

We ordered a beer and a margarita.  The margarita had good flavor, but one flavor seemed missing - tequila.  That was fine, I wasn't interested in getting buzzed.  The flavor was good.

We ordered a mix, which gave us the opportunity to basically taste everything on their menu.  One thing stood out - the lettuce on most of the items tasted absolutely terrible.  Literally the worst iceburg lettuce that I can recall having at a restaurant in recent years.  It really altered what I am sure was normally a better product, but it covered the tacos and tostadas making them poor tasting.  The enchilada was very mediocre, or worse.  I say this because I am a mediocre cook and I make a basic cheese enchilada much better than this.

Nothing stood out as quality.  Good Mexican food is easy to find in the metro area, I'd pass this place by.

Once again, I experienced something that owners/managers need to pay attention to if they desire my business - the wait staff cannot come to the table mid-meal and interrupt a vibrant active conversation to ask if everything is alright.  It is very easy to tell if something is not alright.  Pay attention to your customers.  When something is not alright, people look around for a staff member.  Super big pet peeve when it interrupts eating or conversation.
