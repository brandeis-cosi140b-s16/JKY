Came here with a big group for my friends b day. Decor was really nice, their alcohol drinks were good and our waitress was really nice. They have horrible options for vegetarians though. The waitress did the best she could to help me find something to eat on the menu but when it came out the soup had fish in it. It was like milky top roman and so gross I couldn't finish it. We also got the fried rice as a side lets just say it was not worth $12. I've had better at hole in the wall Chinese restaurants. I won't ever be going back to this place
