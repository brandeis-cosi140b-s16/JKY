I need to preface this review by stating I am from Southern California and I am used to a very specific type of Mexican food. Namely, GREAT Mexican food.

I came here recently with colleagues and we were a large party. The staff took very good care of us considering it was such a big group and I definitely give them kudos for that.

The food was definitely not was I was hoping for. The bacon wrapped shrimpo were pretytyy good, but my chicken was smothered in salsa con queso that could have been Tostitos out of a jar. It did little to offset the dry chicken breast I was served. My side of black beans was ok, the rice was ok, but overall I left hungry.
