I lived in the area now for about 5 years and this location never fails to disappoint! The dining area is always dirty. Tables don't ever seem to get wiped off. While the people who work there are friendly,  it seems to take a very long time to get your order. The food quality is usually ok, but tonight the tortillas were very old or dried up. Im surprised they were able to wrap my burrito! I've been to other locations and don't encounter the same issues, which is a reflection on the management....it'll probably be another 6 months or more before I come back here:(
