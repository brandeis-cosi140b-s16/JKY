Just moved here and this place came highly recommended by a friend. We ordered 2 Armando's breakfast burritos and a carne asada quesadilla. We get our order and notice there's only 1 little bag of carrots. We ask for another because we ordered for 3 people. The woman said it was an additional dollar per bag of carrots. Umm...WHAT?! So if you order 3 items (like we did) everyone is supposed to share a teeny tiny bag of pickled carrots?! I paid it because I didn't want to share my damn carrots, but damn!! Never again.

The food was nothing special. The breakfast burrito was like a home burrito and the quesadilla was 1 flour tortilla, a little bit of cheese and meat. No sour cream, no pico de gallo...nothing. This place isn't cheap either.
