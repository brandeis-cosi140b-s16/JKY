The theme of my last casual stroll down State Street ended up being "go to places you haven't been to in years and years and years." While out and about we decided we wanted margaritas to help stave off the cold and windy afternoon and so I suggested Casa de Lara. I remember liking them in college and that they usually had some sort of decent marg special. 

When we went in, it was dead - there were two other people in the whole restaurant. Our waiter started out very attentive, but as our time wore on he got more and more backed up by being the only person outside of the kitchen. 

My gent and I each ordered a margarita - pineapple for me, orange cream for him. I'd never seen either of those flavors as margarita choices, and was excited to give them a try. My pineapple marg was fine. I couldn't really taste any pineapple, which was a bummer - if you had blindfolded me I'd have just guessed it was a house lime. The orange cream was very different - it literally had cream in it so it was rich and sweet. Next we sampled strawberry (probably the best of the bunch) and tamarind. I've only had tamarind candy before, and this was quite a bit more bitter than that - it had the same bitter quality that citrus rind has. 

We didn't get food on this trip, but were given chips and salsa immediately upon being seated. The chips are topped with pickled veggies and sprinkled with spices. The salsa had a nice kick but was the thick, sweet variety that reminds me more of tomato sauce/paste than salsa. 

For four margaritas with tip and tax it came out to around $35 - not terrible, but for the quality and ambience there are better places around town both in taste and value.
