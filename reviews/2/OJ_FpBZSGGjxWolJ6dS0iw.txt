Total chaos at lunch time today and there seems to be an absence of leadership behind the counter. My usual experience is much better but with all of the chatter, disorganization and poor kitchen management I don't know what is going on. Out of guacamole at lunch? Really? No tables being bussed until almost 1:00pm? At least my food appears to taste ok even though I had to make changes due to guacamole and fajita veggies not being available. Better luck at another location?
