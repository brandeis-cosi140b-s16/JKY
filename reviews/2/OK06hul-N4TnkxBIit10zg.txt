Steve L put it as good as one can say: "It's a college town burrito chain..." If I was drunk, it was late and I wanted to eat something, this would suffice. However, sober, its disgusting. There are only refried beans. The fillings in a veggie burrito consist of rice and hot sauce and refried beans. Mexican, its not. Good it is not. Cheap, I guess. There is better out there. There is much better out there.
