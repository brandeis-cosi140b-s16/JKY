Better than Filibertos but still bland Sonoran style Mexican food. To be fair, I'll note that I prefer New Mexican style. I ordered a combo that came with refried beans, rice (good), 1 chicken taco and 1 shredded beef taco. Very bland.  Also ordered a cheese quesadilla with green and red salsa. The red salsa tasted flat and was missing something.....it just tasted like red chilis and water.  The green salsa is what saved the day.  Super yummy. I'd go back for the green salsa. Next time I'll try a burrito. I've heard that they have good breakfast burritos too. I only gave two stars because the salsa was the highlight of my meal.
