I was here from 8pm to 11:30pm on a Saturday night.  The joint was crowded and mostly mid 30s on up with a few younger scattered in.  A local cover band was playing.  They were terrible but most seemed too drunk or too busy dancing to care.

Service was slow, slow, slow.  I've never waiting so long for one beer.  No one was rude but there's no excuse for the lack of promptness.  It was busy, yes, but I've seen places just as or more busy and had an easier time getting drinks.

I tried the nachos and enchiladas.  The nachos were really good but the enchiladas were mediocre.  Better than what I could make on my own but you'll find better at any restaurant.

Cocomo Joe's has a lot of televisions and I was able to watch the Coyotes game.  It seems like it could be a good location to watch football on Sunday.  I'm guessing the atmosphere is decidedly different during the day than at night.  During the day it's probably a decent place to catch a game.  If I'm invited back on a Saturday night, I will pass.
