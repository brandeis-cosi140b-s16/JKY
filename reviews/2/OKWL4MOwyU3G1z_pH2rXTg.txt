Oh what a sad fall from grace... My previous review of Baja Fresh was very favorable. This one, not so much.

The experience started off poorly when the cashier sneezed in his hand while we were ordering. He never went to wash his hands afterwards. Perhaps he wasn't handling food directly, but he's grabbing chip bags, trays and other items right next to your food. Thanks for spreading the germs, dude.

As a starter, at least we managed to enjoy the tortilla chips & their wide selection of salsas.

For the main course, we ordered some grilled veggie burritos enchilada style. When they arrived, we were highly disappointed. The enchilada sauce didn't taste that good and the burrito contents were mostly cold. What part of "Grilled veggie burrito" is supposed to have cold vegetables?

With a brand new Chipolte across the street, it looks like we won't be visiting Baja Fresh any more.
