I ordered one taco, just wanted a quick bite to eat. The taco is what I expected it to be. The service here really wasn't the best I have had. I was kind of disappointed. I went through the drive-thru, they have two windows, one to pay and one to pickup. I went to the first window to pay. I saw the worker inside the window, but it took her awhile just to even realize I was there. I've been to other company's drive-thru and they open the window right away and say hello. If they are too busy to take your money, they say something. Here, she opened the window after awhile and just said the total. No hello or anything else.
