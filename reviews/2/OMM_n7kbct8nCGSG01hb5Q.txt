Pretty good. Tried the pork belly tacos. Usually get get chicken at Mexican restaurants. Glad I tried something different. They were very good . Unfortunately they use onions in everything and I HATE onions. Otherwise it would be 3 or 4 stars. The down side is that it's a little over priced, especially since the atmosphere was hole in the wall. 2 tacos, rice and beans on a small paper plate were $13. Small portions and hole in the wall atmosphere should be about half that. Probably won't be back.
