Good: queso fundido, chips and salsa were good 

Food: ordered barbacoa enchiladas. The barbacoa at Chipotle is way better than this place! The corn on the cob was salty. 

Drinks: strong cocktails with tequila. The mojito with tequila was a little strange. But for $10 it was alright. 

I wouldn't come back here again. There are far more superior places to eat in Las Vegas!
