First of all, I am not much of a Taco Bell person. The only things they have that I like are their Doritos Taco and the Mexican Pizza. That's the only reason I would give them two stars.

What I came here for was to try the Cantina Bowl. I decided on steak and anticipating it to be good. NOT! It is basically a knockoff of Chipotle's steak burrito bowl! The steak itself was flavorless and it had the pre cooked taste to it, meaning all they had to do was heat it up. There was rice, beans, lettuce, and some kind of chipotle sauce (kind of ironic since it was a ghetto imitation). Immediately after this review I am going to contact Taco Bell to tell them to either make it better or quit making it and just stick to making the Doritos Taco. If they take the Doritos Taco away, then that will just erase another star on this review.

Service was ok and the cleanliness of the place was decent as well. 

So if you are reading this and are thinking about getting the Cantina Bowl, DO NOT GET IT unless you want to ruin your apetite! I had to go to Chipotle that night for dinner just to satisfy my steak bowl craving!
