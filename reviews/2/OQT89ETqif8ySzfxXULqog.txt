We live in Southern California which is effectively Mexico, so we know mexican food.  Here at Diablo's the chips are like Tostitos (out of a bag), the salsa tastes and looks like it is out of a jar and the beans were definately canned.  They can't make rice and the margaritas lack tequilla.  Service good....food bad.  All I can say is Taco Bell, you have some competition.
