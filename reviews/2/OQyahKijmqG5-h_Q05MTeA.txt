We use to go in all the time, and just put up with the bad service cause the food was ok and this place was close. I don't know if the guy with the bad fake hair is the owner or what but he always seems to wait on us. But he has the most miserable attitude I've ever seen! He just seems like he'd rather be somewhere far away. He takes our order and when he drops off either a drink or the food we always say 'thank you' but he NEVER responds with the 'you're welcome" its just a 'uh huh" really? That's the best you can do? We're your only customers right now and you make us feel like we're a bother to you? 
The food itself is just ok, I do like the rice however, the chili rellanos are my preferred choice when we eat there, we've had other servers wait on us and they seem to be pleasant, far more than THAT guy....... We were going in on a regular basis but one time we had the worst service you can imagine, from the food on down, so we didn't go back for years and recently started going back. Not very often but from time to time and "bad hair guy seems to have the same crappy pissed off I hate being here attitude" . I'm really surprised they've stayed open as long as they have due to the little business they have,  every time we've gone in the most we've seen is MAYBE 5 tables at one time , the service was a 2 star at most the food was 4 stars but that's it... it never changes..
I think we'll have to take a break from this place for a while and see if things get better... there are better places than El Burrito, it's just nice cause it's close...
