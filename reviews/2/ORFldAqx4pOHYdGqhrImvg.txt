I was looking forward to trying a new Mexican place while working in the east valley, and the Yelp reviews seemed promising. But I have to say I'm disappointed. I ordered the chicken chimichanga platter. I really don't care for the seasoning of the chicken, or of the rice for that matter. The chimi tasted almost burned. The service was good, but the food was "meh". For my money, I'd much prefer to eat at Manuel's.
