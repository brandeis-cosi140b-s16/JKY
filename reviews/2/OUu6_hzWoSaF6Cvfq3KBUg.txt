Greasy chips
Weird, sour ceviche
No ability to do a blended drink other than their pre-made mixed stuff they keep in a slushie machine.
Overstretched waiters who can't seem to get back to your table with the drink you ordered 30 minutes ago.
Nobody in my party of 5 was especially happy with their meal. 
BUT, it did have a nice outdoor patio looking out on the strip and the Bellagio fountains. The view was worth 2 stars.
