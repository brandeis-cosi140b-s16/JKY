I appreciate the name. 

I appreciate the location. 

I find the food to be just alright. 

I do not appreciate the loudness. (If you are not partially deaf, neither will you; bad news: you may be partially deaf after patronising this establishment.)

I do not appreciate being nickled and dimed for every little thing. (Who does?) Or worse ...

I do not appreciate being outright bilked out of entrance fees to a UFCÂ® screening that was supposed to be complimentary. 

Start at 3* (default), plus two for the appreciates = 5*, food being just okay is the equivalent of plus 0 = 5*, minus three no muy appreciados = 2*.
