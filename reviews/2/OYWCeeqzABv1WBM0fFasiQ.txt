Has gone down hill so drastically!!! I was a regular here for years when Tolan was a manager. The food was delish and service was always on point. I have maybe skipped by for a year now. I did not recognize more than 1 face ( a younger guy server). My boyfriend and I walked in to ask for dining for 2. There was an older lady as a hostess maybe in her 50s. She said one table left. I kindly asked okay no booths by chance when I saw several open. She repeated herself verbatim but so rudely "One table left."  I look at her confused by her tone. She sat us in the back and our serve has 4 tables from what I saw. She was nothing extraordinary with her customer service. I asked for my usual filet minon quesadilla. She said I think that's only for happy hour. Walked away 10 feet to another server and came back saying yeah we can't do that. Now keep in mind I have been there for years different days a week different times. Happy hour and non happy hour. They have never refused to make it. I ordered tacos and the server rushes us to pick. Food came out & food was bland and so disappointing. I tip over 20 percent and am not super picky. But rude hostess, unwilling staff, awful food. Used to love this place. Never going back. I read all the recent reviews since new owner. Sorry carlsbad but you lost your oldtown rating to me
