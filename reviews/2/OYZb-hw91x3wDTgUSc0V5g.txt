Let first say that I am a HUGE fan of Chipotle! However, this location NEVER has steak ready to go. When I ask them why they either say they hardly ever sell steak. WELL HELLO!!! You can't sell what you don'e stock!!! You ALWAYS have 10 lbs of Chicken and few dried up old morsels of steak. What do you think the customer will choose? You create your own destiny by under-stocking Steak. You force customers to say,"Well, I'd like the steak, but that stuff looks like it's been sitting around for a while. Hmm, the chicken looks fresh! I'll just go with the chicken." Try stocking steak for a while! Call it the "Dave Experiment". See if you don't sell more steak.
