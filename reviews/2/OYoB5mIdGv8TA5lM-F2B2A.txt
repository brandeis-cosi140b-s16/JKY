Clean and commercialized is how I would describe this place. IT lacks the authentic feel and ambiance I would expect.  But this is not why the score it low, it was the flavor to value ratio.

My avocado tomato and mayo torta was $5 and it was slightly larger than a .99 hamburger. It had a very creamy flavor from the avocado and tomato on the soft bun. Add to that some 1.99 french fries and I had a unfilling meal.

The one highlight of this place is the condiment station, with a great creamy and hot red salsa, avocado dip and fried peppers. 

If you rarely stay away from the big chains and want a torta this is for you, if you like the flavors and fell of local dining look on.
