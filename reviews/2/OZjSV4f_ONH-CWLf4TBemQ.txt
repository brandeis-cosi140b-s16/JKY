Came here because we heard it was where the locals came and thought it might be a hidden gem - alas, it was not. It didn't have to coolness of the original El Encanto and the setting was not as interesting. It took quite a while for our waitress to come to our table, we had to ask for refills, and the food was lackluster. Green chile had no taste/heat - my son (17 months) accidentally got a bite of green sauce and never batted an eye. We will stick with the original El Encanto at least the vibe is better there.
