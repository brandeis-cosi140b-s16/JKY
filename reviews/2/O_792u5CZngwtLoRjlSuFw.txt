Ummm...no.

Wanted to hit this place for a while due to good Yelp reviews, but I'm rarely downtown for lunch.  Pretty disappointing.  Service was a little slow, and I was there after the lunch rush, one of two guys sitting at the bar.  Waited for a while for my check and finally just walked over to the register.  They were very friendly - just didn't seem completely on top of things.

Food was pretty bland.  The barbacoa taco was okay, the chicken was like microwaved frozen chicken bits.  Definitely not worth $3/taco.  It's pretty bad if this is the best Mexican place downtown. 

Decor in the Wood St. location isn't bad, though.  Colorful, if a bit dark for a "festive" decor.  Futbol on the TVs, though.  Can't go wrong with that.
