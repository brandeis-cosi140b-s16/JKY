Taste/price/no soda.. I'd pass, there's a place next door better. Chronic tacos is to chipotle but with tacos. The place just opened at 10 AM and the meat in my chicken and steak taco is cold. The flavor and price are ok but there's more exciting places right here. I'm throwing away one of my tacos and I bought a soda they were out of every kind I drink in the machine. I was given a bottle of coke and its expired, so it's flat. It was a waste of gas driving up here there is a  Taco Bell right next to my school. Lunch no Bueno today
