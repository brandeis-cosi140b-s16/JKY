Another in a line of chipotle style rip offs this place offers the usual cast of faux Mexican dining fare. White rice, black beans, corn, and a few meat options, check. Hipsters who act like they can not put down their phones yet are so concerned about saving the earth, check. While there is nothing wrong with the idea (imitation is the sincerest form of flattery) just how many of these places do we need?

In my opinion if you are going to copy something at least bring something new to the table when you do! This place does not meet that goal. In fact they manage to mess up some of the basic things that chipotle did right while charging you more at the same time. That is quite a feat to pull off lol. My order was for two burritos (one pork, green sauce, brown rice, cheese and the other shredded beef, cilantro lime rice, black beans and hot sauce). Both were a nice size (compared to chipotle) yet cost almost a full 2 dollars more! The pork had a nice spice but was to salty for me. The green verde sauce was ok but tasted of mostly tomatillos. It could have used something to balance it out like cumin, roasted poblanos, honey or even some more garlic. With drinks the total came out to something like 22.50 for two people! I can make this food at home for way less than that and still have money left for dessert. While it is nice to try eating somewhere new it is not worth almost $25 and 110 plus degree days just to eat here again. Good for some but for me No Bueno!
