Disappointed - I was served a glass of Charlotte's finest on tap water.  I have to say that is nasty in & of itself.  The table behind were regulars which meant that they continually paid attn to their drinks while ignoring us.  I was excited for an alternative to open that was a bit more cas than Cantina. Tortilla Flats was just a half step up from Moe's.  Unimpressed & uninspired by the burrito.
