I was so excited!!! I just couldn't hide it!!! 

Why you ask? Well, I was excited when I heard this location was opening. You see I live close by and geeezzz I loved the other locations. The other locations offered an amazing product with addictive flavors and unparalleled passion for detail and consistency. 

Then my excitement faded. It has taken me a long time to write this review because I kept my hopes alive - time after time and try after try. After 15 or so attempts at this sterile location I finally throw In the towel... I quit all the things... 

I accept my last stage of grief. 

15 or so visits and not once has the flavor or experience been even sort of reminiscent of the original taco shops. Nothing tastes the same. Seriously, every time you go.

You can order the same thing and it tastes like a completely different place. Even the guacamole!!! Every thing is even made differently each time. Tortillas are filled different rolled fm different. It's just strange. 
Isn't there a recipe? 

You can feel the difference. No care or attention to detail. 

It's like the had an authentic amazing grandma with great recipe and passion and fired her just to replace her with someone from Taco Bell. 

And that is being nice because at least with the bell you know what it's gonna taste like. Not like I would eat there either but still.  Anyways. Sorry if this is harsh but by golly.., you had magic in a bottle and I'm disappointed that it seems like the bottle was packaged sold and then it forgot where it came from. 

P.s. I gave it two star because it still hurts. I Love You!
