This Robertos location hovers between 2 and 3 stars. But, because it has on occasion sunk to 2 I'll have to go there.
Why ?
I've had to ask a worker to please not mop the floor with bleach while I'm  eating at table. You'd  think that would be common sense but I guess not. I hate to be an asshat but I just dont find clorox appetizing.
On a recent visit,  I ordered 5 rolled tacos with everything.  Usually pretty dang good for a quick lunch -- well these rolled tacos had a noticeably fishy odor and taste to them so I'm assuming they were deep fried in oil used for fish,  instead of dropped in his ( the cooks ) gf 's panties.  I did not finish the tacos,  but the dogs loved them.
Later,  I had a hellacious case of the squirts. Explosive. Smelly. And dangerous.
I've  sworn off Robertos for awhile,  but I know I'll  be back at some point,  sorta like that nasty sexy booty call at 2 am. Lots of things sound better at zero dark thirty than they do in broad daylight.
