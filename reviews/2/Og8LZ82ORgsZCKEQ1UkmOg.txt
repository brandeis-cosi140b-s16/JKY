Food was okay. The service was 6/10. Came in for a birthday party of 15, so I understand it's a bit hectic, but we did make reservations ahead of time so they can make preparations. The biggest issue was we asked for our check to be split at the beginning while ordering and when we asked for the check it was Not split. Good luck to anyone that gives it a try, and don't come in with more than 2 people...
