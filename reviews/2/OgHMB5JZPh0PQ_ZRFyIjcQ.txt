First time there and from most yelp reviews figured give it a chance. 

Service was meh. They sat us down and brought small basket chips for 3 people. The salsa was very good chunky tomatoes onion cilantro.  Ordered wet style burritos. Ordered carne asada unfortunately it was 70% beans and rice, maybe 20% steak rest salsa onions.  The enchilada sauce comes red basic, green basic & red spicy all very watery. Asked extra chips they replied $1.25 each basket.  I was like really? Oh ok I replied.  Only to bring another basket with salsa cup in half of the basket! Really?  Your burritos are tiny and $2.29 for a soda? 
Sorry but you girls were ok servers, had to ask for refills of soda,  but extra for chips and meh food was hard to see $33 for crap had hard time adding $7 for the tip. I felt violated @$36 for 2 wet burritos 1 chicken enchilada combo 3 sodas.  
Del taco about the same for half price.
