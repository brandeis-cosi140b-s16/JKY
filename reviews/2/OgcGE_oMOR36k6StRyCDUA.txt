Nothing special.  Wandered in on a weekend afternoon and it was all about the game(s)... So our service was fine, but not really friendly or attentive.  Tips were obviously going to be made at the men tables, oh well.
We read the reviews about the crispy tacos and they were ..... Okay.  So that was disappointing.
All in all, it was okay, with the other restaurants in this neighborhood, we could have chosen much better!
