This location had a groupon for 12.00 you received 2 10 vouchers. The first one I used I had no problems with, but today the service was horrible. I placed an order over the phone the food was ready when I arrived. There was 1 guy that I saw helping customers, he greeted me and wanted to help but when i said I called in my order he said someone would help me. There was an employee sitting in the back playing on her cell phone.She looked up and made eye contact but never stopped what she was doing...... The guy was busy working I looked at the lady for 10 minutes before she sent someone over to help me. Keep in mind the lady she sent to help me was waiting other tables. The girl came to the counter and stated a price, no hi how are you nothing just 10.67..... I explain that I have a groupon she took my phone and walked to the back...... So now Im standing at the front and my phone is gone. I wait a couple of minutes but when I see other people coming over and them swipping thru my phone I got upset. So I walked to the back and asked what was the deal, while taking my phone back from some random man . They stated that they are looking for the code. I understand by why did you take my phone. Couldnt you have written it down and come to the front where I was standing and look for the code. The man became upset and told me to go to the front and someone will help me. So I walked back and who comes to help.... The lady who was too busy with her phone to help me in the first place. She then gives me an attitude explaining that it was a dine in groupon. I totally understand that and I explain that the last time I used it, it was to go. She says it wasn't her and she doesn't care.I gave her the .78 cents, I didn't get change and its safe to say I will NEVER go back there. Service is horrible.
