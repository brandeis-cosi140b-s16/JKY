I have ordered Moe's a few times on their regular priced nights now.  They definitely skimp on the ingredients on the special days, including Moe Monday and more recently National Earmuff Day.  They even skimped on black olives for that but also really skimped on the guac and sour cream.  Your product should be consistent (especially in a franchise), whether or not it's a day where a discount is offered.
