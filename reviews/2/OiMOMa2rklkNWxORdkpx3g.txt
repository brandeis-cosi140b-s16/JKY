I can't really give it 3 stars.  I started to but there's more wrong with this place than right.  Others have complained about the poor staff.  The staff was fine and service was good so we didn't have anything to complain about there.

What we didn't like was more.  To begin with the seats are very uncomfortable.  Most of them are on tall wood stools without backs.  Some of the tables are on concrete and some are on the sand.  

Then, there was the menu.  It's really different.  There really is a variety but we didn't think the menu was enough to call it a Mexican grill and that's what we were looking for ... Mexican food.    The red sauce on the enchiladas was pretty spicy and tasted a little burnt.  The pulled pork sandwich was also pretty spicy and nothing on the menu indicated that it was spicy. I can definitely tell you it was.

We were actually quite disappointed with the food and there's no reason we would return.
