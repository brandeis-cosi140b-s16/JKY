I forgave Salty's for past indiscretions only to be burned again.  

When your Cinco flyer advertises "cheap beer and cheap food" with $10 cover, its convenient to find out neither is true when you've already paid said $10.

Not sure where anyone would consider $5 domestics and $8 tacos to be "cheap".
