Was super excited to eat here. Was greeted by the owner and he mentioned the  2 taco  special with a side of rice and refried beans (pinto or black) and a drink. Thought it would be a great way to try out the food and opted to eat at the restaurant. It took a very long time for my order to be ready and people that placed orders to go received their food before I did. The beans were spicy and seemed to have been flavored with chorizo, wish I had know that before ordering, not a fan of chorizo. The rice was a bit dry and bland. Like mentioned in previous reviews the portions were small. The tacos looked delicious. To my disappointment the al pastor was dry, over salted, and there were a lots of pieces of fat. The chicken alambre  taco was flavorful but the corn tortilla kept breaking apart, it was uncooked. Overall, for the food was nothing special and since I didn't care for the rice, beans or al pastor it was not a good deal.Reaffirms that making the drive to Tacos el Gordo is definitively worth it, delicious authentic tacos, inexpensive, and worth the wait!
