I've eaten here twice and each time I haven't been all that impressed.  The food isn't terrible but it's not that great either.  

My first experience was about 2 months ago and I was incredibly hungry for lunch.  My coworker mentioned this place and I was excited to try something new.  The chips and salsa are pretty good.  There were three of us in the party and we all ordered different dishes but they seemed to only screw up mine.  I ordered the pork tacos and I got steak instead.  I'm not a huge beef eater.  I never order steak when I eat Mexican.  I reserve my steak cravings for a simpler meal.  Anyway, when the dish was presented to me I looked confused and said "this is steak and I ordered the pork" .  the server looked at me like I was lying and I just had this bummed expression on my face.  She offered to re-make it but we were short on time and I said "Don't worry about it.  I'll eat this".  You would think she would have discounted it or something but no.  Maybe most people would have been thrilled but I was craving pork.  I probably should have argued the bill but honestly I didn't have the energy.  

The second time I stopped in (with my coworker in order to give it one more chance) I ordered the pork enchiladas and the pork was quite pink!  I didn't get sick but I was a little nervous to eat such pink pork.  
All in all that meal was better but I quickly became upset when I was paying the bill and got pinned in between the cashier stand and the front door when someone decided to enter the restaurant!  Yes, the front door opens inward (this is against fire code if the occupancy is 50 or more).

so, there won't be a third time.....this place just rubbed me the wrong way both visits.  The food isn't bad but the environment and the servers didn't do it for me.
