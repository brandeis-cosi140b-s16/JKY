Having passed this place up several times on my way to Subway, I decided to take a chance to try something new.  I am a big fan of this style of burrito places, in general (Qdoba, Chipotle, etc.).

The special for the day was 3 Chicken Tacos for $4.99.  Given the price, I wasn't expecting too much, but I was actually rather disappointed.  The chicken (their Chicken Chipotle) was mostly tasteless.  I did have the opportunity to choose between flour and corn tortillas, and I ended up getting 2 flour and 1 corn.  The corn tortilla pretty much disintegrated due to the salsa that was on the taco.  The salsa was supposed to be spicy, but I didn't really start tasting it either until the third taco was almost gone.
Anything extra you want to add (jalapenos, guacamole, etc) are all extra charges.   Honestly, I've had better chicken tacos at Taco Bell, and that's just sad. :(

On the upside, the service was pretty decent.  I was offered a sample of their chicken choices and the steak.  The person ringing me up was trying to do something else also, so she was pretty rushed, but was otherwise friendly.

I will probably give it one more chance and order a burrito next time, since that seems to be their strong suit.  I'd really like to see it succeed since it seems to be locally owned and would be a nice alternative to the campus spots (which i don't get to frequent much due to traffic/parking/etc.).   They need to step up the taste a bit though.
