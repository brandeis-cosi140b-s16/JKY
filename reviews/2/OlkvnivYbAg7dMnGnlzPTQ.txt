Went to Lake Las Vegas and found a ghost town. Place was empty. Only restaurant open at 2pm on a Saturday. We were the only people in the restaurant. I had a Tostada with shrimp which was basically lettuce on a tortilla with 3 prawns. Boyfriend had steak fajitas which were ok. Had a beer and a glass of wine. $80 bill. Thought $80 for an ok Mexican lunch was way to much.
