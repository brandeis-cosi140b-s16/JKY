Mr Burrito moved into Salsitas.   Drove in to get my usual breakfast burritos.  Got a shock at the window, the prices doubled!!   Then after waiting 15 minutes.  The glazed girl at the window forgot half my order and gave me the " What are you talking about look"   She mentioned a new owner and then I got worried.   I got fuzzy scorched eggs with a tiny amount of meat. No Cheese no NADA!   Their salsa is nasty.  Nothing worse then scorched eggs.  Twice the cost and bad food.  Such a deal.    Back to FILIBERTOS!
