Went for dinner last night and when we arrived at 5:30pm there was only ONE car in the parking lot. I thought they were closed at first and when we figured out they were open I wondered if something had happened as I had never seen the parking lot that empty. We decided to go in and eat anyway.

We walked in and there was no one to greet us and I could see the help sitting in the back at a table chatting. We waited about 3 minutes before one of them got up and came and sat us. A short time later our waitress arrived and she was very grumpy as was the chip boy that gave us chips. Neither responded to my hello and thank you to them.

Our order was taken and we were brought our iced tea which had a very odd taste to it. Kinda of like dish water with a bit of sweetener in it. Neither my wife or I could drink it.

Dinner arrived and I can never figure out how this place expects you to eat their fajitas. They give you the platter of meat, peppers and onions and then a little tiny side plate with beans and rice. WHERE THE HECK TO i PUT MY TORTILLA TO FILL IT UP AND MAKE IT SO I CAN EAT IT? They need to give you another small plate but they never do.

We ordered and paid for a side order of beans and pico and both came in a little tiny cup. Smaller than the free salsa cups and I was disappointed I paid for a side that was so small. The pico tasted funny as well and not like it normally does when we have it at Raul and Theresas.

At the end of the meal we never seen our waitress again and finally had to walk up to the counter to get our ticket. 

The place was deserted and everyone was very grumpy. Food was ok minus the iced tea and pico tasting weird. Not an enjoyable night at a place we normally really like.

Hope things get back to normal or we're going to have to find a new place.
