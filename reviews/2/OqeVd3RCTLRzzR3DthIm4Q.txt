On two separate occasions, we have ordered using the chipotle app. On both occasions, we arrived to pick up the order and they hadn't even begun making it. Not the end of the world. But, even once they realized they were late, they didn't start working on the order, they just continued making the orders of everyone in line. You're busy, I get it, but you already took my money, and the people that arrived after I did are already leaving with their food.
