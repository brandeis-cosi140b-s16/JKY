Not much to recommend here. As a general rule, I come to Vegas prepared to spend cash, so I'm not going to dock this place for being ridiculously overpriced relative to your traditional Mexican or Chinese restaurant. $4-$5 per taco and $22 for a seafood noodle dish may seem steep, but I'm ok with it if the food is top notch. 

Unfortunately, China Poblano fell short of expectations. The Al Pastor taco had very little pork belly and was overwhelmed by sauce. The portion sizes were small across the board. The guacamole was pretty good, but then again, it's pretty hard to screw up guac. 

I would not dine here again nor would I recommend it to others.
