Came here because of all these great reviews. Sadly it didn't live up to expectations. Our server was about 12 years old, he was nice but didn't write down our order so of course the food wasn't right. Had to ask for refills numerous times. Fish tacos were okay. No salsa/sauce of any kind offered for tacos.
