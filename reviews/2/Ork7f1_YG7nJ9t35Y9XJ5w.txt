Good:
- The place is nicely decorated
- The hostess was polite and had a big smile

Bad:
- The waiter wasn't exactly friendly - not rude, but just not interested.
- The food was below average. We ordered the the lamb and vegetable potstickers, they were both very uninteresting. We also tried some noodle dish which was ok, and hot and sour soup which I found too sour.
- Their prices are very very high for the quality of food.
