Tacos El Gordo is a late-night-drunk-eats kind of venue, located very conveniently in a strip mall near the Strip. Sorry Vegas people, but this place doesn't stand a chance against LA Mexican food.
The carne asada fries were mediocre at best -- really bland. Had to go and ask for more sauce but it didn't help much. The adobado taco was actually pretty good.
I must hand it to the guys that run the place though. The restaurant is seriously a well-oiled machine. Runs super efficiently and the place is actually clean.
