I have been to Las Glorias twice with people from work.  Both times I was underwhelmed.  The first time I went the service was good.  They were great about bringing out chips with salsa and bean dip and refilling drinks.  The second time I came the service was horrible.  We were there for over 1.5 hours because we had to wait for EVERYTHING and it was not very busy.  I was not impressed with the food.  They seem to put raw onions in everything, including the cheese enchiladas.  I really dislike raw onions and am a pro at finding dishes without them, but you cannot escape them here.  The rice and beans were good, but I cannot say much else for a positive about this place.  I will not be back!
