Am I the only hater on here?  The store seemed really messy to me and my ultimo burrito (or whatever the called it) was soggy.  Pretty sure I could feed the burrito to my 5 month old daughter and her pediatrician would not have objected.  That's how soggy it is.  It's also possible that a combination of Cafe Rio in combination with the plethora of authentic Mexican Food in this city has spoiled me in regards to Mexican food.  The salsa was really chunky too.  I know some people enjoy the consistency of a good pico de gallo but that is really not my thing.  Bottom line is I did not enjoy my lunch here.  I thought it was over priced for the quality of what I got.  It's the southwest man...THE SOUTHWEST.  You can get to Mexico in 6 hours...you can do better than Baja Fresh.
