Horrible....what happened??? Food is about the same as del taco. Beans were bland, taco were slightly warm, guacamole need a balance of acid and salt. Ceviches, uh no, just say poached fish with lemon juice. They said the chef is from Mesa grill, well now I know what Gordon Ramsey was talking about. 

As for the service and the restaurants standards? Water glasses were all spotty, silverware was spotty as well. Edges of the resturant was very dusty, debris on the floor, dirty tables, and as i was sat down the busser nor servera ever wiped the seat from the prior table. I seen my busser more than I did my server who may I add was either talking to Co workers at the bar or elevator. I guess the idea is to come to work and watch sports and chill out, thinking we will some tip. Better service at a local pub. What is the direction of this place to discourage people from coming in hope to send them to the new location? 

I have been here a few times from past to present and I understand every restaurant has its quirks, even the one I work at.  But brunch has always been great, an affordable dinner before a show or event was alway good for a mexican restaurant.  We have been back for both and since the change of a chef and what looks like to be managers this place is not worthy of a honorable mention from Al in his reviews. I know he has a soft spot for the owners, but I think he really needs to revisit.  Or maybe it just too much tequila shots while he is here. Lol.
