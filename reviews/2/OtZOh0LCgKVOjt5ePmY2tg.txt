Taco Bell. Cheap, Tasty, and Vegetarian Options. All major pluses.

Unfortunately, this location is really not up to par with most other Taco Bells. Most concerning would be the issue of Order Accuracy. Now, I realize mistake do happen, but they should not be happening ALL THE TIME. This location must quickly revamp it's procedures so that they can fix this. One need only look at reviews, or listen to word of mouth, to know that this location is notorious for giving people the wrong orders, charging them incorrectly, ect..

Also, please take a look at your shift managers, and frankly, your leadership in general. When asked probing questions about allergy and dietary restrictions procedures, some managers fared better than others, although most did not appear to be well-versed on this issue. All seemed inconvenienced. In general, the managers just need to be held to a high standard, and it starts at the top with the General Manager. This means knowing how to respond to allergy concerns, greeting customers within moments of entering the store, and apologizing when things don't go as they should.

To sum it all up, it is more than clear this Taco Bell needs a revamp campaign soon, if they wish to remain competitive.
