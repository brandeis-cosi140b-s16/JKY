Not happy with the food at all. They don't have fountain drinks. Over priced food. They don't trim the fat from the meat or re heat it. It's always chewy. And the funny thing is I got the carne asada french fries one time. And asked  for everything on it. And it only came with meat, tomatoes and cheese. Ha. What a joke. You think with the place named cilantro they would at least throw cilantro on it as well. I would rather take the time to drive to another restaurant. That has better cheaper food. I don't see them being open long.
