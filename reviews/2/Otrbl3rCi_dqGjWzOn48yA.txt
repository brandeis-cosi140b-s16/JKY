I have heard how great this place was, so thought I would give it a try.  I have to say that the Green Chile Cheese Crisp is amazing, so simple and add some of their great salsa it is a winner.  However that being said, the place was a mess!  We were ignored the first 15 minutes we were there.  The restaurant is DIRTY. the tables the floors the walls just gross dirty.  The health department should shut them down just for that, can't imagine the kitchen!  If you were a fan of the tv show Will and Grace, you will be happy to know that Rosario has found work here, and she is just full of mean, no funny!  The food was bland, there was no seasoning at all that I could tell and it was all so mashed together on my plate I wasn't even sure what I was eating.

Brave it Once for the Green Chile Cheese Crisp then find a place that has some flavor, and that is clean!
