Highly disappointed today. BEWARE non BEEF and PORK eaters... Today, I ordered the 'combination 2 tacos' . Apparently, most food orders are for BEEF instead instead of CHICKEN. Needless to say, I don't eat beef or pork - their website doesn't specify BEEF or PORK - 

And the kicker is, when I called their establishment to speak with a manager, I couldn't get past the young lady on the phone to leave my comment. 
It was stated "that the customer needs to specify CHICKEN with their order". Granted, I take partially responsibility for that - how about not assuming that all customer's eat BEEF and PORK and ask them their meat preference. 
Furthermore, when speaking with the young lady there was no recommendation to try to fix my order, no apology, no nothing to try to amend this. 

Azteca update your website to reflect chicken/beef/pork or what have you instead of assuming that or a great majority of them eat BEEF. 

You live and you learn huh! On a more positive note, my rice and beans were edible and quite delicious.
