I ate here and was in the bathroom three times.  Not a great experience.  I give it two stars because the servers are nice, but their food is just not good at all.  

Their location on 16th St & Camelback has excellent queso dip.  We ordered it here and it felt like plastic.  The flavor was ok, but you had to keep stirring it so it would't congeal up.  

Ordered their rolled taco plate.  When it came out the cheese wasn't melted on it, the rice was bland, beans were bland.  The meat on the inside was ok, but I couldn't finish it.  

What happened Ajo?  YOu guys were once great.  Won't be coming back here again.
