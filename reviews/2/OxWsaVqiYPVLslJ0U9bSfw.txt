Average Mexican food served in a Vegas style setting.

We have been eating here for years during baseball Spring Training and other sporting trips. The food is REALLY average and pricey. The place is usually filled with seniors since it is quiet unlike some of the more rowdy margarita bar places (Camarone's, El Torito, etc...). The ambiance is pleasant enough with a Cesar's Palace fake sky ceiling, but at best is a "safe" place to eat with no real endearing qualities for food or service. If you're not inclined to be adventurous, it is safe, but that's about it.
