Slow delivery, that also never arrived. Not only did I not get a confirmation of delivery until an hour after I ordered. They then called ad asked if I lived somewhere I didn't (even though they have the address). After waiting so long and no hope for delivery, I just went out and got food.  

I gave them two stars because grubhub was also a part of this stupidity.
