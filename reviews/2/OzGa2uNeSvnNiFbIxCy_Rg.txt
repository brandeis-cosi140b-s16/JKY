I like Del Taco it reminds me of Might Taco in Buffalo NY. But this is the hands down the worst location Del Taco owns. They have forgotten my sour cream on my tacos 3 orders now - only went 3 times so far, so not that good. To be honest they put it on just one of 6 once , which is prob the more frustrating. The dang sour cream cost as much as the tacos but I like it. Tacos have all the meat in a lump, cheese one end and they are too lazy to fold the paper around them properly so you have lettuce all over  before you even eat. The location is not dirty but looks like a high school just passed though every time i visit. Go next door to taco bell or Whataburger.
