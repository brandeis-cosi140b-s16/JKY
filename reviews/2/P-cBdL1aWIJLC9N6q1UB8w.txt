The drinks were good. And if you scape all the sauce and cheese lumped all over the tamale, it's good too. The chimichanga seemed like it had been made then nuked so it was unrealistically boiling hot in the inside. 
I was soooo disappointed as the crowd was large, but the drink was good so maybe that was the draw.
