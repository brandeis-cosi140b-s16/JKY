I originally went to Qdoba's step brother's place, Chipotle, but there was a long line, so I went down the street to Qdoba's (no line), and ordered a Chicken Bowl (to go). 

I was quite hungry, and when I ordered, I was surprised (and my hungry stomach), of how little they put in there..... I had to tell them to put MORE in, Rice, Beans, Chicken, etc...    

I'm used to going to Chipotle almost every night for dinner (yes I'm a bachelor and don't cook), and they pile it on (without having to ask for more).

If Qdoba is trying to be like Chipotle they are doing it wrong.

Just fill up the bowl without me having to ask for more, and I'll be one happy (repeating) customer. 

Cheers
