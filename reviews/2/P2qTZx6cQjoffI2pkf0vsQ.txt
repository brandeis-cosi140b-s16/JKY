Had you asked me to write the review after my first visit I would have given three stars.  Now that we have been back for a second stop, it has dropped to a 2 star experience. 

Biggest plus - the chips are hot fresh and the salsas are tasty.

However, the entress are just a soupy mess of sauce, beans, rice and whatever you ordered.  It seems they plate the food, then throw it under a broiler or heat lamp to perfectly melt everything into one congealed mess.  Flavor is jsut ok, as the two stars say, "meh, I've experienced better."

Still on the quest for a better upscale Mexican Dinning experience.  Somewhere where they rice and beans are not one big mess covered in sauce and sour cream.  Somewhere where they take the time to plate a nice plate of food.
