Sunday football... 8 tv's with the Cowboys game on. NOT ONE TV with the Cardinals on.... The home team. The person controlling the tv's said he could put it on a back TV and that they "accommodate everyone, but most Cardinals fans stay at home to watch the games." Very irritating. But I'm always happy with the bartenders & most of the time by the food. Prices are slightly high, but it's the only sports bar on this side of town so they know they can get away with it.
