There is a lot of pretty good Meixcan food.  Other wise I would have given it one stars.  The service 9 out of 10 times is not good.  In fact  I have been there and gotten an attitude more than once. My main complaint is this place closing early.  Today they closed early for Easter.  One hour early I think is a pretty bad excuse.   If this was the first time I went all the way over there and they closed early that would be one thing but this is the second time this has happened.  Think I have eatten there for the last time.
