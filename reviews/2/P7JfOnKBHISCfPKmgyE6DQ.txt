Brushfire is yet another restaurant that has jumped on the chipotle trend. They do offer additional items (tapas) however that is not offered by Chipotle. They have potential to be better than chipotle as their flavors work well.  However, with the exception of their shrimp, they are consistently under seasoning their tough dry meat. Long story short, get the shrimp. 

Also if you're going to charge $9.50 for a "burrito bowl" make sure it's worth $9.50. The technique was sloppy. I had 6 inch chiffonade pieces of lettuce which I had to twirl around my fork and whole pieces of onion which wasn't pleasant. For $5.50 you would have possibly received a five stars for your shrimp bowl but if you're gonna charge $9.50 you'll get graded on that level. 

All in all, season well and keep your meat moist.
