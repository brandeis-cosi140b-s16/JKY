I tried really hard to like this place, but in the end, no different than a Cantina Laredo. Table side guacamole was average compared to other places ( La Grande Orange has the best). Skirt steak tacos were good but were so heavy there is a reason why they only give you three quarter sized ones. Dessert was the most disappointing. The churros were soggy and the milkshake that came with it was terrible.
