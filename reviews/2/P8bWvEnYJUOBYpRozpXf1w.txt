Horrible!! The queso was not really queso, it was melted cheese that was hard and cold. The service was not friendly and unprofessional. The service was giving each other high fives and talking to one another in front of the table. They went to take the food without asking if we were done, I had to stop them and ask for a box. Lastly, the music was so loud! We couldn't talk and hear one another or your own thoughts. When we asked if they could turn down the music the server rudely stated that they don't do that here. When we asked someone else they stated when they are busy they turn the music louder. We were shocked! To top it all off they gave us a pen to sign our checks with a pen from another hotel on the strip not even an MGM property. Shows the attention to detail and the quality of place it is! Save your money and go somewhere else.
