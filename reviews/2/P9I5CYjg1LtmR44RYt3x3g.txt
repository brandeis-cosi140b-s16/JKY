Sunday afternoon.  We are the only people in this restaurant.  There are 4 people in the kitchen.  There are dirty tables, food crumbs on the floor & our order took way too long!  I heard them send out order 251 (drive thru) before our order (#248) was up.  We eat at Taco Bell A LOT and this was just really bad service!  Our order was correct aside from a missing side of cheese for my nachos.
