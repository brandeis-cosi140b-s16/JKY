Went there for lunch today and here's my take - Great Service, but the food is best eaten when drunk because it's meh, and still at Scottsdale downtown prices.

All in all, for food I'd rather go to Chuy's at 32nd St &Thomas Rd seven days a week instead.

However...it did look like a fun place to hang out on a Friday night so I might be back for  a beer in the future!
