Hmmmm, what happened to La Salsa margaritas!! We ordered a couple of margaritas and it seemed they were made with an overload of sugar. When they were located in the middle of the Forum Shops, they had that very distinctive tart and tequila taste. Now, they taste like your typical chain Mexican restaurants - indistinguishable!! La Salsa please go back to your original recipes and maybe your location - it was much more fun there. Also, your hostess must have been bored lighting and burning matches at the host stand and watching them burn till the very end.
