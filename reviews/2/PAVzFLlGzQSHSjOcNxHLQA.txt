This place is seriously overrated. Chips and salsa were horrible by standards of other Mexican restaurants located near by. The cheese crisp had hardly any cheese on it! Seating was catastrophic, had to wait 40mins when I could visibly see 10 tables open and set. This place was also like douche-bag central! Just reminds me of the Scottsdale Bars song!

If you wanna spend this much cash and get better food and drinks, go to the mission in old town Scottsdale!

On a good note however, once seated we did receive good service!
