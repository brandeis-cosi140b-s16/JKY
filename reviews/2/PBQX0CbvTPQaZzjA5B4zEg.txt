The food is really great. However, go to Chipotle if you want better service. The young woman who helped me, totally overcharged me and seemed like she was in a bad mood. 

Dear Salsaritas team (on the night shift): fix your attitudes - I know it sucks selling burritos in a airport, however, don't take it out on your hungry, paying customers.
