As I'm sitting here this morning casting my Zagat votes I cant help but feel underwhelmed by the selections on their "Arizona's Top Restaurants" I cant help but wonder why some of these places are on here. Is Barrio Cafe really the best of? For me, I think not.

We went with about 6 friends so we were able to try many things on the menu. However nothing even remotely stood out. Oh yes something did, the loud dining room. It was so loud we were literally shouting at one another from across the table. I love to talk over dinner so my throat was pretty hoarse afterwards.. ah yes, the waiter was a very nice looking man and was super flirty with all of us.. he got a big tip.

Otherwise I scratch my head and wonder why so many people gush over this place? Its not bad, its just blah.
