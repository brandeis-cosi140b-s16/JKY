This place has pissed me off for the last time.  Well, probably not the last time, but it should be.  I've not been a regular because the food is so incredibly awesome, it's just okay.  I've been a regular because of the location and the reliably good service.  That seemed to all change once smoking was banned in the bar.  

They are now eager to sit you in the bar as much as they can, especially if you come during a slow period.  I don't have a problem with that except the service really sucks in the bar.  We've given them several chances, and it's always the same.  Last night after braving the flood waters, we left before we ever saw drinks as the only server in the area was too busy chatting it up at the bar to ever come over.  But on a positive note, the hostess who seated us thanked us for coming in.  She's an observant one.
