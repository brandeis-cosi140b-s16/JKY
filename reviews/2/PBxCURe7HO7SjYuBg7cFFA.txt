This place is overrated. Way too expensive for Mexican food. It took a long time to find the place, especially because the MGM is renovating. We were seated quickly and the place had a cool vibe with red walls, selective lighting, and a river like thing going through the middle. The chips and salsa are cool because they give you 3 salts and 3 salsas, but I never knew what each thing was (the woman who was explaining mumbled and glazed over it), but honestly nothing special. I ordered the steak tacos. They were pretty spicy and you have to make them yourself, and sadly the best part of the whole meal were the beans. My boyfriend got the enchiladas and he said they were really good, and it made me wish I had ordered that. I would definitely not go back, and would save my money and go to La Salsa on the strip instead.
