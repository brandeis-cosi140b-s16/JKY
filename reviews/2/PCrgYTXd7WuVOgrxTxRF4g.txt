So we were looking for some good old Mexican food on a Sunday night of  study overload, and were disappointed. We saw on Yelp that it was rated 4.5/5 stars...what a waste!!

My friend had two tacos de cabeza and two tacos de lengua and she said that it was mediocre and not surprised at all. I had the chicken quesadilla and wasn't pleased very much either. I asked for everything on it and let's just say they're VERY VERY onion happy. In hopes that the horchata would make up for the lack of taste in food, we were AGAIN let down. It was watered down.
