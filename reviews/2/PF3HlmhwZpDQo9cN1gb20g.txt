Dined last night 1/28/14

First, let me say that  the food at Taco Guild is (mostly) awesome. The salsa is too runny, though, and I judge a lot about  Mexican food experience on the quality of the salsa. I had the grilled romaine salad and a side of corn-off-the-cob that was delicious, and their draught beer selection from local breweries is solid. 

HOWEVER, the service is so horrendous that it nearly neutralizes all of the positives of the cuisine. First, our waitress brought me the wrong wine. Instead of allowing the table to keep the accidental glass, from which I had already drunk, she said that she had to take it back from me, or charge me for it. Really?? You'd rather waste a perfectly good glass of wine  than just let us consume it? I surely hope you weren't going to pour it back into the bottle for reuse!! 
Secondly, one of the members of our table did not receive his drink, and upon waiting  fifteen minutes for it to arrive, instead of admitting she forgot, the waitress told us it was because the drinks are handmade, thus taking a long time. Said drink arrived three minutes later. Then he did not receive his soup, then he only received a single a-la-carte taco rather than the full plate that he ordered. Then he received the wrong side dish with the plate. It was absurd. 

Third, after mentioning to one of the owners (who I am told also partially owns z tejas) that we didn't care for the jukebox (the general public seems to have an affinity for mediocre 90s alt rock), his reply was, "Okay. Pretend it isn't there."
What a rude, smug, jerk. 

I'll be going elsewhere for my Mexican food. I'd rather not wait 15 minutes for the wrong class of wine, while being forced to listen to the Gin Blossoms.
