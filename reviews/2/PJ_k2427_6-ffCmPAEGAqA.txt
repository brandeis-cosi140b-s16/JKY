Summary: A roller coaster ride of review updates for this Robertos Taco location. 

I am not sure why it has to be this way, but it is (this way). This place is as consistent as I am religious in keeping to "clean" language in reviews (which is to say not at fucking all). 

You get a public service discount one day, you don't the next. 
You get a drink with your combo (they are listed as coming with one, and certainly implied in the term), and you don't. 

I'm wondering if they are as A or B with their hand-washing back there. (Every one working with food should be A-type personalities when it comes to sanitation.)

One year they are two stars; incrementally they make a fan out of a skeptic; then, they manage to fuck it all up again. 

The breakfast burritos are the shittiest I have purchased at any other location on planet Earth. Pro Tip: Don't buy them. Just get a lunch/dinner burrito really fucking early. Your stomach will suffer one way or another at 4 a.m..

I wish I never met you, Robertos. I wish I could Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind you. Damn you.
