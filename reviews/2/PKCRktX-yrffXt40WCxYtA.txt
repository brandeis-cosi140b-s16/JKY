My Wife and I had dinner there, very colorful place at first, seemed like it'd be good. They model themselves after a real Mexico City restaurant, and I'm not sure what that's all about! Food was bland and boring, and I didn't find it to be authentic at all. Service was OK, it was very crowded, but that didn't hinder the waitress. Won't be going back.
