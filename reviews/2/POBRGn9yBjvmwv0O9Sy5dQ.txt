I'm so bummed I even feel like this but they don't even deserve a 3 star. I ordered the chips and salsa, soft tacos, churro and burrito with chicken in it. The salsa was so bland-_-. I love Mexican chips and salsa and this has been the worst (maybe it was a bad batch) . It was also the only "taco sauce" offered for my soft tacos but the "taco sauce" was really the same as the "salsa". I asked the cashier for condiments like sour cream and was told it was in the bag along with the "taco sauce (haha)" , chips and salsa and sour cream. When I looked in the bag there was only "salsa" for my chips.-_-. So I went back to cashier and she tells me that they don't offer sour cream....um ok. It is what it is....at least everything else was positive outside of this place.
