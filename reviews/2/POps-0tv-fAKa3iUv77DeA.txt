The ambiance is fun, colorful and the music is good.  Located inside a hotel & valet parking available.  

Food was ok, but FAR from authentic Mexican food.  The presentation was nice, but not quite functional ( i.e. Container holding the guacamole and crab was sphere like and sideways facing - not ideal for scooping up or dipping anything.)

Ceviche was NOT ceviche, was definitely more creamy and somewhat watered down and seafood was almost non-existent.

Fish tacos were tasty but definitely appetizer-sized.  (By far the best of all dishes, followed by guac+crab)

Chicken tacos were okay, but not anything spectacular.  

Service was ok.  I didn't feel particularly welcome.  Not really a family-friendly place, although our waiter was nice, but not really attentive. The bussers were really nice, even after some spilled beverages.  

Overall, two stars for super small portions on non-practical platters (although very cute) that were overpriced.  

But, if you're looking for a good place for a Happy Hour, I'd say YES to this place!
