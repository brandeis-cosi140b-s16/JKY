I would like to start out my review by saying Laredo's used to be one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in town. However, my last two visits have left a lot to be desired. Like other reviewers have noted it seems that they have cut back on their food quality to save money. My family and I visited recently and ordered the following: 3 tacos, regular nachos, enchiladas meal, and two kids meals (quesadillas). The meat in all the dishes had chunks of potatoes (at first I thought they were large onions) which I thought was very odd. The kid's quesadillas were just a small tortilla with shredded cheese folded in half and pressed. Our bill came to $40.00 and I felt like at best we had about $8.00 worth of food out of a Sysco can and heated up. Service is good. Food not so good.
