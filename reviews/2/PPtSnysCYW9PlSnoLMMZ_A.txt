Disappointed, just another Mex chain restaurant.  Pro: clean and spacey, friendly staff, easy parking, very nice salsa bar with all the chips (fresh) and salsa you wish, dishes have quite large portions of pork and chicken in them as well as green pepper, their green chili sauce is very tasty.  Con: chicken has no flavor, somewhat dry, skimpy on the onions in the fajita burrito, all the sauces taste alike and none are hot, crispy taco just fell apart, was truly finger food.  I would rate them 2 1/2 stars.  Obviously, we won't be back!
