went there last sunday. place was busy but not full.got served chips, salsa and water immediately. never got our drink or food order taken for the 30 minutes we were there. got up and told the manager but all he was interested in was what table we were seated at. the three of us walked out. scottsdale location is great but won't return to pima road location.
