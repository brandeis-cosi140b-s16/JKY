We stopped in for lunch at 2:30, the only ones in the place, service was okay, ordered a Modelo draft and a super burrito. The Bartender wasn't sure what was on it but went ahead and ordered anyway. it came out luke warm. No sals and very bland. The order of Guacamole was strange in comparison to any other guac I have ordered and it was bland too. Wont be back
