On Sundays they have tamales and the menu has no price and says 'ask your server' our server didnt know if they had tamales, found out they did, then she didnt know what type, came back with pork, then didnt know how much they cost, then came back with the price. I figure if you have a Sunday only special they would have it on the board up front or a piece of paper w/the menu. I ordered a soda water and it only came in the bottle... I didnt eat, friend did, she said it was good but I think it was so-so based on how little she ate. I wouldnt personally go back, just not a lot of appeal to the place and the staff seems less than happy to be there.
