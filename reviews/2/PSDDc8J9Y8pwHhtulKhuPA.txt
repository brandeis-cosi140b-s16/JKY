Couldn't wait for it to open, drove past every day surprised to see just a  piece of wood spray-painted "Open soon".  Finally called and found out it was open.  I find it odd that they didn't take the time to paint an "Open at Last" sign.  Anyway, I really enjoyed the other location, so I expected basically the same thing.  The restaurant is very nice - but scaling up the dig includes raising $ as expected.  My margarita was very tasty  - better than the other spot but the food went downhill.  I'm so disappointed!!  Chips and salsa were good, entrees- just okay, beans and rice, really bad. 

I hope they figure it out - love having them in the neighborhood.
