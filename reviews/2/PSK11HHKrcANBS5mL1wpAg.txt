My wife and I decided on a whim to check out Rubio's. I had a burrito and she had a salad. The total came out to 16 dollars which I thought was really high but I figured they must give you a lot of delicious food. In short, the burrito was not very large and I still felt hungry afterwards. The food was pretty good but it wasn't 16 dollars worth of deliciousness. My wife also thought the salad was ok but not amazing. They do seem to put a lot of effort into atmosphere and decorations, so maybe they have to make enough money to afford the decorations.
