I don't really understand how "Modern Mexican" really fits into the title of the Camelback corridor restaurant. I have been on two separate occasions now and have been anything but impressed. The quality of the food is always bland and the service seriously lacks. I would not recommend anyone to try this place. STAY AWAY!!!
