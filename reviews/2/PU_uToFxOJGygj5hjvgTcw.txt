I expected little from them and they delivered! First off, it's ridiculoulsy noisy. I dont mind music while I'm eating but it was really really loud. The food menu looked horrible. Nothing looked good on the menu, and when I saw them deliver food, none of that looked very good either. Vegetarian options are pretty non existent.  Our froggerita drink was pretty decent though. Wouldnt come back. Better drinks elsewhere as far as I'm concerned.
