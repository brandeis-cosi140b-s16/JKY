Don't get me wrong the food is great! And great portions! We went as a Easter brunch date and the bar was packed which was okay the bartender offered us a drink right away which was great, there was a little spot that was opening up soon so we stood and waited when the spot opened we walked towards the seating and another more appealing table opened up and a man directed us and said that the tables were seating only for 3 or more people. While watching a couple of "2" get up from the table, we were very confused, we didn't understand the seating arrangement was he going to make us stand until a 2 seating space opens? But yet some staff directed us to a huge table in the back seating 15 but we can sit there. Over all I would love to go back, and hopefully have a spot at the bar top. but I will have to get over that service,
