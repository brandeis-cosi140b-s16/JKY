I really want to write a great review about this place given the location and atmosphere. Unfortunately, the first time I came here, my party was seated only to not be greeted by the waiter for 20 minutes (wish I could say I was exaggerating...) so we left before ever meeting our waiter. We gave it a second try some time later, and sorry to say the food was a let down. The queso is straight velveeta cheese with some chorizo on top. The drinks were good and our waitress was sweet, but returning here for food is not in my future.
