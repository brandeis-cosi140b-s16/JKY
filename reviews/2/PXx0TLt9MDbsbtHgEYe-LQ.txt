I had the shrimp tacos, my niece had the El Green-Go Burrito. They charge for chips and salsa... and for me anyone who charges for chips and salsa is lame. I'm from houston and we have the best mexican/texmex food around, so as far as the food goes its just 2 stars for me.

The shrimp tacos were good, but just ok. same with the rice and beans. I've had better. Too many other great food places in vegas to spend money here. My niece said her food was good, but also mediocre. probably wouldn't be a repeat for me. 

The staff was very nice. that was probably the best part of the experience. That is all. :)
