We ordered drinks and waited for them for over 30 minutes. Waitress 1 stopped by. Once we said we hadn't received them, she said she would follow up. Waitress 2 stopped by and said she would follow up, but no luck.

Both of them walked by our table multiple times afterwards and saw we didn't have our drinks. Never got our drinks so we found another bar nearby. 

Seemed like a cool place (hence 2 stars instead of 1) but didn't get to experience it.
