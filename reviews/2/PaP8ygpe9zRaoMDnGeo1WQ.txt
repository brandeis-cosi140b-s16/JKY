I was in the Henderson location for lunch today.  I saw that you had chips and guac listed on your menu for 9.95 and then a picture next to it showing the Daddy's Chip Plate.  The only thing added was the queso.  I figured that since there was no price mentioned it could't be much more then just the guac.  WRONG!  I was charged 18 dollars and feel completely ripped off.  I dont think I will be going back even though the food was very good.  Not right to not post prices and then charge an arm and a leg for chips!
