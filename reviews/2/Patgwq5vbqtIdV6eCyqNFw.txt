Came with a party of 8 waiting in their lounge area to be seated when all of a sudden I realize our orders were being taken and silverware being placed at waiting area. Ordered ceviche good but nothing at all special small for the price. Husband ordered 2 tacos and bowl of noodles which was tasty. I was left not full I asked waiter if we could have salsa &chips, which was brought out after asking for them you would expect automatic especially for a high priced restaurant. Salsa was not special. Food is Pricey for such a small amount of food. Was hungry after an hour and a half later.
