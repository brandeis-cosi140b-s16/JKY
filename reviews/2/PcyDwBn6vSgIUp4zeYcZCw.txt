What can I say...foodwise, Chevys is Chevys. I was with my 6 year old and she was so well behaved, never even got up from her seat. The food came out quick then our waiter disappeared. 20 mins after we're done I saw him an asked for the bill...another 20 mins.  My daughter was getting anxious but asked, why don't you just ask someone else for the payment (she calls that the bill). Horrible horrible service. There were only 4 tables on the patio, not close to being busy.
