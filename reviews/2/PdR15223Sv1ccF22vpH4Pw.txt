Stopped for a Latin Lunch. I think this is primarily Mexican- American food. Socal, Tex it's all the same to me for the most part. I decided on the chiliquiles because with the egg, it's a healthier type of meal. It's a newer reastaurant too. 

I opened the container and there was this kind of oily pile of tortilla mush with some sauce and lot's of seasonings. I was so hungry so I started eating but it was not the good spice I look for. It just seemed that they added too much heat to the dish, it was all I could taste. As for the egg?? I didn't see any. I ate enough to lose my hunger pangs but would not order that item again. 

My lunch partners ordered tacos, a fish salad, and a taco salad that all looked better than my choice. I know the office will order from there again so next time I will try the fish salad.
