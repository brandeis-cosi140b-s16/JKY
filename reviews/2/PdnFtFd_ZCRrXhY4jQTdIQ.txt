I have to agree with the lower ratings. There was a peculiar non food smell when I entered the restaurant. There were just plastic plates and utensils. The restaurant appeared to be clean, however it was a very sterile atmosphere. I had chicken enchiladas with rice and beans, chips and salsa. The rice had some corn green beans and peas in it but with very little flavor. The refried beans were bland. The chicken and ingredients appeared to be fresh however there was very little flavoring to the ingredients. Overall it was a rather bland affair
