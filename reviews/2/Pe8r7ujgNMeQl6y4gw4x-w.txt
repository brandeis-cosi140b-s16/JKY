I've been here twice in the weeks since it opened. The first time I had two shrimp tacos and couldn't even finish them, they were so rubbery and gross. I chalked it up to opening week jitters. I went back this weekend for brunch and realized that it's not opening week issues - Hot Taco's food just sucks. 

My roommate and I played it safe and ordered nachos. They were probably the worst nachos I've ever had. No salsa, just chopped up tomatoes (I'm guessing it was supposed to be pico de gallo). Pickled, not fresh jalape√±os. The chicken was over-cooked and the chips were really, really salty. I don't know how a Mexican-centric restaurant can screw up nachos so badly, but they did. 

I gave it two stars overall because the blood orange lemonade mimosas were decent.
