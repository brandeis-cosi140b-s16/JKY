I give this place 2 stars. first being seated when it wasnt very busy it still took quite a while to have our drinks ordered/. price for a 16 oz coors draft is 4.00 which i think is a bit high for a low starred place. i can go to chilis and get a 22 oz for 3.50 -400 . corn ships were very bland VERY BLAND. hot salsa tasted like plain tomatoe sauce with seeds in it. the regular salsa had almost no cilantro in it and was in a jar in which you had to then pour over your bland chips.sorry but i like to scoop.I ordered the the small taco which i cant remember the name of ,and wasnt too bad. cannot go wrong with onions and a little cilantro . it would make anything taste good really.
