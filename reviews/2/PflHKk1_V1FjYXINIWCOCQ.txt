Food wasn't very good at all and a little expensive for the quality. Service was slow and wasn't much customers in the place. I ordered the choose 3 tacos. 1 shrimp. 1 fried fish. 1 grilled fish. The shrimp was alright but the other two were just horrible and chewy. I bet the fish had been sitting under a heat lamp all day had become hardened from being so dry. The cabbage they put on the tacos was tasteless and I ended up just scraping it off by the third taco. Chicken quesadilla was also tasteless with just grilled chicken and mozzarella. Didn't even seem like they used seasoning. I'm not aloud to pick lunch anymore. Thanks Baja Fresh!
