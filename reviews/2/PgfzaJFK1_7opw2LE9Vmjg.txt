Asian-Mexican Fusion. Saw this on Diners Drive-Ins and Dives and decided to be adventurous. They give you samples of rice, beans, and pork which was nice so you weren't ordering blindly. 
Trying to order was a bit confusing because of the system they use. 
The fusion of the foods just doesn't work. It's like putting Panda Express sweet and sour chicken inside a Taco Bell quesadilla. I wasn't a fan. They do give you a snicker doodle cookie with your order which was the best part of the meal.
