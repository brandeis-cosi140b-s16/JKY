I really really wanted to like it.  Its very authentic, unfortunately not everyone from a foreign place is a great cook...

The mini chimichangas were probably the best part of the meal though one of them had unrolled a bit in the frying process.  They put shredded meat, red onion and green and red peppers in it which was a nice touch.  Then it goes downhill...

Carne asada - the meat was very grisley and rather bland.  It wasn't cooked great, had a weird coloring.  The fajita platter - the chicken was basically a flattened, pan fried salt and pepper seasoned meat.  Shrimp was also not interesting.  The meat was the same as carne asada.

They're very nice and all.  I wish the food and the general order of the place was a little better..
