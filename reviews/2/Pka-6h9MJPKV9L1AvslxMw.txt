The food was okay but not worth the price, go to Maize instead.  The service was decent.  The problem was that the server did not have change to break the $50 bill the friend I went with had (the meal cost $32) and the guy behind the bar would not let her get into the cash drawer to make us change.  The lunch crowd was not that busy so they should have had a decent cash drawer.
