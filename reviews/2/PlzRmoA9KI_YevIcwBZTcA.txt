For starters the service was great but slow. Waitress was very friendly and the executive chef discounted our overall bill because we waited over 45 minutes for our lunch entr√©es.  The pop and lemonade tasted dirty. I sent back a total of three drinks and stuck with water. The chips and salsa were decent. I ordered beef and chicken fajitas. Beef tasted like teriyaki and the chicken was dry. Didn't really enjoy the overall taste of the beef and chicken combo. Most likely won't be going back.
