WE have been going here for some time, but things have changed. The food is mediocre at best now and the service slow. We think it may have changed owners or management. WE were a party of four with a toddler. They charged us a 20% premium. Other restaurants charge a 15 to 20% for large groups, but with a toddler they said that makes five and that's a large group to them. They, of course, never told us this until we discovered it ourselves, leaving it open for us to pay not only the 20% but also to leave a tip. Pretty slimy. WE approached what we thought was the manager and told him that we were not happy about this policy and his reply was, "I'm glad you don't like it...have a nice night" Really! Avoid this one, there are far nicer places with better food and better attitudes in Apache Junction and East Mesa.
