If I can say anything positive about this place, it has a great location and the employees are nice.  And they have a great little outdoor patio to eat in. 

But...this place is nowhere near as delicious as Chipotle.  And they are so slow, even when its not a peak meal time.   The Qdoba on Central is better.

This location is still pretty new, so maybe they are still working out some of the kinks.
