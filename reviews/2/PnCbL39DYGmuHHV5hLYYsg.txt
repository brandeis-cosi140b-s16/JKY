I'm from Hawaii and this is a far call to be called Hawaiian food. This is more like a chipotle but with things like Kalua pork and teriyaki chicken and beef. I got a bowl with rice with kalua pork and cabbage. I usually put soy sauce on my rice bowl but they didn't have any. If you are looking for an authentic hawaiian food experience this is not the place
