The staples of a good Mexican meal are simple good chips, flavorful salsa, beans and rice. Although they have nice crunchy chips the other three pillars are missing the mark.   The meats have one flavor- salt... Oh and dry. They were out of guac on a Saturday during lunch... That's just wrong!  The staff however is delightfully charming but not enough to make up for a lack of guacamole!  Location is convenient but the food is not enough to bring me back for more. I'm more of an authentic Mexican food lover than what Cucos has to offer. If you like bland and salty this is the joint for you.
