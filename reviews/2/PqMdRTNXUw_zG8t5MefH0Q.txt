The food at America's Tacos is always great. But this location just sucks. Went at 45 minutes  to closing. No beans. "We didn't make any because we are closing soon."  Ok. Just say we sold out. How about an ice tea? "We are closing soon so we don't have ice tea either." REALLY? The beans are why we go to America's. They didn't have horchata or jamica (sp?) either. I understand being ready for close but people were still coming into the store. The manager needs to sort this out.
