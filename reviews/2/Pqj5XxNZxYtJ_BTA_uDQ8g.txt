Like many, I was psyched for the opening of this location and I think the space is grand compared to the others I've been to. Sure, it's loud and proud, like the others, but it also features the many vegan options that make Mad Mex a pioneer in the Pgh area dining scene. Really, If it weren't for the vegan food (of inconsistent quality), I'd avoid the (obnoxious) Mad Mex atmosphere at all costs. 

But since they have discontinued the half priced food after 11pm at this location, the costs to avoid have increased. In other words, WTF. This review has been discounted by 50% to reflect my disappointment.
