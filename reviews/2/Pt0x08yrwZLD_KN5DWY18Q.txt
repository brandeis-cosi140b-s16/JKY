We were totally non-plussed. Their service was great, especially considering the busy crowd on a Friday night, and they were as fast as they could have been considering the crowd. But really, after the 25 minute wait, we were not at all impressed with the food. We both got a shredded beef burrito--pretty standard Mexican restaurant fare--but it was totally flavorless. Without the guacamole and/or pico, there was no flavor at all. Nothing to distinguish the beef from the shell from the beans. The texture/temperature/quality was great, but as far as actual Mexican quality burritos, these were sub-par and not worth the $20 it cost us. I'm not saying I won't come back, but I'm not planning it any time soon.
