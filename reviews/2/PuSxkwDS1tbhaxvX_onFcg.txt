I've been going here on and off for two years now...the service has really gone downhill the last couple times I have been in.  As has already been mentioned, they often have one person working the line, one cashier(who can only cashier and nothing else) and usually have at least one or two employees "supervising"...meanwhile the person on the line is backed up and apologizing to everyone waiting in line.  This backup most likely leads to the mistakes that have occurred, like not giving salad dressing with salad the last two times I picked up there...just disappointed in general
