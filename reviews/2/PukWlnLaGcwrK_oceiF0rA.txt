I foster kittens for a rescue and had to take them to be altered at the AHS yesterday. My husband works close by so we met up and had an early dinner here before the kittens were ready to be picked up. I haven't eaten at any El Pollo Loco restaurants in four years because the last time I did they gave us the wrong order. We threw caution to the wind, mainly because nothing else close looked good.

I ordered the taco salad and my husband got the chicken avocado taco combo. He liked his tacos well enough, but my taco salad was sprinkled with dry, hard pieces of chicken. They were so hard you could tap them on the table and it would make a clicking sound (if it wasn't covered in sauce, that is). I didn't complain, I didn't take it back. I will never again go to El Pollo Loco. I didn't learn my lesson before, serves me right.

I gave it two stars because my husband said his combo was "meh, it's okay"
