I so hate giving a Mexican restaurant two stars, but Cabo's was to disappointing. I arrived around lunch time and saw fajitas were on special for $7.99. Once being seated the table was dirty at which time I asked if they could wipe it down, and got a very rude look. I ordered chicken fajitas, which arrived in less than five minutes. Nice, but scary they arrived that quick. Well, I know why. It seems to me they had everything prepped and basically heated the fajita platter. The chicken was very dry and the onions, peppers, and tomatoes were so overlooked and it seemed to have a burnt smell. The side plate of rice of rice and beans was so cold and bland. I will say although the chips sucked the salsa was somewhat decent. Overall, such a disappointment.
