I visit this Taco Bell a little more often than I should, because some days I just need a quick bite to get me through an evening of errands or to pick me up after a very long shift at work. The food they serve is fine enough - by Taco Bell standards, of course. There's certainly better places for tacos and whatnot in the area, but this Taco Bell makes pretty tasty fast food that hits the spot on a bad day.

But man, the service! Every time I come here the drive-thru is horridly backed up for one reason or another. Not only are the workers not prompt in taking orders (not once have I been able to place an order right away after pulling up to the station to do so), said orders are never ready when people make it to the window. I honestly don't think they've ever had enough people on staff during my visits to handle orders from the drive-thru AND indoors. The result is delay after delay, and my "fast food" order here has never gotten to me under 15 minutes. And because of the design of the drive-thru you can't even leave to go to Wendy's when you're ready to give up. You're trapped and forced to sit. And wait. And wait...

I think whoever is managing the place really needs to re-evaluate the busy hours here and adjust staffing accordingly. It shouldn't take 15 - 20 minutes to get a cheap taco from a Taco Bell. Definitely skip this place if you're in a rush.
