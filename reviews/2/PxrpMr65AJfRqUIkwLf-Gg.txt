Yo Rita is a potential contender that consistently disappoints.

This place is great in theory -- schmancy tacos with a focus on offal. What's not to love? 

I follow them on twitter and will occasionally be lured in by enticing twitpics of sweetbreads or liver, but every time I go they fall short on execution. Meats are overcooked, ingredients that should be hot are served cold, waiters are needlessly surly. It's just kind of a bummer. 

Also, what gives with serving all the tacos on flour tortillas? So sad.
