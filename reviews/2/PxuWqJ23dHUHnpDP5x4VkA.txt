The hostess was really nice and friendly but as soon as we sat at are booth are waitress was so rude you can tell she just hated her job.. She took forever to come take are order . I ordered the taco salad with chicken (special order) asked for no tomato or onions. Food comes out really fast and I start mixing the salad a little bit I notice a couple tomatoes no big deal... eat a little bit more a whole layer of tomatoes ( even told her please make sure there is no tomatoes or onions ). She checks on Us once and i mention the tomatoes and I show her the plate of tomatoes I have now all she could say In the biggest attitude was I'm sorry We get done eating and we don't see are waitress again for 20 minutes she is no where to be found she finally showed up with are check and makes a comment by saying she tried to prices are things the best she could and then proceeds to say "homeboy is hungry this is a lot of food" .. (she is referring to my boyfriend)  like really you are basically calling him fat -_- RUDE! defiantly going to be a while till I go back
