I love Chipotle and give their food 5 stars. However, this location has to be the worst in Charlotte. It clearly suffers from a lack of good management. Employees are consistently unpleasant and seemingly cannot be bothered to regularly maintain the cleanliness of the dining area. I think it's safe to say that I am done with this location for now.
