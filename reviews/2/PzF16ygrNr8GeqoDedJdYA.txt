I don't know if I just went on an off night for the staff ...  Good thing I have a sense of humor.  I decided to keep my order simple, a fried been and cheese burrito.  For some reason they could not get it right and had to start over.  They were all running around behing the counter, everyone had to keep repeating their order as we moved down the line.  They also kept throwing red sauce on top of my burrito when I didn't ask for any.  I gave up and just had to laugh.  I won't be going back anytime soon.  Their trash was overflowing, we had a long wait in line (and it wasn't that busy) plus I didn't think their tortilla chips were good.  If the chips aren't good, I don't go back.
