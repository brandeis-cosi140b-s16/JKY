Food was ok, a little bland.  My big issue was the restaurant was HOT. They had no a/c on, and they had one huge fan which was pointed at the CASHIER!   I sweated through my entire meal.  If I return, which I am unsure of at this point, I would only get takeout.   Cashier seemed very much concerned with herself, and she had difficulty communicating in English.  Not impressed.
