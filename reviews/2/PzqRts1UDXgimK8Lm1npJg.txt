The service was great but unfortunately the Carne Asada on my mom's plate and my own was incredibly fatty. We were both quite disappointed. I was especially disappointed because I had never had the Carne Asada here.  I was also disappointed that this location did not light the appetizer queso fundido on fire like they do at other locations. For some reason the rice tasted weird too and the "fresh" tomatoes tasted bad as well.
