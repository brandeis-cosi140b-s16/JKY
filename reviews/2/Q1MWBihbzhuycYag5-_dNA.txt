I have sadly been to this On the Border more than once due to family members liking it. I just don't get it. The food here is substandard 'Mexican' that tastes extremely salty and is loaded with sodium, calories, and fat (their fish tacos have over 1800 calories... whoa). Their portions are outrageously large. Don't bother looking at their nutritional facts, it will make you sad.... And yes, I get it , Americanized Mexican food is generally bad for you, but at least it tastes good at other restaurants. To their credit, they do have a 'healthy' menu that lists the calories, unfortunately this food is also not very good. On my most recent visit, I got the 'healthy' combo with an enchilada and fajita taco with a side of grilled veg. The veg was fine, the taco tasted like they dumped a bunch of that lime juice that comes in the green bottle all over some prepackaged precooked chicken slices... not awesome, but made better by adding some of the grilled veg and some salsa to it. The enchilada was also nothing special, but not terrible. The husband's enchiladas were a 'salt lick.' A family member ordered the guac, which they made table side. I don't even know how they could make fresh guac so flavorless. I would not recommend on the border to anyone and am keeping my fingers crossed that I will not have to make a return visit.
