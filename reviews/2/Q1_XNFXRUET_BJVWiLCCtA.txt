Came to this place to show some friends, from Jersy, a good time and good food....you failed me Black Chili Grill.  The service sucked, our server had attitude and went AWOL...had to go find her to place the order. The only good thing, to a slight degree, the food but not enough to make me come back again...ever.
The place wasn't even busy when we arrived @ 7pm nor did it get busy by the time we left. It was embarrassing to have this sort of service when taking friends here for the first time. Shame on owner and management. For being a new restaurant, located at the Biltmore, you certainly would not pass the standards set by Gordon Ramsey.
