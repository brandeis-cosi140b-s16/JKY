I've been wanting to try this place and I finally made the commitment tonight. 
I'm a mexican food fanatic and love cheese enchiladas, I get them any chance I get. 
I was expecting this place to be similar to Los Favoritos or Filibertos.....a mexican fast food. 
It was what I had expected, but the quality was not up to par. 
They cooked my enchiladas in a styrofoam to go container in the microwave. 
The menu had great options, and I will return to give them a second chance.
