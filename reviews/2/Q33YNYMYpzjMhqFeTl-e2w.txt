Don't sit at the bar....you'll be ignored. It took a good 15 minutes to take our order, and chips & salsa were never refilled. It's not like it was busy either...3 other heartbeats in the bar area. 
A slightly better beer selection than other Mexican joints, but next time I'll go so where with better food and service and order a margarita instead.
