This evening was the last straw. I thought the last time I had rolled tacos, they sucked because it was the special of the day. Today, they sucked just as bad. This Filiberto's seems to have gone downhill. The meat inside was practically nonexistent and what was there was tough and dry. Not sure what Fili's adds to their guacamole but it's runny and tastes like plain avocado. On a positive note, the green sauce is tasty, but they don't give you enough of it.
