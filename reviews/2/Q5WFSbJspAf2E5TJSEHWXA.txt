Not knowing mas amigos had moved we went here for dinner. confused by the short menu and lack of customer service you order at the front take a number and sit down. I ordered a margarita that tasted flavorless and with no alcohol, my food was not the greatest. Cheap & quick way over priced.service was so so only 2 people working. Would not return there for dinner again.
