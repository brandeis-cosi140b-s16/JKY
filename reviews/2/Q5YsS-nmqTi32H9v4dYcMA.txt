This is the 2nd time I've eaten here. The first time I came here I had the pick 2 combo whch was enchiladas.  the 2nd time I was here was on New Years Day after filling up on $1 beer in the sports book. 
I dont remember what my bf ordered but I went with Beef Fajitas. The plate came out sizzling hot and smelled very good. I dont really eat tortillas but it came with a side plate of rice and beans. the beans are kinda runny and the rice is very much like what you would get out of the box of rice-a -roni. Well I love san francisco as much as the next person but this was not my fave rice but after a few beers it wasnt too bad. 
The fajitas were very small portioned. I know my bf took several stabs at my food but compared with other places I think I'd rather order something else next time. I guess I'm just so used to taking a box home to go- and this time .. there was no box to pack and it was rather greasy. 

Better yet to go to Los compadres on Trop and order some fajita meat to cook up or order some of their ready made food.
