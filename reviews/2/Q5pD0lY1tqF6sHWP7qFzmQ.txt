I love Baja Fresh but this location has killed my desire to eat at any Baja fresh anymore.  The food is terrible.  I used to eat the fish tacos at least 2x a week, and I loved their burritos.  The fish is always either greasy, overcooked or mostly batter.  I am not a fan of cilantro and it's now overkill in it to where I can't pick it out.  Used to love the salsa bar...the roasted salsa which is supposed to medium has gotten so hot we can't eat it,  Basically they phased us out with substandard food that's not so fresh.  The cleanliness is another issue.
