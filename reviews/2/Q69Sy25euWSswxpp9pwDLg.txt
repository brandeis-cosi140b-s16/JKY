I heard this place is similar to Chipotle.  Believe it or not we have never been to Chipotle. My wife nd got us both a Rumba Burrito with shreded beef (that was tender but not real flavorful), beans, rice and mango salsa.

Its not the best Mexican food,  that's because it is a fast food type restaurant. It is clean, has large portions, clean tables, decent prices. with plenty of parking. What more can you ask for?

As stated in another one of my earlier reviews regarding Mexican food. "I pretty much judge a Mexican restaurant on how their salsa tastes". Cafe Rumba's mild red salsa was to my suprise tasty. Their mango salsa was simply awesome. My only complaint was there wasn't enough of either one of them. 

FOOD: Super sized and fulfilling. They made sure you did not go home un-satisfied and hungry. PRICE: The prices were good for what you got! SERVICE: Staff was nice, and the service was up to par AMBIENCE: Looks pretty much like a typical fast food restaurant. CONCLUSION: Limited, Straight forward menu. It's not the greatest food / restaurant but definitely not the worst. I'll give them another try for sure.
