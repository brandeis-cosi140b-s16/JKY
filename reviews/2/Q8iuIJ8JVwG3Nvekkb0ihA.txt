Definitely not real Mexican.  More of a fusion food with Mexican dishes.  A salad with cranberries?  A basket of bread (good quality though) with olive tapenade?  A shame, i had such high expectations! I had the pork tacos and they were ok, a bit too salty and the tortilla either isn't homemade or has been sitting in plastic for quite some time.  My wife had a chili poblano dish with chicken and a massive wheat roll. I mean, come on, a french style sandwich roll?  She hated her dish, scraped the chicken and barely made it through the filling.  We left plates full of bread and the waiter said nothing, but he did give us his card for his personal art sales, a good touch to finish off the night.
