I'm not quite sure what all the fantastical chatty chat is all about. It's ok Mexican food, I've been there three times & have yet to have an orgasmic south of the border experience.  They do fork over the chips & salsa which is a plus, but the salsa is a lil on the ratty side in my personal opinion.

Maybe being from California I'm spoiled with fabuloso pintos?  I most likely won't be going back, I'll just wait until I go to CA.
