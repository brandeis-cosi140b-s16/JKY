I am totally shocked that people like this restaurant. I had the taco chicken salad. The  chicken was good but the bagged lettuce was terrible. The salsa wasn't salsa at all just hot sauce. The guacamole tasted watered down and tasteless. We had to add hot sauce, salt and squeeze lime from our water and still it sucked and was placed on top of a bed of shredded lettuce. The chips were so thin they broke every-time we tried to pick up the crappy guacamole. The cafeteria type setting was also sub-par. I will never go again!
