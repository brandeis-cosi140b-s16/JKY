Average to poor for quality and taste. 


We stopped by with hopes of having of a Chipotle-like experience. Despite a carbon copy approach to food, this place was uninspiring bland. There were too many uncharges for basic items such as fajita veggie. The food was not seasoned and my bowl was simply pitiful. They get a couple of points for cleanliness and service. Too bad the food left our entire party of 6 disappointed.
