We sat outside since it was a beautiful night. Well bad idea. It smelt off cigar smoke. It was disgusting! The food was ok for me but my husband took 1 bite of his and that was enough for him. It was horrible. Service was awful. Our meal took 2 hours!!! We didn't even have an appetizer!! With 3 kids this service was way too slow. It's like she forgot we were outside! Looked like we were her only table out there. Don't think we will ever go back!
