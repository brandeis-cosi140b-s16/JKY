So disappointed arrived early in time for happy hour  took awhile to get our drinks and both had only a hint of alcohol. Chips poor choice ,tasted stale, did not mind warm salsa but get rid of those chips. My dinner partner got lamb , way too salty , my mahi  mahi over powered by sauce and over cooked. Veggies not bad   But overall so sad  as the meal and drinks disappointing-place is so nice inside, lovely decor  , and please ditch the canned Mexican music ....
