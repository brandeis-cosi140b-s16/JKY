The food was okay.....even the chips were cold!  I drove out of my way to this location to eat the food and I was disappointed!   It should have "hit me in the head" to think that maybe this restaurant would NOT have good Salvadorian food since they were serving "Mexican" style tortilla chips.   Fresh Salvadorian hand-made tortillas with butter or cheese would have been BETTER!  Oh Well!
