Being a native Californian and a Mexican i crave tacos, but i crave authentic tacos and not that fake "white-washed" tacos. I want the real shizzle. So when i heard that there was an "Authentic" taco shop close to work, i instantly knew that i had to try the tacos there. 

So I pull up and this place is located in a pretty ugly strip mall, but my craving for tacos had me dash for the door. The place is pretty small and clean. So i ordered an "Al Pastor" burrito and 2 tongue tacos. The food was mediocre at best. The tongue was hard and too rubbery, i was really unimpressed. I personally will never walk back into this joint.
