I had the bean and cheese burrito. It was not flavorful and was rather salty - and I slat and pepper almost everything. The queso side for the chips was also salty, a little sweet, and overall underwhelming. The tortillas are fresh made and probably the best pare of the meal. 

 service was quick and the dining are serviceable if not super comfortable. Family friendly and fairly busy so people seem to like this place. I wouldn't make it a regular spot. Chipotle is superior in my opinion.
