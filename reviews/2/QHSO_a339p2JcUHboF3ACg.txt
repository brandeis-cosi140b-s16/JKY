I really wanted to like this place. A friend did their promo video and recommended it to me. 

Price was okay for quantity but quality was seriously lacking. I got "everyone's favorite" green chile beef burrito. Flavor was okay but the beef/chile was like pure aide gravy inside a tortilla. You couldn't even identify what was inside. Not good a start.

I can understand and appreciate creativity but if you're going to mashup two culinary concepts (BBQ & Mexican) into one it needs to be exceptional, not mediocre. 

I don't know if it's a Mormon cultural thing due to too much jello and casseroles, but poor choice in local cuisine is not uncommon in Mesa. And based on the high reviews here, most of the reviews have to be coming from the same people that have had their palates desensitized by Pete's and El Charro their entire lives.
