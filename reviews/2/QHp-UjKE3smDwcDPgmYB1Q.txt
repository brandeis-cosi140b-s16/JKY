We went today to La Reyna Mexican Rest and We weren't impressed.  We were expecting something better.  I had a Chile relleno combination and the rice was overcook and the beans just didn't taste good.  My husband had a Molcajete and it was not bad.  One thing i didn't like is that we got there we ordered a Jamaica drink and we were told that it wasn'r ready so the waitress told us to try the lemonade that it was fresh made, so we ordered 2 and when she came back it wasn't lemonade, was a margarita mix very very sweet and we were charged $7.00 for it.  Defenitelly we wont go back.
