This is a standard looking hole-in-the-wall Mexican food restaurant just like a gazillion others in Phx.  Unfortunately this one is pretty lame.  

I got two enchiladas, one chicken and one beef.  Neither meat is anything I'd recommend or buy again.    The dark brown sauce scared me and didn't taste much better than it looked.  Some sort of beef sauce I think.  It wasn't awful but it was nothing I want again. My copilot on this adventure said her chicken tacos were not so good either, and when we got back to the office she noted that we won't be trying that place again.

The place was super quiet for a Friday at 12:30pm. Punch machines were off, a 4yr old was scootering around behind the counter, and I think there were only two people working.  I wonder if they'll be in business next week.
