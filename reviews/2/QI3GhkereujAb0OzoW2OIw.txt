This is a  pretty standard Mexican food with pretty standard service. It is located inside of Sunset Station in Henderson. They have an outside and inside bar attached to the restaurant. We dined here on Cinco de Mayo and it was one of the few spots that was not packed. The food was marginal and something you'd be able to find at any Mexican restaurant in town. My carne asada platter was lacking flavor coupled with chewy, low grade quality meat. I was only able to finish a small portion of my meal. We had their cornoitas which were margaritas with a mini bottle of corona draining into it. The margarita mix was sweet and the drink as a whole a complete bust. The prices are in the $15-20 pp range and most definitely not worth it. I don't think anything can compel me to come back.  

It is a shame that proprietors of Mexican restaurants appear to think that their clientele are either stupid or lazy enough to accept substandard food.  I get that there is not much more upward mobility or fine Mexican dining out there, but the restaurant community can do way better.
