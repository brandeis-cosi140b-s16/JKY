I know Rubios has a gluten free menu, so I asked the cashier for it.  He said they don't have one.  As he was talking, the manager type person came over and told me that they cannot guarantee me anything is gluten free because of cross contamination.  I told him I knew about that and told him I know the tacos are gluten free but need to know about sides.  Then he told me again about cross contamination but the tacos are gluten free.  I repeat that I just want to know about sides and he finally tells me that all the sides are fine.  I seem to remember that not all the sides are on their GF menu but I went ahead and ordered.  

Restaurants need to have their GF menus on their websites.  They need to have them in all their stores (the one at desert ridge had a gluten free menu).  Also, I do not need to be lectured twice about cross contamination.  If I am gluten free, I already know I am taking that risk at ANY restaurant. 

This was a frustrating experience.  I will not be going to Rubios again until they have a GF menu online.
