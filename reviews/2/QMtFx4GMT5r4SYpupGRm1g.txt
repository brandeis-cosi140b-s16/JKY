We have always like this location. It has always had pretty good food. But, we came here last night for dinner. I was very disappointed.
I understand that the staff is short , they are looking to hire. AS always the Busers are great. Water, chips , salsa, etc. Brought us to go boxes.
But, our service was not good at all. The food was dry as if it had been in the oven and left for a while.
The server walked by our table 3 times and still he did not pick up the check. We had to go to the counter where the host said the server had to ring it up.
The bean dip and salsa are amazing. But, now for the food and service. I say we probably will not be back.
