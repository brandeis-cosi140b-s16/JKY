Service was not the issue. Carlos was great and service was over my expectations. However, the A/C has been down for over four days now since I last stopped in. How can I continue to enjoy my experience while I wait in your lobby in misery? Even other guests were like wow...it's hotter than outside! It's 102*f right now! Please fix so no one else has to suffer. Thanks again Carlos for apologizing though.
