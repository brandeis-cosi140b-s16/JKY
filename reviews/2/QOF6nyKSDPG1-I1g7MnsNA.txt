Where to start, this was my first time here and my experience was obviously not the best. We sat inside for two minutes but I'm assuming the AC was broken or they chose to not have it on. In AZ this is a necessity. We asked to sit outside because the atmosphere was nice and the misters were on. The waitress moved us with no issue. The misters soaked our table to the point where we needed our table wiped down.. Which the waitress wiped it with a wet rag? Anyways, the chips and salsa were awful but the rest food was decent just not worth the price. We switched out a plate because the menu didn't specify and wasn't what we were expected, that went okay. At the end half of the party was leaving and when they gave the waitress gift cards which covered most of the tab and then cash to cover the rest, for some reason she took the full amount of cash and ran the gift cards for the rest. So what's the point of the gift cards if we pay with cash?! No, obviously no common sense! We wanted to use the gift cards then the rest in cash, anyone would know this. The service was slow and then when she couldn't figure out how to cash us out, that was the last straw. Never coming back.
