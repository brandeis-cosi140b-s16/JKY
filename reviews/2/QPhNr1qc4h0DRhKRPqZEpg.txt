I was the only one in line, didn't see anyone in the dining area. Super slow drive thru. I think their burritos cost more than the other filiberto that's on Elliot/McQueen. I asked for guacamole in my burrito, didn't get it, but was charged. Burritos are also smaller than the Filibertos that I just mentioned. Saving grace-it taste decent. 

I'm sticking to the Elliot and McQueen location. Food taste like it's better quality and faster service.
