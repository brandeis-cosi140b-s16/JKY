It's a nice place to socialize with friends, drink, and dance. Like most bars, drinks can be a little pricy but if you don't want to spend money on alcohol then stay home! 

The food is a weak attempt at Mexican cuisine. The only thing I like eating there are the tacos on Tuesday. 

Like many others I think the dress code is ridiculous. Why are guys not allowed to have stickers on their hats? Seems a little silly to me! 

The staff is horrible. I almost always see the female servers flirting with the tables that have only men but neglect to check on my table when it's me and my boyfriend. The male servers are no better. One guy even said he would rate my friend and I as 'sevens'. I'm sorry but I don't go out to a bar for the staff to degrade me as a human being. I have no idea who he was or why that comment was even made. But after that I have not enjoyed going there as much. 

The only thing I really enjoyed about this place is they sent out coupons for free beer. I loved using the coupon since no purchase was required.
