Perhaps our mistake was going on a Sat.night in the summer .Who knew it would be packed to the gills with thirsty college students. 
Loud is an understatement. We were crammed into a little table the four of us elbow to elbow with the diners seated on both sides. 
This already has put me in a bad mood.I never did well in Europe sharing my table with stranger and in the U.S it irks me even more 
It took forever to get our drinks of simply water and soda. 
We at last caught our waitresses eye and was told should would take care of us she guessed.....? What the heck she was the same waitress who took the drink order and was delivering the food next to us. 
When Ms.Wiffty finally brought our long awaited food it is totally the wrong order.We even considered asking if we could just keep it because we had waited so long, but no off she went to leave us for another 20 minutes. 
What we got at long last was so disappointing. 
It tasted no better than Taco Bell anywhere in America.Think nacho grande with a side of Guacamole. First and last visit.We did notice on the bill she gave us the wrong check .It was for half the amount of food we ordered and was probably some poor guys check.We waved her over .Her reply was just leave the money on the table I'll come by and get it later................ 
So we did.
