The good, the mild salsa mixed with the jalape√±o salsa was tasty.  I also enjoyed the green corn tamale.  The bad, everything else.  I ordered the number 1 combo.  1chicken taco, 1cheese enchilada, & 1 bean tostada.    The chicken in the taco was fried to crispy bits of jerky and actually cracked when I attempted to chew it. The cheese enchilada had way too much cheese. I never thought I would say that.  I requested red sauce but was served green.  The rice had no flavor or seasoning other than black pepper.  Since the beans had no flavor, I didn't even try the tostada.  I may stop back for a tamale if I happen to be in the area, but even that isn't likely.   The young man I expressed my displeasure with as I threw out all of the food stated had he known he would have tried to correct it.  While I appreciate the gesture, if any one had come by our table at least once, we may have provided the opportunity.
