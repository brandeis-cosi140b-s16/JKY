Food is consistent and great with other locations but the speed is horrible. No sense of urgency and very slow. I came here two days in a row and waited at least 20 minutes. The line was just barley moving. I guess I am used to the ones by my work that get you in a out. Seems like someone needs to be in control of the staff and get them energized. I would choose somewhere else if you are  in a hurry but if you are craving Chipotle, be prepared to wait.
