I've been to this place many times with co-workers since my office is just close by. I finally understand this place. While the food was pretty decent, the service is so slow that it's angering. Sometimes, when I'm fed up at work I get the urge to come here and order something and wait 50 minutes for it so that I can appreciate retreating back to cubicle hell. 

On every occasions I've had to wait on my order for average 30-45 minutes. I eat for a few minutes before rushing back to work with them just fed up. On one and only one occasion have I had an explanation from the wait staff but the place only had a few tables with patrons so I didn't understand why it was so slow. 

Since then, I've stopped eating here and reverted back to eating and the other nearby Mexican restaurants that have my food out in a few minutes but sadly not as good as this place. The food is good but it's not good enough to have me tapping the table for my whole lunch period.
