We visited this establishment on a one day stay in Phoenix based on previous Yelp reviews.  The food was pretty good but the service was very slow and unfriendly.  Upon arriving, our party of 5 was tightly squeezed between 2 other parties.  The tables should have been spread out more but we managed to fit with the backs of our chairs pressed tight against the guests behind us.  Right away we presented our server with the Yelp check in for the free cheese crisp which never came.  The server never checked back with us after bringing our food and we ran out of water, never seeing our server until she came to collect the tab.  Good food, poor service earns only 2 stars.
