Second time here since we moved from St.Louis, MO 8 months ago. It was OK both times. Upon entering the restaurant today for lunch, the Health Department score was 93.I wanted to turn around and walk out, to me, that speaks volumes about a place that I actually want to eat at. However, my hubby and son wanted to give it a try. The tortilla chips were horrible to me. They gave an oily after taste where I could not even taste the tortilla chip at all. The salsa was good and the 2 shredded beef chimichangas were OK. The environment could have been cleaned much better than it appeared, hazy mirrors, floor needed to be swept. It was very hard to understand our waiter,although I think he was pleasant!

At this point after seeing the 93 score, I think I'd like to try another place that has higher scores. I admit I am a clean freak when it comes to someone preparing my food. As a former Missourian, we did not have number scores to restaurants, only letter scores. Grade A, you would think that was great...until you really see how they come up with that grade after all the mishaps are subtracted from 100. There is a 10 point difference between Grade A & Grade B. I will be looking up this place's score to see how they did on their 93 score inspection.

I love what North Carolina does by posting their scores as you enter the establishment. My new home state, suits me well with their Health Department scores and how they publish it and all the things that were found wrong on inspection day.
