Went there for lunch today. This is my second time visiting and the second time my order was messed up. I had ordered a chicken ceaser salad burrito. It was my mistake I guess, from what I remember a ceaser salad doesn't have tomatoes in it. Well it does here. I don't like tomatoes. Love ketchup but not regular tomatoes soggin up my meal. I had them make another burrito. The menu clearly states what's in a ceaser salad, and tomato is not one of the ingredients. The replacement burrito tastes slightly better than the first but not by much. Maybe they had a surplus of tomatoes and were trying to get rid of em I don't know. Should've went to Costa Vida but as we all know they are almost always crowded. Ugh F me and my burrito cravings.
