Quick edit: thanks to manager Dave for looking to right this wrong with an apology and offer to chat about ways to improve the experience next time. I haven't returned but the attention to fixing is appreciated. 

Yelp steered me wrong this time. This place was pretty mediocre. The atmosphere was great but the food was disappointing given then reviews and price. 

First, the chips are actually tortillas which a thick dash of what tastes like paprika. Not great and salsa was thin and just boring.

I got the "el Jefe" filet and shrimp taco and was really disappointed. The meat was very chewy and just thrown on with two small shrimp. A real letdown, especially given the price. My other item was the fish taco gobernador. I asked for items with no dairy and while the cheese was removed, the taco had a slew of Creme sauce on it hidden by lots of lettuce and a little piece of fish.

Finally, my waiter was barely around. We didn't get silverware until someone got up to ask after asking when our meals were delivered and we had to find someone again to ask for the check once we were finished.

Needless to say, despite just one visit and taste testing a few items, I won't be back.
