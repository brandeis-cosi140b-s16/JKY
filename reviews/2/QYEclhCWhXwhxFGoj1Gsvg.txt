Mediocre food, and overpriced for what it is ($10 taco salad was a joke)...  Admittedly I was debating between a 3-star and a 2-star, since we had pretty decent service.  Would I go back?  Perhaps, for appies, and without the kids...and if we're hungry and nearby.

I normally have more to say, but this place totally didn't wow me, even with a $5 off coupon.
