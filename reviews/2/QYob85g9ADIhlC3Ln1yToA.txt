I totally agree with Kristin C. on this one!!

The food is expensive compared to other Taquerias in the city and there's nothing that stands out about it! It isn't great or even very fresh. One thing that REALLY irritated me was that it takes FOREVER to get your order to go! Nearly half an hour. And good luck if you choose to dine in! 

It's a small family owned business, but they really need to change their prices. I'd go back, but I'd call ahead first! IF their prices were lower. I live so close! But Taco Bell is RIGHT there and they may not be as good, but dangit! They're cheaper and faster!
