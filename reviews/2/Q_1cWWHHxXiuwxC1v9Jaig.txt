Came here for lunch with some colleagues and we were sat immediately.  We all just wanted water, which seemed to annoy the server.  Dude, it's Thursday. And we all work.  Stop pushing.

Anyway - he fills the mason jars on the table with water and asks if we need anything.  Looking at the mason jars, we all ask for straws.  They were cloudy, kind of dirty.  Honestly? Of course I want a straw - have you looked at these things?

I ordered the shrimp salad, which came with jicama, mango and mandarin oranges.  It came with three shrimp sitting on top.  Visually it was pretty.  However, overall I feel like there was too much spice for the sake of spice.  And at the price? I should have gotten more than 3 pieces of shrimp.  It was $12!!  

Overall, I probably won't be back.  I'm glad I experienced it, but nothing about my experience will make me walk back in the door.
