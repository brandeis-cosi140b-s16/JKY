Convenient location inside the hotel. Traditional style American mexican. I had the chili rellenos, they were flavorful but a bit soggy. My husband had the beef enchiladas and they were standard fare. The first perfecto margarita was delish but the second one was off and sent it back and they fixed it. Our waitress was not attentive but another waiter was right on top of things. 
I would only come back here for happy hour
