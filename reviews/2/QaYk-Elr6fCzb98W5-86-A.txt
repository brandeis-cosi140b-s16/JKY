The food was gringo interpretation of Mexican food. Which meant the sauce was not spicy but bland with a side of mild. I swear the rice was from Uncle Ben's it was so bad. My chicken tortilla soup was tasty. Typical suburban crowd of tired moms, bitter dads and unruly children screaming everywhere. Our waiter was efficient but odd. The chips and salsa were good but its hard to mess that up.  If we were not meeting friends here I would have chosen a better chain restaurant or better yet a local one. Hell the food from the local food carts downtown is better. Boring is the word that sums it up. Boring.
