To bad Jennifer isn't going to be working on Saturdays anymore, they really need to do some training with this help, sat here for 30 minutes, waiters came over twice to take our order, both times asked for menus, he never brought it over. We had to ask another waiter. This is extremely unusual for this restaurant. We will start coming here only when Jennifer or Sergio are bartending.
