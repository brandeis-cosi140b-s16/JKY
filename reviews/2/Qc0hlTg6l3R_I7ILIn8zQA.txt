I have always wanted to go to Cabo Fish Taco.  I am a Foodie and good food is what i love.  That being said the food was nothing to write home about.  I had the "world famous" fried whitefish taco.  There was NO flavor- not in the batter not on the fish and to top it off there was sliminess that was just gross.  The crab and shrimp dip was good- but you can barely taste the crab or the shrimp.  The margaritas were Very good.  I also sampled quesedillas and they were tasty-but nothing mind blowing.  Hanging this up as-- been there done that.
