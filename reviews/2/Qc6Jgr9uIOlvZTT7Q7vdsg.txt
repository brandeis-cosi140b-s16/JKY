I was a longtime fan of the Rokerjj but, it has gone downhill. The service has declined and the food has declined. My guest steak was very undercooked then taken back and chopped up and recooked. No one wants a filet this way. My duck was tough and fatty. The wedge came out with NO salad dressing. The waitress insisted that it had dressing. The tastebuds do not lie!! No offer for coffee and desert.
I was so sad after bringing our guests to dinner because I raved about the Rokerjj before dinner. What a shock!
