Think overpriced (I know that's Vegas in general) chain restaurant.  I have been to the original in Mexico and the relation is apples and oranges. Food was not great and the atmosphere was nothing special. The waitress forgot part of food order and if it wasn't for the location and outside sitting area I would have given it 1 star. 

It's basically Mexican TGI Fridays. There are plenty of other non-chain Mexican restaurants on the strip if you have a craving for Mexican . 

Don't get fooled into thinking this is going to be anything like the original Cabo Wabo.
