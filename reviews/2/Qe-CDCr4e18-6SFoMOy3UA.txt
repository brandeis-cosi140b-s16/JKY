You know...when this place first opened, it wasn't bad.  In the year or so since then...just not good.  Especially the service.  This is a family run place, which I am all for.  To me, there needs to be a level of service though that goes beyond the friendly face and the whole 'Oh goodness....I can't believe I forgot that' routine.  That happens All The Time here.  The food is average, at best.  They do have some good drink specials for happy hour, but it's not worth going back for when in the west valley.  Sad to see a nice little place regress so much.
