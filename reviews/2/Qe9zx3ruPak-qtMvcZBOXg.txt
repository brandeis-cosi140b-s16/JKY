-An acceptable chain restaurant to take "out-of-town" visitors for (overpriced) sit down Mexican food with tacky decor.

-Expensive! Almost $11 bucks for a carne asada burrito???? Really?? For that price, I could had bought like 2 or 3 burritos at any "...Berto's" type place in the Valley!

-Refried beans are bland and thick like drywall putty.

-$1.98 for a small side of guac OR sour cream with your meal.

-Salsa not as good as it used to be...tastes like chunky watered down tomato soup with added preservatives (mostly ala sodium benzoate) . You'll be consuming a tin of altoids afterwards from "salsa breath".

-Loud background music. I shouldn't have to talk super loud over the blaring music, was I in a nightclub or restaurant?

-Service was ok. Servers seem to scowl when you request MORE chips & salsa.

-Parking is plentiful.

-Separate entrance in the back for take-out.
