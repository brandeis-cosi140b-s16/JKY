I've been here a couple times before and like the environment. There's a downstairs bar as well as upstairs that is completely open so you can see the sky, hanging lights, live music some nights and a nice view of the strip. 

When I went last night after checking in I got a "buy 1 get 1 free drink" offer. Tried to claim it at the bar upstairs, was sent 4 different places before a bartender finally told me the correct place to go, which was the hostess booth downstairs. I go back upstairs where we were sitting, waited at the bar for 20 minutes. The bartender was busy with everybody else but never acknowledged me so I gave up and we left 5 minutes later.
