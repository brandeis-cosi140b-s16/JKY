Oh Vince.  What have you done?  It's all true, those other reviews.  I came here looking for killer Mexican and was sorely disappointed.  The hostess told me they had full menu at the bar- guess what?  Nope.  Then was reseated to the dining area and ate there.  Chips and salsa, meh.  Tortilla soup, meh.  Ceviche, meh.  I want to love it, really I do!  I love Vjnce Neil!  Buuuuuut, no dice.  Can't love mediocrity.  Will go eat somewhere else and just listen to Motley Cr√ºe via headphones.
