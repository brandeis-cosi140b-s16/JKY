Went here for the first time, because of the high rating.

I decided to compare the California burrito to Senor Taco's version.

The burrito Pancho serves is smaller, but slightly better.  I wasn't very impressed with the carne asada or how they made the burrito.  Maybe burritos are not considered authentic Mexican food?  I don't know.

I'll probably order something different next time.

The horchata I received was also smaller than what Senor Taco offers.  I love horchata and always want A LOT OF IT!

Overall, a decent place.  It is run by nice people who appear to be genuinely concerned about your experience,
