The chips were very watery. I ordered the guacamole made at my table. They brought it out in a salad bowl, not very classy of mexicanish! The server was courteous which is always a must for me. As I'm writing I'm tasting the guacamole. Very bland! I had to add the weak "hot sauce" they have to it for some semblance of flavor. The shrimp tacos are mediocre at best. I was going to give this place 3 stars but after eating the shrimp tacos I went down one more star.
