Felipito's on Decatur?! I wonder if it's the same as the one on Tropicana?

Naaaaaaahhh! Not even close, they should really change the name.  I ordered a grilled chicken burrito from here expecting chicken, lettuce, sour cream, and cheese.  Instead, I got rice, cheese, and like 2 table spoons of chicken that tasted old and had plenty of ligaments I had to spit out.  Good thing a ordered one of their mini Carne asada tacos which came with beans and chips on the side.

The inside is dirty and the tables were filthy.  The workers seemed like they didn't wanna be there and had a face on them like someone just stole their sombrero.  I might give this place another try, but only if I'm in the area.  Definitely wouldn't go out my way to eat here.  The Tropicana location is better in every way.
