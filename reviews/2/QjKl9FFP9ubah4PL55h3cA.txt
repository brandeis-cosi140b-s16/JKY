Food and drinks are fine.  Service is lacking. We waited way beyond normal to be greeted at all. Had trouble getting our order in. Used the bar to get drinks.  Had to bus our own table.  It's an ok place for ambiance.  The owners deserve credit for what they offer aside from the service offered.  Owners, take some care in getting more attentive help.
