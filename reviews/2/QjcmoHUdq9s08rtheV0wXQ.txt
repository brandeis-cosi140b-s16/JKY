I took my daughter here for lunch before our movie, for her 10th bday last Saturday at about 2-3pm. (her choice) The food was good, no complaints there but the girl working the front needs a real attitude adjustment. My daughter and I walked in, the worker was sweeping by the front door. She didn't greet us or say a word. We walked to the cash register to order and she just kept sweeping for a good 5 minutes. She didn't make her way to the register until I just kept looking at her. Still not a word from her. She walked to the register... Just stares at me and still says nothing... So I just start telling her my order. She tells me my total, And still says nothing else even after I paid. I say "thank you" to her when she handed me my cup and still NOT A WORD from her. WOWWWWW. 

My 10 year old and I go to sit outside to wait for our food. The same girl brings our food outside... And literally tosses my food down on the table, and guess what doesn't say a word! She was EXTREMELY rude! I have been coming to this rubios off and on for 6 years and have never been treated like that. Me being there was such an inconvenience  to her. Hey "gizzy" treat your customers a little better, or find a new line of work. Seriously...I don't care how good your food is, I won't be returning after that.
