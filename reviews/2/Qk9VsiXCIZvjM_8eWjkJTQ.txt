Took advantage of Groupon offer and was really hoping past experiences would not be repeated in regards to service.  Food as usual was just okay but service continues to be horrible.  Upon being seated, our waiter took care of patrons that came AFTER us...okay possibly an honest mistake.  But then our waiter NEVER checked back with us until the very end of our meal...inexcusable!!!
