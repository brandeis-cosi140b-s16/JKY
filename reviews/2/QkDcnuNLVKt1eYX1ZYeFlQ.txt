Sadly Mercadito does not live up to its hype as having the best fish taco. What was NY Magazine thinking? But then again that was 2006 somewhere else. Was excited to check out the restaurant when it opened at Red Rock Resort and, of course, had to taste these famous fish tacos. Unfortunately, they arrived dry and over-cooked. It takes a lot for me to send dishes back to the kitchen, but on this occasion there was no choice. The waitress was super polite and upon looking at the dish even admitted it wasn't up to par. She returned several minutes later with a much more desirable plate of mahi mahi tacos. Our other dishes were quite good and service was on point. Hopefully it was just a fluke but "best taco" goes too far.
