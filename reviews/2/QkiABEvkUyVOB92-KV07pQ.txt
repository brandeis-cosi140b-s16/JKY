I ordered a carne asada burrito and 5 taquitos.  I was expecting quite a bit based on the price I paid.  Unfortunately the flavor of the food doesn't make up for the exorbitant prices.

The taquitos were sinewy and difficult to cut with my teeth andguacamole was not included.  They were topped with lettuce, sour cream, and cheese.

The burrito was of average size and had more beans and rice than meat.
