I am usually a big Chipotle fan, but I am not sure what they were going for at this location.   It was freezing with cold blasts of air conditioning beating down on us, the music coming from the speaker box around the drink station was so loud you could not even hear the person at your own table, and the chairs were uncomfortable (no booths here).  As for the food, they were out of brown rice and fajita veggies; and the chips were stale and lacked the usual salty lime bite I love.  The staff was nice but seemed a little confused.  All in all, I will still hit up Chipotle regularly, but I doubt I will return to this location.
