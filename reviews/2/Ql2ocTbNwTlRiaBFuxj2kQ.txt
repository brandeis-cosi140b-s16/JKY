I went to Arriba last night with my wife and another couple.  I have been to this location a handful of times and always had the same result.  The food was okay but the main problem here is the super slow service. 

It took us nearly two hours to eat dinner here.  It took forever to get our chips and salsa.  It took us nearly as long to get our drinks.  Forget about refills.    When our food finally arrived we asked for an additional plate but never got it.  I asked for a water when our food came out and got it after I was 3/4 done with my meal...and I do not eat fast.  Our waiter was friendly but hardly ever checked in with us.  When we asked for the check he said he would bring it in five minutes.  His five minute deadline was not met.

I don't think I will be eating here again.  I have given them too many chances.
