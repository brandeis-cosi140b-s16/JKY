If you're looking for authentic mexican - this is NOT the place for you.  If you are looking for a Tex Mex BBQ joint masking as a Fine Mexican restuarant this IS the place for you.  We tried the shredded beef tacos and shredded pork burro.  The tacos were good - not as good as Los Dos Molinos or Guedo's though.  The burro had so much BBQ sauce I could only eat about 1/3 before I gave up.  The rice was delicious and the refried beans were ok - a little too much BBQ sauce again.  The chips and salsa were good.  Drinks were a little expensive - $4.25 for Dos Equis.  Service was almost too effecient.  It seemed they wanted us out of there quickly - never asked if we wanted another drink and kept coming back to clear plates.  Very nice service staff, simple atmosphere, nice patio,  prices a little too high.  Not authentic enough for me to return.
