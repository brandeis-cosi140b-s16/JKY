I love to toss hearts and flowers when possible...tonight wasn't one of those moments.

We were frequent visitors when this restaurant was SuperMex...decent Mexican food back then at a very reasonable price.  And, silly us, we liked placing those whole crispy tortillas on a napkin and "fisting" it to make small pieces...that was kinda' fun.  The food also seemed more flavor.

The interior has been slightly updated and presented nicely.  We arrived before 6pm on a Thursday and it was perhaps 20% full.  We were seated across from a booth which held a large noisy family group (younger kids).  We asked to be moved to a booth far away and were accommodated...only to find the older kids that couldn't fit in the family booth were near us and didn't understand you shouldn't yell to the other table.  We almost left - a relaxing dinner was not to be.

We then inquired about Happy Hour as a cold beer would have been most welcome.  We were informed that Happy Hour was only in the bar section and that the entire menu was also available in the bar.  We asked if the bar permitted smoking and learned yes, it's a smoking bar.  If I recall, Nevada law does not permit served food and smoking in the same room.  We had no desire to smell like a cigarette once home and really would have liked to have been permitted to partake in Happy Hour without being subjected to smoke.  We would have spent just as much, or more, in the restaurant section than the bar section as to us, it's a preferred environment.  This didn't set well with us as we feel an accommodation could have been made knowing we do not want to be with smokers while having our meal.  We ordered a minimal meal, tolerated the very noisy family and left.

I will add that our server was outstanding and that another large family seated at a center table in the room was a delight.  As we had small combinations, I can't attest to the food as it was just average in presentation and flavor.  The fresh salsa was delicious.
