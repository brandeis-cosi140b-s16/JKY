So I went here on Saturday May 19th.  I'd heard a lot about this place, seen it on the Internet, etc., and wanted to try it out for myself.  The place was small inside and a bit overrated.  The drink list they showed us was WAY overpriced.  Drinks starting at $10 each and going onwards of $12, $20, etc (good thing we had popped open beers we had brought ourselves before entering the restaurant).  I thought the menu would be strictly Mexican food, but it was a mixture of Mexican, Tex-Mex, and American.  Everything on the menu was about $12 and up for a plate.  The food was decent, but unlike other Mexican restaurants where they provide free chips and salsa, they charge you $4.99.  Here's the kicker.  When I got my bill, I realized the tax was $11 (my total bill was approximately $76).  When I alerted the waitress of this, she checked with the manager to find out why the tax was so high and he said that there is a 10% "Entertainment" tax.  WHAT?!  Entertainment tax?  I've never encountered such a thing.  There was absolutely no entertainment of any sort going on, unless you consider a MC chick trying to get the crowd all pumped up entertainment.  Due to this ridiculous entertainment tax and high prices, I don't think I'll be going here again.  Please check your receipts to see if you got charged this "Entertainment tax" too.  Totally outrageous.
