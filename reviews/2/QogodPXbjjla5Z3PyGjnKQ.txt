Really, I should know better...

It was late at night, we didn't feel like fast food burger places, and I have driven past this place millions of times. 

It's in a dark scary lot too close for comfort to Greenway square. Probably not the best place for a woman to go by herself late at night, but luckily I had the husband with me.

After looking at the extensive menu, I ordered the chili relleno plate and my husband ordered a chicken burrito, beef taco, and a horchata. 

I couldn't finish my chili relleno plate. (Quick lesson in Mexican cooking- when preparing anything with chilis, its a good idea to remove the majority of the seeds. Not just because of the heat, but because its NOT fun to have a mouthful of seeds.) Besides the hundreds of chewy seeds in my mouth, the chili rellenos were lukewarm. The whole plate was pretty bland, and with every bite I took I knew my stomach would be paying for it later. So I only ate half, then popped 3 tums and hoped for the best. I ended not having serious food poisoning, but I definitely felt uncomfortable all night.

On the other hand, my husband didn't think his food was too bad. His chicken burrito did  have a couple bones in it. He liked the beef taco. 

I might come back for a breakfast burrito. After all, it is hard to screw up an egg and potato burrito. It seems like this food would taste much better while drunk or hungover.
