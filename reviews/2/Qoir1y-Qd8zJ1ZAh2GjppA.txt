I think this restaurant is overpriced.  I recommend ordering from the ala carte menu.  The chips are good (and thin; I like thin chips).  The guacamole was bad.  I think sour cream is used as a "filler."  However, the meal that I ordered (a simple taco with beans/rice) was good.  Nothing stands out as far as I am concerned though.....
