First time here. Don't really have a problem with the food, it is just very average. The service was a little on the slow side, especially for such a SLOW night. There were literally only three tables inside with customers. The bar was a little busy, and therein lies the problem. This must be one of the last great frontiers for smokers. Although it is legal to smoke on an outside patio technically, what is not OK is to let the smoke and nasty smell waft in through the open doors constantly, ruining your quiet enjoyment of your meal. We will NOT be back.
