Food is good. Don't come when it's busy or on the weekend, the service tends to be horrible. Especially in the bar

We definitely come for the food, not the service. You can get similar food at Chili's, with much better service.

To be fair, the staff are typically always nice and apologetic about the delays, but it always seems a little understaffed.
