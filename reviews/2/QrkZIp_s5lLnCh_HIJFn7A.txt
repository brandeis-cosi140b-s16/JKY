One of the stingiest Chipotle I have ever been to!!! Our group of 4 arrived in Vegas and were in a rush to grab dinner. We stopped by Chipotle and we were jipped! I got a bowl with brown rice, fajita veggies, chicken, mild & medium salsa, corn and lots of lettuce. The first girl doing the tortilla/rice/veggies was STINGY AS F. She spread out the rice so much while only giving you a little to begin with and she gave me about 5 .. literally thats FIVE pieces folks, of the fajita veggie mix. Really? I didn't even want to bother. The party behind us saw our orders and mentioned to the workers they would pay for extra meat and etc after seeing the amounts they gave us!

Luckily the lettuce girl and cashier were nice so they get +1 star. Ugh.
