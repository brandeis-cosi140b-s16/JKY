I feel like there's always this argument within my circle of friends about who makes the best burritos: Qdoba or Chipotle? To be honest, I've never had Qdoba before this point. Always a Chipotle fan so never found the reason to try the "other" burrito place. 

To judge for myself, I went to Qdoba and ordered their burrito with the exact fillings I would've ordered at Chipotle. Here's what I have to say about Qdoba. First off, their burrito is equally as fat as Chipotle's. Qdoba's chicken was a bit dry and the seasoning not as flavorful. The beans too soggy, making the whole burrito extremely soggy. The salsa was not crisp, but mushy. Overall, I thought the burrito was kind of bland due to the lacking of seasoning in the chicken. 

The final verdict: I did not finish my buritto. Qdoba disappointed me and I will be back at Chipotle tomorrow.
