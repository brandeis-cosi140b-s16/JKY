Breakfast is a huge disappointment. Although it has been offered off and on in other cities over the last 10 years, this latest offering, is the most over-priced CRAP to date.
What is being called a Breakfast Burrito is not even the size of an egg roll and being priced as if it were a Burrito Supreme.
