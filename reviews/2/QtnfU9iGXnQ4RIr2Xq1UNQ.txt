I had been to this restaurant years ago (in NY) but since it was christmas eve our choices were limited so we figured we would try it out. Overall it was ok, our service was great and food was fine, all except the mushroom and spinach enchilada. It was filed with corn with 2 mushrooms and maybe 3 pieces of spinach that were miniscule. It was very disappointing. The beef tacos that i ordered with the combo were fine. My advice is just to be prepared to maybe be a bit let down on what you order.  The salsa was a tad bland as well. Nothing horrible overall but food wise nothing really stood out, the service though was enjoyable.
