This is my second visit to Zapatas, the first time i went the food and the service were excellent. So i decided to take my husband so he can try it, he had heard bad reviews but i assured him it was very good. 
We arrived and the hostess is very busy texting,once I greet her than she puts her phone down and takes us to a table. We waiting 10 min before the server came to greet us,  she took our drink order and went missing for another 10-15min. We got our drinks, my husband didnt like it so he asked her to take her back and bring water instead, she neever came back with the water, the food arrived, it was good but not great as the first visit. Then our server went MIA again. Definitely service was really bad I will not go back based on the service i received today, they treated us as if we were invisible.
