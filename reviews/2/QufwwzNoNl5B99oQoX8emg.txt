The food here is fair and the service was very poor.  The waiter took our appetizer order and we didn't see him again for another 30 minutes.  What should of been quick lunch turned into a 1 1/2 hour meal. The guacamole is not very good, it doesn't seem made to order and that's a shame.  I'm sure that the food and service is much better than what we experienced.
