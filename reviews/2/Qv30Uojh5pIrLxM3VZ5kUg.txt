we went sunday at around 1pm, party of seven. It wasn't to busy, they had only one server at the time they took our order, the food was good, but they really need help on service, no prebussing, no refills we had to raise our hand every time we need it something. they add 20% service charge to the check ( we knew that) maybe thats why they didn't care about our table, they knew they were getting a tip any way. we mentioned it to the server at the end, thats when she told us that the other server had left, cause it wasn't too busy. She  said i'm sorry and offer  to give us a free dessert or another beer.
