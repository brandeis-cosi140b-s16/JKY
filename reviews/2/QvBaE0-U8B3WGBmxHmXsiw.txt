Just like the 2 stars say, "Meh, I've experienced better".  I recently tried this place due to a Groupon and a recommendation from a coworker.  Loco Lime is Tex-Mex at it's best and to me is a second rate On the Border (which I'm not really a fan of either).
   The queso was fair and the fish taco's weren't anything to write home about.  The location that I went to was the Huntersville one which lacked any type of decor.
   I wouldn't waste my time here again.
