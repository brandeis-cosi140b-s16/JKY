Not a fan. I had the Arizona Burrito, which was actually pretty bland. It came with some spicy fries and spicy ketchup, which was actually the best part of the meal.

Service was a bit slow. Took about 15 minutes to actually receive my beer and wasn't offered a second one til I was about done with my meal.
