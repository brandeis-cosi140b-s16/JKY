Service and staff were friendly and knowledgeble.... no wait....of course after experiencing the food it is easy to see why!
I would say Los Olivos is 1 very short step up from Arribas.
I started with a margarita $7.00 which was quite tasty...and I am still feeling the effects...lol...
Fish tacos were expensive $13.95 for 3, Boringgggggg and tasteless...*Yawn*
Gazpacho was again very boring and way too peppery.   
The salsas were just ok....  I think someone needs to learn about spices...
The tortilla chips were stale.
Did I mention the Margartia was good? lol
One of the people at our table tried the guacomole and enjoyed it but did not care for the chili rellano.  And I must admit I did enjoy the frijoles...good texture and tasty....once you doust it with hot sauce.
And so goes the search for some decent mexican food in North Scottsdale area that is affordable.
Would I go back to this restaurant.......Naaaaaaaaah!
But the Margarita was yummy.....or did I say that already? lol
If it is generic mexican you are looking for with a "not so cheap" price tag this might be an option for you.
Bon Appetite'
