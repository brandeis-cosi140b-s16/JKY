I been to this place for the past two years, almost go there once a week.  Great food and good portion.  I enjoy the food there very much.  Few week ago I visit this place again, the food still great but the quantity of food is a lot less.  I ordered the two meat combo plate with pork skin and green chili.  The food tastes good, but We only got 2 pieces of pork skin and 5 pieces of pork green chili...that looks like an half order or a kid meal?!  Today, I went back there for snacks, and noticed all the price goes up crazy, we just end up heading back home.  So bad, we like the food at this place so much, but I guess we can't afford to go there as often as before.
