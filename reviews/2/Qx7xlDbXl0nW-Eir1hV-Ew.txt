Booo.... What a freaking disappointment!  Bf and I have been so excited to try Los Dos Molino's, but were severely let down.   Starting with the salsa, it was hot and that was about it.  There was no flavor and no salt.  I ordered the cheese enchiladas with blue corn tortillas topped with red sauce.  What I got was two yellow corn tortillas stacked on top of each other smothered with red sauce with maybe 2 Tablespoons of cheese sprinkled on top.   The sauce had a weird flavor, almost burnt, I can't really describe it. The beans were runny and the rice was dry.   Bf didn't particularly enjoy his chicken burro enchilada style either. I think this place received a lot of hype a few years ago which is the only reason people keep going, because the food is definitely below average.  We will not be back.
