We are on the hunt for a new Mexican restaurant after the Laredo's down the street closed. After a visit to La Hacienda, we will keep looking. 

The salsa was bland - the margaritas tasted like they came from a premixed bucket - and the food was just flavorless. 

Next time we'll trek a little further south on Park and go to Taqueria Guadalajara.
