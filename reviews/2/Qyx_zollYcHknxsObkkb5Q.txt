This was our first visit to the restaurant.  My wife and I both ordered the 3 taco combo and one side dish.  My wife got rice for her side and I had the Mexican fries.  The tacos were very good and my wife fully agreed.  She liked her rice and I thought the fries were very good.  We left and I told her I would come back to eat here again for sure.  Then about 30 minutes later, we were both so exhausted we thought we were either drugged or they are using MSG in the food.  We are both sensitive to MSG and only feel like this after eating Chinese food lased with it.  I did not call the restaurant to verify weather or not they use MSG but can think of no other reason we both felt the exact same symptoms. I would highly recommend the tacos but for anyone who does not want MSG in their food, at least ask before ordering.  Just to be clear, I DID NOT verify if they do or do not use MSG.
