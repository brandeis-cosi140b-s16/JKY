Founded in 1993, Chipotle Mexican Grill has expanded from a 16-restaurant venture to a 1500+ adventure. While they don't necessarily offer the best or most authentic burrito experience, the fast-casual franchise features efforts in organic ingredients, a secret menu, an excited staff, great branding, and a customer base featuring all types of social groups--stoners to businessmen to even sorority girls admitting guilty pleasures.

And then there's Qdoba, abused for its free queso coupons and appreciated as a solid alternative when the lines are too long at its competitor. I felt like ordering my burrito was a chore for the person at the counter. I felt rushed through my order even though I was the only customer in line. No one smiled. The black beans were runny. Having queso and tortilla strips are a solid addition to the buffet of choices, but at the end of the day, something isn't being done right at this location...at least the Oakland spot has a bar upstairs.
