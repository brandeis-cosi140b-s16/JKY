You're joking right? 
Went here for Taco Tuesday and I have to say; Worst Taco Tuesday EVER!!! 
Don't be lured in by the $1.29 Tacos, go somewhere else. 
The Chips were very basic, and the salsa bored me. My 3 Tacos came out and I didn't quite know what I was looking at. 
Are they hard shell or soft shell? Why did they put lettuce and cheese on them? 
The Shells were OK, but the meat was a poor attempt. The Shredded Beef was mushy, no flavor. Chicken texture was ok, but no flavor. Ground Beef? What is this stuff? Mushy as hell, no flavor at all.....
