What a sad disappointment. 
We had high expectations for barrio queen, seeing they have all 4STAR reviews. 
We were greeted by a nice guy/waiter/possibly manager? I asked for options that were Gluten free and Dairy free. Barrio Queen, please educate yourself on this topic.
We sat at a bar booth for dinner, ordered table side guacamole for two. Let me just say this is my first experience EVER ordering $11 guacamole and it not being made at the table! Instead it came out in cubes with some pomegranate seeds sprinkled on top. There was no salt, no lime, no mashing, no nothing, but the sweet waitress "threw some salsa on the side, just cause". Wow..thanks, feeling "special"
After our guacamole we order some Pozole, which I will give them credit for, it was good.
We also ordered street tacos, 3 for $10, or 1 for $3.50. My fianc√© ordered the Huevo con Chorizo, Suadero Azteca,and the Nopalitios. The Nopalitis was good, but the rest were luke warm, no salt and pretty much an epic fail at trying to make a Mexican taco. Our waiter recommend I try the Salmon y Nopal taco and Huitlacoche y Champion taco. OH.MY.CRAP. The salmon taco smelled like the seafood market in Chinatown. I had one bite and passed it off to my old man, he can eat about anything and find some sort of appreciation for it, but not this sad salmon taco. Mushroom taco, was lacking even the flavor of the mushroom. How one achieves that is beyond me. 
The margaritas were decent, I recommend just having those and some "cubed" guacamole.
