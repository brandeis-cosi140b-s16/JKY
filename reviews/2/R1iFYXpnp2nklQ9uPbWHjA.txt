We went for a friend's birthday as this was what she was craving. There were two babies in the group, which is fine because this is seemingly a family restaurant. I needed to change my son, but they don't have a family restroom or a changing table in the bathroom. I thought that couldn't be right, but after asking an employee this was confirmed. I ended up having to take my son out to my car on a cold night to change him. None of the employees seemed to care.

After this wonderful start to the dinner, things didn't get much better. Our chips didn't get refilled, neither did our drinks. The food was OK, at best. Our server was friendly, but it wasn't enough to salvage the night. 

This place used to to be nice, but no more.
