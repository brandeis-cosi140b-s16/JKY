Happy hour is mediocre
Pork tacos are the best choice
Prices were okay
Beer selection was poor

Sat at the bar first and was never acknowledged, went to a table and Katie was our server. Not sure if she was busy or having an off day but she was less than desirable. Not attentive, rushed us and had no personality. 

We will never come back.
