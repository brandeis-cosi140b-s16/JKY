The food and service were very good.  However we have three kids so chose a Monday night because kids eat free. When our bill came the kids entrees were not taken off.  The waitress waited to see if we noticed and then when we complained she said her manager told her no because it was the 5th of May.  She offered to speak to him again and he again said no because it's cinco de mayo.  He never came to the table to offer an apology. There were no signs saying Kids Eat free wasn't valid on cinco de Mayo.  Bad customer service.  Sneaky manager.  Poor management that he didn't even come over
Won't eat there again based on principle.
