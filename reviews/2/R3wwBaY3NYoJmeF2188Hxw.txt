I don't know what has happened to this formerly tasty and satisfying restaurant, but things definitely seem to have fallen way below par in terms of taste, quality, and price. I ordered the cheese enchilada, shredded beef taco, and beans combination plate and was very disappointed to see that the beans were microwaved while the rest of the food lacked flavor. The staff is usually always nice at this location, but the food just isn't worth it anymore. Maybe it's different at different locations, but the only tasty food still left here are the chips and salsa.
