First, their system is way to slow. I went in for lunch yesterday and there was only one other person in front of me. He ordered three burritos and each time they would make a single tortilla and make the burrito, then go back to the start and make a second tortilla and the second burrito, back to the start and make the third tortilla and third burrito. Even the guy that was being helped was embarrassed by how long his order was taking to make. They should have made all three tortillas at the same time and made the burritos at the same time which would have been much faster.

Second, I must not be ordering the right thing as I went back yesterday to try it a second time since I did not enjoy the first time I went and again, wasn't impressed.

I had the sweet pork burrito the first time which was way to sweet. Yesterday I had the chicken burrito with red sauce and the red sauce was all I could taste. I love Chipotle and their burritos are much better than what I had here.

My wife and kids also remarked that Chipotle is much better.
