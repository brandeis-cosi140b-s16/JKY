I wonder if this place used to be a venue for weddings.... the awkward dance floor, now home to a buffet, tells me that it was.  The food was ok, but maybe over priced.  I'd be interested in trying the lunch buffet at some point in the future, but it might not be the best idea given the small vegetarian selection.  Final verdict: I feel a little bad for suggesting the place to my friends, but if they had suggested it I wouldn't hold it against them.
