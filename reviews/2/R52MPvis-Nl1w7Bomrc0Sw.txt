I first walked in and there was nobody there, I caught a glimpse of someone in the back. Since I wasn't sure what I wanted, I didn't mind waiting. I settled on carne asada tacos and 1 fish taco. When the girl finally appeared, she took my order and I handed her my credit card. As she swiped it, she started talking to the girl behind me. I signed my reciept, assumed that was it and walked away to wait.

Carne Asada Street Tacos: They were good, the tortillas were nice and hot. Plentiful of meat. But I've had better...from a food truck no less. The green salsa I found was good but not spicy.

Fish Street Taco: The fish was great in flavor, from the little piece that was given to me. I had to remove half the cabbage before taking a bite. It seemed they were making up for the lack of fish with cabbage.

The bar area was really nice, it looked almost like a club. Flat screen was playing golf.

Regardless, I wouldn't be returning here.
