Only reason this place doesn't get one star is that the server was great at what she did and was really friendly. Otherwise, the food was not good. Five of us ate there and all five of us had upset stomachs later that evening. If you're a classic rock fan, it may be worth it for a drink, but food is mediocre at best.
