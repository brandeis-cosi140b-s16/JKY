We've had way better, but what the hell could you possibly expect from a freakin' airport Mexican restaurant?! It gets ridiculously packed, so don't plan on bringing your family of 12. Most tables seat around 4, and the pre-flight, pre-gamers, pack it in. It's your typical Chili's-style restaurant, complete with all of the run-of-the-mill tacos, nachos, and easy-to-pleasy Tex-Mex apps and entrees eager (or hesitant) travelers are looking for. Prices are high as hell, so steer clear if you're on a budget. Grab a $10 Corona or Margarita, $15 nachos, and say a prayer to Jesus Cristo for a safe, quick, and easy flight home (and that this crap wasn't you're last meal!). Honestly, come on, it's an airport Tequileria! Oh, service is typically terribly overwhelmed and, concerning our last visit, sucked juevos grandes.
