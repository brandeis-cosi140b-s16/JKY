I use Yelp a lot to find places to eat. My son suggested El Bravo because of reviews. Lots of good reviews.
My wife and I  got there and was seated by a very nice lady.  I am going "good start". I may of just hit it on an off night. Nothing special about the decoration. Kind of plain could of used some cleaning. Very typical of some of the locally owned places where you can often get some very good food. My son and daughter arrives and it takes a while for someone to come and take our order. We get our drinks and wait and wait. Other people that came in after us have their food and are eating. Our drinks are empty and I have to ask to get refills. Ten min. later our waitress came out and said our food was being made. Ten min later we finally had our food. My son liked the Chimi, my wife and daughter liked their meal. Nothing exceptional, good. I got their cheese crisp Ole, again was good. There was not a lot of people in the restaurant so our long wait was not because they were to busy. I will probably not go back. There are a lot of places that do as well or much better closer to where I live.
