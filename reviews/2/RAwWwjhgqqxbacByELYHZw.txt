This place is really close to my husband's work. We decided to try this place for our Tuesday lunch date. While it was clean, it was nearly dead. The only people in the restaurant were there to shoot a commercial or an interview. The food, while largely portioned, was not that great. I would have much rather gone across the street to the 'Berto's. I had a chicken burro with guac while the hubs had the pulled pork upon my recommendation (I had read the reviews here about the pork being great). The chicken had a nice smoky flavor but it completely overwhelmed my burro. It was the only thing I tasted. The hubs said he had the same thing with the pork. We also had the brownies. They were the best part of the meal. Even though the food was not terrible, I had sated my curiosity about Bueno Burger and don't feel the need to return. They were trying a bit too hard to be the next Chipotle. Why does every new restaurant now need to have a minimum of 3 TVs all playing sports review shows? Very distracting. Definitely not a recommend.
