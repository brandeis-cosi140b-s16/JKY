I don't know, maybe I hit this on an off day.  I ordered two enchiladas with carne asada, and one fish taco.  The fish taco was not solid fish, it was like chunk light fish, and smelled very fishy.  Hard to get the smell out of my office.  The enchilada meat was good, but the sauce was, I would say, just okay.  It's not horrible, but it's definitely not the best Mexican food I've ever had.  If you compare it to other Mexican food in Maricopa, probably not so bad.  But overall, not totally happy, and not sure I'm ready to give it another shot.  Very inexpensive, took about 15 minutes to get my food during lunch hour, even though I was take out.
