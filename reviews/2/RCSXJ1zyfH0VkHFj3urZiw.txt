Does the word casino-y make sense? it tries to be authentic but really doesn't cut it. The atmosphere is more buffet then Cantina. We went there on a Friday around 7 pm. The service was quick but felt extremely rushed. The waiter kept walking away in the middle of our order. I'm like, uh, can I finish my order here before you walk away? I had him repeat our order just to make sure he actually got it right. 
I ordered the beef enchilada and tamale combo. My son ordered the cheese enchilada and beef taco combo. The food came out quick, as most Mexican restaurants seem to be, so quick there's never any time to enjoy your drink.
The food was not quite hot, not a good start. Enchilada was ok, tamale was dry and without the luke warm barely spicy red sauce to add moisture, I don't think I would have eaten any of it.
Prices were what you'd expect, around $13 for the combo's. Not sure I'd be back to try any of the other dishes unless I'm in the mood for hurried cold Mexican food. At least Taco Bell serves it hot....
