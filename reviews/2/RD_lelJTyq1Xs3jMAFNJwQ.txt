Ok, so I kind of perversely enjoy a restaurant that's so needlessly complicated that it requires its own help desk, but that was before I tried the food. We went through the newbie tour, getting little bites of everything, and were mostly underwhelmed. Striking out nonetheless, I ordered the jade chicken, fried rice, and the pork in a quesadilla. I was impressed by the tender and flavorful pork, but that's where the magic ended. I felt everything was awash in salt, and the jade chicken was as generic as Asian food comes. The snickerdoodle was cute, but a fun concept does not a good restaurant make. Guy Fieri, I expected better of you.
