Seriously? People giving this place 5 stars? I have lived in Southern CA and now in El Paso, TX. I've tried some of the best mexican food, but this place was just ok. I've eaten "New Mexico" food in New Mexico and it's tasted better than this place. The food was a bit greasy. Granted, we ordered take-out from this place so maybe the food could have been better if we ate it in the very tiny restaurant that doesn't even have a sign on the outside. It's amazing how people even find this place!
