I wasn't really impressed with this place at all.  On the positive side their medium salsa was quite good, but they just give you a squirt bottle when you get your food (i.e. don't expect to get complimentary chips and salsa).  My lunch was the chicken taco and green tamale combo.  The tamale was nearly petrified, in fact I had to cut it half way in order to remove it from the corn husk it had grown glued to over, oh I don't know, a week??  The chicken in the taco seemed to suffer the same petrification process.  The rice and beans weren't bad.
