Nope-not authentic, pre-prepared, the chips are way too greasy and flavorless, and every entree tastes the same as every other entree. I went there with a party of five.l tasted everyone's entree. Tasted like we were all eating the same thing.
I have not had authentic Mexican anywhere in Madison. I'm told by my friend from Mexico, that yellow cheese is not used in Mexican food, nor are black olives.
