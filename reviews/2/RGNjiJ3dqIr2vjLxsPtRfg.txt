After a recommendation, three of us headed to Fausto's for dinner.  After scanning the wall menu, we ordered three separate combo plates.. They arrived barely Luke warm.  The cheese enchiladas were pretty cheese less, very little filling.  We didn't care for the refried beans on the tostada or the combo plate.  We found them to be very "lardy" tasting.  Nothing special about the chili relleno, either.  I doubt if we will be back anytime soon.  There are just too many Mexican food restaurants in the area.
