Food is amazing!  The service however, some of the worst I have seen in the industry.  Very poorly managed.  Staff is lackadaisical at best when it comes to even remotely attempting to care about their jobs.  Girl behind the counter was talking about calling in the next day since she was going to be hung over, cashier double charged my card by ringing up the same item twice and had an attitude about fixing it, overheard complaints about being busy and wanting to lock the door so no one else could come in, and to top it off, they were out of Cholula hot sauce on the self serve bar and I asked for more and was told there was none even though I saw it in the back cooking area and when I pointed that out, she rolled her eyes at me.  If the food was not as good as it is, I would never go here.
