Disappointed in the service we received this weekend. We were seated for 20 minutes and, despite flagging down the bus boy, could even get a glass of water. The server finally acknowledged us but didn't return for our drink order for another 10 minutes. I'm deeply disappointed and won't go back any time soon.
