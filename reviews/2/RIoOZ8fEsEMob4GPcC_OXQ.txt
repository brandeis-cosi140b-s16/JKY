I've finally been there enough times to realize that I don't like it. 

The beans are bland and the rice is salty. The salsa isn't right, either. They have all of the typical tacos, enchiladas, and other stuff you'll find in a similar Mexican place, it's just not as good.

The service is sub-par. I've noticed that the bussers do their thing right; refilling water, cleaning up, etc. The servers are happy to take their time with everything and leave you hanging.

The last few times I went to this place, it was the decision of someone else. I'm not going back.
