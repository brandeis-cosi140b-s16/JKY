Decent food, but nothing to write home about.
Dining room is tight... booths are only fit for thin people and even then it's a tight squeeze.
Food is overly greasy, salsa is watery, chips are mediocre and limited.
I really do not see what the big deal is about this place... it's decent, but nothing to rave about.
The best thing about the place is the fast service.
You could do better... you could do worse, but  you owe it to yourself to try some place different if you believe Azteca is "great" or even "above average".
