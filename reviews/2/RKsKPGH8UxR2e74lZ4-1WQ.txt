I really like the atmosphere in the dining room at Ricardo's, but every time I visit, there seem to be problems.

It was a bit late when four of us went for dinner.  We were ushered to a table in the lounge, but asked to be seated in the dining room.  We didn't know it was already closed, but nevertheless, the hostess seated us there.  Definite props for that.

We started with an appetizer combo plate, which was very good.  For the main course, I ordered Carne Asada, medium rare.  At other Mexican restaurants, this steak has an inimitable flavor. It came out of the kitchen fully well-done, and the only flavor I tasted was salt.  By this time, I was full enough from the appetizers that I just sipped my margarita and didn't have them replace it.  I knew that without that special flavor that I know and love, a less-cooked replacement wouldn't be much better.  And that's the big disappointment at Ricardo's.  The food just isn't worth the trip.
