Although we have been in the Phoenix and surrounding areas several times we had not tried a Filiberto's before tonight. On a whim and since there is not much choice in Buckeye we decided to give it a try. 

First if this is cleaner than other Filiberto's, YIKES. This place was not clean. 

I ordered #5 combo and it was a lot of food. 2 cheese enchiladas, beans & rice. The only thing hot was the beans. The red chili had a rather strong vinegar taste but after a few bites I got used to it, it was not horrible but not spicy either. My husband had the Green Chili Burrito, which was very hot (temp not chili) and he enjoyed the flavor but it was much more tomatillo than green chili, we are from NM and we know green chili. The burrito was huge and had lots of very tender chucks of pork that had been simmered in the sauce. 

We also ordered chips & salsa, we got a mound of chips with what we would call pico de gallo all over the top, mostly just onions and cilantro with a few sad looking pieces of tomato thrown in, but very wet and it sogged up the chips really quickly. 

We love good Mexican food and won't be going back even though it is convenient it just wasn't very good.
