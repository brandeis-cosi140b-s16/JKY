The salsa bar & veggies that are pictured don't exist. The Coke machine pictured doesn't exist. Flowers on tables pictured? Nope, not those either.

They didn't even have water for customers, literally. The guy told me I could go get water out of the bathroom sink if we wanted water. WTF?!

The carne did have good flavor but the California burrito had steak, fries and cheese, that's it. No guacamole, no sour cream, no pico de gallo... nada!

Seriously disappointed with the high Yelp ratings at this run down taco joint. Pretty much "Meh. I've experienced better." Way, way better.
