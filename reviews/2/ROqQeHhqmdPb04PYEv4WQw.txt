Rosa's is kind of a Mormon staple - it's being so close to the Temple and all.  I have been there countless times, but my last visit on June 3, 2009 was an unqualified disaster.  Service was painfully slow.  The food, normally good for Baja, was lousy.  We complained to the person who was pointed out as the manager - Bert - and he was less than interested in our problem.  He basically said, "There's nothing I can do for you."  Awesome business skills.  Well, there is something we can do for him.  The five of us, and our families and anyone we can dissuade, will not be patronizing Rosa's ever again.  There is a lot better Baja in the Valley.  I think they are resting on their laurels.  Oh, and the best part?  We found out that the good regular chef wasn't there - and that a DISHWASHER had been recruited to fill in with the other regular chef.  Seems that clogged up the kitchen, because it took them a while to call in another dishwasher.
