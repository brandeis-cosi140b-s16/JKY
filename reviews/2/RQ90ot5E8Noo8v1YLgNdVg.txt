Wouldn't go here again....clean place, everyone's working but the food isn't really good. I got chips and nacho cheese....they are plain without much flavor.
The 2 soft tacos I got where chix and Chicharron...they were both really small and soggy....I got them Togo so I reheated them in the toaster oven making them a little better....the salsa is quite spicy....honestly I'd rather eat Taco Bell. Sorry.
