We went for salsa night tried to purchase bottle service which has clearly posted pricing once we sat down the waiter tried charging $60 extra for  the table claiming tip is included and juice was extra... So we left because I personally hate up charges tried getting water and the bartenders claim they don't serve water at this bar extremely disappointed I used to love coming here not anymore
