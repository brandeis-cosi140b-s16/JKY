3 stars food.  3 stars for price.  And 0 stars for service.

We ordered seafood enchiladas, chicken flautas & tacos, and spicy bean dip.  All were good enough.  Nothing extraordinary, but good.  Guacamole was really good, so was their salsa.  Portions from their dinner menu were ok, not gigantic but not small.  

Our orders sat in the back long enough to not be hot and to make my taco all soggy and had to eat it with a fork.  I ordered a side of sour cream and guacamole -- service forgot sour cream.  She asked my husband if he wanted warm tortillas with his meal, he said yes, she never brought any out.  Chips and salsa were brought out  after we ordered.  I thought this was one of those cheap joints where it wasn't included so I ordered chips and bean dip.  And then about 5 minutes before our food came she brought out the salsa and the bean dip.  As another reviewer said about their experience, we also weren't checked up on during our meal at all.  We had to flag her down to get the bill after we stopped eating, which wasn't easy when she refused to look in our direction most of the time.  It was not busy, by the way.  

I'm not counting them out entirely, but this first time was not good and the owner needs to know some of his wait staff are making him look bad.
