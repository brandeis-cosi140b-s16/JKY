This Taco Bell is one of the worst I have ever come across. Don't get me wrong, the food tastes the same as any taco bell, but they have HORRIBLE service. For the second time I have waited over 20 minutes stuck in a drive-thru for food. When I went in to check on my food (they never brought it out) I saw employees sitting on the counter! After all that wait they have people not even working. Lucky Taco Bell's are a dime a dozen and I can just drive to another one.
