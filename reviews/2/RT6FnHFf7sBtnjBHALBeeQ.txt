This is not gourmet or a charming hole-in-the-wall. It's a gas station restaurant. 

Yes, one half is devoted to dispensing fossil fuels, the other to refried beans. Do not expect miracles.  

They will give you the largest chips you have ever seen.  They will also give you refried beans and salsa.  Fancy.

Food is basic and will meet your Tex-Mex needs.  Do not expect an authentic experience.

Also, in case you were wondering, the restaurant does not smell like gasoline.
