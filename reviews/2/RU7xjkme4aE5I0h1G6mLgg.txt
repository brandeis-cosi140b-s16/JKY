I've lived here all my life and used to go to the original Mattas. It's definitely not what it used to be, they have gone downhill. 
When I was placing my order, I told them I  wanted the kids chicken fingers with rice and beans. Another girl leans over and tells the cashier that the kids meals are only for kids. The cashier then proceeds to ask me if this was for me to which I pointed at my son who was standing right next to me. Customer service is lacking. 
I also ordered the 2 item meal, which consisted of tamale, cheese enchilada, rice, and beans and I also ordered a shredded beef taco. 
After we were seated it took them a while to bring out the chips and salsa. I got the hot salsa and it was mediocre, nothing special.
The taco shell was horrible, like something you buy in a box at the grocery store. The shredded beef was ok. The tamale, with red sauce, was very dry and very average. The enchilada was not too bad, however, there's room for improvement. I think Filibertos has better food then Mattas now.
My son's chicken fingers were overcooked and a little too crispy. 
I have to say the quality of the food has gone down considerably over the years, not to mention how expensive it is compared to other places. It's WAY overpriced for what you get. There are far better places with far better quality than Mattas. Don't waste your money!
