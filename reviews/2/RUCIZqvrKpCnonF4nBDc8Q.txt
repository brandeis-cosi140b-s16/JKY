I joined yelp because I felt compelled to leave a rating here after we ate based on the many good reviews listed here, because I was SHOCKED so many people could rate this place so well.

We are new to PHX and were looking for something that could replace El Charro, which was our place we ate at religiously in Tucson.


I gave it 2 stars based solely on prices being low and the service being great.  Sad truth is that the actual food was just plain not good.

Food:
We had the following between us:

Beef taco - beef wasn't seasoned at all and taco was bland in general
Chicken taco - same as above, chicken tasted very plain
Green corn tamale - masa was dry and gritty, sauce that it was topped on was flavorless and tasted like it came out of a generic can
Chile Relleno - This was relatively tasty and probably the best thing we ate, but the chile was soggy and nothing that special
Fish taco - very plain again and the sauce was simply watered down mayo
Refried beans - pretty tasty and hot, no complaints
Rice - boring and dry

Margaritas - Average, but about what you'd expect for a 4 dollar margarita.

Salsa bar - None of the salsas did it for us.  The green is decent but nothing great, the hot tastes like tomato sauce with cayenne added.  The fire roasted taste was decent but needed some heat.

Ambiance:
Very bare bones, reminded me of a fast food place.  Tables close together and felt cheap.

Service:
The kids working there were nice and we got our food quickly, no complaints here.


Moral of the story is that the food really disappointed.  It had no flavor and nothing special in any of the dishes we ordered.  It tasted like what'd you get at a cafeteria.  I could eat mexican for every meal and die happy in 5 years (lol) and I have eaten at hundreds of Mexican places throughout the southwest.

Again, I cant believe all of these glowing reviews, its like these Yelpers have never had real mexican food.  You've been warned.
