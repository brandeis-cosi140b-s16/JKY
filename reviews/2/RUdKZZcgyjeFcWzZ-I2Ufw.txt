I'm a big fan of atmosphere when I go to eat somewhere. I know, judging a fast food restaurant based on ambiance might be a little unfair, but hear me out.

Before we even made it into the restaurant, we were immediately on edge. The "hours of operation" sign, usually a corporate decal, had been replaced by hand-written hours scribbled on a strip of paper. Not only that, but the aforementioned sign was taped to the glass using the tape they use to close the wrappers on burritos http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/baja-fresh-mexican-grill-scottsdale-2?select=VrHCIyrNYWFaRr8-G_D0Dw#VrHCIyrNYWFaRr8-G_D0Dw.

If that wasn't enough to put us on edge, there was the issue of the door. The handle was missing a bolt at the top, meaning that the handle swung back and forth if you touched it. When we left, this is what we saw http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/baja-fresh-mexican-grill-scottsdale-2?select=VrHCIyrNYWFaRr8-G_D0Dw#eHCSZ4a1Y3GzTaOIXTDucw.

This location was probably a shining gem when it opened. Those days, however, have long since passed...which is really unfortunate, because the food is actually pretty good. Not only that, but their outdoor patio area is really cool! It has heaters for the winter, and misters for the summer. So much potential...all lost due to lack of upkeep.

The years have not been kind to this building. Perhaps they could use some of the profits they're making off of their food and use it to maintain their facilities.
