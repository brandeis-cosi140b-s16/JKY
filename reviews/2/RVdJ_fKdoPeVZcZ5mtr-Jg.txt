I gotta say that the quality here has gone downhill. My last review here was in 2013 and it was great back then but now........eh I wouldn't bother. The Sonoran dogs are now a big disappointment compared to what else is out there. As a side note....El Guero Canelo just opened a shop out in Phoenix so just do yourself the favor and head out there for a good Sonoran dog.
