Service and food quality at Decatur store has gone down since expansion/new store both time I have called since.  Can the owners come back please and show the new kid on the block your style of service and quality of cooking?  When I just told the new guy how I felt since the change, he said OK fine if I didn't come back.  He answered the phone at 8:25pm and told me they were closed even though the website say until 9pm for both stores.  Really your going to be there for a while still taking care of what sounded like a loud full restaurant and cleaning up why argue with me and loose a good customer that use to tell everybody how great this place WAS.  He said no, I am looking at the site on my phone and it says 8pm close, maybe he doesn't realize mobile sites can differ from main sites but regardless don't call me a liar when I can clearly see the posted hours on my computer.
