Tacos were great...for what they had available.  

This what was on the menu:  Carne Asada, Carnitas, Adobada, Buche, Cabeza, Lengua, Pollo, Cameron, Suadero.  Great selection, right?  Well, this is what was available:  Asada, Carnitas, Pollo, Cabeza.  So everything I was craving wasn't there.  I opted for 1 each of what they did have and had a decent meal anyway.  Oh yeah, they were also out of fountain sodas (despite the big soda machine staring me in the face) so I was limited to their can options.  

Good food, large menu of false hopes.
