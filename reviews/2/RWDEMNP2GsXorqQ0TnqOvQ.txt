far better Mexican food in the valley... The place was dead so I don't really know how to rate the service.... the food was like Chili's and the prices were like an upscale Mexican restaurant .... I think the people coming from a day at the pool or a great concert must put them in the mood to review this place better? Go to Viva Mercados and forget Pink Taco.
