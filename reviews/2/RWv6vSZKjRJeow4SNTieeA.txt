Sadly, I have to update my review from 5 stars to 2 stars. Margaritas were awful, service was awful, server did not know happy hour drink special and we had to point on the billboard the prices, instead of checking, she immediately informed that alcohol drinks were not o happy hour. 

She cleared chips and salsa without asking us if we were done. Horrible experience compared to previous visits. We will try one more time as this may have just been a fluke. 

Fingers crossed...
