The best thing about this joint is definitely the amount of salsa they bring out when you sit down. They give you chips, of course, but then you get four, five six - I lost count - salsas to go with them. It's a veritable buffet of salsa. As has been mentioned, none are earth-shattering, but it's nice to have something other than a simple watered-down salsa to go with your chips.

After that, you get fairly standard mexican fare, delivered by generally helpful staff at a very, very slow pace. In fact, were it not for the chips and the extraordinary amount of salsa, it might be far too slow. Though I like mexican food, and don't mind it taking a while to prepare, because it means they are generally working on something tasty, in this case it was like they forgot we were there and had to remember what we ordered.

By the time they delivered it, we had eaten so much of the chips and salsa, we were hardly hungry for the food, but we did eat it, and it wasn't bad - just not decent enough to make us want to go back. In the end, eat we did, and if nothing else, I can say without a doubt that...

I ate it and I didn't die.
