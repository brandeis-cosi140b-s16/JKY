Nacho Daddy has been getting pretty good reviews lately and since we were close by, why not stop in? 

I ordered the Supreme Tostado Nacho's and my wife had the Daddy's Wings. The nachos themselves were huge, a lot of toppings...but not very much meat which was weird. I can't see why the amount of taco meat was so small on a plate of nachos that cost $13. Everything else seemed right though, they give you a good amount of guacamole and all the ingredients seemed fresh. My favorite part was the avocado lime salsa, it is killer! 

My wife didn't have as much luck with her food. She ordered the wings and asked for them extra crispy but they came out undercooked and with too much sauce making them really soggy. The wings come with a dip, which we asked for ranch and got blue cheese. No problem, they got it swapped out pretty quick. Now the problem...there's something in the ranch that's not supposed to be there. We pulled out 3 big dark chunks of something that I think maybe the kitchen dropped in the ranch and had been sitting in there a while. I'm not sure what it was but it was big, soggy and nasty...when I find things in my food that shouldn't be there, it's all over for me.

I was going to give them one star but the waiter noticed my wife stopped eating her food and without us saying a word, he offered to take the wings off the bill. We may try Nacho Daddy again but it won't be for a while. For me, the good service and decent nachos didn't outweigh the high prices and weird crap in my food.
