So disappointing. Food was good as usual but the new wait staff is downright bad. Barely got a greeting and did not once come to check on the table to refill water or chips. Even after asking for water twice we still got none. This used to be my go to spot, I've brought a good hundred people here ever the years but it seems like the recent bad reviews could be start of a bad trend. I would definitely start away for a while to see if they good better staff.
