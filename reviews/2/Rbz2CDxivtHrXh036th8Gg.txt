I wasn't impress. We sat along the canal and that was the highlight of the meal. Chips and guacamole was decent. I had the Tres Tacos, I thought it was bland and also they were those small tacos, I was expecting something more hardy. Even though the place was dead, service was slow.
This might be a OK place for drinks, but I would skip it for dinner.
