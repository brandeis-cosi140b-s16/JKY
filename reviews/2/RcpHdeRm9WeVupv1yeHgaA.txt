I Love Braddahs and have gone to their other locations and have never had a problem. When I saw this location opened I was very excited to go! We walked in; and even though there were about five people behind the counter the girl serving the patron ahead of us was the only one to say Hi. Two other girls walk in after us; and one of them apparently worked there, but was off that day. As I was finishing up getting my bowl together the girl behind us gets behind the counter and serves herself and her friend, while my cousin stands there waiting for her turn to be served. It was extremely awkward and unprofessional! I got my bowl & paid and my cousin was still waiting to place her order. Come on Braddahs you're better than this! Let's just say I won't be returning to this location.
