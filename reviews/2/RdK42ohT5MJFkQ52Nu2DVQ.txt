If you like Chipotle's, you will like this place, as they are identical. This is a "fresh and healthy" type restaurant. I went for lunch with my wife. Basically, you pick the item you want, I had steak tacos, and then you add the toppings you want, all for one price. 
   After spooning my "marinated, then grilled" steak into the tortillas from the hot line, I was rushed over to the cold line for additional toppings, bypassing beans, rice, etc. I had the lady go back to  the hot line to get the toppings I wanted then back to the cold line. I felt that I was being rushed through the line even though no one was behind me! I managed to find the only salt shaker in the place, and had to use Cholula hot sauce to have any flavor on the food. Very bland food, can't call this a Mexican restaurant in any way. Bland food, rushed through the line, not a good exp.
   The only good things are guac was good, restrooms were clean, quantity of food was decent for the price.
