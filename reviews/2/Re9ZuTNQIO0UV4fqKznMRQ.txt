So we decided to Cilantro a try. Apps and drinks were fine. My dinner and my wife's dinner were luke warm. At least our two other friends had hot food served to them. Took ten minutes to get our meals back. The owner came over to apologize but the waiter never did. When we got our bill which was good bill for 4, $130 I expected to see something knocked off the bill due to having to send the food back. Last time I eat there and besides this review I will let others to go to our favorite Mexican place La Mestiza or Casa Del Sol instead. Hasta la vista Cilantro.
