These guys just can't get their act together so I'm knocking them down one star from my previous review.  One of the reasons I go to Wahoo's is they always have a decent beer of the month (BOM) at a discount price.  I went there today and they were out of the BOM, Pacifico.  I asked if they would substitute a Corona or something else at the BOM price.  After a deer-in-the-headlights look, the cashier called over the manager.  The manager explained that he was unable to override the All Powerful Computer - makes me wonder why they even bother to pay a manager if the computer is actually in charge.  I guess the computer doesn't care that it lost out on a food sale and earned them a negative yelp review.  

This Wahoo's location has now been open too long for me to continue to cut them slack for being new.  There is no excuse for not having sufficient inventory and for not empowering managers to do right by the customer.  The owners and managers should visit the Santa Monica CA location and learn the true meaning of customer service.

BTW, I walked across the parking lot to Three Angry Wives Pub and had excellent service as well as happy hour priced beer and snacks.   Recommend you do the same.
