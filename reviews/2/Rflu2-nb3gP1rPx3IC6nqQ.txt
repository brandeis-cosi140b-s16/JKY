OK but seems to be living off its history and loyal patrons.  Damn sure not worth a no-apologies 35 minute wait for a single person's meal to be made on a not very busy Sunday night.  This is the last time I waste my time waiting for middle-of-the-road mexican.  Congrats, Espo's. You chased another one away.
