Not military friendly!!!! Especially with Marines. . Manager wants military to be in uniform to get military discount.  I'm not going to sit there in my dress/service uniform eating a burrito.  My ID should be sufficient enough. And Marines can't even wear utilities in public unless on duty! The cashier Nathan was nice and the only reason I didn't just walk out. 
Like most I'm also addicted to Chipotle so this won't be my last visit. Just my last on Scottsdale and Camelback! 
My only other complaint was my meal was cold. I was hoping this wouldn't be the case because I showed up at 11 on the dot. No worries I've said what needed to be said. . .
