I love Mexican food therefore I am very critical of it. I really wasn't too impressed with this place. First off, before entering the restaurant there was a nasty stench in the air that smelled like pee. It was gross. There was also a homeless guy outside the restaurant begging for change. I ordered the carne asada burrito and Al pastor taco as well as a horchatta drink. The burrito was a super burrito so it included rice, meat, sour cream, and so on. The burrito was okay. I've definitely had better. I actually liked the taco better than the burrito. The horchatta drink that I ordered didn't taste all that great either. It lacked flavor for some reason. Overall, I would not recommend this place.
