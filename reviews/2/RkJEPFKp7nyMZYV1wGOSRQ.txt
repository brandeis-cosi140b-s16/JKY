My recent trip to Chipotle was definitely disappointing. Ordered $60 worth of food and got $10 worth of service, due to the idiots that are often staffed on Sundays. 

We ordered take out and waited the ordained 40 minutes to leave the house for the ultra-slow Laveen location, even tho the Chipotle near my house in Mesa takes 10 minutes. Upon arriving 10 minutes after the online promise time, they hadn't even started the order. 

My carnitas order was missing sour cream and guacamole, which costs more. My daughter, who has a severe gluten allergy, received no apology when they forgot to switch out spoons and gloves. They just laughed and said "Oops".

My tip to management: call 'Restaurant Undercover' and see what is really going on cuz you just lost a weekly $60 sale from our family.
