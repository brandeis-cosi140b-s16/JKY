Over priced and don't come hungry unless you plan on buying two entrees per person. My husband and I came here for dinner on a Friday. Cute little restaurant and not busy (probably because it's new). 

I had the white, chicken enchilada (notice not plural) and my husband had Guido's chicken. Both bland and again small portions. For $15 a plate, $5 for chips and salsa (which I believe should be free) and $7 margarita (happy hour price), we left still hungry and disappointed. 

Two stars for service and hospitality. Other than that, we don't plan on going back.
