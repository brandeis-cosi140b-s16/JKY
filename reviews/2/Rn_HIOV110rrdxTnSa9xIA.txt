This could have been 4 stars.  I wanted it to be 4 stars.  I came in with my family asuming this would be as good as the other location.  I was wrong.  When we walked in, we were not greeted by the staff at the counter.  they just stared at us.  We ordered 7 tacos, a torta, a side of beans and 3 drinks. The Torta was more bread than anything else.  the amount of meat and toppings they give is ridiculous. The tacos werent bad but they could have used more flavor in the meat.  Someone behind us came in with a punch card and when my husband asked about getting one, the guy just ignored him. When he asked again, the employee said they were out of cards and to ask next time.  We asked for limes and we were told they do not have limes.  What the heck?  What kind of mexican restaurant doesn't have limes?  Not to mention, the place is filthy.  We left hungry and disappointed.  We wont be back.
