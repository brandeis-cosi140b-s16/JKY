I used to go here once a week until i decided to start a diet. The food was good when it opened but it slowly deteriorated. My last trip was at the end of the year for my birthday and to my surprise, the name changed. I decided to try the pork burrito with a spicy white sauce on top. I cut into it and it was like some one broke a dam, grease was everywhere. Needless to say, I tried to eat it but I paid for it later. Although I liked it at first, I would not recommend it anymore.
