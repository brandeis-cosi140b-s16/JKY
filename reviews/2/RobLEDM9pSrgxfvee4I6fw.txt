On the Border....of food.
Something to say when the rice was the best tasting part of the meal.
I ordered the Queso Chicken....the chicken was burnt and completely covered in what I would call ballpark nacho cheese....I'm not joking. Mildly spiced, Velveta covered burnt chicken. The rice,...unseasoned, unflavored, and the best thing on the plate. 
Two stars due to the margarita...
