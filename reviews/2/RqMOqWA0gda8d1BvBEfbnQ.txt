We were there yesterday and they have only been open a day.  That being said, wow it was hard to order and communicate.  The food barrier is too high and although the food servers are friendly, they struggle to hear you and remember what you said.  They need training on the menu.  I had a chicken taco and a potato taco.  The chicken taco was good but the potato was deep fried and came from the back, then sealed shut so you can't really add salsas and fresh toppings.  My b/f got the meat torta and did not like it.  The meat had little flavor and it was packed with white rice??? And no guacamole; he was almost angry about a torta stuffed with rice.  We will try again because the menu was good and I think they are just experiencing newness with the staff.
