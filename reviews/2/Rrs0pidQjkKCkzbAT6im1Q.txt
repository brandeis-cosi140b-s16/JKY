The service is not the best because you can forget about a refill unless management walks by. The food is cheap but you get what you pay for. It doesn't taste authentic and if you order something you don't know you may be missing ingredients. My husband loves chili relano and there was no chili plus a sliced piece of cheese melted on top. The waiter even tried to make excuses for the cook. The ground beef is standard on everything that has ground beef in it also the salsa is pre-made and you cannot order salsa without cilantro if your allergic.
