I would not eat here again.  I could've bought the nachos and salsa at half the price for twice the serving size at the grocery store.  Even the margaritas are not good.  And they served a pint glass. Why?  The tacos look good, but they are flavorless and bland at best. I'm irritated I wasted my money here.
