Service, service, oh silly service. It was greatly lacking at Cabo. 

After ordering our drinks, I swore our waitress had hit it big because she was no where to be found. 20 minutes passed and finally she did return with said drinks that had been sitting at the bar, and then proceeded with taking our order. 

Maybe we just came on a bad night, it was karaoke night after all and I hadn't yet had enough drinks to enjoy the karaoke that was ensuing. Not to mention the DJ, well I'll just be nice and say he enjoyed hearing himself talk and needed to come down off the high cloud he was on. 

The food arrived, again at a much slower than normal pace. It was mediocre at best, no one at my table had finished their order. Sadly cant even remember what I ordered, the experience here was just not up to par.
