I usually go to Dos and love it but decided to give this place a try because of yelp. I have to say I liked the decorations better here but not much else. 

I had a bland flavorless El Toronto fajita that did not sizzle and were not tender (like the menu promised). It didn't come with guacamole lettuce or tomato ie the usual with fajitas. I had to ask for lettuce and sour cream which were not fresh and too cold. The waiter also seemed offended that I asked and generally didn't seem to want to be there. 

I'm never coming here over Dos again.
