I've been to many Chipotle locations, and this one isn't very good. Cramped layout, inefficient staff and no parking. Portion size is below average (I do realize that this has a lot to do with the person serving you). The restaurant is not sparkling clean and the soda/utensils area needs to be tidied up. The food tasted okay, but the salsa was not as fresh as many other locations.
