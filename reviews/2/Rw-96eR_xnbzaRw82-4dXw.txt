went there for a lunch on a lazy sunday and it is what it is.  the chips and dip were awesome.  there were 6 of us and the food took a long time.  the lunch room wasnt too busy either.  cost over 100 bucks (all of us had one beer) and they forgot my hot sauce.  but when they remembered that we were in the bar side of the place, it was good.  problem was they forgot alot. 

the food is nothing fantastic.  chili's type of food at best.  wasnt disappointed cause that was close to what i expected.  taco was massively oily, beans were burned... the usual.  would i go back?  probably not.  but i had to go once to be able to say it!
