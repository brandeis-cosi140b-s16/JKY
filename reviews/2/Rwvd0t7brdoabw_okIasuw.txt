I've eaten at Pure four times, for both lunch and dinner. The drinks are pretty good, the food not so much. 
On my last visit I ordered the quesadilla special, thinking it would be like every other quesadilla I've ever had (grilled flour tortillas stuffed with cheese and meat). Pure's quesadillas are more like empanadas - fried masa turnovers. I took one bite and left the rest untouched. When the server asked if I wanted a to go box I declined, saying I didn't like the food. Later I had to ask the server to remove the charge from my bill. She actually said she hadn't planned on taking the charge off and would need to ask the manager first. The manager was nice about it and said that they need to do a better job of explaining the quesadilla. I agree. 
So, learn from my experience and don't expect to get grilled, cheese stuffed flour tortillas when you order a quesadilla. Oh, and they don't serve nachos either.
