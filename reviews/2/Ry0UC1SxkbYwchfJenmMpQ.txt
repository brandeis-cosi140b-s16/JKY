Girlfriend wanted Mexican food and not just a regular run to Taco Bell. She mentioned El Charro since she grew up in Mesa. I have to say I was not impressed. I'm not very demanding either but I'll take the "gringo" Mexican food served at Tee Pee's any day over the food I was served here. Service was fine but the decor seems or rather is very outdated. Dark and green. We ate at the bar area and the best part of the meal was the chips and salsa I can say that. Ordered a sour cream enchilada off the menu and it was just so so to be honest. I'd eat there if someone wanted to but I won't be making the trip voluntarily. I can however see how for some it's a family tradition,etc. Just won't be mine.
