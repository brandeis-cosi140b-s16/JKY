We used to love over in Tempe and ordered from the burrito express off alma school and Elliot; we were bummed when we moved but then quickly got excited when opened up Gilbert.  We've ordered from here a few times and usually not so bad, expect for today.  Whoever answered the phone seemed extremely annoyed to be working, literally felt like I was bothering her.  Then we ordered a combo meal and asked for green sauce on an enchilada (btw I completely understand there is no substitutions) but since the sauce type isn't listed I really didn't expect that to be a problem...apparently it is.  To be honest it wouldn't of been that big of a deal but both the employee and manager were extremely rude.  Needless to say you have lost a pretty loyal customer! Step it up guys!
