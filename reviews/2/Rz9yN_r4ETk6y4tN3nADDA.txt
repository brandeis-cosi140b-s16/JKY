My parents love this place. They ranted and raved about how great it was so when my mom invited me to go there for a girls night, I was happy to try it out.

The restaurant itself is gorgeous. Fake trees covered in lights...the whole nine yards. I hear they have live music on the weekends. The stage was beautiful.

Everything was pretty expensive but I don't mind spending $15 on a meal if it's worth it. I ordered the vegetarian enchiladas and a margarita. 

The margarita was alright. Nothing too special. Definitely not a twelve dollar margarita. As for the food, well it was horrible. My enchilada had cinnamon on it. CINNAMON. It didn't say that it would have cinnamon on the menu. I HATE cinnamon. I was really polite about it when I mentioned it to the waitress and she said, "Well AUTHENTIC mexican food usually has cinnamon on the main dishes."

Excuse me? My last name is Montoya and I was running around in diapers eating fresh tortillas before this waitress was even born. My family visits Mexico multiple times a year and I was raised on homemade mexican food. Not once EVER has there been cinnamon in it. I wouldn't have been mad about the cinnamon if she hadn't said that. It is NOT authentic mexican food. I have no idea what she was thinking.

If you like overpriced 'mexican' food that tastes nothing like mexican food and love dessert spices on your enchiladas, then I'd suggest coming here!

Stick to the bar for the atmosphere because it's lovely but avoid the food at all costs.
