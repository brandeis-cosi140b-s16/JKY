What is this.....a taco for ants?!

I wish I could give this place a 5 star rating because boy do I love me some good Mexican food, but I just can't do it. 

Their tacos are like wee little babies and the chicken pieces are bite size, like safe enough for an infant with no teeth to eat. 

For the price def not worth it. I much prefer to throw down on some Wadda's tacos in old town where each bite is worth every penny. 

Now I will say-they are not lacking in the refried beans department. Not sure if crack is their secret ingredient but uhhh, I'm addicted. 
 
So if you go-order the beans and order ten tacos so it's basically like 3 normal tacos. But those beans doe. 

Oh and they don't serve alcohol anymore. Like what?
