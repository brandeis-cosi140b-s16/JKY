I went here the other day for lunch and it was very disappointing. I have been to other Manuel's locations and they have been alright, but this one was not very good. I went for lunch and got the pollo especial which is basically a chimichanga with jalapeno cream cheese sauce on it. It was pretty gross, the chicken tasted like dish water and there was barely any of the jalapeno sauce on it. Also, it was really soggy, not crispy at all. I did give an extra star because our server was really nice and attentive, however, I would not come here again when there are places like top shelf that make the same dish much better.
