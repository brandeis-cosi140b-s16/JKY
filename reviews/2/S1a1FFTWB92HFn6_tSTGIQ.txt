This place made me so sad. I ordered combo tostadas expecting a giant platter of tostada goodness and it was just like in those skits where they stereotype fancy restaurants, giant plate, tiny food. Three setups on a tortilla chip, crab, chicken, and I forgot what the other one was because I ate it in one bite. Don't get me wrong, it was a damn good bite, but for $14, not worth it. 

They did serve chips, and the sauces were ok. The server was friendly and polite. My friend ordered a margarita, I tried it, at least they don't skimp on the tequila.

I also don't understand the poster ad coming into the Luxor for T&T, it had an attractive, scantily clad female on it, but there were actually no female staff from what I could discern. Not that I came in for that, but that brings me to my next point, why did you name the place Tacos and Tequila? You expect to stuff your face full of tacos and get really drunk with a name like that, and all you will actually be able to afford is a shot and three tortilla chips! Unlike Carrot Top, not worth the trip...
