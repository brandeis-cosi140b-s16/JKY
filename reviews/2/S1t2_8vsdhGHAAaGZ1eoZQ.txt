Fairly generic, bland Mexican food. My wife's family went to the old location for years and they have fond memories of good food there. I was never a big fan, but tonight's meal ended it for us. Tacos were boring. Sangria was so bad that my mother-in-law sent it back. My chicken chimichanga was fine, nothing special, but not bad. My wife's flan had to be sent back. I didn't get a refill on water the entire meal. There are so many good - better - Mexican restaurants out there. On the plus side, I like the interior, and kids like the cheese crisps. Oh well.
