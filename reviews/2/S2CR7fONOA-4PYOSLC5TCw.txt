One week before Christmas and already out of beef tamales.  Forget your holiday tamales, folks.

They're not taking orders by phone (so says their website). So I drove to their storefront on Cave Creek this morning.  Give me 3 dozen red chile beef.  Already out.  Ok, give me the red chile pork as an alternate.  Already out of that too.  

Guys, it's Christmas.  Most people want the traditional.  The other restaurant I drove to after leaving The Tamale Store had the traditional red chile beef so I bought there.  I will buy there next time, too, because I don't have time to waste with The Tamale Store.
