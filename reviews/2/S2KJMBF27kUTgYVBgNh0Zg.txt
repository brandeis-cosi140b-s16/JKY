I bought a Groupon and was looking forward to eating at Taberna for the first time with my friends last night. When I tried to make a reservation at Open Table, it said the restaurant was currently unavailable. I tried calling a few times and only got the voicemail. When I visited the website, only information for the Beverly Hills restaurant is listed. I had a feeling they were closed, but couldn't find anything about it online. 

Finally I showed up around 7 pm and there was a sign on the door that said the restaurant is closed indefinitely due to the economy. I can't really accurately rate the restaurant since I've never been, but I am a bit frustrated that there isn't any information listed on the website about the closure. Perhaps it just happened, but I didn't appreciate wasting my time and being forced to drive out there. Hopefully they open up after the slow summer months, and I can actually review their food!
