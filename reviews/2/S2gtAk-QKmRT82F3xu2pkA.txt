They claim to be gourmet mexican cuisine...  I've had better mexican food from street vendors.  Service was awkward, food was mediocre at best and pricing was way too high.  Ordered the "barbacoa"...  It was basically boiled meat with absolutely no flavor.  Menu stated it was brisket, it seemed more like top round:/  the tortilla chips were good!  Won't go back...
