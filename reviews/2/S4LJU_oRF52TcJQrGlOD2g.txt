After having gone to another similar chicken place in Tempe, my expectations were high. This place was much closer to home so we decided to stop in. 
There was no one dining when me and my friend showed up. The place was clean and the guy who took our order was friendly. We get our plates which consisted of chicken (not spicy at all) tortillas, and I forget what else. I think it was rice. Unfortunately, our chicken was SUPER DRY and BLAND. It literally had no flavor :( I really wanted to love this place but the chicken ruined it. It's a chicken place, shouldn't the chicken be tasting great? Maybe I will give it another try and hope that this time it's seasoned.
