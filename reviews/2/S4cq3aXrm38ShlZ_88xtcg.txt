This place was lame.  Weak margaritas.  Our server was nice but you could tell she was green.  A couple of us ordered the "jalapeno slaw" as a side and this stuff was like plain old boring cole slaw.  We addressed this to our server who took it to the cook who said basically, "that's the way it is."  Where was a manager?  Food took a while too.  I was traveling through but I would not return.
