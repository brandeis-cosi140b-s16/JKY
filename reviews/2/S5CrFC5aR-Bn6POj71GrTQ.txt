Service great.
Quality of food, horrible. 
Compatible to chipotle, but a lot worse. 
I liked the idea of fresh pressed home made dough, but it was almost all the way cooked. 
All the ingredients were in covered containers and did not look fresh at all. Probably due to the lack of customers at the establishment. Only one family eating, no one in line at 11:15am. 
I did get free chips and quest for checking in on yelp, but the chips were too salty for me. My co workers on the other hand did enjoy them.
