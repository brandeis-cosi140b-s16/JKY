I wanted to try something new, and this place was alright. The waiting time was so long, and I didn't find it to be the most sanitary place to eat just because the hands that prepared the food were the hands that opened and closed the door. No gloves whatsoever. I was served my food by the chef, who had creamy gunk all over his fingers. Nevertheless, I ate the taco since I was too hungry from waiting... And it was alright.
