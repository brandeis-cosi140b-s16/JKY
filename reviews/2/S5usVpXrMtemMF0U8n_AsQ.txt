What's a matador? 
Nothing fella I just don't want to open up because the food behind me is horrible.

Seriously the food is really bad.  We live in AZ.  How can a Mexican restaurant get Mexican food so wrong?  Should my beans be orange?  I got the chilli verde burrito enchilada style and the beef was a disgusting color of salmon and didn't taste any better than it looked.

Service was great.  I was served promptly and and my food came out quickly.  That is the only reason for the two stars.
