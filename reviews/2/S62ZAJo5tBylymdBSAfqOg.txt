SINGING COOKS ALWAYS MEANS SAVOR! SERVICE STAFF TREATS YOU LIKE EXTENDED FAMILY JOINING FOR A GREAT FAMILY MEAL. DECOR A BIT DRAB, BUT THIS PLACE HAS POTENTIAL!!!

--made-to-order Pico de Gallo is fresh and spicy, but too salty, especially if you eat with corn chips.
--when you can hear cooks singing in the kitchen, you KNOW it's going to be good.
--flour tortillas, though delivered, had only SIX ingredients.
--guacamole should _never_ have a thickener like milk
--rice too small, so it dried out fast, too bad.
--cheese crisp not crispy, green chili strips were fresh!

DECOR NEEDS A REDRESS
--long strands of hanging beer flags don't make a place festive unless they're flapping in the wind at a Mexico beach bar
--nor do mounted mariachi hats and diagonally-stapled multicolor throw rugs
--caballeros and damas are great, but don't mount McDonald's-plain Men and Women signs underneath.
--mirrored walls are '80s. EW.

must qualify my review by mentioning my corn allergy. means I can't eat much from this menu.
great local feel here, needs a facelift.
