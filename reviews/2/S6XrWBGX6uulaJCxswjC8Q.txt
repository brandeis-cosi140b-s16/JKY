My daughter and I visited today for the first time.  The staff was very courteous, and I believe it was the manager or franchise owner that greeted us.  He described the menu for us, and welcomed us to the restaurant,was clean and bright.

That said, I had one of the Carne Asada tacos, and one of the Al Pastor tacos.  Both were kind of average and uninspiring.  Here is the quick list of likes and dislikes about the food.

1. The guacamole was the processed kind, not the handmade kind, this caused it to have a processed flavor which was kind of flat and off.

2. The tortillas were kind of weak, and partially fell apart during the meal.

3. The Carne Asada was overcooked.

4. The Al Pastor was pretty good.

Being a franchise, I don't know if they can change things like which tortillas or guacamole they use, but it would definitely make things better.

I doubt that I will return.
