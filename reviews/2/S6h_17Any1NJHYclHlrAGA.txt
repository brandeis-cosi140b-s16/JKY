Do your best not to come here during the evening rush.  Appears they only focus on the drive through.  Stood in the front with a few other guys for what felt like 10 minutes.  Several people looked at us but nothing happened.  Eventually I heard some one say: "can you take care of the front? " then I heard a "no". Shortly after some one came to the front to help.  She was a nice lady. ... must have been a day that some one called in. This is the same place that my order is wrong every time I go through the drive through.  Why do I keep coming here you ask? Its the only one for miles.....
It has been over 10 minutes now according to my receipt. Still no food.... it took 17 minutes for 3 burritos a double decker and a roll up.  And they still got the order wrong. ... I did get 2 free orders of cinnestix though.
