This place reminds me of Qdoba, Chipolte and Moe's Southwest Grill: they're just fancier versions of everyone's favorite go to spot when they're broke: Taco Bell. Nothing spectacular or memorable. The nacho chips they serve are too salty. Prices are ok. Best time to come is lunchtime. This location closes at 8pm.
