We stopped by on our way to Tucson for lunch.  We had chips, salsa and sodas while waiting forever for our enchiladas. Service was slow, may have been short staffed. Chips-cold and stale, salsa-had better out of a jar. Enchilada sauce was like ketchup and both cheese and beef fillings were tasteless.  Never again!
