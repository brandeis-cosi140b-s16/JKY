"FML"

Going here makes me want to thank my parents everyday that they didn't raise me to be white trash.  Located in a mall populated with a mix of the cast of the Jersey shore, COPS, Real Housewives, and State Fairs, this restaurant will primarily appear to you if you like have never been to a Mexican restaurant other than Chipotle.     Our server was nice, but looked like she might have contracted 3 STDs before she was 18.

The bigs: 
- The was average, even edible.  I had the baja style fresh grilled fish tacos and munched on some of the steak fajitas.  A little bland for me, but it seemed that it was prepared in the recent present and the sides were tasty.  Obviously nothing close to authentic.

The diggs:
-One of the worst frozen margaritas I have ever had.  It was a sweetened icy slush of artificial nothingness.  Even though it was Happy Hour cheap at $3, skip it.

- They have the 48oz mini-Yard style Margaritas.  Cheap, large drinks seems to be the attraction here.  Perhaps consuming them would help to tolerate the other customers and this mall.

Like everything in this gigantic mall, it is artificial, cheesy and just plain wrong.  Sigh, this party of Vegas sours the whole experience for me.  When do I fly back to NYC again?
