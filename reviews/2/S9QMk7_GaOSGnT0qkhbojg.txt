This is the home of the dollar margarita and its the best I have experienced however get the extra shot in it makes it even better.  The white sangria a little sweet which I love, which is 2.00 a glass.  I have not eaten at San Antonio other than desert of which was very good the Churro's are so good strawberry filled with ice cream enough for two unless you dont share your deserts.  I will say its a hit or miss with the bartenders, we either get a great one or one with no personality.  But for 1 margarita and 2 sangria you cant beat it.
