I think my jaw is broken from trying to eat their rolled tacos. I really think they were made a week ago and just re-heated. I waited almost 5 minutes for someone to take my order and they seemed upset that I would come and eat here..? Then my food came out in 30 seconds (a little too fast). Not the best fili's around.
