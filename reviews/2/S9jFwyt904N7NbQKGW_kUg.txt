I love Mexican and a super long time ago (circa 2000) I remember Zapatas (University) being really good. No mas. No bueno. 

The salsas to start were watery and the mild tasted solely of black pepper. That was just weird. The chips were plentiful but very bland. They needed salt in a bad way and I rarely need to add salt to anything. 

We were barely seated less then a minute when the waitress asked if we were ready to order.  Seriously. I had just opened my menu. Also, no specials on Saturday? That was weird. 

I ordered the chimichanga and asked for queso on the side because I like my chimichanga crunchy. When it came out, there was some other red sauce on it. Dang. Defeated the purpose of a crispy shell but at that point I was ready to eat anything besides the chips and bad salsa. 

I really wanted this place to be awesome so it could go in the rotation of "Places we can walk to for Lunch".  It deserves 1 1/2 stars but I'll be generous and give them a 2. Save your money and put it towards gas to drive to a decent Mexican place.
