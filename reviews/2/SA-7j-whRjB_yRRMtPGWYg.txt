I came in just after the lunch break. Service was fast and friendly. 

I ordered the homewrecker burrito with chicken. The chicken itself was quite tasty. However, the rest of the burrito left something to be desired. It just didn't taste properly fresh... as if the veg and beans and condiments had been sitting out and had gone limp.

Overall, it wasn't bad for fast-food Mexican however I could probably do better going to Chipotle instead.
