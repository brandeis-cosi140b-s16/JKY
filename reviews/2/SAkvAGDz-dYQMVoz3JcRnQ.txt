Not much to say except for almost no flavor chicken with edible black beans and pretty fluffy edible rice. The veg and onions are way too soft, almost mushy. The guac is edible and the pico de gallo did not look fresh. They also give you a side of spicy salsa that's full with preservatives. 

Edible when you're on a bind.
