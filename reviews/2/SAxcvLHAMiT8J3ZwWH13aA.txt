I am really surprised at the high ratings.  The service was absolutely terrible the entire time, and at the end of the dinner we were surprised to see 20% gratuity added on our party of 7.  I asked for water 3 times and waited for a extremely long time for our meal. I try to put service aside because you never know if they were short staffed etc.

The tableside guac portion is extremely small $11.75.  I had the mole enchiladas, which were served cold. The flavor was pretty good but it was a basic chicken enchiliada with mole on top for $20.  Overall, I thought the food was decent and would probably pay for it at 60% of what is charged (especially given the location).  I really don't see what was innovative or standout in any of the 7 dishes our table ordered.  If anything, I think this place benefited from the Guy hype and lack of competition in the marketplace.  This place would not survive in a foodie town.
