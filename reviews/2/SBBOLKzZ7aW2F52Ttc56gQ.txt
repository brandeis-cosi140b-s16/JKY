This particular visit was the 3rd visit I've made to Chipotle in the last few weeks that has been disappointing - subsequently, this will be my last visit. This time, I asked for a carnitas burrito...oh boy! The meat was atrocious - dry, tasted like mold/dirt, and then I got a big chunk or slimy fat & all was done. I couldn't possibly take another bite, nor will I ever again. The only thing they have going for them is the chips & guacamole.
