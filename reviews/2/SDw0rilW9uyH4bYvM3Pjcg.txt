*Sigh* You know when you really want to like a place, but every time you go you're disappointed until you finally just realize that place sucks?  Chronic Tacos is that place for me.

I wanted to like it because it is a similar concept to Chipotle, but they have more options like quesadillas, nachos, and tortas.  I liked that about the place, but I have found after three visits that the food just isn't that good.  The meat is dry.  The lime rice has no flavor.  The guacamole is brown.  They charge extra for sour cream.  Not to mention that they have GOT to get their assembly line in order.  All the times I have gone, the food has been piled up and I've had to keep my eye on my order because:
(1) they will mix up the orders and try to put other people's burritos with yours so that when you get up to the register, there are magically three burritos they want to charge you for, or 
(2) ask what you want on your nachos when you ordered a quesadilla and you have to tell them multiple times that those nachos aren't yours but that quesadilla that somehow got pushed to the back of the assembly line is.

I also don't like how you have to pay extra for chips and salsa, yet they don't have a slasa bar.  You have to ask the crazed assembly line people for salsa and good luck if you need more salsa, because you won't be able to get back up there without standing in line again.

And then the decor...they encourage you to write all over the walls, booths, napkin dispensers, and even in the bathrooms.  Just gives the whole place a dirty, cheap vibe.  "Come to Chronic Tacos and be the hoodlum you've always wanted to be!  Draw a penis on the wall if you want!!"

I tried, I really did, but I just can't find love for this place.
