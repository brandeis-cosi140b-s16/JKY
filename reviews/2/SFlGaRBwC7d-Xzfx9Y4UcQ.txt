I've been here twice before games at Time Warner - while it's nice to have a sit-down fast casual place in EpiCentre besides Moes, I wish the experience and food was better. All the taco's tend to be bland, which is odd given that Vida makes some solid food. Worse, they aren't a good value - two people really can't get a meal and drinks under $30 there, which seems a bit much for mediocre taco's, canned guac, and average service.
