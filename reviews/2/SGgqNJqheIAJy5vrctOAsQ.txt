I was shopping nearby and spotted this Qdoba. I had never been to one before so I decided to give it a try.

To sum up the look, feel, and menu of the restaurant, all I need to say is think Chipotle. If you've ever been to a Chipotle then you've been here. 

The menu is also 90% identical to Chipotle, just named a little different.

Since I love the steak fajita burrito at Chipotle, I decided to get the same thing here. It wasn't hard- you order exactly the same way and direct the worker to add what you want (exactly the same ingredients available too).

So I got my carbon copy burrito and unfortunately the taste was the only thing different. The steak in the Qdoba was not seasoned- it was just steak. I'll admit it was good steak, but in a burrito, I want seasoned meat. The burrito was a bit bland IMO.

So to sum up, I found Qdoba to be a near perfect copy of Chipotle- except for the lack of flavor.

Only 2 stars for being copy-cats.
