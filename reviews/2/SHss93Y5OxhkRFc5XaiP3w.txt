Ate at the new Pasqual's Hilldale last night.  

Atmosphere:

While I'm a fan of the Pasqual's on Monroe St the interior of this new Pasqual's is bizarre.  It feels like an industrial space with lots of different colored walls and a cement floor.  It might work for some other type of restaurant but not a Tex-Mex joint.  Its way too bright also.  

The Food:

Enh.  Not bad but not great.  Texas Tubbs is better for tacos.  The food had an almost Taco Bell taste/quality to it.  I had two tacos and we also tried the huevos rancheros.  The huevos were just plain gross and the tacos were ok.  One good thing is that its cheap.

The Service:

A friendly hostess sat us but she could not have been over 15 years old.  The service was fine for a $15 meal of tacos.  Not great but you get what you pay for.  

Overall:

Unfortunately I don't think I'll return.  The space is too sterile and it feels like a chain.  Honestly Qdoba has more character and the food might even be better too...
