The good:

The food was actually tasty.

The bad:

It was a little on the less than hot side and could stand some time under a broiler.

The ugly:

The 4 people (5 including us) wandering the restaurant with bill and credit card in hand looking for someone to pay. We waited 20 mins before getting up to look for someone who wanted to take our money. Oh yeah, they forgot to bring our appitizer and seemed to not believe us but eventually took it off the bill.
