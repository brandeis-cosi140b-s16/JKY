I'm confused as to why this place has such a high rating.  What I ordered was the most tasteless burrito I have ever eaten in my life.  Not to mention the salsa was pretty bland as well.  The wait staff was awesome though! They smiled and they were really helpful. Part of the reason why I didn't complain about the food while at the restaurant.
