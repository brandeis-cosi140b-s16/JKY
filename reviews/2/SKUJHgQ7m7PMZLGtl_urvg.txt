Overpriced wanna be Mexican food. Never again! First and last visit. Tasteless overpriced food. I guess.my famiIy prefers authentic and this is not that. If you enjoy Americanized flavorless food, this place may be for you.  

They had a guy making ballon animals and he kept making eye contact with my children yet never made his way to our table.

For aSaturday evening we were seated rather quickly and the place was crowded. Seating way too tight. Felt we were dining with the group next to us 

Food bland no seasoning. Chips stale and cold with meh salsa. Margarita was good tho, only good thing about that visit 

Rather hit up Raul and Theresas
