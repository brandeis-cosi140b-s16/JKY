Just got back from an early dinner. We sat in the bar as we have in the past when it was Cabo. The bartender took care of us - he's been there for a long time and is always good, not intrusive but there when you need him. I had the Pork Chili Verde and my wife had the fish tacos. Both were okay but not great - definitely no where as good as we used to get back in the SF Bay Area. One thing I'd like to see changed would be a choice of beans. We both really don't like refried mush. Some black beans would be nice. 

Oh yeah the menu was hard to read in the dim light of the bar. The combination of black letters on a brown/red background just doesn't work.

We really don't know if the "new" Aliante is going to make it. It's pretty dead every time we go. We ate at the Bistro the week before and the food was good but the place was empty. I think Aliante has to be exceptional to draw bigger crowds.
