Sunday- Sept. 9th.  Excellent DJ.  -The best part of the experience.  Excellent server with a bright smile.   Downside- food was weak at best.  Wings were terribly tiny and for 12 bucks, a total waste of money.   The wings were smaller than a sugar packet.  See the picture I posted.  They should be embarrassed to serve those things.
