I don't understand how this place is getting such good reviews. It didn't do Chinese OR Mexican food well.

dan dan noodles - super small portion of noodles for $12... our table of 5 basically got one bite each

mongolian beef and lettuce - when it came out, i thought it was a salad, there was so much lettuce and the beef was M&M-sized and thus lost in all the lettuce

tacos - got two orders of this, and it tasted fine, but when the two tacos were SO tiny, they were like two bites each.

buns - this was fine, not the best, but relative to everything else it was okay.

Basically it was disappointing. Please don't eat here.
