I learned that chicken is not meat when I visited my first El Pollo Loco recently.  Observe the following exchange:

"Can I have two hard taco's with cheese, lettuce, tomato and beans only please"

"Two chicken crunchy taco's with only cheese, lettuce, tomato and beans?"

"No, two crunchy taco's with no meat, just cheese, lettuce, tomato and beans please"

"You don't want meat on the taco's?"

"Yes, like vegetarian taco's.  Just cheese, lettuce, tomato and beans."

"So only cheese, lettuce, tomato and beans?"

"Yes, no meat, I want cheese, lettuce, tomato and beans only please"

*pulls to window, pays for food, pulls away.

*swings back to window, hands bag back to employee.

"Is there a problem?"

"Yes, these taco's have chicken on them."

"I know, we always put chicken on them."

"I asked for no meat."

"It's only chicken though."

"Can I have a refund."

"You don't want them?"

"That is correct, I'll just have a refund please."
