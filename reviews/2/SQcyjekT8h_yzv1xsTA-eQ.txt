Our La Perla experience started off with the fear of being shot during the vatos altercation in the Fiesta Room that carried out into the parking lot. Our debate to stay or not weighed heavily on the BOGO coupon we had. 
I ordered the chicken chimi "regular" size, the chicken was good but I didn't care for the red sauce they topped it with. The beans were very runny and the rice didn't have much flavor. My boyfriend ordered the carne asada plate, the meat was a little bland but otherwise ok. He also didn't like the beans.
The food wasn't horrible but wasn't good either. Sorry La Perla, we won't be a return customer!
