A friend told me this place was a place to get great Mexican food.  We got lunch from there today. Prices were high. We spent over $50 for lunch for three people.  For that price you think the food would be unbelievable, well it wasn't.  It was more like tasteless and less than remarkable.  Definitely will not be eating there again or recommending them to anyone.  Such a disappointment.
