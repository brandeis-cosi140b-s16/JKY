How dare me book a reservation at a restaurant without checking Yelp reviews first! I didn't look at the reviews until the day of and was instantly kicking myself when I saw the low start rating. I went anyway with the hopes I would have a better experience, but I didn't.

Went with a friend for my first stop of restaurant week and I'm in no hurry to go back. They've only got two stars for a reason, that's because of their bland and unimpressive food.

Starter:
We had the queso fundido, it's a basic queso nothing too exciting. If you like your queso on the mild side you'll like there's, it wasn't spicy at all.

First course:
I had the grilled Mexican sweet corn. It was covered in queso, cilantro, chili powder, and a roasted garlic aioli. Would have been very good but it wasn't hot, tasted like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for too long.

She got the guacamole that wasn't good at all, looks and tastes like it came out of a bag. They're definitely not making it fresh.

Second course:
I had the texas brisket enchiladas while she ordered the surf & turf enchiladas, both were just ok.


Third course:
We both got the Chicken Zarape which is a grilled chicken breast topped with bacon, queso, cotija cheese, pico de gallo, chipotle sauce, crema fresco, and served with cilantro rice, and charro beans. It was good but lacking Mexican flavor.
*It tasted like something TGIFriday's would serve.

The overall dinning experience was lacking. Don't think I'll go back, there are too many great Mexican restaurant in Charlotte to eat this mediocre food.
