I used to like going to this Chipotle, but lately it has gone downhill. There was no line when I arrived, but soon after the dinner rush showed up. I noticed people were waiting a long while and had angry expressions on their faces. 

Another thing, they ran out of chicken. How do you run out of chicken? They were also out of forks. Really???

It would also be great if they posted the children's menu. It wasn't until I was paying that I saw the take home menus that has choices for kids. Oh well, now I know for next time, but it won't be at this Chipotle.
