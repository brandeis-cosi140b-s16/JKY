The food quality is very inconsistent. When it's good it's amazing, but some days it is some of the worst. The meat will be either super old or overcooked and tastes and feels like its burnt to a crisp. I find myself not wanting to go here as much just because I never know if I'm going to spend $20 on amazing or awful. It if was always good they would definitely have more stars. It's sometimes a little pricey and you have to pay for things that most mexican restaurants will give you (like chips and salsa).
