I was really looking for some authentic Mexican, but because of time and location had to settle. I knew better but went in anyway. The restaurant was not busy but service was a little off. My wife and I were seated at a table too small for my children. We had a craving for margaritas and shared a pitcher. It was good. Nothing else was. The salsa was bland like ketchup and we asked for an extra Jalapeno and never got it. The "Flautas" rolled in flour tortillas were corn taquitos. The Green Chile Pork Chimi was filled with flavorless stew meat and was soggy. Had we not enjoyed our margaritas we probably would have not eaten and gone to Taco Bell. This is probably a good restaurant for Snow Birds with no palate, but for true Southwesterners it was horrible.
