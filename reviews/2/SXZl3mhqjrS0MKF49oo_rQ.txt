The staff is very friendly, The food is mediocre at best. The filling in my shrimp tacos was tasty, but served in a flour tortilla, which to me makes it not a taco. No choice was offered. The carne asada in my husband's burro had never been on a grill or over a fire. Steam table meat. They have lost their liquor license, so there wasn't even a margarita to offset the food.
