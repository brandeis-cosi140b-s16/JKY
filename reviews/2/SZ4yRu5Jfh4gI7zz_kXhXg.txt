After growing up in Texas and living in Arizona the past few years, I was very excited when Ninfas opened in Glendale. Well......Ninfa's didn't taste like the Ninfas in Texas. Since Ninfas originated in Houston, I was expecting really good Mexican food. 

The food was VERY bland and tasted like it had been sitting under the heat lamps for hours. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.
