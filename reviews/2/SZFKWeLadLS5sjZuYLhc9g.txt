Driving in the area and hungry, I decided to give this place a try for lunch.  I looked at the menu on the wall and decided to order:

Carne Asada Burrito, $5.59

The service here was brutally slow.  The lady working the cash register could not multitask....it was agonizing.

While waiting for my food, I went to the Salsa Bar to load up on Salsa.  Since I like spicy Salsa, I went for what appeared to be the spiciest one...turned out to be watered down, mild Gringo Juice...*bleh*.

The food came out after a long wait.  Customers were confused because the cashier was calling out the wrong orders and people were returning saying it wasn't what they ordered.  By this time, there were 8 or 9 of us waiting...it was a hot mess in there.

I went for the Carne Asada Burrito first.  I took one bite and didn't like it...it was way too salty.  The Burrito was all Meat & a little Guac/Salsa combo...no Rice or Beans...that's a common recipe in some of these Taco shops.  Since there wasn't any other ingredients to soften the salty flavor, it was just bad.

Next, I went for the Beans/Rice/Cheese (BRC) Burrito.  I took one bite and that one was bland.  I don't know if my taste buds were shot from the salty Carne Asada Burrito, but it wasn't good either.

The Salsa wasn't *meh* too and couldn't save it for me.  Towards the end of my meal, I noticed a guy speaking in Spanish to the cashier lady...she goes to the back and comes out with a couple of cups of "spicier" Salsa that was hidden in the back...dammit!  Secret menu I guess....

There are too many other good places in town, I won't be back here.
