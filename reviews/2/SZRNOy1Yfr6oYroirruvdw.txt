Atmosphere here is nice, live the Dia de Los Muertos theme they have going. Drinks are good, not much on draft but definitely a place where a majority of Scottsdale can get a taste of a variety of Mexican beer. The food, well the Duck tacos although good the menu should have read "Tapa's" or appetizer's $4 for 1 baby street taco. Not a good deal, not $4 worth either! If I go back ill make sure to eat somewhere else.
