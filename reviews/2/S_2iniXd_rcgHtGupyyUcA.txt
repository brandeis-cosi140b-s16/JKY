Not bad, but not all that great either. Based on previous reviews, I get the sense that Wisconsinites have no idea of what good Mexican food tastes like (probably because most of the Mexican restaurants here suck).

Cheap prices, sure. Flavorful food, no way.

Everything was very bland. Salsa tasted like they opened a can of diced tomatoes and put it in a bowl. Meat in the tacos was under-seasoned. Most food was bland with no flavor. Even the guacamole. When you make guacamole, you need to *at least* add salt and lime (if not add pico de gallo). Tasted like mashed avocado on a plate, no more. Margaritas were good and cheap during happy hour!
