meh. That's the best way to describe this place. Not the worst food out there but definitely not great. I tried the chicken chimichanga. It was perfectly fried, with the outside nice and crispy. But the chicken inside was so bone dry and tasteless that I could barely eat it. The service was decent. Our waitress was friendly and stopped by often to check on us. But the food was just so blah.

This is a totally uninspired review for a totally uninspiring restaurant.
