I've been thinking to try this place for ever. I finally did and I'm sad to report that per my taco standards it's barely OK.

I got 2 al pastor and 2 carne asada tacos. I also ordered the "cuatro" (chips, salsa, guacamole and beans). 

Besides the $21 that this cost me, the food was absolutely uneventful. The tortillas were cold, the beans were lacking flavor, the salsa was meh and the guacamole was average.

The al pastor tacos were kind of sweet and if you've read my comments before, you know that I can't stand the heartbreaking moment when you expect something (because they name their dish the same of something you're craving) and you get something totally different or at least far enough from the real thing.

The carne asada tacos were OK but they had this indescribable green topping that was totally unexpected (in a bad way). I don't know what it was but i believe there was some onion and celery involved. Not authentic at all, at least nothing I've ever seen in Mexico.

Veredict:

If you pass by, it's OK for a quick bite with low expectations, otherwise, I wouldn't crave it.

Cheers.
