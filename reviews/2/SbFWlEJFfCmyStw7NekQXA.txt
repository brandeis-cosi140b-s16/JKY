Very disappointing...

Ive been going to this place for a pretty long time. However, it was when it used to be SuperMex. tonight was my second time visiting there after they changed.  I gota say that I am not happy with the joint. Super mex used to be a great place to get a cheap and delicious bite to eat. But now its gone :( I used to go in there all the time to enjoy some delicious chicken tortilla soup for around 5 bucks.. which was a great deal. the same soup now comes in a smaller bowl and is nearly double to price. I would have to say that 9 dollars for a bowl of soup is kinda ridiculous for a place like that

The first thing I experienced upon walking in the door was the hostess who gave me a menu COVERED in salsa and food. I opened it to find red sauce just running down the page as well as beans all over it. I told her that it was gross and to give me another one.. She then rolled her eyes and walked away with it.. Never to return with a new one. Finally our server comes out (who was the only reason this place didnt get a 1 star rating) and gave me a new one. Our servers name was Lisa and she was awesome. Very nice and very efficient. She even brought out new chips and salsa without having to be asked.. which is a huge bonus for me, as I love chips and salsa.

We then order our food. I had the Mole. The Mole was very generic.. Good.. but generic. The chicken however, was terrible.. It was very tough and chewy, and had alot of fat on it. I bit into a huge chunk of fat and instantly felt sick,  You could tell the chicken was not cooked in the sauce. I would assume it was thawed out, already cooked and was just warmed up, and covered with the sauce. My gf had the enchiladas, which werent bad, but also very generic in my opinion. 

I gota say the only good reason to go there was the chips and the service.. But not for food. Which is sad because its mostly a restaurant.  It is also more expensive by far after the name change. Save your money and go elsewhere.
