I have to agree with the other complaints. I was excited for a Mexican restaurant to be close to my house.  I judge Mexican food by the Chili Rellanos. Theirs was way too hot and I LIKE hot, but CR's are not supposed to be hot. They left the seeds in the Chili Rellanos.  So I am back to driving to the "hood" for real Mexican food!
