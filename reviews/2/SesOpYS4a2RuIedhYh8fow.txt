Very disappointing

I hate giving a restaurant with positive reviews a bad rating so let's start this review off on a positive note.  The service at Taco Mich is quick and the staff is very accomdating, which is why I  feel terrible for saying their food is  bland and poorly presented.   

Taco Mich food isn't so much bad as it is bland, and the presentation of their entr√©es are, I hate to say sloppy and unappetizing. Today my lunch companion and I ordered the taco dish combo and to be honest it just did not taste very good, and the food was lukewarm at best. The color of the beans, rice, and meats are all muted together somewhat like bad cafeteria food.  The tacos were topped with a  combination of cheese, lettuce, and tomatoes  but it all tasted greasy.

 I'm not in a rush to visit Taco Mich anytime soon. I feel that  unpleasant flavors are worse than no flavor at all.
