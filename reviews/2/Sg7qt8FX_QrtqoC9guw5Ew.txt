Roads are good
Service not so good

This place is a tourist trap in every sense of the word. The restaurant and gift shop are overpriced for what you get and the ice cream isn't anything special. Service from the staff needs to be a lot better and treat the customers like you want them there. Always understaffed always waiting on food. Been there a half dozen time no improvement.

Do come to the area for the beautiful views, not for the food or souvenirs. Great road for motorcycles ride.

During the summer outdoor cooking.
