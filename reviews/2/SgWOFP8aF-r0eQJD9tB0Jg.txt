Liked the ambiance which is important. I have eaten at many restaurants and have to say there was some big short comings though.

We tried a number of different items on the menu to share along with a few drinks. Sangria was ok...  nothing special and over priced.

The service was really poor. When I say poor it came in a number of areas from being very slow to an arogent  attitude  to go along with it. When it took over 30 minutes to get our guacamole and chips brought out we asked one of the staff members why it was taking so long. I don't think I have every experienced such a rude way of dealing with customers but the guy was terrible. It was probably the worst way to have handled our inquiry about what was going on.  (can you tell it was not a good experience)


Well the food finally came out  and as a rating on the food I would say it was average.
It consisted of  good quality ingredients and tasted good. But for what it we got... i would say it is  WAY over priced compared to dinning in other City's.

As great as the design of the space was the Presentation of the food  was poor!

I don't know if I had to come again I guess I would ....  but if you looking to try something new....  i would have to say try something different.

I have had much better elsewhere.
