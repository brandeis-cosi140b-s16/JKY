So, I went here cuz I got United miles and Yelp gave it good reviews.  Not so good.  I went with two coworkers.  We were the only three people in the entire restaurant at 6:15 on a Monday night.  I had two Corona's ($3.50 a piece - nice and cheap) and the Vuelva a la Vida, the large one.  It was huge - I couldn't finish it.  I was decent seafood though.  The other two people in my party got the steak fajitas and their meat was cold.  The queso fundido was a tad greasy but ok.  The worst thing about this place was the location.  I walked here from the Las Vegas Hilton and was surrounded by homeless people in the parking lot - kinda scary if you ask me and I'm from the south side of Chicago.  Sorry Las Palmas, I won't be returning.
