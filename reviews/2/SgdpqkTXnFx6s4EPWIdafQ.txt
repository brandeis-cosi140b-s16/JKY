I had high hopes for this place since it's within my pants radius (that is, the distance I'm comfortable traveling from my apartment without feeling like I really need to put effort into getting dressed.)  I think it just opened within the last couple weeks, so I stopped in on Wednesday after I got back from an out of town trip & didn't feel like making dinner.  I just got a basic chicken burrito, no beans, add guac.  

My issues:
-- The tortilla.  This is supposed to be their big selling point, but it's nothing like a real tortilla.  Yes, they press and cook it fresh in front of you.  The one I received was chewy almost to the point of being gummy.  I was not impressed.   
-- The flavors.  I filled my burrito with marinated chicken, pico, hot salsa, lettuce and guacamole.  None of it had any distinct flavor, nor did the salsa have any kick.  

On top of that, there were several employees just standing around while I waited.  When one finally decided to help me, he had to ask what meat I wanted three times since he wasn't paying attention the first two.  My tortilla ripped while they were trying to roll my burrito so they transferred 3/4 of the contents into a new tortilla.  The rest were thrown away with the old tortilla so a quarter of my burrito was lost.  I know I'm being nit-picky here, but nothing seemed to go smoothly.

In general, I just was not impressed.  I'll keep driving the extra mile to Chipotle.
