Service was excellent. Our waitress brought us refills without even asking and always with a smile. The free chips and salsa was decent although the chips were over cooked and salsa was fresh but had no flavor/seasoning. We ordered the enchilada combination platter my spouse said the ground beef was not seasoned, the rice was overly dry as well as the peas mixed in. The random pile of lettuce was fresh but clearly not understood. The refried beans- though clearly out of a can were yummy. The beef fajitas meat was not seasoned, the peppers and onions were good though. The guacamole was decent. The drinks (soda was $2.5x) were a bit much in my honest opinion. I can buy a 1 liter for $1 at most stores right now. I am glad we went with a groupon but will not be returning. If you prefer bland food that served promptly and at a nice temp this is the place for you. I was willing to give it a shot even though they had no queso on the menu.
