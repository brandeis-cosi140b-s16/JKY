I lived in Utah for a long time and loved the Provo location-- I ate there once a week from 2001-2011 and I was so happy when they opened one here, but the staff is so bad I have to psych myself up before I go in. They ask what you want on your salad AS THEY ARE PUTTING IT ON. They don't wait for an answer. 
I regularly get my beans on the side and I'd say 9/10 times they've had to remake my order because they didn't listen. And once they stuck my side of beans--in a styrofoam container-- in my salad to pass down the line  . I'm certain that styrofoam wasn't washed. 
I've complained and asked for someone to call me several times and they never have. If I wasn't nostalgic and loving the pork I'd never go here again.
