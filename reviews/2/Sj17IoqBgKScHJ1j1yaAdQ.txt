Have been to Cocina Mendoza many times.  Food is always consistent: decent Mexican food close to home - this is not a destination restaurant.  Service is the real downfall here.  Service has always been slow, as there is usually only one server (sometimes two) for the whole place.  On the most recent visit: I was never asked if I needed a refill/needed anything, no one cleared our plates, I waited about 20 mins for the check & had to go to the bar to ask for carry-out containers.  The food & atmosphere aren't good enough to make poor service tolerable.
