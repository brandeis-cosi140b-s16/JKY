The service here is really bad. I asked what the soup was and the waiter said "I don't know I think they quit making it". It was only 6:45pm really!  We ordered quacamole it came out fast but had no flavor it might as well been just an avocado. Ordered two margaritas and dinner. The dinner was better but service still sucked our drinks were almost done didn't ask if we wanted another. Finally checked on us and then ask if we needed another drink. We were done eating at this point. I would find another place to spend you're hard earned money this place is not worth it.
