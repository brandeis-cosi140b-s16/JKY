Tried Cafe Rio today. It opened near work a couple of months ago and they haven't seemed to draw much business yet but I gave it a try. 

I ordered a Spicy Pork Barbacoa Burrito (see pic).  Not very exciting and if that was the spicy version, the mild must be really boring. 

They will need to step up their game to draw a crowd or they will go under. Perhaps a better menu on the website, more creative dishes and any level of enthusiasm in their crew, some creative sides, IDK.
