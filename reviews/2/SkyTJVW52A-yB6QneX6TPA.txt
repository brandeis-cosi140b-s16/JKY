No stars for the service, the food prices and soda refill charge. ( I mean, come on it's soda)  and 2 1/2 for food taste and portions. 
Servers are not knowledgeable about menu items and food. We order Jamaica, they didn't have it. I ordered menudo with corn tortilla, they didn't have them either. Settled with bread ($6.85) n my husband chimichanga ($7.50) which it was tasty and huge (great!) 
Ended sharing 1 soda ($2.50ish) and a water. 
You can tell they are always changing prices on menu because they hand write prices on top of old ones. 
Different servers came never the same one. 
No toilet paper in bathroom only hand towels. 
Check came out to $21.50ish...mmm I did the math and both plates n a soda didn't added up to that amount unless they charged water or tip?
No itemized receipt, it only showed total. Maybe tax is high nowadays. 
I really loved the menudo taste tho! No fatty chunks or bones. Just the nice tasty meat! Loved how they give u equal amounts of cilantro and onion. Other places give u tons of onion n few cilantro leaves.
