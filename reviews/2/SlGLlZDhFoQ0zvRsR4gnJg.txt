Underwhelmed after the hyped expectations from the other reviewers. Easy to miss, small store front in strip shopping area. It is relatively quiet except for the game shows on the TVs. Blackboard menu is a little confusing at first. My "server" (counter service only) was very difficult to understand; nice enough. I had some difficulty understanding his questions about how I wanted my food. Forget about drink refills, they serve sodas via bottle or can only. It is inexpensive and the meal was filling. I did not find the offerings particularly interesting or diverse.
