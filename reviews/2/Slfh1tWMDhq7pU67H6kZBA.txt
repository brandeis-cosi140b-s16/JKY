I was so excited when this Cafe Rio opened. It was so much closer to where I live! But every time I go to this location I am always disappointed. They are ALWAYS out of something. Every. Single. Time. 
Their customer service is just sad. They are rude and take forever to help you. One time I waited about thirty minutes to get my food with only two other customers ahead of me. I honestly just drive the extra 15 minutes to the one located on Stephanie. Trust me, the drive is worth it.
