Their food is awesome.  However service is horrible.  I've been twice now and just walked out after waiting an hour for a table.  We were finally seated and then waited over 10 minutes and no one came to our table for a drink order.  Tons of open seats on a Saturday morning for breakfast and very understaffed.  If they could hire a better staff this place would get 5 stars as the food is really good!
