Bring your ear plugs because your going to need them. The place is extremely small and feels over crowded. My friend and I went in to enjoy some seafood, but from the beginning it was a bad experience. We walked in and one of the servers accused us of trying to skip some people that were there before us. We didn't even know who to talk to in order to get on the waiting list. 

After about 10 minutes of wait we were sat down. The table we were setted at next to the door so ever time someone walked it it hit the back of my friend's chair. So we asked to be moved and got an ugly look, but we moved to another table. 

The food is very good just like seafood should be fresh! Everything tasted fresh we had oysters, & tostadas de ceviche (shrimp tostadas.) The micheladas are very good also if your over the age of 21 of course.  

If the music wasn't so loud, I mean having a live band is such a small space is a horrible idea. You can't even hear the person across or next to you speak. This place definitely needs to make some changes before I ever go back.
