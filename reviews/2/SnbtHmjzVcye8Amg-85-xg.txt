I have drove past this place many times and finally decided to stop in. At first glance I was impressed as it is clean, had no funny smells, and bathroom was clean (I always wash my hands before I order). Ordered basic Carne Asada Burrito and my girlfriend order a chimichanga of some sort with rice and beans. After I ordered my food I noticed there was no salsa bar, that sucksc something fierce. Got our food fairly quick and GF asked for salsa which they gave us green and red in ketchup style bottles. My burrito was quite a bit smaller than most Mexican food joints I go to, but I wanted to be positive and thought quality over quantity....well after my 3rd or 4th bite I realized there wasn't much of either, and the salsa was the worst I have ever had (Taco Bell has better salsa). My burrito had more pico in it than anything else. I am use to my carne asada burritos being meaty. My GF said she was not impressed with her food either, and the best thing she had on her plate was the refried beans. I don't think I will be frequenting this place any time soon, as there are a plethora of other options within the area that have quality and quantity. Two stars for cleanliness and food coming out quickly.
