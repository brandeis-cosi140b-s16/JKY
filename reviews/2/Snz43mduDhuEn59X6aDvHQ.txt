Food is good. Service is the worst service I have encountered in a really long time...I'm a server, so it takes a lot for me to say this. Service sucked AND Has ALWAYS sucked. My son loves this place so, I come here often and share fajitas with him and my boyfriend. It takes me everything I have not to get up and start serving myself lol.
