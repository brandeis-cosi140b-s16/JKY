Yeah it's cheap and fast, but I'm sorry, I just don't dig it.  My husband really enjoyed his tacos.  He liked the chips and guac, but I thought the guac was a little weird.

They offer nachos, but they use this weird cheese "sauce" which was super watery.  You can put shredded cheese on top of the nachos, but there is no way to melt it..  Maybe if you put the shredded FIRST, then the cheese water, then the meat then anything else, it might work.  Overall, if you go here, don't get nachos, get the tacos.

I will say that the chicken on my nachos tasted good.  They had reasonable prices on beer and the staff was friendly even when i was grumpy about my food.  

I probably won't be back which will probably make the husband sad, but this was just not my place.
