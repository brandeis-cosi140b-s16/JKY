My family cones here almost every Tuesday. We like Filibertos food, but the wait in line most days is ridiculous! 20 minute waits should not be a thing. Sometimes I'll wait even longer than that even if there is only a few cars ahead of me. Not to mention on my most recent visit I got very very ill after eating the food. And I don't think I'll be stopping by for a while..
