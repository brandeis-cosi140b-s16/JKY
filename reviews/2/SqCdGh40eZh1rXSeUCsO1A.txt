Maybe I'm being to harsh on this place, but as an Mexican this Chipotle like Mexican Grill crap insults me. The meat is meh at best and the rice and beans are horrendous (come on people! this is the foundation to Mexican food).  Proper Mexican food is made with fatty ass cheap meat with excessive seeasoning and about ten pounds of lard! That's the way my daddy did it and that's what keeps me coming for more. But seriously though, when it comes down to it the burrito itself might be good size and tasty in its own right but the price tag is way excessive and in all honesty with Mexican food their is sooo many mom and pop hole in the walls that will give you a much better product and for a much cheaper price.
