After seeing some good reviews for this place I decide to check it out.. It was very disappointed. My boyfriend got some carne asada tacos and they were ok nothing that would make us crave them. While, I got the carne asada burrito and I was very disappointed! The meat was dry, and to make matters worse the salsa bar didn't have many options. Plus, the salsa that was already there looked all watery which didn't make the dry burrito any better. Defiantly not coming again!
