This was my first time at a Se√±or Taco and since I work a mile down the road, I thought I would have a new place to add into my lunch rotation. I was wrong. 

The cashier seemed annoyed that I was taking a while to review the menu. Well I've never been there before and wanted to make sure I checked out everything and despite being really hard to read. I even had my glasses on but found myself squinting to read the board, whomever designed that system wasn't using his thinking cap.  When I finally ordered, I asked for the two taco combo with chicken. I asked a couple questions regarding my order such as what's on tacos and wasn't really given a real answer. I asked if they had sour cream, instead of saying yes or no, I got a "do you want sour cream?" Nope! Then we moved on so I'm still not sure if there's normally sour cream or not.
I asked for flour tortillas but was given corn. I hate corn tortillas. So I ended up just dumping the contents of the tacos into my container and eating it like that. 

The customer service was horrific. The cashier kept pulling her pants up but was getting surprisingly low into her pants to accomplish her task of covering her midsection. No one looked clean and professional. I seriously worry about the cleanliness of the kitchen based on the staff. 

The only reason it's getting 2 stars instead of one. The chicken was fantastic.
