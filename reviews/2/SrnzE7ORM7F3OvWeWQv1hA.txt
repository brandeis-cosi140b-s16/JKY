I had high hopes for Chinita and I really wanted to like it. The service is top notch but the food is another story. Please keep in mind this is only for the three items I ordered maybe the rest of the menu is great. 

The guacamole was a little expensive and small. They don't even make it in front of you. It was also less chunky than I would expect hand made guacamole to be. It tasted store bought. 

I had the white cheese dip appetizer which was slightly bigger than the guacamole . It was good and my favorite out of the three things I ordered. 

The calamari was my biggest disappointment. They were cut in rings which kind of reminded me of fish bait. It was chewy and rubbery and smelled a bit off. I didn't like the idea that after they breaded the calamari they put some type of sweet sauce on it. It made the breading soggy. The sauce on the side would have been fine there is no need to over sauce the dish. I only ate two bites and the rest I couldn't stomach. The waitress asked if everything was alright but I didn't have heart to say the food was lousy because everyone was really nice.
