Was visiting the area....my friend chose this place.

I was going to order the fish tacos, until I asked the waiter what they put on the fish tacos and he was like: "Uhhhhhhh...."
me: "Do you put anything on the fish? White sauce? Red sauce? Salsa?"
waiter: "Oh yeah. Salsa."

Uhhhhhh....nevermind. (I guess you can only get good fish tacos in Cali.)
So I ordered the carne asada tacos. You can't mess that up, right? WRONG. It was the driest meat I have ever tasted. And then they loaded that dry ass meat with tons of cilantro. ugh. It was sort of like I was eating a cilantro salad with tiny pieces of meat mixed in.

The only reason I am giving this place two stars is because everyone I was with seemed to like their food. If I was basing the stars just on my food it would definitely be a ONE star joint.
