I always come in here hoping for a better experience than the last, but they always disappoint. Yes the food is good but the service is terrible. The staff is never friendly and they make you feel like you are bothering THEM by ordering a meal. I've never had a positive friendly experience in this location, which is sad, because that's what keeps me away.
