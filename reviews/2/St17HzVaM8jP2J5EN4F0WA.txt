I don't speak Spanish so I'm not sure that my girlfriend's translation of La Parilla Suiza to English as "Our food tastes like when you throw up in the back of your mouth" is correct. We had some chicken enchiladas with green sauce on the recommendation of our server. Being a gringo I expect my enchilada to be a corn tortilla filled with some gooey melted cheese and if ordered with, some meat. These were corn torts with a dab of chicken inside them, topped with a green sauce that had no heat but a lot of twang. Though given the flavor of the enchiladas I was happy that there wasn't much there. 
As for the service, we didn't see him again after the food was delivered until done and ready for the check. The carafe of water left on the table appeared to be a Star Trek collectible as it had food particle klingons. But hey, no server to complain to so I guess all is good.
