Everything is OK, but the prices are high in correlation to the food quality.  The bloody mary and the guac both looked promising, but left a lot to be desired.  We went for the Cinco de Mayo street festival, but opted to grab seats at the bar because there were only 4 tables outside and no seating, plus the music was deafening.  The servers at the bar were nice and prompt.  The Rio Grande Pancho Verde Chile Cerveza on draft was quite good.
