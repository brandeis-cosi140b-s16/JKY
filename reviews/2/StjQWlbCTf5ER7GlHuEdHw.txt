The food was great! But I came for the first time ever on June 5th for my bday with my fiancé and kids. He had us wait outside and told them it was my birthday when I wasn't able to hear him tell them. Happy Birthday was sung to other tables and it was never sung to me. Now I didn't expect it. But my fiancé was super disappointed. He wanted me to feel special.
