I was visiting the Phoenix area and ate lunch at Los Rubios.  It was OK.  I was looking for authentic tacos.   I ate the asada and carnitas.  They were larger than street tacos with pico de gallo and guac.  The salsa was not very hot (disappointing).  It was in a tiny plastic container.  I needed to ask for more.  Overall flavor was OK.  I did like the roasted serrano chile.  It added the heat I was looking for.

The tables all needed cleaning when I arrived.  It was about 2:30 p.m., so this may reflect the post lunch condition.  The next time I visit, I will likely try a different place.
