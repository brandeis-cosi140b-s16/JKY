nothing special about this place.  I just happened to be on this side of town, and I remembered hearing about FAT BOY boygers.. Well it was a huge disappointment.  I just got the Double Boyger, with Fat Fries..  daughter got the wings (tasted ALL tapatio).  Maybe other things are good on the menu, but i wasn't impressed. Service was really slow, but they were very attentive and made sure you were taken care of while you waited for your food.  I probably won't be going back, but if I ever do.. I will have to try the Pastrami, or something else on their menu.  Oh, and we also tried to Chenco fries.. which wasn't bad, but not worth the money.
