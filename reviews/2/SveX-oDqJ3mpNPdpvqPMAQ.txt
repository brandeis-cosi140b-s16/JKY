We used to love this place and will often ride bikes here with our 2 kids when weather is nice and order to go. Sadly, after last nights visit for a simple bean burrito, we will no longer support this location. 

Asked for a bean burrito with "just a little bit of cheese". I wish I was able to capture a picture because it was kids size despite the tortilla being gigantic. It was filled with like 60% cheese, 40% bean and then the tortilla was over folded. I basically just had to rip half the tortilla off because it alone was not worth eating, and then once I bit into the burro it was just a bite of cheese half melted mess, no bean until bite 3. Gross.

This ONE burrito is all ordered, since I'm sick at the moment and my husband was trying to be nice and get me the one thing I felt I could eat. I couldn't even finish the darn freezer sized burrito. 

Then as I'm eating my husband told me how there was a family of 6 that came in after him and they got their food to go before him. Seriously?! That is not cool. We have had other bad experiences and just shrugged it off but I think this might have to be our last experience here. Poor service to friendly, easy to please people, is one thing, having it happen every other time you seem to go is a bit much. Such a shame.
