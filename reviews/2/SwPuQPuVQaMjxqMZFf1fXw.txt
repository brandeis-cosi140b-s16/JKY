Great location. They should do more with it. Food is standard Mexi-American, nothing notable, really. Asked for hot salsa, got something passably decent. Margarita was most, if not all, syrup. No tang or booze. Too sweet to even finish. Ordered a cheese crispy, expecting sizzling hot cheese and, well, crispy. Nope. Plenty of cheese, but soggy tortilla and the middle wasn't even melted. Service, ok, not great. If you've ordered, you'll never see the waiter again. Overall: meh.
