I usually come here for the chicken salad, which I really enjoy.  The idea of a good salad in a Mexican establishment is great and I would still return to have one, however, I strayed last night and had a carne asada burrito.  Sadly, the meat was really bad. No taste and the pieces were way too big and full of stringy gristle. I had to throw the meat out of my burrito. Other than that, the rest of the ingredients were good, and of course their salsa station is really good.  So my advice: have something other than the carne asada here, and you should be ok. The staff is always nice and other than the carne issue, thumbs up!
