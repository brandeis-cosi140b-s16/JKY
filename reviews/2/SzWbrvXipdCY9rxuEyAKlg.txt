Womp womp. I'm hoping this was just a fluke, but our service was so bad! I've read other yelpers that seem to have had the same issue. Get it together Round Corner Cantina! Our waitress had attitude and barely ever came to our table. When we asked if she could split our check she flat out said no and looked like she was so annoyed that we had the nerve to ask. She then said we could do the math ourselves and we could pay with two cards. She may have been overworked with too many tables which I can totally sympathize with, but her attitude was what really turned me off. 

Other than the poor service, the food was good. Their guacamole is delicious and their margaritas are also a nice treat! I ordered La Chiquita Sarita margarita...it was corrale jo, orange juice, lime, and diced strawberries. It was a little overpriced though. $8 for a small mason jar that was mostly ice. The tacos are also a little overpriced. $7-$8 for two tiny tacos. 

This is one of those situations where I want to love this place so bad, but they broke my heart and I just can't do it! :(
