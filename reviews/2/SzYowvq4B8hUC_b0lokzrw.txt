My boyfriend and I were passing through town and stopped for lunch here. The food was absolutely bland, as if they forgot to season it at all! The chile relleno was like nothing I've ever had---I actually considered not eating it for fear of getting sick later, but I was starving and a tourist in a small town. Also, the service was pretty much non-existent. 

The good news? I didn't get sick, but I will certainly never be back and wouldn't recommend it to anyone!
