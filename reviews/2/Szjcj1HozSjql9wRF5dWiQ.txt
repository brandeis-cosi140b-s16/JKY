Cashier at a retail store over heard my nephew and I talking about wanting some Carne Asada Super Nachos. She recommended Faustos and swore up and down that it was great. I always go to Pepe's for my Super Nachos fix because their meat and beans are very tasty and the use of melted nacho cheese (like the kind you find at gas stations) makes theirs #1 in my book but we figured we'd give this joint a shot. The food was not bad at all but ok at best, the atmosphere was clean and festive and the employees were nice but this reminded me of a knock off Roberto's, which I dont care for much.
