I'm sad to have to give this a bad review because I really wanted to like it. The service is so slow and unpleasant here, which doesn't make any sense as a new restaurant. It makes sense to still be getting it together, but when there's multiple tables looking visibly annoyed, you need to be at least a little apologetic when it takes 15 minutes to even have your order taken or 90 minutes to get through a meal.

I will say that the queso and the green sauce are good, but it everything else was shockingly bad. Started out strong with fries with queso and green chile, but the burrito was awful. The red sauce is terrible, the calabacitas are bad and the rice is practically mashed potato consistency. It came out completely cold, but no one ever appeared to tell them about it so we were out of luck there. 

I might give it one more try and order something else (and stick to green chile), but if I feel like I'm bothering the employees by even existing then it'll be a loss.
