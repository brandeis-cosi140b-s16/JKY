The food at Big Burrito isn't that bad but they have a lot of work to do.  I cannot think of a reason to visit this establishment over the other Mexican fast food joints.

I ordered the enchilada and burrito combo with carnitas.  The pork was diced as opposed to shredded and it was not very tasty.  To their credit, though, the portions were fair and I did not leave hungry.

The folks do a good job of keeping the place clean which is not the norm at other places I've been to.

If you're already in the area and in need of nourishment, Big Burrito is not a bad option.  Just don't expect anything special.  It's edible.
