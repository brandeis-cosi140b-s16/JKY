Overall, I was not impressed. The chips were stale and flavorless, the salsa was not chunky, and my meal was so...lackluster. I ordered the Flautas Plate...which consisted of two, what seemed like microwaved, chicken flautas, rice, beans and some guacamole. The flautas were more like taquitos that you buy in the freezer section, the rice was good and was really the only thing I enjoyed, the beans were standard re-fried and the guacamole was quite bland. The other three people I was with all ordered burritos and really enjoyed their meal...so I'm thinking the flautas are not the shining star at Restaurant Mexico.
