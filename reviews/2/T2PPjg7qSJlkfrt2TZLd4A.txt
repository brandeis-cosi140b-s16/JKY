My review for this restaurant will be simple and to the point.

As my friend and I entered the establishment, I checked my phone and found it to be exactly 6:15. Why did I check my phone? The intent was purely innocent, I assure you. I suppose it just happened to coincide with my entrance into the restaurant. We chatted between ourselves, both of us being fairly patient individuals, and both of us restaurant workers ourselves, making us doubly more thick skinned to bad experiences. 

Minutes pass; we are not greeted or acknowledged by a soul. More minutes pass, we begin to change our posture, to accommodate the awkward transition from entryway to dining table. Finally, an attractive young woman comes up to us with a friendly smile and leads us to our table, located next to the bar. We exchange relieved looks, after both mentally contemplating an exit stage left only moments before. The time is 6:22.

As we take a seat, the restaurant appears to be around 1/4 capacity. The temperature, lighting and music levels are appropriate. We begin to read our menus, becoming much more anticipatory of a good meal after reading some of the descriptions. More time passes, we remain ungreeted by our future server. Finally, the girl who sat us approaches, smile exhausted, and takes our order. Chips and salsa was decent, refills were far and in between. Fast forwarding, our soups arrive. They are out of this world. The Consome de Pollo and Sopa de Tortilla. Much more time passes, our entrees arrive. Both entrees were bland and uninspired, leaving both my friend and I with an empty void in both our stomachs and our wallets. Price was intermediate but overpriced for our experience. Time of exit: 7:45. 

I would not recommend La Parrilla Suiza based on our experience. I have talked with many others with the same experiences (slow service and great soups), so I am relieved to find that my often obligatory second visit may be skipped in this particular scenario.

Thanks for reading!
