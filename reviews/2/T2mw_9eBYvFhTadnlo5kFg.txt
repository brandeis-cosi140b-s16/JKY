I usually am a fan of Moe's for chain southwestern food! I'd just recommend a different location- like the one in the Northlake area.

For a Moe's I was incredibly disappointed with this location. The staff were grumpy, the soda machine was out of ice (I guess the machine breaks randomly?), and they were out of tofu.
