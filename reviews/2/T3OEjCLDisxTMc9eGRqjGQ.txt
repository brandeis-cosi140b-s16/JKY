I want to start off by saying I can't judge nor comment on anyone elses review, however I will advise anyone thinking of eating at this paticular location to get your food to go. 
There are constanly people around this location that look suspicious. 

The trash bins and bathrooms were or perhaps still are filled with graffiti.

I had the $0.99 chicken tacos, and they were atrocious. They mask some horrible food with cheap prices. If you go to the location on Durango, the tacos taste fresh and crunchy not stale and flavorless.

My friend ended up getting a carne asada burrito and was on point so maybe the next time I come in the food will be better and the restaurant will look cleaner.

The staff was pretty much on point but that can't compensate for bad food.
I speak fluent spanish so communication is not a problem.

Maybe next time Roberto.
