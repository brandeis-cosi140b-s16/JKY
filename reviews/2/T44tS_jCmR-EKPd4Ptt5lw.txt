The food was decent but DAMN there's a lot of salt in them 'taters!
It was 113 degrees out and after a meal at Taco Time I started hallucinating from dehydration.

DO NOT go to the Taco Time off the Blue Diamond Road exit off the 15 South. If you do, it'll never be Taco Time again for you. It's not that the food was bad... or different from other Taco Times.... It was the atmosphere. Generally I love a good truck stop, but this is NOT one of those cool kitchy truck stops. Besides the multi-bulbed CASINO sign, there's nothing kitchy about this place.

It's just dirty and gross and you'll have no appetite once you get a look at the dining room.
