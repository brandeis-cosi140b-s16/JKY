I really wanted to like this place.  The food is ok, not spectacular.  The prices for main dishes is reasonable.  We've been twice and both times my wife had ordering problems.  She prefers her enchilada in a flour tortilla and they absolutely refused to do it.  The second time we decided to get Chimichaungas.  We asked them to be enchilada style and they wanted an additional $3 for that...That seemed out of whack.  They finally agreed to do it for a dollar.  Also, if you eat in you get free chips but not if you take out.  So that became an argument.  The chimi's had decent flavor but lacked filling.  I would agree to under seasoned food.  Though we probably won't return I don't think it is awful.  Hopefully they will read the comments on here and make some adjustments to price.
