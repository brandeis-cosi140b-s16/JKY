My first time at this particular location and first time ordering online with out having to wait when I got there.......So I thought.  

I placed my pick time for 3:45pm. Upon my arrival , at 3:45pm, there was one person at the register.  I completely understand that the cashier had to take care of the person before me.  I was asked if I was here for pick.  Then was told my order would be ready in a few minutes. I expressed my disappointment and was given an excuse. 
A young crew working and some harmless flirting with other costumers while my order was being made. A young gentleman came out who I believe was the manager gave his apology and said would speak to his team. 

My order was ready, 10 minutes later.  Same amount of time if would have walked in rather than ordering online.
