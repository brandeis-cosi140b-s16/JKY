A few of us from work had talked about trying this restaurant and finally decided to do so.  At first it was the price that shocked us, but based on what we'd heard, we thought it would be worth it.  It really wasn't. 

The items we ordered were not at all correct (carne asada was missing from a carne asada quesadilla) and the size of the items we selected were not big at all.  The tacos were street-taco sized for the price of a standard taco and were so soggy (and cold) I had to eat it with a spoon.  

The flavor was definitely there.  Everything was very flavorful.  However, the service and the quality were not. 

Los Taquitos & Some Burro are both just on the other side of the freeway and so much better.
