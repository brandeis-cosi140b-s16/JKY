We live nearby and eat here 1 or 2 times per month. We usually find it enjoyable. Went there last night and not surprisingly with summer in full force, there were few other customers. Nevertheless our server managed to find other things to do besides take care of us. She had a bit of an attitude also....not what we usually get here. Disappointing.
