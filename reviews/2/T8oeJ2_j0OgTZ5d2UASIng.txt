Okay, I consider myself a huge fan of Mexican food... We drove 17 miles for this place. Shoulda saved the gas and money. The waiter did give us 5 dollars off. Anyway, the queso fundido was awesome. The bean dip with the chips is flavorless. We got the famous flaming fajitas!!
Pork and chicken. Chicken was okay..pork was horrible nasty dark fatty chunks. The fajitas were not seasoned in any way. I got the veggies with mine and took one bite... Ugh no flavor either. Tried salt and pepper didn't help. Also how can you mess up fideo soup?!? I don't know but theirs is no bueno. Was really hoping for a great fajita place but not here!!
