Service here was exceptional, the hostess showed us to our table quick, waitress came by quick and told us how the restaurant is (small portions), recommended what was good, and even the manager popped out of no where to offer some club soda to my friend when he got some sauce on his shirt, for the first time being here, that was great, sorry to all who had a bad waiter/waitress 

BUT....the food is just bad, terrible, overpriced Chinese/Mexican food that you hoped would at least taste good, but nah, I ordered wonton noodle soup, so honestly how do you screw this shit up, like I said this place is overpriced, I could have ordered the same bowl 5 times with tip at my local cafe...AND it would taste better lol.....place is bad for food, come here for.....the people? ha
