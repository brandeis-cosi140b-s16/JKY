Had wanted to try after spending nights @ Money Plays next door. Prob should have come here after drinking and would have tacked on additional stars. Not so much when sober during lunch. 

I grabbed a taco salad to bring back to the office when working around there. Took quite a while for what i got and considering I was the only patron in the place. 

What killed it was the extremely stale red and green dyed chips. They also forgot the beans I asked to be added. Would give this place and miss and aim higher.
