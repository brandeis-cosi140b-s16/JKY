This place is more inconsistent than outright bad.  It is more authentic than the fast food joins that claim to be Mexican or MadMex.

Our most recent visit was during the lunch rush (mistake numero one) and our party of four all ordered the same dish with a different protein (mistake numero dos).  The chips were not deal-breaker stale, but I refused to try to Guac since 1) the gentleman was only wearing one glove and 2) not a big fan of avocado.  A good (we did have fun talking and mingling in the loud quarters) forty five minutes passed before our meals arrived which turned the table into an eating frenzy since we were stretching the definition of a lunch hour.

Mistake numero tres was made then we asked for separate checks.  Apparently our overburdened (to her defense, the house was PACKED) waitress didn't catch our request right off the bat when we first sat down.  After fifteen minutes of muttering in Spanish (which BTW I'm from Puerto Rico so I really didn't appreciate what was muttered) we all got our checks.

At first I was going to give it a one-star.  But my burrito and the rice with beans were really good so I would return for the food itself.  The service and the timing of our visit ... those left it wide open for improvement.
