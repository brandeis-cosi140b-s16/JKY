The portions were really small here. Maybe I'm spoiled back at home. Anyways, I find that Chipotle is a little bland but, this food was really bland. My chips were very stale. I'm surprised that I didn't chip a tooth! I went around lunch time during the week. The wait wasn't too long, checking out was a breeze and the dining area was clean for the most part.
