This review is for the location on Gilbert Road. 

First, I LOVE the food here. I always order Posole to go in addtion to a regular full breakfast.  

Although I love the food, I'm really over the service and the time it takes to get the meal. Twice I've been here where I ordered the food and it took 45 minutes to get my scrambled egg combo.  They were not busy and only had one other 2-top table in front of me.  I've also been waiting for my food and seen call ahead people come in and wait more than 30 minutes for an order they called ahead for!  

I can hear and see the ladies in the kitchen so I know someone is back there, but they are so SLOOOW it's crazy.


If this place can get their service and timing down it'll be a huge hit and a big money maker. If the food continues to take as long to come out, I'll be finding another breakfast place soon.
