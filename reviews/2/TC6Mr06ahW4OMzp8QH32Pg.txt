First, let me address the reviewers ahead of me that had a problem with "salsa in a squeeze bottle."  - You haven't been eating Mexican food very long, have you?? - or in Mexico.  Get a clue, people! The concept of chunky salsa in a bowl on the table is a fairly new. I  remember trips to Mexico where not a salsa dish could be found, so if you want "authentic" - the "salsa" in the squeeze bottle was what all my friends had on their family table when growing up in the 70's. Now.....with that said, I am always enthusiastic about an authentic family-owned Mex restaurant, but Pepe's was just mediocre. The service was friendly.....until they had a family party of 16 to prioritize, and service slowed to a crawl.  Also, that family "event" was so noisy a few feet from us that we could not converse and grew impatient to leave. 
Margaritas - our server enthusiastically claimed he "makes the best in Phoenix." If you tell me that, you had better start with fresh limes and not a mix. Bummer, it was a mix, and not great tequila. Mediocre.  I LOVE mole, so I ordered the #14 - chicken mole enchiladas. Their "award" on the wall claims "Best  mole in Phoenix" ....but that was 2000. I'm not sure what happened in 12 years, but the mole was "blah." Mole has nearly 30 ingredients in it so the flavors are usually complex. This was just......nothing. Not sweet, not smoky, not spicy - and l left me longing for Frank and Lupe's. Normally, I will give a place more than one visit before reviewing, but I have no intention of coming back here.
