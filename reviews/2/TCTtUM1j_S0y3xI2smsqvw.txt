So happy they got their liquor license back but wish the bartender/ server knew what a Cadillac or perfect margarita was. Had to order from the margarita menu & buy an extra shot of tequila to offset the strong sweet  sour mix. They have the best smooth/ taco sauce but not provided. Chips were cold like out of a bag. I requested extra garnish with my red chili burro, barely got normal amount but didn't get a chance to ask for more, she dropped food and left quickly and did not see her again until we were done. There were 2 occupied tables, maybe she was busy doing side work. I have been to the other Manuel's locations and the service and food is always great.
