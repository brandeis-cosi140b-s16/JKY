We heard about this place and decided we had to try it out. Drove way the hell out Craig in N Vegas to find it. Place is dark inside and decorated with a cross between Mexican Revolutionary and Farmer. Staff was very friendly and actually very good. We ordered appetizer of the Quesadilla that was damn good. Also the chips, salsa and bean dip that was great as well. I had the Enchilada, Taco and Burrito combo. This was good, only drawback was kinda room temperature, not hot. The parts that I ate were very tasty. Scary when the meat is only room temperature, so doubtful that I will return.
