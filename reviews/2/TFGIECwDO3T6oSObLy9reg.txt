Okay, so the food was actually pretty good in my book. Some things were overpriced ($12 guacamole), and some things were tiny ($9 gorditas), and some things were different than the waiter described ($9 tortilla soup), but the overall experienced was made TERRIBLE by the SLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWWWWW service. 

45 minutes to bring the food out. Really? Not when the restaurant is 1/2 empty...unacceptable Diego.
