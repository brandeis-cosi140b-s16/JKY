The food for a Taco Shop is Ok... I got 3 bean and cheese burritos for almost 16$ That's pretty dam pricey if u ask me. I didn't look at the price when ordering so shame on me , but when I got to the window and she took my $ I then asked how much burritos were she said 4.48$ each , shocked and stunned at the price still I didn't have time to do the math in my head , I get my food .. Confused , I pull over to see the menu and BEAN Burritos are 3.15$ cheese is .95 so that equals 4.10$ .. Where did she get 4.48$ ?? And how did it end up 16$ ?!?!  Long story short , BEAN and CHEESE burritos are not on the menu , cheese is a extra cost.  The burrito it's self isn't bad and isn't the best ... Bottom line - do the math before u order cause they don't . I will not be going there again , I can get way better 5$ bean and cheese somewhere else !
