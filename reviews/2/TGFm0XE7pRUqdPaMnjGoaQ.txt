I really really wanted to love this place. Based on the culinary credentials alone, I should. I'll start with the positives then we'll move on, because, that's what Yelp's all about, right? And, you are entitled to completely ignore me anyway. Ok, so we ordered the Beef Red Chile entree & the Green Chile Pork, & Verde Salad. The salad was amazing. Crisp greens, chunks of avocado & healthy vine ripened tomatoes. There is no way you will find that goldmine of organice veggies at Tuli/Juli/Fili Berto's whatever the freak the name is. Cilantro Lime dressing: divine. 

Red Chile Beef perfect. Flour tortillas - can I just slather these with some butter, add a glass of milk, & call it a day? Ok, here goes with the rest.

Green child pork - the texture of the pork literally melted in your mouth. 

the sauce was good but it reminded me too much of Indian Curry & this is why - you guys Pleeeeez lay off the cumin.  Almost all of the food is just soaking in it. The beans taste like sweet barbecued cumin pods.  I'm guessing fans of truly authentic Mexican will not appreciate this. the rice was ok but, again, sorry, I'm used to my Tia's orange-y chicken broth-y moist Spanish rice & this is just too drastic of a departure. Even the chips; they remind me way too much of Frito Lay, not My Nana's. I suppose if you are looking for Mexican Cuisine or Mexican/Tex Mex, you will love this place. to the chefs; if that's not what you're aiming for, I hope you won't hate this post & instead, make some tweaks because this place has great potential. you are VERY close on the salsa, it could be a little spicier & it would be killer. The location is great, the interior is adorable & the staff extremely friendly.
