So damn bland. The chips were nothing spectacular although i'll admit to the speed at which they were served. The atmosphere was loud and very fitting for the hard rock hotel but everything left me with buyers remorse. Drinks were $12 and for that price - yes, i expect mediocrity. The margaritas were weak. Weaker than weak. What a bummer - because you need to get a buzz going to at least tolerate the tacos which were too soggy to stomach (if they were able to make it into the mouth before falling apart into a pathetic pile of questionable ingredients). Flavors were unspectacular and as my father said "like an expensive version of Chilis." Save yourselves the frustration of a costly letdown.
