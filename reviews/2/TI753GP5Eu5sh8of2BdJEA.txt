OK. I don't usually update reviews after being contacted by the owner but since I didn't sample the food I'll give them the benefit of the doubt.

Cons:
- Not veggie-friendly (way too many meat heavy dishes on the menue)
- Smelly (chemical) water feature outside would make outside dinner near it not so appealling

Pros:
- Plenty of parking
- Attentive staff
- Fondness for bats
- Locally owned and operated

It wasn't what I wanted and apparently they're not going the chain route so my judgement is held in check...for now.  :)
