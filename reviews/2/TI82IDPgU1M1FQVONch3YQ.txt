I never like to give a low star review, but my experience at Diego Pops was pretty worthy of it. I came late, around 9:30 on a weekend night, and sat down with a friend who was already there. I didn't even see our waitress for fifteen minutes, but luckily the manager came by to drop off my friends drink and took my order. I also had to order my food with the drink runner because the waitress was MIA. But that's not what annoyed me, what really got me was that after we got our food, our waitress came literally every 5 to 10 minutes asking "you ladies doing alright?". Yes, yes we are. Just like we were 5 minutes ago. She came about ten times in a 45 minute period, and it made me mad honestly. I am having a conversation with my friend and am constantly being interrupted by this girl. It was rude and it made us feel rushed, even though the restaurant wasn't full and plenty of people had come in after us to eat so it's not like we were the last ones. I will say the only reason that I didn't give this place one stars was because I thought the manager (female, brunette) was being attentive and involved just the right amount with all the tables. The food was mediocre, the Brussel sprout nachos were good but the guac had way, way too much lime in it, it was inedible. Good luck diego pops, but I won't be back.
