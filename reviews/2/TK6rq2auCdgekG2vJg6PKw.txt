Stopped in for lunch, service was good but the food, was simply the worst representation of mexican food I've had in a long time. 

Had a chicken chimi with a "mystery" red sauce that was "ok" at first, but the harder I tried to like it, the worse it got. By the time I got halfway through, I just had to stop. The middle of the chimi was bit soft and doey and seemed undercooked, the chicken was fine but the sauce and the undercooked shell was just yucky. 

Other people there pushed away an enchilada and a funny look on their face, saying, sorry man, you pick where to eat next time.  

I ate at the Desert Ridge location before, had the wings there, but nothing remarkable. I don't see myself returning here for food. Probably an okay place to hang out at the bar for a drink, but doubtful I'll be back for that much. 

Just not a good vibe here, and two for two "meh" experiences.
