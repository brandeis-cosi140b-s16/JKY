My husband and I have been eating at El Valle for years and went at least once per month, using a coupon over half of the time.  My husband usually chooses from the combination plates and I get a large sopa de pollo, big enough for two meals for me and priced about $7.00.  There has NEVER been a problem using a coupon for the soup as it is large enough for an entr√©e and certainly too big to be considered an appetizer.  Last night we placed our usual order; however, when we went to pay, we were told that the coupon was not good for the soup.  When we explained that it has always been accepted, the manager was sent to our table.  He was arrogant to say the least and just short of rude.  He said that the coupon is never accepted for the soup, that he didn't "know who we talked to" and that he is "the only one who can make that decision".  As I said, we've been using the coupon for the soup for a long, long time and it has never been questioned by any of the wait staff.  He only wanted to talk with my husband and did not want to make eye contact with me.  I told him we would pay for the soup but we would not be back - the cost of the soup is minimal but his attitude was inexcusable.  What ever happened to the customer being right?  He should have offered to accept the coupon this time but explain that it wouldn't be honored again for soup.  In fact, my husband suggested that, and he refused emphatically.  I don't think he realized that he was running off long standing and loyal customers.  Even though I think the food is just adequate (with the exception of the soup), the staff has always been polite, the margaritas are good  and it has been my husband's favorite Tex-Mex restaurant.  We live in the Cotswold area so it takes us about fifteen minutes to drive - longer in late afternoon traffic.  We will miss going there but we would rather spend our money (with or without coupons) somewhere where we are treated with respect.
