STAY AWAY.  It takes HOURS to get served and receive drinks, apps, food, check!!! Bummer....we wanted to like this place!!  We miss our Miami and Tampa Cuban food!  Service is AWFUL due to one server for about 20 tables this Saturday afternoon. Perhaps it's better in the evening with more help??!  We could have flown to Havana, ate, and returned based on the time it took to order, get drinks, get food......yikes.
