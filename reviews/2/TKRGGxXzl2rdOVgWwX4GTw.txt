I went here because I saw how many positive reviews it had and I wish I could say what they are saying but I don't agree. The food was a lil expensive for what I was getting. The food itself wasn't all that impressive either. I ordered the Hash Brown burrito and it was a mess. It had bacon, sausage, hash browns, sour cream. and eggs. I wish that every bite I had would have all of those things. I would have already ate half the burrito and I'm barely starting to taste the bacon. I really wanted to like this place but I can't. I rather stick with Filibertos that's across the street.
