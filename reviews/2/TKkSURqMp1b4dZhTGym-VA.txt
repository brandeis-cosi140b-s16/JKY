Multiple times have I asked for something and I don't get it (tortillas on the side), or i don't ask for something and I get charged for it!
So sad, makes me not like Chipotle!! 
Hopefully you don't get stuck there at a busy time! You'll end up with someone else's meal!
I work at Scottsdale Quarter right across the street. What I thought was convenient is a disappointment.
