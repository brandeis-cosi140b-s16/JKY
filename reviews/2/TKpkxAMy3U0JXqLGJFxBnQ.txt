Liked it for years. the food is still good but they keep raising prices. I live close by on Power and on SS $. Seems every time I go there the prices have been raised, like 50 cent increase in Margo's twice in the past 2 yrs.... we on SS don't get that kind of increase in our SS $$. So I will still go but only have a coke and still eat the Comp. chips, salsa, and beans. I would love to have a Margo but they raised prices too high.. I'll have my Margo when I get home.. :-) also, they went from hand made margo's to machine's which make a watery margo, ICK !! I didn't order a Slushy, I ordered a Margo !!!  You would think a mex bar & grill would make a good margo.. NOT !!  and they don't realize we don't make the kind of $ they do..   even to be able to shut down on Sunday's.. on our $$$$//
