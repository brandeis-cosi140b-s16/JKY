I came here at the beginning of the dinner rush and it was a surprise to see the service be sub-par.  The individual making the bowls and burritos was making the food and as we walked up to the counter, he did not greet us or anything but rather started working on a to-go order. This is awkward, but he could have said "hey, I'll be right with you folks" and maybe mention he would be with us in a few minutes.   The cashier was stressed, likely due to the busy crowd at the time. 

Ambiance:  Again, typical Chipotle. This location brings in quite a bit of people. 

This location would earn more stars if the service was adequate.
