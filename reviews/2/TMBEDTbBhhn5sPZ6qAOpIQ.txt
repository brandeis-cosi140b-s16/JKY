I have a rule about Mexican restaurants.  The first time I visit, I always order their tacos.  If the tacos are good, I can usually count on being able to find other items on the menu I'll also like.

A couple of weekends ago, we arrived at Cafe Posada just after 11am on a Sunday morning.  The interior of the restaurant was nice and much more spacious than it looks from the outside.  Since it was still early, we were the second table seated for the day.  The servers were friendly and attentive.

I ordered shredded beef tacos.  After a few minutes, our plates came out to the table.  The plates were hot and the rice and beans were pretty tasty.  However, the tacos didn't cut it.  It seemed like the shredded beef was leftover from the day before and as if all the flavor had been cooked out of it.

So my dilemma is, the atmosphere and service were good but the food was really bland.  I'm still deciding if I'll give Cafe Posada another shot. Maybe I'll head back on a Friday evening.
