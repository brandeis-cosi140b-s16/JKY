The service at the bar is always very good but man, the food just sucks. 

I think they share the same "Mexican" food as the buffet. Only difference is that it's put together by somebody and then served to you. 

I've eaten here on at least four separate occasions because I like to give the benefit of the doubt. Well one things for sure, sticking to drinks only from now on unless they do a complete menu overhaul.
