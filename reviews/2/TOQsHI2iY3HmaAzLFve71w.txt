So I really really really wanted to love this place. I live in the area and appreciate great Mexican food.  

My husband and I went the first time and it was awesome. Chips/salsa the bomb. His carne asada burrito amazing. My potato tacos delicious. 

The second time we went my husband ordered the same exact burrito - carne asada. The meat was not the same. It was a ground meat? We asked about it and they said they had recently changed it. 

I went back today. For a business lunch order. 6 people. I ordered a little bit of everything, which included two orders of chips and salsa and five orders of guacamole. They did not send the chips/salsa or guac, or plates, silverware, napkins etc. Since the meeting was in the area, I called them and spoke with the manager and I explained that part of my order was missing. He said he'd deliver it within about 1/2 hour. 

About an hour and a half later nothing. I called again. The manager asked me if he could just give me a credit. I said no, I prefer the food to be delivered as promised. Then he asked me what time they close. That shouldn't matter considering the food should all have been there 2 hours ago. Then he begrudgingly agreed to deliver it. 

I don't know about you, but I understand it was a simple mistake, which would have normally been fine. The problem was the attitude and lack of follow through. Not to mention this was a pretty large-sized order. If this is the service they give to a customer who spends a lot, I can't imagine the service you'd get for 2. 

No thank you El Burro. I'll go eat my Mexican food at some of the other great places in the city like La Palapa, Casa Reyna or Las Velas, where they appreciate you.
