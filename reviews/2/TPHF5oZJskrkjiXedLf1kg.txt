We were excited to hear of a new tapas restaurant in the neighborhood.  We stopped in excited to try this place before heading to a show, only to walk in and discover it felt like nothing more than a PT's kind of vibe.  We sat down at the bar to order a drink and dine, the bartender had a bit of an attitude letting us know she was very busy (but the place didn't seem that bad!), we finally ordered one drink, but the bartender took so long to come back that we were so turned off by the place, we never even ordered food....
