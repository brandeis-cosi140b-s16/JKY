First time in this location. I've ordered crispy tacos take away. When I got home and open the bag it dripped unbelievable amount of oil. On the sofa and on my clothes. The tacos was soaking wet with oil. But the pickled carrots are good.
Don't order crispy tacos! 
I love Robertos tacos but not this location.
