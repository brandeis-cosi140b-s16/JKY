Food is great. Came 2 times in 1 week. Both times though...Juanita has bad customer service. Asked her for some things like chips and water cups and she said ok and never gave them to us. She moved on to the next people so we had to ask someone else. Today we are here again and she brought us our food and didn't say a word. Just flopped it down on the table. Didn't ask whose food was whos. We were flip flopping dishes around giving whoever had that certain food theirs. Not a people person. Maybe she would be best utilized in the kitchen where she doesn't interact with people
