Rubio's *used* to have a packed-with-shrimp Shrimp Burrito. Now they limit the number of shrimp per burrito to eight (8) per burrito, so it ends up being pretty much all rice and beans. The shrimp got smaller, too: they used to use a 36/40 count shrimp size, now they're using 41/45 or smaller shrimp size (my best guess.)

I understand that sometimes product offerings get smaller as margins are protected at chain restaurants (e.g. the Big Mac is tiny nowadays, the Burger King hamburger is bite-sized now.) But, with a Chipotle exactly one block away, you'd think that the franchise owner here would ensure that customers are getting their money's worth. In the middle of my burrito there was a pretty big triple fold of excess overlapped tortilla - meaning the burrito was much smaller than it should of been.

If Rubio's keeps this up, they will go down like Circuit City.
