Normally I love Senor Taco but this weekend I went in and got food for my three kids and two adults. First they refused to sell me an extra kids drink. Ok, fair enough. Then they made a mistake on my order, corrected it and asked for my card to charge me an extra dollar. To me, that's just bad customer service. Will def think twice about taking my family there next time.
