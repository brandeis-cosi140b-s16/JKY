Oh how I desperately want to love this place....but I don't. In my opinion the food is subpar and the service lacks. I've given it many chances thinking I didn't order the right thing or service was just off that day. Nope. After about 5 visits I can officially say that I'm still in search of good Mexican food in Henderson. I gave it 2 stars because the view is amazing and I haven't gotten food poisoning there.
