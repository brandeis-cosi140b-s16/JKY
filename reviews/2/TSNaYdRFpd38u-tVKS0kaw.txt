We only came here because La Palapa was full with a 45 minute wait, we were starving, this was across the street, and they could seat us immediately. Sad disappointment. Next time I'll get takeout from La Palapa, or make a reservation there. 

To be fair, the chipotle salsa was okay, but the chips were extra tough, and the pile was about four times too large for the amount of salsa.

We tried the beet tacos (interesting, but not amazing), and the fish tacos (downright bad). The rice and beans included as side dishes weren't great either. I think this place mainly caters to the college drinking crowd, but I wouldn't go here for the food. The bathroom was also completely out of soap which is a little gross.
