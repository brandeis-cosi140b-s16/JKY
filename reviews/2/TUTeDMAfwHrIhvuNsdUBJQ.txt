I have come here a couple of times, and each time I leave asking "WHY"!

Here are the deets...
My friends and I went on a Friday night, the place wasn't packed which was nice. We really wanted to sit out in the patio but it seemed too windy, however, it looks like they have great outdoor space.  We got sat right away, they served us chips in salsa, bad idea since we ate two containers of them. The chips where very tasty and warm, the salsa was also pretty good. 

We ordered guacamole and drinks - red wine Sangria and a Millionaire Margarita. The guac was bland, no salt, no flavor, the avocado tasted like it can from a container and not fresh at all. The drinks came but immediately we realized that they weren't good, they were too sweet, so sweet we couldn't drink them. 

The food was decent, we ordered the carne asada tacos, the tortillas smelled amazing and tasted just as good. We also ordered the garlic shrimp with corn and plantains, the plantains where perfectly cook. I ordered the Vida house salad, it said mixed greens but it was iceberg lettuce (which I dislike), other then that it was meh, nothing special. 

What really did it for me is the price, I don't mind spending $100 for dinner for 3 people but I would like the quality food to match the cost, I did not feel it did. 

The one constant thing is the service, they are pretty attentive, cleaned up quickly and I never noticed my water glass empty. 

I won't say I will never try them again but It will take some time and some convincing from my friend that LOVES mexican.
