2 stars is for the awesome bartender we had!
Drinks were priced OK at $9 each or so....margaritas served in mason jars...ok cool. All 3 of our margaritas were WAY too sweet. I had a guava one, my friends a raspberry and peach of sorts. My friend had to ask for it to be watered down, I myself added an ish ton of lime and it was still sweet. It was a nice little relaxing place to grab a drink.
We did not order food although it did look pretty darn good.
