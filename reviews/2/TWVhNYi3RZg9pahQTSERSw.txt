Me and the other homies in the hood were quite delighted when we learned (a few years ago) that the old gas station  on this corner was being replaced with an El Pollo. 

Why? Because there aren't enough Mexican fast food places in this neck of the woods? Hardly.

Because it's a healthier, tasty alternative to the usual fried stuff? Maybe, but you can trot into pretty much any grocery store and grab a rotisserie chicken, a tub of salsa and a pack of tortillas. You'll have a lot more of basically the same food for a lot less dinero.

No, kids, we were delighted because of the flan. And anyone who knows flan knows that, for whatever mysterious, inexplicable reason, EPL has the best flan anywhere. 
Make that HAD.

Drove on thru a couple of days ago, put in my order for whatever I had a coupon for, and added on a request for my favorite dessert, only to be told "I'm sorry. We don't have flan anymore".

Wha wha WHAT?? "You mean, you ran out"? "No. We don't have it anymore".

I am still in shock. What corporate dumbass made the decision to eliminate the best thing on the menu? What's next? Those greasy little deep fried tacos at Jack in the Box?  Only reason they got any stars was because the guy working the window agreed with me wholeheartedly. It was his only reason for going to work each day.  

Don't worry, bro. They will probably lose enough customers now that you will have to find another job anyway.
