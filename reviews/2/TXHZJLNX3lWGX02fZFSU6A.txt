I went there for lunch because I had a hankering for Mexican and a Groupon.  The service started out good but didn't finish that way.  We were honestly 7 minutes from dinning and ditching.  After we got our food we didn't see our waitress for another 30 minutes!  The food did not make up for it either.  I am pretty sure they microwaved everything.  

I go out to dinner to get food better than what I can make at home and this fell way short of my standards.
