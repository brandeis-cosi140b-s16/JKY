They say 3rd time is the charm, but unfortunately not for Pink Taco. Everytime I've come here the service is slow. I've been seated at tables inside & outside, as well as the bar. The service was the same everywhere. However last night took the cake! Came in about 830pm & sat at the bar. Immediately greeted by one of the bartenders. That was the last interaction w/ that bartender. Mind you we were 2 of 5 people on his side of the bar. We had to ask the bartender on the other side for another round. The guy next to us got up to pay at the front because the original bartender never bothered to check back in w/ him for payment. A request of lemon wedges were made on every round of drink, however on the 3rd round the 2nd bartender said 'sure I'll be right back' & never brought any. Instead the bartender brought a lemonade, but didn't give it to us it stood on the wet bar in front of us. When I asked what it was, the bartender replied 'I thought you ordered this'. I placed my card in the glass so I could pay. It stood in the glass for about 15 minutes. The original bartender never even bothered to look over. He was too busy cleaning up to handle the last 2 customers on his side. I had to get up & take the check to the front to pay. HORRIBLE SERVICE! 
The only reason I'm giving them 2 stars is because they do have a good happy hour 4-7pm. The food however is nothing special. I'd recommend going someplace else. If you do eat here expect slow service, ok food, & to probably have to talk to a manager about it all.
