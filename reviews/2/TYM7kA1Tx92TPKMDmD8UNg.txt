2 things that do not go well together: 1) mexican food 2) high prices. With hundreds of Mexican restaurants to choose from, we were lured in with a coupon and Wednesday "family" night.  Sure kid gets 4 corn dogs the size of your thumb for $1.50 and the wife and I split a $13 chimichanga + $2 upcharge for splitting (we were stuffed from the bottomless chip and salsa bowl)  now i gotta throw down a few prunes just to keep the pipes clean (and smooth, if you get my drift)

fool me once.....

on a side note, the whole Anderson Springs shopping center is packed to the gills on a wednesday night.  amazing
