This place has $1 margaritas. If you want one that doesn't taste like dimetapp, ask for an extra shot and make it a $2 margaritas.

For Southpark, it's one of the most affordable places for lunch.  The food isn't anything to rave over.  They have $1 margaritas. I had some cheesy chicken burrito thing that wasn't bad but it left me feeling more full than content. My friend had the fish tacos and wasn't wowed either.  

So the food is mediocre but the prices for lunch really aren't bad.  We escaped for around $10 a person before the $1 margaritas started piling up.  

If you're looking for an alternative to the fast food places at the mall and the executive restaurants in Southpark, I'd give them a shot.

Did I mention they have $1 margaritas but my recommendation - get the extra shot.
