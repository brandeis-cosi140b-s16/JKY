The food here is decent, if somewhat simple.  Their dishes have a homemade taste to them, but are not overly flavorful. Contrary to what a previous reviewer stated, they do feature both blended and on the rocks margaritas. Their margaritas are relatively potent, but smallish for the price.

Follow-Up: I wound up getting sick after eating here, lowering rating from 3 to 2 stars because of this.
