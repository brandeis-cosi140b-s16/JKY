Kinda high price. Food is OK. I've had better. 

They advertise the heck out of this place, and make it sound so good, but, honestly, the food was small portions with a big price, and tasteless, to boot! 
Overall, we found no good mexican food in Scottsdale area. If you want some good nachos, though, go to the Fairmont Scottsdale Princess Resort, and eat the Nacho appetizer at the Ironwood American Kitchen. Is run by a famous chef. Also, walk around the property. It's amazing!
The nachos here, were made with more gourmet ingredients. I've never had nachos that good anywhere else.

Skip the Old Town Tortilla Factory!!
