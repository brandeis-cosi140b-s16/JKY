Very disappointed.  I had high hopes for this place being more than a generic wanna-be authentic Mexican restaurant.  I'm sure this place is better than what I experienced but I probably won't give it a 2nd chance and here's why.

Our waiter was so dull & clueless.  I seriously think he must be a relative they HAD to employ.  I know it's not a dream job but he really looked upset to be there.  Whenever I go to a new place I always ask what dish makes their restaurant worth coming back for... you know, what do people tend to favor.  He had no clue how to answer this.  I asked if they had any drink specials & he said no.  Turns out they had Sangria (which I usually like), but I didn't order it b/c I had already ordered a beer.  He was rushing us to order.  If I had more time we would have ordered an appetizer, but I guess he prefer we spend less.  I asked for green enchiladas, instead I got red.  He could only do one thing at a time.  When he brought our order, instead of clearing our table to make room for the plates, he just plopped down the meals on top of the dishes already there - making a lot of noise and making things flop all around.

I saw dishes on other people's tables that looked better than ours, which only made me blame the waiter more for rushing us.

While it may not be fair to judge this entire restaurant because of one waiter, the fact that they let this guy work in public makes me question anything this place does.

But what about the food?...  very mediocre.  My favorite part of the meal was the beans... pretty sad.
