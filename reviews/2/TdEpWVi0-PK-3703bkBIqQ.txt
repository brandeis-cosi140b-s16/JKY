This used to be a good place to go in a pinch for a quick lunch. 
But the service has really gone down hill.
If you go through the drive thru .. DO NOT EXPECT to get packets of sauce even when you ask for them. 
Also don't expect your drink occasionally because they think they gave it to you.
The food is good.. 
But the service really has taken a turn for the worse here.
I hope they get it together soon.
