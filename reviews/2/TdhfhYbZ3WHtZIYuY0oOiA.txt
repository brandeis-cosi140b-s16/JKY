Not delicious. The weak tamarind margarita was the best part of the meal. The place was dead and that should have been an indicator given it's Saturday night. The salsa was bland and American-ized. Nachos were mediocre. And the burrito was anything but Mexican, even for what us Americans are used to. On a positive note, the ice cold water was just the right temperature and fantastic to my palate.
