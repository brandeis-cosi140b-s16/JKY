Pasqual's was a wonderful, funky, order at the counter kind of place with very tasty food, for many years at their previous Monroe St. location. They seem to have lost something in their move to the present more upscale ambience. Gone is the deli from which you could purchase yummy guacamole and other specialties. The food is less spicy and tasty overall, and it doesn't seem freshly made, as it used to be. My black bean soup was way over-salted, the beans were overcooked, and no other flavors were evident. The blue corn muffin was good though. The friendly but inexperienced waiter brought my dining companion a bean burrito, instead of the beef burrito ordered, and then offered to "add beef" when this was pointed out. We had to fetch our own water, and no butter, salt or pepper was available. There are much better Mexican restaurants in Madison, like the Guadalajara, and we'll be going there in the future.
