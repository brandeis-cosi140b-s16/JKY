I love the atmosphere at Tia Rosa's. The service is always great.  Tonight I made the mistake of ordering the beef Chimichanga.  The meat was so dry and a little burnt.  I needed to drown it in sour cream and guacamole to choke it down.  The tortilla was perfect, how can you go wrong with the crunchy on the outside chewy on the inside delicious tortilla.  I don't think I've ever met a chimichanga I didn't love until now.  Maybe the manager will read some reviews and work on the burnt dried out meat.  I had the seafood enchiladas last time and they were great.  I am leaving tonight with a bad(burnt, dried out) taste in my mouth. Please pass the water and pass this restaurant if you are hankering for chimichanga!
