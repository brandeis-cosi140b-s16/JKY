Went here for the first time today.. I ordered the taco combination plate ($7.19). It is only a combo in that there are three different types of tacos (carne asada, chicken, and pastor (Pork). It did not come with any side or drink.. So I ordered a side of beans  ($1.69) and a soft drink. The tacos came out on the little 4 inch corn tortillas, and each taco MIGHT have had an ounce and a half of meat in them. The beans came in a small little plastic souffle cup, maybe 3 ounces at most. They were bland pureed beans, with a pinch of cheese melted on top. 

For my 3 tacos, spoonful of beans and a drink, I paid over $11.00. Definitely NOT worth the price. Next time I will go to Chipotle, or the Stand on Indian School. At the Stand, the tacos are about $2.50 each, but they come packed with meat and toppings.
