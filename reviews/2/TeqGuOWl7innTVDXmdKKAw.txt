The fiesta potatoes are NEVER cooked all the way through.

One worker will literally hand us our bag through the window and just shut the door. Half the time we have to check to see if all of our food is in there or if we're waiting for another bag. No communication what-so-ever. No "here you go!" or "thanks, have a good day!" Just bag, and shut door. Unfortunately she works there a lot so it happens often..
