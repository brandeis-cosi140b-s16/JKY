The Moe's at the EpiCentre is not as good as other Moe's Southwestern Grill locations in the Charlotte area.  For starters, the prices are higher at this location.  The burritos and tacos are also not as good; with the pinto beans overly flavored and other items somewhat lacking.  Another annoyance is the two Freestyle Coke machines that seem to always be out of some flavors.  Overall, I give this location two stars... it can be better, just that they weren't any of the times I visited.
