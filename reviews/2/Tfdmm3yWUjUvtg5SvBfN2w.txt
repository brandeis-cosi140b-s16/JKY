I absolutely love Chipotle. However.... The past couple times I have come to this location I haven't had a good experience. Everyone works with their head down... No eye contact, no smiles and they all work super slow. I stood in line for 15 min last time. Asked for my salsa on the side and they still put it on top... Didn't bother to remake it even though I stated to them that I had asked for it on the side... They clearly didn't care. And their bathrooms were disgusting!! 

Next time I decided to go online and order so I didn't have to wait long. My pick up time was 4:45 and I walked in at 4:47 and guess what.. They had a line and MY ORDER WASNT DONE! They again acted like they didn't care and took their good old time making my one salad I needed. 

Needless to say I'm never going to this location again. The location on Lake Mead is a million times better!!! Go there for a good experience!
