The food was reasonable, definitely not as good as Barrio Cafe, but the service was totally unacceptable. We were a party of six, including two children, and it took 55 minutes to get our food. Water arrived after our entrees and several requests. As neighborhood residents, we know that The Yard is popular because it is a very fun place, but service should never be this bad. Very disappointing.
