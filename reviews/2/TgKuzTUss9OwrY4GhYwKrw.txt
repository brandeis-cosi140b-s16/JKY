The staff needs a lesson on what "any social media" means.  It doesn't mean just Facebook.  I mention this because there is a posted sign by where you order a burrito, in which any social media check-in gives a free elote.  I luckily had Facebook, but my girlfriend disabled hers awhile back and when she showed her Yelp check-in nearly everyone in the kitchen was yelling, "Facebook only!"  The younger cashier understood the clearly marked sign and offered to deliver 2 rightfully earned elotes to our table.  I guess the cashier forgot, so we asked her about our corn, which she said she would bring right out after apologizing to us.  We overheard the kitchen staff loudly asking her in Spanish why two elotes were being given to us...  Sigh, we each got an elote in the end thanks to the cashier's diligence and reading comprehension.

Another thing, the price of burritos has gone up.  Our usual order of 2 burritos used to be $16 something and now it is $19 and some change.  I will be looking elsewhere for Mexican food when I'm back in Vegas.
