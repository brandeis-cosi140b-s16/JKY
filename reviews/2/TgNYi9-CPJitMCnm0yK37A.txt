My Super Nachos were really good, minus the cheap liquid cheese.  I ordered two regular burritos which turned out to be filled with air, not meat and other good stuff.  They were meagerly constructed and filled leaving me to really not want to go back there again.  They're even stingy on their hot sauce....at least robertos gives you an abundance of hot sauce!
