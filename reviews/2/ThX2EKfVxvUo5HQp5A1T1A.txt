As for the food at Chevy's---I say *meh*.  It's not horrible but it is eminently forgettable.

We hadn't been to a Chevy's in years.  There used to be one in Sterling at the mall but it had long since closed.  We tried it once and the one thing that stuck in my mind was "El Machino"--- the machine that's highly visible by the entrance where you can watch an employee making tortillas.  As a result of El Machino, the tortillas are probably one of the best things about the menu.  Those same tortillas are what is used for the complimentary chips and dip.  Other than that, the rest of their food is *meh*.

We went to the one in Mesa because we were looking for a place that was kid-friendly.  Chevy's fit the bill in that case.  Yet the kids all had---hamburgers!  LOL!

I had a combo platter and chose a chile relleno and a crispy taco with carnitas.  The chile relleno was just ok---I have had far better.  As for the taco---the best part was the carnitas---I have to admit they had good flavor.

Our son-in-law had a chicken burrito and liked it.  My husband had a taste of Chevy's platter---which, well, had a taste of several menu items.  He was not impressed.

I had a frozen margarita which was just OK.   The adults at our table had a good laugh when the waitress carded me!  I'm thinking that this Chevy's got in trouble in the past for serving underage patrons.  I mean---I'm well past the legal drinking age---there's no doubt about that LOL!

Our waitress was friendly and prompt---no complaints at all about the service.

Yet---I can't help but wonder what the attraction to Chevy's is in a place where there is far better Mexican food around...?
