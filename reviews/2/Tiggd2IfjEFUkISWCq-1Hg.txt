1 appetizer + 2 entrees + 1 dessert + 0 cocktails = $80

i don't mind paying $80, even more, for stellar food, but this experience left a lot to be desired. i had the casa especial, the chiles en nogada, basically a big, burnt poblano pepper stuffed with hunks of chicken and other organic matter. my friend had the suiza enchiladas sin carne, which really wasn't a good vegetarian option on his part. it turned out to be a messy, creamy disaster in a dish. the crepes with goat-milk caramel sauce were definitely the highlight of our dinner. and i will say our server was good. prompt and no BS. i like that. he didn't try to butter us up: hang around our table and try to make small talk. nothing worse than a waiter who won't shut the hell up and bring the food.

since i'm not from phoenix, i can't offer another alternative, however, if you're a vegetarian/vegan, this is not your place. very limited meatless options. then again, you could always stuff your face with the pre-meal bread and tapenade (in lieu of chips and salsa ... apparently that's too obvious for the barrio cafe). if you're looking for typical mexican fare, you won't find it here. but if you're looking for an aesthetically cool place to grab some dinner, give it a whirl. just be prepared to drop some cash to see and be seen in this hood-inspired eatery. personally, i think you could do a little research and get much better (and cheaper) mexican food in this area.
