If you're looking for authentic, keep driving.  I've never had anything here that remotely wowed me, and I've tried their chain several times.  I should have realized this was going to happen too, when everyone who recommended it thought Filliberto's is good.  Just because you see the red and green sauces in the little plastic ketchup bottles that remind you of your last trip to San Diego doesn't mean it's authentic.  It's good for white suburbanites, I'll give them that much, but then again, so is San Diego.  One word: gringo.
