The food was absolutely 5 stars, but the service was terrible! At 5:30pm on a Sunday evening, the place was busy, but half the seating was not in use.  Our waitress appeared experienced and competent- at least to her other tables. We waited, but no water, chips, or menus arrived. Finally, the waitress took our drink order and tossed the menus onto the table. My husband was the only one who did get water because he specifically asked for it. I would have ordered two sodas had realized my single diet soda was the only one I would get. Other tables were regularly served off a beverage cart supplied with soda, tea, and            water.                     

The chips, salsas, creama sauce, and bean dip arrived and were delicious but we were out of salsas by the time our  ($9+) assorted appetizer platter arrived. We asked twice for more salsas. By this time, the cheese on half the platter was cold and congealed. I asked for a refill on my soda, please, and the waitress affirmed that she heard me. Then our dinners arrived. My Chili Rellenos arrived without the usual side of tortillas, so I asked for some. Other tables had red containers of small tortillas on their tables. Like my soda refill,  the tortillas never showed up. I resorted to using pieces of the cold cheese crisp. The food itself was delicious--the rellenos were perfect- a combination of hot, gooey cheese, spicy Hatch pepper, and crunchy fried crust. My husbands #3 platter was equally delicious. I let the waitress know it was my husband's birthday, so she said "oh, congratulations" and then brought out the bill and the 3 sopapillas (hot, crunchy and delicious) that are part of the standard dinner. 

We sat and watched as our waitress was attentive and helpful to her other tables-- and there were at least 2 other waitresses and a helper in the dining area--so not as short staffed as I thought. The Check  totaled  about $60 for the three of us.  Having worked waiting tables for a living, I realize tips are an important part of a waitress' salary. We usually are very, very good tippers---at least 20%. Not so last night.
