I had been passing by this place since it opened a few months ago and after a late night of work decided to stop in for some food.  I have to say that this is the blandest food (especially for mexican food) I have ever had.  I walked in about an hour before close and they were already closing their debit machine and I had to wait for it to complete before paying, no big deal, and the girl up front put my order in right away.  The price was OK and they did have a nice liitle salsa bar, but over all the food was not good.  I won't be going back.
