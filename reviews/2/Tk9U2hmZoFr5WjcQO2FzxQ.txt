Like so many Food Fight restaurants, this one banks on decor instead of serving good food. 

The salsa bar is comprised of multiple mild, lifeless salsas. I know the average customer probably whines about spicy food, but if you label a salsa "hot," it should pack a punch.

It's hard to imagine how a place can also consistently produce dry tacos, but I've never gotten one at Tex Tubbs that wasn't dry.

In short, this is not the place to go for (Tex Mex) food. The margaritas are just fine and the place is cute enough if you want to meet friends for drinks and queso w/chips.
