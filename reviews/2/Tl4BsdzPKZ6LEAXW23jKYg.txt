This was my first time at a El Pollo Loco, I don't know if it was this shop or all of them, but was not impressed at all. Chicken was soo over cooked it was like sawdust ... The skin was good though.   The Mac and cheese tastes like it came from a can.. Only reason I gave the extra star was because the girl who took my order was very friendly
