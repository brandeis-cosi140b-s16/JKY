The food was pretty decent and tasty, but the service and organization were horrible...we were given chips & salsa to start, but there were NO plates...salsa ended up dripping all over the table.  Then our drinks (just soft drinks) took forever, although there were only around 4 tables occupied.  My husband ordered soup, which arrived only after reminding the waitress (where was she with hardly any patrons and 2-3 severs?), who then brought soup with NO SPOON...then she didn't bother checking back with us, so my husband was eating the thick soup with his fork for quite awhile.  Drink refills were only provided (sometimes) upon request, and then also took forever.  Lots of dry glasses and thirsty people.  I asked for no beans (explaining to the server how much I detest them) on my tacos, and when the meal finally came, she said it took awhile because the kitchen accidentally added the refried beans.  I trusted that she had them redo the meal, but in the middle of eating my taco, I saw that the meal had been replated but that the beans were still stuck to the bottom of the taco shell...GROSS!  I had just about enough of the poor service and was expecting them to at least apologize for forgetting the soup and the spoon until my husband was nearly done with his meal, but to my chagrin, they didn't seem to care.  As I said, the food was okay, even tasty, but the service absolutely ruined it; I can excuse a mistake or an omission with no problem, but the lack of concern for their comedy of errors was inexcusable.  Never going back...and really think they only deserved one star...
