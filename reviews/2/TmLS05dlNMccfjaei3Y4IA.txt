I'll start by saying everyone pronounces this place incorrectly, & it irks me to no avail. Without the accent mark, it's just Chi po tull...not Chi pote lay...if that at all makes any sense. So until they add the appropriate accent to their logo, I'll continue to say it how it should be said...not how the company inappropriately wants it to be called. Anyways, I'm not a huge fan of this quick tex mex burrito joint. To me, there are several other places in Charlotte that are much better for getting the same thing.

The taste of their burritos just doesn't do it for me. Maybe it's in the onions or spice flavor of their chicken, but I just wasn't a huge fan of their burrito or their sauces. To me, it seemed like a lesser tasting burrito than many other places such as Qdoba, Moe's, or Phat Burrito.

Chipotle isn't one of my favorites & I'd rather go to several other places to get a tasty burrito.
