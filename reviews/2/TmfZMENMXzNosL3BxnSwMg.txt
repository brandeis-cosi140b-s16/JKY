Dissapointing/odd visit. My mom and I decided to get lunch at chipotle today. We were second in line and it took almost 10 minutes for them to make a quesadilla for the person ahead of us. 
I ordered a veggie burrito as usual. Usually they're pretty consistent at other locations right? I asked for all the veggies and she forgot quac and cheese. I guess I should have been watching. 
Their mild salsa was old and mushy! 
They remade the burrito and when the cahier gave me the remade burrito it was the smallest burrito I've ever seen made at a chipotle!! 
1. Long wait when there was no customers
2. Old expired food..(tomato's)
3. No good portions 
Won't be going back to this location
