I am a bit surprised by the previous reviews.  I had dinner here with a friend on a Sunday night and the restaurant was almost empty.  The waitress was not friendly or very good.  The chips and salsa was amazing but that was really the only good part of the meal.  I ordered a bean and cheese burrito.  The beans were bland.  I had it deep fried.  It was but not to make it tasty.  It was dipped in oil just long enough to make it oily but not at all crispy.  It was then topped with a cream cheese sauce that was a bit spicy but mostly flavorless.  I'm glad we had an entertainment coupon for buy one get one and I would not go back.
