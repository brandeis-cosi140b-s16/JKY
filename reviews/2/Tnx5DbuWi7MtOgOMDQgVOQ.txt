well I must say i have taken a star away from anitas and can barley muster up 2 stars we were up in wickenburg for the marty stuart show on friday we decided to go to anitas for dinner before the show we were seated right away and brought chips and salsa then waited about 5 min before our very friendly server arrived . I ordered a margarita which was way too sweet must have been margarita mix, i had the 6 rolled taquitos w/beef and guac and sour cream $9.50  I thought a little pricey ...WHERES THE BEEF, the wife had a taco salad which had lettuce chicken and cheese....no tomatos/beans The menu was also very limited this week end was gold miner days so i think the menu might have been catered to that over charge and limited menu.As we talked to some of the locals no one talked very highly of this place and said   IT USE TO BE GOOD
