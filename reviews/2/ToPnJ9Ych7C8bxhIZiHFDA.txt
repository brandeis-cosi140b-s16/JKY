Haven't even eaten my food yet but I ordered it at 11:30pm when no one else was in there, and it still took a half hour for them to make me ONE thing. 
Place is a little sketchy looking too


--  Update

I ate the food and it was decent. So I boosted my rating from 1 star to 2. 
Still wouldn't go back
