We love Chipotle and this location used to be a great weekday lunch destination. Lately we've tried it on the weekends and probably won't go to this location anymore. The food is still OK, but the service has gotten slow and the restaurant is generally messy or they let the fountain drinks run dry. One time we had to stand and wait while an employee held up the whole line as she ordered food for her family members - and for some reason this confused the rest of the staff and they had to re-make a couple of other customers' orders. Maybe they don't have a weekend manager? Not sure. The location on Las Vegas Boulevard & Warm Springs is where the A-Team workers are. We'll keep going there instead.
