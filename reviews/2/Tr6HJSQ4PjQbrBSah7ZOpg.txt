How hard is it to take my order and give me what I ordered? The last three times have been progressively worse. Last time, order just nachos. Pico de Gillo, quac, and sour cream on the side. Get home, no PdG, no quac, no sour cream. Tonight, fish taco plate and nachos (same way as last). Nachos are fine, my fish taco plate magically turned into some sort of squashed enchilada thing in red sauce. HOW DO YOU SCREW THIS UP? I WAS THE ONLY CAR IN THE DRIVE THRU AND YOU REPEATED THE ORDER BACK TO ME. I'm miles away now and can't go back. If I ever do. The food is just OK. It will be a long while before I go back. Even the beans and rice where nearly flavorless.
