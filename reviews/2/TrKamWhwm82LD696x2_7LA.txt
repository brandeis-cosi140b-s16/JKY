Good BUT not great. I will give them an A for effort because if they could enhance the flavor the rest of the experience was great. 

Ambience - Nice
Staff - Great and on top of refills
Chips - Perfection
Salsa - tomato paste ... Lacks flavor
Guacamole - Okay 
Carne Asada taco - Not great ... Considering this is a Mexican restaurant. 
Shrimp taco - Good 

Again, everything about the place was great EXCEPT for the food. {Sorry ...}
