Meh, I've experienced better. My pollo con chorizo (chicken breast & sausage) had a couple itsy bitsy pieces of chorizo... umm, you're supposed to get more than that if you're ordering a $11 dish and not off the lunch specials. I didn't get the flour tortillas either without explicitly asking for them.

Food tasted ok and was brought out really quick, hence the 2 stars.
