I'm all for spending money on mom and pop shops that carry good food, but man this place really set a challenge. Worst customer service experience. Ordered the BIRRIA, which was basically bones in broth ( $9 ) asked if she can please change it to pozole ($8) without mentioning the prices. The rolling of the eyes,passive aggressive attitude, but the waiting for sure took the prize. Took about 15 minutes (no new customers were arriving) for the pozole to be ready, but instead of bringing it to the table ( as she did before) yelled out the order as if it was my fault the give out bones in a plate. The pozole was pretty good, but nobody should be welcomed with a negative attitude specially if I'm being polite and courteous.
