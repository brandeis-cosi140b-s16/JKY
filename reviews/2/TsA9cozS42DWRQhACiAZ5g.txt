We had the beef fajita plate and they were ok. Being from Texas, I might be a bit biased though. The food was better than the service though. The environment wasn't very welcoming, and the server was not very friendly. The chips and salsa appetizer was decent. It's not a place I'd crave or go back again if I have other options around.
