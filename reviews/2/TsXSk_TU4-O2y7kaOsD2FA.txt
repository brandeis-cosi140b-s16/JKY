I always wonder why I find myself back at this place after complaining to myself about the last time I was there.  Nothing different this time.  Very unfriendly hostess!  The waiter came around and was friendly but extremely slooooowwwww.....  Never got refills on our drinks or asked about refills on our margaritas, and when it came time to pay, the waiting continued...and continued....

Overall, food is good, I think that's why I have come back several times.  Not to mention the great selection of tequilas and great decor.  But the service is atrocious.  I'll probably write a follow-up in 6 months when I find myself back there wondering why I came back again.
