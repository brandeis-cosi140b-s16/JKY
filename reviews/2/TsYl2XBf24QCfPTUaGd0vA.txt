Good - table made guacamole was very delicious and so was the cheese dip and chips.
The bad - I ordered the enchilada/ taco beef combo.  The beef tasted like it was either out of a can or cooked in a giant vat for hours.  No red sauce on the enchilada, isn't that a standard?  Sean ordered a 1/2 chicken & 1/2 beef chimi and was equally disappointed.  It wasn't anything great and he thought the same about the beef.
The atmosphere was nice, Spanish tile throughout and the server was good and very accommodating to our special orders.
Would only go back if I can't find another place with just as delicious fresh guac.
