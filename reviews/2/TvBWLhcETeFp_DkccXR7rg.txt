Mad Mex is in absolute obedience to what must be the Great Commandment of Pittsburgh Dining: thou shalt serve tons of food, whether it's awesome or mediocre or just plain inedible.  My friends and colleagues seem to love this place -- and maybe it's just me, but I never understood why.  Sure, their burritos are twice the size of any burrito you can get in, say, Chicago; but what does that matter if they only have half the flavor?  Their food is always artfully presented, with colorful sauces everywhere; but when your "hot" sauce is mild to the point of tastelessness, what's the point?  And finally, the cost -- sure they give you a lot, but they charge you a commensurately high price.  I think I'd rather spend my money at Chipotle, honestly.

Not recommended.
