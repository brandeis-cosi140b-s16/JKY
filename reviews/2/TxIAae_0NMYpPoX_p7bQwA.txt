Decent food and drinks, but the service was very poor.  I probably wouldn't go back.

Once we got our drinks and appetizers, we never saw our waiter again. This prevented us from ordering more drinks or getting waters refilled. It took forever to flag someone down to get my group's bill, and it took an hour from when we asked for the bill to pay and get our credit cards back. Some of the people in our group lost patience and just threw cash down on the table because it took SO long to get the bill.
