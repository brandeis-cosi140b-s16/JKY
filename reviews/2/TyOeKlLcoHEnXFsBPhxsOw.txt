This place has been around forever, but I can't really understand why. The restaurant is run down. The service was pretty awful - it took forever to place our order, we sat with empty water glasses, then there were missing dishes, messed up dishes, we needed silverware, etc. And from the moment you try the salsa that tastes like canned tomato sauce, you'll know that the food just isn't good. There are many better options for Mexican food around this area.
