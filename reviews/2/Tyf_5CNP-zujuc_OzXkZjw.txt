Had the lunch Pollo con queso special.
The chicken was pretty dry, and had no discernible flavor.

The jalape√±o cheese they topped it with wasn't very spicy, but was ok.

Our server was good, and they have decent salsa with their chips.

My second trip, mostly because it's close to work, and my coworker doesn't like Manuel's.

I may be back.
