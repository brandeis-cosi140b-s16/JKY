The hostess are very obviously not hired for the size of their brains, but hey, its vegas. The food is subpar, even for the prices it;s a ripoff. I got a sangria and it was bad news. Didn't even drink it. I bet the margaritas are better. I will give it another shot I guess but honestly, I would rather go to firefly down the street.
