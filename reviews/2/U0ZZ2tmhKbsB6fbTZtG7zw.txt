The service sucks. The food was bland. Its a fair price for the food but the food itself is not great Mexican food. Why was there peanuts in the guacamole ? And why is the green salsa sweet ? Anyways the waiter was nice but it took forever to get anything. . and all the employees seemed to be lounging around. I was disappointed because the restaurant looks so nice.
