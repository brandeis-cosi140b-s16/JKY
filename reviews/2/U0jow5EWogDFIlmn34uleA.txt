First timer, wasn't what I expected. We were seated right away but it took our server "Amy" at least 15 minutes to acknowledge us and another 10 minutes to take our order. Our chips & water guy was way more attentive then Amy. 

After 45 minutes of total waiting we finally got our food, COLD. We questioned the server and she put  blame on lack of chefs in kitchen. We watched all the other servers walk by with their orders, no problem. Food wasn't bad but wasn't that good either.

IF we give it another try (most likely not) we will make sure its not with the server we got the first time.
