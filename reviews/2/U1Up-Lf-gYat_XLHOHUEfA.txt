A small little restaurant tucked away in a small corner alley of the Forum Shops, offering Mexican food, a nice place to kick your feet up after walking through Caesar's or the Forum Shops. 

First impression was the Mexican decor was cute, but upon using the bathroom prior to ordering and it was not well kept, old toilet paper all over the floor, not frequently cleaned toilets it appears, zero toilet paper or paper seat covers, that makes me nervous, what's the kitchen like? 

I'm with a group so I'll play nice and just disregard the bathroom. We order food, and Cadillac margaritas. 

The margaritas were really sugary, but I slurped mine down. I ordered fish tacos (so dry and an overcooked strip of Wahoo fish that it was hard to eat, not pleased, the beans in the side were sticky. I've never seen sticky beans, and I have eaten at a hundred Mexican restaurants and lived in Mexico for 3 years), Suiza enchiladas (they said good), and chicken burrito (small and my friend said just okay). 

Service was great, our waitress was very nice. 

I probably will not eat at La Salsa again, I will try somewhere else in the Forum Shops.
