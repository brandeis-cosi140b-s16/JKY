Why on earth did Guy Fieri and DD&D come here? I have 100% no idea. Food is actually just fine, but there are thousands upon thousands of places like this. Might as well show gas stations with A&Ws and other fast food chains in them. Nothing stands out here. Please don't make a special trip here, however I guess if you're getting gas and hungry, it's ok. Not worthy of broadcasting on TV for sure. In fact, makes me question the whole DD&D show.
