Im not sure why this place has more than 2 stars, its not that good, OK at best. Maybe if you never had Mexican food before than that would make sense. 

To start, the lines are confusing and chaotic!The tacos, were made inconsistent, some had not enough meat some had no guacamole some had one tortilla and some had two. The meat, was dry with no taste. 

The price at $2.00 a taco off the street should be a Very Good taco, this is not even close, its more of a $1.00 taco!

So many other places are much better. I don't get it.
