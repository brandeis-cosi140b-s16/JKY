While waiting for my next flight, I decided to head to Salsarita's since I was craving Mexican food, and didn't want the typical fast food burger or Starbuck's.

I ordered steak tacos with a side of chips and salsa.  The steak tacos tasted weird - almost as if the steak was pork.  The chips and salsa were ok, nothing special.
