I really wanted to like Taqueria Mi Casita, but it just wasn't very good.

The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful, and it was nice to see them interacting with regulars and newbies alike. 

Ordered a Carne Asada burrito, and this sucker was PACKED full. 

Unlike typical Carne, this was finely chopped beef vs. chunks.

No big deal. What was a big deal is all I could taste was salt. :( 

Haven't been in a hurry to go back and see if this was a fluke, but definitely willing to give them a second chance per some recommendations Claudine F. made!
