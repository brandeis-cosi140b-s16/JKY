Paid $10 for an egg, potato, and green chile beef burrito, enchilada style red, with a fountain drink. My meal was so-so,  I enjoyed the spiciness of the green chile. 

The customer service was not good. The girl behind the counter was on the phone, hung up, and didn't acknowledge me for about 2 minutes while she input a phone order. When my meal came out she must have whispered my order number because my food was just sitting there, waiting for me. It was clean inside.

Bottom line: There are better Mexican food options within a five mile radius. Rositas's, Burrito Express, Elmers, Amado's, Cafe Rio, etc. Go a little further and try Los Taquitos or Burrito Company. I won't be back to Espo's.
