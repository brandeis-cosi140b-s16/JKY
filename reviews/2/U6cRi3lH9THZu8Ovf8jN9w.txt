The 4 Stars drew me in but unfortunately it was a let down. Like many of the other reviews the best word to describe the food is BLAND. There's just no taste. Salsa is bland, cheese dip is bland, chips are bland and on the verge of stale...just not very good. The only redeeming factor is the margaritas are good and service is good. Probably wouldn't want to return.
