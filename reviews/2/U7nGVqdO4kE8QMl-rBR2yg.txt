Came here for a team lunch based on some Yelp reviews, however, the meal I experience was below average.  There wasn't much spices and most dishes tasted bland.  I had to order additional plates of hot sauce, lemon, salt and pepper just to season the food.  Perhaps, it was an off day for them, but I probably wouldn't make additional effort to go back.
