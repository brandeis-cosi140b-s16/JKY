Don't charge $2 for guacamole and give a measly little dollop. Really pisses me off. Every time I come to this chipotle they give half the meat. No wonder chipotles are doing no good. I'm here because there was no line and in a hurry. No lines at chipotle anymore because their quality, including employees have gone down hill.
