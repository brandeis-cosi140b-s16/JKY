I wanted to try a new Mexican food place today so I stopped in and was quite disappointed. The food was mediocre at best, but the service was quite good. I ordered vegetable fajitas and there was minimal flavor. The guacamole was just a paste with no veggies and this is what really bummed me out. I loooove guac. The salsa was ok, but nothing special. Wishing I had just skipped this place altogether.
