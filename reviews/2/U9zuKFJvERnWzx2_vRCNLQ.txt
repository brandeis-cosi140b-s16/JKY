I don't know what it is, but I've driven into the shopping center and driven right back out because the line is pretty much out the door EVERY time I go.  I don't even bother getting out of my car because its a total waste of time.  Please get it together, because when I'm craving Chipotle and its extremely crowded, that becomes very annoying.
