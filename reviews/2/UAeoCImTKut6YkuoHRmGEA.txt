Great Hot Sauce if you like it (HOT)!....I have eaten here more than half a dozen times and what I have eaten is good, but you are made to sit and order from a waitress that once served doesn't seem to know you are still a guest.  It seems as though you are only made to sit down instead of go to the counter, is so you will feel the need to leave a tip. The problem is the atmosphere feels more like the many other BETTER MEXICAN places to choose from where you order at the counter from and eat in or take out.  

For a sit down restaurant where atmosphere and service are part of the deal this place gets about  1/2 a star.  For food quality alone I could go as high as four stars but for reasons already stated and the price one has to pay for what this place offers by comparison to so many better choices this place gets just 2 STARS from me.
