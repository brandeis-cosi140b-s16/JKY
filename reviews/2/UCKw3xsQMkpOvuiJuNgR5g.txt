Thought for it being on The Strip and at Bally's Casino, it would have been great.. Very disappointing!  Food was cold.... Service poor..After we sent our food back, the server didn"t check back with us to see how it was! The only saving grace was the Marguerites.  I recommend you eat before you go and have a Marguerita only!
