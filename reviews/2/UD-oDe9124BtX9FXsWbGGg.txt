The food ranges between good and just OK. I like it as a wheel deliver option except that the consistency is terrible. Sometimes you'll pay for a side of fries and get about 10, other times a nice-sized container. Same with the side of sour cream. It'll be $0.50 for a teaspoon half the time. Food quality is similarly inconsistent I'd give it 4 or 5 stars if they learned to be consistent.
