I generally avoid Filiberto's unless I've run out of other options, and even then I stick to one or two things on the menu.  They can't mess up a basic breakfast burrito with eggs, potatoes and cheese.  Well, I say that and the potatoes are always undercooked so they're crunchy from the rawness.  They make a decent AZ burrito, but it's greasy as all get out--you'll want to pour out the grease before consuming the last bit of the burrito.  

Because it's so close to the house, I've been here at least 30 times, so I have a fully-formed opinion.  I used to be excited about them when they first opened--who wouldn't be excited about 24-hour Mexican right on your corner?  Over the years I've become turned-off by their cheap meats, overly greasy food, and inability to cook potatoes.  

A better option for a cheap burrito in the area would be Los Favoritos in Chandler or Some Burros.
