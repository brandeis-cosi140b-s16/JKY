We went in to Qdoba for lunch. I normally love this sort of food but this time the food was disgusting and the bathrooms were comparable to a frat house-just plain filthy.            
The entire restaurant had flies everywhere. (Fix the gaping hole in the door) 
The food was gross, the chips over salted, and I had two people talking to me at once during the assembly line.  
     The chicken in my child's taco looked like tofu chunks. There was no manager in site-just children slopping up the food in the assembly line.  Overall I just could not get over how many flies there were and how it just seemed to be a regular thing as no one cared they were around the food.  If I had more free time I would have called the health department.
