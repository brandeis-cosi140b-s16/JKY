Still on soft opening, but still...The iced tea dispenser (manual) was out of order.  I ordered a Chronic Salad with the lime cilantro vinaigrette.  I got a handful of lettuce and some kind of nasty chicken....then I was asked if I wanted something else on it...huh?  So, I eyed a bunch of dispensers and asked for cilantro and onions.  All this for 7 bucks and change.  Ugh.  They serve beer.  A customer was in there eating a burrito.  She said it was good.  I will give this place a wide berth for a while.  I will wander over to Potbelly or Chick Fil A for my salads.  Both are a few steps away.  Oh...the t-shirts were cool.  They will be available at some point.
