As I moved here from FL, where I am accustomed to excellent Cuban food, I tried to be as neutral as possible when reviewing this restaurant.  I ordered my old favorite, Vaca Frita, with Moro and a side of Maduros since the plates don't come with Maduros.  The Vaca Frita was extremely fatty and the Maduros were so scorched, I was trying to peel off the black parts to get to the sweet plantain portion, but they were not salvageable.  The restaurant looked clean and the staff was friendly so I may try this place one more time to give it a fair shake (will order the Lechon Asado/Pork instead though) so let's see what happens on try #2....for try #1, and for the drive I took to get there, I was not impressed.
