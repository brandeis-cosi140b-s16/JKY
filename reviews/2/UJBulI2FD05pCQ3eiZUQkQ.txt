Finally tried this place for lunch as I've passed by it a few times, and it seems busy.  Got there, placed my order (Tres Tacos, nothing else), and waited. And waited.  And waited some more.  Finally after about 25 minutes of waiting, I asked one of the girls behind the counter what was going on, and she never gave me a clear answer - just mumbled something to the cooks and all of a sudden my food magically appeared. All I got was a mumbled "Sorry".  By that point I was already over my 30 minute lunch break.  If I hadn't opened my mouth, I'd probably still be waiting for my food.  After all that, they weren't even anything major to write home about - the soft taco shells tasted a little raw, and the fillings were decent, but again, nothing to brag about. I'm sure it's like every other taco shop on McDowell.

It didn't seem that they were short staffed, but with such a fast and busy lunch crowd, I expected better.  Don't think I'd go out of my way to come back anytime soon.
