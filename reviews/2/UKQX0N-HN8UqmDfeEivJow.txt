I've never understood why this place is always busy.  The flavors just aren't there----it's sort of Mexican food that works in a pinch but never delivers superb recipes.  The service has always been fantastic----they train the staff really well.  George Bush ate here and you can order what he ordered----it's a menu item combo.....
