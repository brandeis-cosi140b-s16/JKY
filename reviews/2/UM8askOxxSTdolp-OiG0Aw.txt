Sitting outside waiting for my husband to order, all the tables are dirty and an employee is sitting at a table with feet up and says to me "you can go inside and tell someone to clean it". Are you that lazy? I have to do your job for you? I hope at least the food is as good as other cafe rio's but so far, this location is pretty dirty, and bad service. Also, the inside seating is very small and very crowded and it's way past the lunch rush.  

After eating the sweet pork salad, which I've had enough times to know how good it is, I can say it was pretty bland at this location. They gave very little meat and were very stingy with the rice and beans. This location needs a new staff.
