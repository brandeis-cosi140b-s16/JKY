I wish I could give this place more stars, but as a TexMex lover from Texas, I just can't bring myself to do it. The chips don't taste homemade at all. The salsa is pretty gross. The queso tastes like total shit. Literally, like a block of Velveta microwaved with nothing added in. The only thing this place has going for it is location, sangria, and an awesome server named Pete.
