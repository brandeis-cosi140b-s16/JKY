I used to love the New Mexican Grill, but the last 3 times have just made me not want to go there anymore. 
First strike - with 45 minutes left until closing, the ice machine had run out of ice and they weren't going to refill it. My husband asked if they could get him some from the back and the answer was "the soda is cold, why do you need ice?" We drank warm soda with our dinner.
Second strike - my debit card won't run through their card machine. It runs everywhere else and I've never had a problem anywhere. I still use it today, everywhere. They refuse to swipe it and they said the chip must be defective. I had no other way to pay so I left. 
Third strike - I  went there last week for fry bread. Middle of the day, lunch time and they were cleaning the fryer. 45 minutes for fry bread. Again, I walked out. 

I hate that they're the only place that sells fry bread. I dread going there as customers don't rank very highly there.
