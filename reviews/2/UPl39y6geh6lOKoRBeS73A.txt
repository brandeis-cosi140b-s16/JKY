We have dined here many times and love the food.  Yesterday we had dinner there.  The temperature was 60 degrees in the place.  Kept my coat on and my fingers were cold.  Our food was also instantly cold.  When we left after asking to raise the heat it was 62.  Was very disappointed and will be a while before we can return.
