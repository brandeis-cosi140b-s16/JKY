Food and server were good. I always find it hard to swallow a place that charges $10-11 for a burrito. I live close and I was hoping for a new drinking spot to walk to that may take the place of the loved Chuy's. Nope! They are serving Coronas for $4.50 each. A 6 pack is $2 at the store.Why bother. They need to reduce their beer prices and get better happy hour and reverse happy hour specials if they want business. Will not go back until I hear of better prices and specials. Chuy's was cheap and good... learn from the success of the company that was there.
