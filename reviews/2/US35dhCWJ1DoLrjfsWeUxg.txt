If this is the best Mexican food Madison has to offer, I feel bad for all Madisonians!  Cool location, looks great from the outside but inside the service was HORRIBLE and the food was just okay.  They charge too much for such a lackluster experience.  Left there feeling very disappointed.  I'm glad this meal is company paid and not coming out of my pocket.
