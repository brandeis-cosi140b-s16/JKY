Nope, no way, never again. This is probably the 5th time we've been here and I've walked away disappointed every time. The customers that we saw eating tonight are a great example of what kind of food and who it's prepared for, old, white people who don't know what Mexican food is and don't like anything with flavor or picante.
From the chips & flavorless salsa to the bland carnitas burrito I really didn't care for anything that we had. Our waitress was pleasant and we did get pretty good service but outside of that I'd be headed to a lot of other places before I go back here again. You've been warned.
