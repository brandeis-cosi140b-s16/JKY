I use to eat at the Jordan's that was located off Central and Thomas years ago when I worked across the street a bunch of us would go weekly and looked forward to it each week. I forgot about this location until I passed it not to long ago and decided since I work not to far to head there for lunch. I got seated right away and served chips and salsa (just like I remembered it) I ordered the personal size cheese crisp with green chilies and a bean Tostada ....well, my food came out VERY quickly. The cheese crisps was cold and the chilies weren't even warm....seems like it had been sitting there for a bit then they threw the chilies on last minute...kind of disappointing. My Tostada on the other hand was good. The service was great but the food was a let down. Not sure if I'll be back soon but if I crave a Tostada I know I'll head over there.
