Visiting from out of town, this was our first stop for lunch.  After traveling for 12 hours, we were hungry, and that may have skewed my appreciation for the food.

The overall feeling at our table was that the food was mediocre.  We got what we ordered, they honored the special requests that one in our group made, but it didn't leave me wanting more or needing to go back.  The service was friendly but not terribly attentive.  I asked for extra napkins which came at the end of our meal, along with the extra salsa I requested.
