Hm, not sure why this place got such high reviews...maybe because most people were tipsy when coming here?  Well, we came here sober cuz we wanted really good tacos and read all the rave reviews.  I told myself and my bf (who was the one who wanted to come here) that driving in Vegas traffic and waiting in this extremely long line better be worth it.  Well sorry my friends, it was sadly not!  It took us about a half hour in the line outside to get to the line inside, lol.  We ordered the spicy pork tacos and a quesadilla and both were just ok - I've had a lot better elsewhere.  Apparently the spicy pork tacos are supposed to be kickass here but for me, they were only meh.  Have you guys ever had really good tacos??!  My theory is that there's not many good taco places on the strip and that's why all the rave reviews?  Who knows, but I'm definitely not coming back here again...
