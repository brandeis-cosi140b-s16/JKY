I love chipotle and have gone to many in the valley. I understand that this one just opened and have been here 3 times, but this last time was horrendous. 1)I wanted a veggie bowl split(I'll pay extra no worries) and the lady looked at me like I was asking something impossible. On top of that there was not even enough veggie left to add to a meat burrito let alone be a half of a veggie burrito and the veggies looked like they had been there for a while. No worries I will wait. 2)I asked for a kids cheese quesadilla. The lady left it on so long not only did it look burnt but it was rock hard! I gave it back to her and said no thank you and she threw it in the garbage and walked off even though I was at the register paying for it. 3)After the manager ran up to me apologizing and making a new quesadilla I paid for chips with my meal and was just so ready to get out of there that I didn't realize I hadn't been given my chips either.....They really need to train their staff better. This gives Chipotle a completely bad name!!!!
