Went here cause I've heard from a few people it was good. Being a huge fan of Mexican food, I had to check it out. Pretty nice happy hour special, half off appetizers. Very nice staff. Food was just ok. Queso dip was the consistency of water. Valle luna is still the best i've had. Manager was very helpful and eager to please, but the food was just ok.
