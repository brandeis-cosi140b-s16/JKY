There really isn't much I liked about this place.  I had a chicken burrito, and was just unimpressed.  The tortilla was average, and everything was just kind of soggy.  The chicken was in sort of a broth, rather than what you'd see at places like Chipotle or Baja Fresh, where it's grilled and diced.  This was more like pulled chicken, though it was larger pieces.

Got a side of the queso sauce too, which looked good, and it was fine, though a little thin.  Try a place like Panchero's for awesome queso.  Had a side of chips and salsa, but again, below average.  

I probably won't come back here, there are too many better options.  Even the Coke wasn't great - the ice is crushed, so it melts quickly, watering down your drink.

Staff was friendly and accommodating, though.  And the place looks good, so it doesn't get just one star.  Service is slow, because they don't seem to have the "assembly line" thing down like at other places (hi, Chipotle).
