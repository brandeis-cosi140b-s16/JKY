Clean fast food restaurant but the food was horrible tasting and looking. The containers that held the food wasn't covered. So the variety of meat, beans and other toppings looked as if it hasn't been refilled, reheated, or at least stirred before we reached the counters.

I ordered three grilled chicken tacos and the tortillas were cold. Only had a nibble of chicken on the tacos so it would pretty much be a veggie taco lol.

Staff was ok, restaurant was very cool but I've definitely experienced better.
