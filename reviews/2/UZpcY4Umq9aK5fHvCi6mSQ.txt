This was not a good experience for anyone in our party. Before we could even sit down after the hostess dropped our menus on our table - we were approached by someone trying to take our photograph and then turn around and sell us the print. We asked her nicely to leave us alone - we all had cameras and had been capturing our vacation on our own. She would not take NO for an answer and had it not been for the fact that we were starving, we would have just got up and left. 

The food was not appealing in any way. The salsa was not fresh, the meat tasted pre-cooked, then reheated. 

One good thing - we took some great pictures of the huge stripper mounted right outside the main entrance!
