Good food but the drive thru service needs working on , the girl who has been there before when I've eaten here still has the same crappy  attitude, that's why most of my business goes to filibertos or Humberto's . They should be appreciative of any business they get in the hole in the wall spot they are in and the arrogant crappy attitude  definitely doesn't help
