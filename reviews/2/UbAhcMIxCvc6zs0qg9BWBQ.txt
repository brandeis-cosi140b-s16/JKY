We arrived during happy hour, were greeted by one of the managers.  The table we wanted to sit at (no one else was in the restaurant) was dirty. The manager told us to sit wherever we wanted, tossed the menus on the adjacent table and walked off like a spoiled teenager whose phone had been taken away. The servers were nice and seemed overly accommodating, after I expressed my displeasure with the manager, however, the first impression was set. I'm sure the manager was having a rough day, but his attitude was quite off putting. This was our first visit and probably our last.
