let me qualify this as I think the food is a 5, the people there are pleasant, but the time to get you food is about a negative -50. I have NEVER consistently waited as long at a fast food place as this Taco Bell location; on a good day about 5 min's to get to the register and then 10 min's after that if ur lucky to get ur food.

Which is a shame because as I said, food is GREAT there and the folks are nicer than you'd expect in a Taco Hell (pardon the pun) and the area of town it in. But you friggin' wait FOREVER for food...today i got in line at 1:16 and got my food at 1:45, in a to-go bag i asked them for because after a 1/2 hr wait I'd burned thru my ability to sit down and eat lunch. I've called their corp. office several times over past 6 mo's w/no change I can see in service.

 I am not going there again any time soon and unless you got 90 mins for lunch and a book to read, you shouldn't either
