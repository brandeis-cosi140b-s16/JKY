We were so excited Cafe Rio was near our new home! Sadly, this is not the same experience you get at a Utah Cafe Rio. The work ethic is far inferior. Long lines because the workers are not efficient, not because they are incredibly busy. Many workers will be standing around while a few work hard, orders are often wrong. You have to ask for someone to clean a table and the floors. They have a rickety table that moves so much it makes you dizzy. The food is pretty good, but the poor service trade off is not worth it when there are other eateries nearby that have better, much better service. (The managers are certainly not dynamic. If I owned Cafe Rio, I would yank this a franchise.)
