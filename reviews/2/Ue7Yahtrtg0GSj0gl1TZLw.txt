Nice design and atmosphere.  Very mediocre service.  Extensive menu that gets your hopes up, but I've never really had anything very good there.  As I live nearby, I can't wait until they are replaced by something else.  It seems popular, but I think people are all pretending to like it.  It's far from a bad place, but it's not good enough to go to in my opinion.
