When you hear about salt these days, it's usually presented as a villain. A lot of people don't understand that when applied reasonably, it is the most important tool in your kitchen.  The cooks at Pure seem to fall into this category, and the mediocre food is quite overpriced for what it is.

Pure was a disappointment.  We went because a coupon mailed out when the restaurant opened was still languishing beneath a magnet on the fridge, but I don't think we'll be going back.  The place has the unfortunate characteristic of placing trendiness over taste.  The decor was cool and the music was loud, but the food was unfortunately bland.  The rice and beans on the side were ok, but the fish tacos and tostadas that were our main courses were forgettable, especially considering that they were not cheap! Both of our meals required a significant amount of at-table salting-and-peppering to have any hint of taste at all.  It's too bad we didn't have the entire spice drawer at our table.  We could have put it to good use.

Now, I'm not the sort of (home) cook who takes offense when people salt or pepper my food after I serve it.  Everyone has different tastes.  However, a diner should never need to pour on as much as we did.

There are better Mexican-ish options in the area, such as Azteca, or heck, even Chipotle.  Skip this one.  I give Pure a point for the service; otherwise, this would be a single-star review.
