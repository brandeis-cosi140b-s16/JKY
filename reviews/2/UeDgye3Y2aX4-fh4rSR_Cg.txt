After experiencing Chipotle  I can say I honestly say I'm not impressed. However, this location is a nightmare due to the traffic congestion.

The food was decent but not spectacular. Its the kind of place you stop by for a quick Mexican meal. In other words you have had better Mexican food but the place just happens to be so much closer than your favorite spot. 

Prices were disappointing. $10 bucks for 3 tacos and charging extra for guacamole??? Must mention there are barely enough seats so be prepared to take your food on the go. All in all, not impressed with this establishment.
