It's Filiberto's. They are all similar, yet there is a considerable difference between shops when it comes to food quality and service.

Like any Filiberto's, the burritos come with pure meat. Wanna add rice or beans? It'll cost ya! Wait... they have to remove meat to fit the rice/beans. Rice and beans are cheaper than meat! Why on earth would anyone charge more money when they are saving money??!?  Senseless.
