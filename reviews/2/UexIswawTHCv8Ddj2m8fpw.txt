I tried Tacos El Gordo in anticipation of a great, quick meal through the rave reviews on Yelp. I'm not one for cow tongue, brain, eyeballs, intestines or any other functional organ. So naturally a wait of over 15 minutes in a very confusing system, (half of the menu is ordered in one line and half in the other) I lost my appetite. 

When I finally got my vegetarian quesadilla the only thing I was tasting subconsciously were the cow parts. Egh. 

They do offer some rad flavours in their soda fountain like tamarind, vanilla and some tropical fruits. The prices are also pretty fantastic so I'd recommend this to those who love their meat. It's just not for me.
