We all need to be honest with ourselves: Canteen is just not very good. We have been lying to ourselves about its quality for far too long and we all need an intervention or something. 

We all want Canteen to be good, because it has helped usher in a slightly more upscale version of Mill with fare that is not your usual college bar. We can agree to give it points for that, but little else. Nothing about Canteen justifies its absurdly-priced margaritas, as 9 bucks for tequila-tinged kool-aid is a farce. We all have had better margaritas and we all know that Canteen's margs spend all day marinating in a pre-mixed jug. The beer selection is hardly impressive (even for Mill) and the staff is a synapse or two above catatonic.

We don't really like Canteen's happy hour anyways, because Z Tejas' is better. We've all had better tacos just about anywhere, because we live in Arizona, a place where tacos rain down on us like a rap video. We don't like Canteen's dance floor or its patio, because both are poorly designed, overcrowded, and noisy to the point of making Nine Inch Nails seem timid. We want to like Canteen, because its better than Zuma, but everything is better than Zuma. I once drank a forty at a bus stop and it was better than Zuma. We have to be willing to accept Canteen as a gateway to a better Mill Ave, but not a truly good bar.

I know we can do this together, Tempe. We have to stop pretending that Canteen is a quality establishment and we have to do the right thing: drink tequila at real tequila bars.
