Great tea and chicken chimi, unfortunately it stopped there. 
First of all the seats are horrible and pitch you forward causing you to have to put your feet up on the table rail to push yourself back onto the seat. We got our drinks, ice tea for both of us, very fresh brewed tea. As a matter of fact, some of the best ever. Then the guacamole came out...not bad but nothing great, wouldn't get it again. Next came the entrees. Chicken chimichanga, Spanish rice, guacamole, black beans and lettuce & tomatoes. Let's go down the list. Chicken chimi: excellent. Spanish rice: inedible. Guacamole: had gone bad, why on the same order one is good and one is bad is beyond me. Black beans: under seasoned, didn't eat 'em. Lettuce & tomatoes: didn't even try it, got one piece of lettuce with a bite of chimi and it was sour.
Now on to the staff. Our waitress was adequate but the wait staff and bar staff on a whole stood around and talked way too much to each other. One of the cooks did little more than talk on his cell phone while waiting on orders. The girl working with him had to literally yell at him in order to get his attention so that he would work.

I won't be going back. If it weren't for the chimi I would have given 1 star.

Update: The assistant manager contacted me and offered coupons to come back or refund my money. I couldn't bring myself to get the coupons to go back nor could I justify getting my money back because then I would feel obligated to go back. No change to my rating, I just thought it fair to let others know that they do seem to care that they get bad feedback.
