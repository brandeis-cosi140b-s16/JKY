The food is much like most other Baja Fresh locations. But it feels a bit sloppier. And they quickly run out of things. Like being completely out of queso after only have been open for less than 3 hours. It also doesn't feel all that clean and has a messy floor and tables. And the salsa bar isn't well kept. The flat screen TV doesn't work, the cords were showing, there were holes in the wall, etc. And then there's the grammar error on kids eat free banner. It was just a sloppy location. Where's Undercover Boss when you need them? The food was edible, albeit not good. The pork carnitas taco wasn't very flavorful and the meat was too tough. The steak on the steak salad was fatty, really thin, and barely included a couple of strips. The tortilla strips on the salad was actually crumbled tortilla chips. The guacamole wasn't good. Etc., etc. And on top of the food quality, I'm definitely not keen on returning to this particular location.
