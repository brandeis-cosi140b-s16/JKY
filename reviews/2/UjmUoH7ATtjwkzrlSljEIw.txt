it's a nice, big place with indoor and outdoor seating, but the tacos I had that were 'on special' were bland, small and expensive. Service was a bit thready too, though I was here for an event and there were a lot of people, we had called ahead of time to let them know, but apparently they didn't take us seriously. Probably wouldn't stop by again unless it was the only choice in the area.
