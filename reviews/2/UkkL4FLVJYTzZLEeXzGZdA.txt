I wanted to like this place.  They obviously spent a fortune on the remodel, but the food and the service don't match their architectural efforts.  I was going to sit at the bar and have a quick bite, and it was just sort of a mess.  Barstools were strewn all over, which I know shouldn't be a big deal, but it's one of those little details I'd never really paid attention to before.  It made  it look like they weren't ready for you.  The staff just seemed like a bunch of kids left to their own devices, dropping silverware and loudly yucking it up.  Pollo fundido was terrible.  Tasted very flour-y, sauce on top was like mushroom soup without the mushrooms.  Whole thing was more like a fried fajita wrap.   Just a disappointing experience.  And I really wanted it to be good.  I hope they straighten out some of their issues.
