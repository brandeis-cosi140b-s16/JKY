I was excited to try this restaurant because it has a cool name and is in a nice area with plenty of upscale shopping. However, the service was very slow. I ordered the chicken fajitas. They were okay. The chicken was good but the grilled veggies were not the best. No rice or beans came with the fajitas, which was odd. Also, the guacamole that came with it was basically a giant chunk of avocado in a cup. I was not wowed by this restaurant and have definitely had much better Mexican food. The atmosphere was fun, though, and the waiter was pretty nice.
