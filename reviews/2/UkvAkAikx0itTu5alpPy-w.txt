I absolutely love Chipotle and have always had a good experience however I did not at this location. Unfortunately, I experienced horrible customer service. The workers did not even acknowledge that we were there until we said something.  We finally received our guacamole and chips after several minutes of waiting. The lady behind the counter had the worst attitude. We asked a question and instead of giving us a nice reply she just shook her head. I am very disappointed with this location because it gives a horrible reputation to Chipotle.
