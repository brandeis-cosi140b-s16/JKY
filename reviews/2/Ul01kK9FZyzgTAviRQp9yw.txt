I'm taking a long break from this location. I've been here 3 times...the last 2 visits I've had issues. Once, I ordered 3 carnitas soft tacos, which came w/ moldy taco shells. My last visit I ordered a carnitas burrito. My first bite included a huge piece of plastic bag (like they cut open something into the tub and let the plastic fall in w/ it).
I'll stick to my normal location for a bit.
