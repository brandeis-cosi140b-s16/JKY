Chipotle is definitely one of my favorite quick meal establishments, but this location always seems to make everything far too spicy. I don't know if they are putting too much seasoning on or what, but I've come out of here gasping on some occasions.

I do also agree with Bryan S. that the employees are of a lower caliber than usual and the servings sizes are all wrong. I've never come out of a Chipotle hungry until I started visiting this location.
