As Yelp says, "Meh. I've experienced better." I was expecting some bomb Mexican food based on the yelp reviews I've seen, but dang! 
I know authentic Mexican. I grew up eating it & can make it myself, and this was completely subpar. I've pretty much lost faith in Mexican food in the Phoenix area. :(.
The cleanliness of the service was questionable. (Maybe invest in multiple spoons for serving meats. I'd hate to have a pork allergy flare up after having you grab my carne asada [beef] with the spoon in the pork container). The food itself was just meh... Very little flavor and no sass. I'm disappointed. :(
