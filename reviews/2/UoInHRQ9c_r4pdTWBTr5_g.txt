first time here and I won't be back. place was criminally understaffed for a lunch rush especially considering it's located within a busy office park. the regular sized burrito was 75% empty tortilla and what little steak they included was cold - I guess they're encouraging you to pay for a large burrito, but who would want to eat that much cold meat is beyond me. chips and salsa were stuff you could find in any grocery isle. overall not worse than the time I ate a dead frog, but not worth going back again
