Yuck. Had a "carnitas" burrito. More like stewed, watery pork in a less-than-passable tortilla. My friend had the chicken and steak tacos. All I can say is BLECH. Made with something like American shredded cheese and then possibly deep fried; Jack In The Box makes better tacos. 
On another note, all the trash bins were overflowing. Nice touch (sarcastically said) to a less than spectacular burrito and taco experience.
