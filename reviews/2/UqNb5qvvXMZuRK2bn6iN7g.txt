Jalapeno Inferno (the nearest Mexican restaurant) has nothing to worry about.  With one exception, the food was simply bland.  We started with the shrimp ceviche and guacamole.  Both were completely unremarkable, having very little flavor and no value with respect to presentation.  My finance had the salmon salad.  It was edible, but not good.  I had the steak fajitas.  Unlike the rest of the dishes we ordered, they were very good.  

Although our server was very nice and responsive, he simply did not know the menu and appeared lost most of the time.   We observed similar behavior from the rest of the wait staff.   

The one are in which the restaurant excels is the d√©cor.  It is very modern and well-done.  At the end of the day, we will not return to this restaurant and, unfortunately, cannot recommend it to others.
