I am mexican...and I know mexican food.

Food here is greasy and old.

I was there three times while at a conference at the convention center...I stayed the night at the Hyatt during the time.

I ordered Chicken Flautas and the plate came with rice and beans.  The rice was dry and looked as if it was at least 2 days old..left in the open air..the top of it was dry crusty...yuck.  I felt the food was slopped on my plate and it was VERY greasy.  Place is very casual..but the carpets are REALLY dirty and smelly...almost as if someone urinated in the dark corners...this place converts to a night club on certain nights..so maybe thats why the place smells like spilled drinks and vomit and urine in the dark corners.....

Drinks were delish.... the Bartender Pamela is a sweetheart and the only reason I gave this place a 2nd and 3rd chance...I mainly went there for the free appetizers and sat at the bar and talked to Pamela while she served me yummy sweet drinks!  You can't get a bartender like her ANYWHERE!! just wish the food was better!
