WAY overrated.  Very bland food. Will not return.

I guess I'll just have to take my parochial taste buds back to my home town, Hermosillo, Mexico, and see if I can educate myself on real Mexican food.  

I was sure I wouldn't return but now I'm sure I'll spread the word that this place is owned by disrespectful, and tactless individuals.  

The service was perfect, just work on the seasoning.
