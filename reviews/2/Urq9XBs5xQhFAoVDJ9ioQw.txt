For full disclosure, I am a Zabas fan more than a Chipotle advocate. That being said, Zabas had just closed for the evening and I figured I could get a similar meal by going to this location, just down the street. I was disappointed on so many levels in such a short amount of time it's still boggling my mind. Walking in, there was nobody in line yet it took 2-3 minutes for the staff of 4-5 to notice me. Once my fianc√© and I started ordering, the portion size of the meat and vegetables was laughable and it was embarrassing to ask to put more of the items on our burrito and salad. I would say that my burrito came out to 70% of the size of a Zabas burrito. Every item was ice cold. Every item had little to no taste and by "every item", I mean the very limited selection of sub-par extra choices. The (store bought) chips were probably the highlight of the meal. The pico was downright terrible. All of this goodness (one burrito, one salad, chips, and one drink) cost over $26.00... So if you're in the mood for overpriced, under seasoned, icy cold, tiny portioned food, be my guest. If you're not, take a trip a mile down the road and get your money's worth.
