Fish tacos are good, but nothing exciting. First few bites of the Maui bowl was ok then the rest of the meat was very tough. Seems it's a place to hang out and have a beer at the bar. The view at night is nice from the bar, but the food is not all that. The place is missing something, it's trying, but it's missing....
