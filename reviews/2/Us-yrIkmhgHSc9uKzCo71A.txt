The tacos are really good, 5 stars but I am only giving it two stars because of the way you have to order your tacos. Three separate lines for every meat.. I don't see how this makes things go smoother or faster.  We were in line for 45 mins and had to stick with one kind of meat because we were not going to be back in line again.  I'd like to go back next time I'm in Vegas but I'll have to go during the day with hopes that the lines are not as bad as wednesday night.  I wanted to try the Al pastor.. It looked real good..maybe next time.
