Okay Baja Fresh, I like you.

But, I like Chipotle better.

I usually get some kind of salad bowl thingy from Chipotle, so I tried Baja's grilled chicken bowl, but it didn't really stand up.

It was just okay, but not great.

The grilled chicken was fresh, but I can't figure out what they put on it so that it came chargrilled orange. (?)  Strange, but the taste was okay.

The chips that come with every meal are pretty bland and seemed a bit stale.

There were some okay sauces on the salsa bar.  I did like that part, but the ones behind the counter at Chipotle are better.

And just in case you want Chipotle now, there is one in the same shopping center as this one. Ha.
