I have been here twice now...and I was completely underwhelmed both times.  The first time the service was terrible, even though there were only a few tables occupied at the restaurant.

On my second visit I was with a group and we were having a 3 course menu.  We started with the duck tacos, and I was very excited about these, but when they came out, they were smothered in enchilada sauce.  A taco is supposed to be a food that you can pick up with your hands and eat, these needed a fork.  The sauce was very overpowering, so the duck flavor was hidden.  For my entree, I chose the Chicken Enchiladas....when they came out, I thought I was being punked, they looked just like the duck tacos, only bigger.  I took a bite, and they tasted just like the duck tacos too!   The same sauce was used, and once again, it masked the flavor of the filling.  Our table was very confused as to why these two dishes were exactly the same yet, one was called a taco and the other an enchilada.

The chips and salsa were decent, as was the Mexican Lime Tart, but I will probably only return if it is for some sort of group event...this is not somewhere I would chose to go on my own.
