Love the concept of Sandbar. But they try to sneak in smaller portions. Also, all 8 times I have been here, the bill was "accidentally" charged full price instead of Sunday-football drink prices. All 8 times. You can say, "OMG, I'm so sorry," so many times until you are no longer believable. Where is your integrity?
