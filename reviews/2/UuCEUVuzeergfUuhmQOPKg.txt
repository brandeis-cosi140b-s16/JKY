If I could give the food four stars and the service one star, I would. That being said, perhaps I went into this restaurant on a bad day. Initially, the service was great and our waiter, Rodrigo was certainly trying his best, but the dining experience fell short and the horrible service was a distraction from the great food. At one point, I had to wait fifteen minutes to have my glass of water refilled as I tried to catch the attention of a waiter and watched the table next to us have their glasses refilled twice. To say the least, the experience was odd. For such a nice (and moderately expensive restaurant) a couple of the servers had terrible adequate. Personally, I go out to eat for the entire experience. If I had wanted good food, I could've made it for myself at home...dining out should be about more than just an expensive meal and attractive decor. I don't think I would go back if given the choice. Ultimately, despite the good food, SOL Cocina left a bad taste in my mouth.
