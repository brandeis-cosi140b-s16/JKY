It drives me nuts how every time I order a taco or burrito without the sauce, they still go right ahead and put the sauce on it.  Not some of the time, or most of the time, but every single time.  Sometimes, with the tacos, they even cover it up with extra cabbage or lettuce on top so I don't see it until I get home.  For that reason, I usually order the chicken or steak street tacos since they don't come with that gross white sauce that they put all over their seafood items.  But every once in a while I feel like a shrimp or fish taco and invariably when I get home with my takeout and taste my first bite, I realize that they put the d#!@ sauce on there.  I don't like tarter sauce or mayo or any of those creamy sauces.  I don't know why they put it on there in the first place since they have the yummy salsas for you to add to your food to your own liking.  Which leads me to another complaint that I have.  The last few times I have been to this Rubio's, they are out of the spicy carrots.  Nothing left in the container except jalepenos and liquid.  And one time I got some of the chopped onion and I could tell after one bite that it had gone bad.  A little more attention to the condiments, please!

Get it together guys, or I will stop coming here. Even though it really convenient, if I can't eat my food when I get takeout or have to wait around while you make it twice when dining in, then why would I want to return?
