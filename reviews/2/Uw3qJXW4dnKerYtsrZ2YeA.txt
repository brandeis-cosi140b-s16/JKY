I went in at around noon on a Saturday.  There were about a dozen people in the restaurant eating.  I was behind two other customers in line.  I placed my order and then waited -- and waited -- and waited.  After 15 minutes, they finally called the number for the guy AFTER me.  Five minutes later I got my food.  Seriously -- 20 minutes of waiting for a taco, rice and nachos.  They have two prep lines, but only one was being used, and on a Saturday at lunch time.  The food was good, but the service and wait time sucked.  When the guy handed me my tray, he did say 'sorry about the wait' -- but he said it like an automaton without any sincerity whatsoever.  This is one Taco Bell I won't be coming back to.
