Ate here in the early afternoon. Boyfriend got a breakfast burrito, I got a shredded beef burrito. His was dripping some weird watery greasy crap..mine made me sick instantly after. Unless I'm eating bean and cheese burritos from here late at night..I'll pass. Why not just go to Amado's or Filly B's?
