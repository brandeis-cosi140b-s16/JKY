This review is very frustrating to write because the food is good, especially the skillet chicken.  What isn't good, however, is the situation with the chips and salsa.  For whatever reason, this restaurant decides to mix flour crisps and corn chips in the bowl on the table, while providing a gluten free menu.  I didn't know there was flour mixed into the corn chip bowl until it was too late.  This is very risky, and they should have a sign to notify diners of this before they start eating the chips.  Management - Please either separate the corn and flour chips, or warn diners when the bowl is placed on the table.  I do not appreciate getting sick from unknowingly eating gluten.
