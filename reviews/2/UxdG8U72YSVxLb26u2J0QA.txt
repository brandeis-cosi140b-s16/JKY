Who told Carlos Santana to open a restaurant chain? Between his god-awful shoe collection (apparently designed exclusively for hookers and the colorblind) and his collaborations with Rob Thomas (is that guy still around?), I would have thought he was pretty busy. But nope, no such luck.

Enter Maria Maria, conveniently located at our newest soon-to-be-rundown fake-urban mall, Tempe Marketplace. It is, of course, a chain. But you knew that. It's pretty inside, though, and arguably less crass than some of its neighbors (*cough* Lucille's *cough*). 

Work lunch. Not my choice, but I'm game. Wait, how much for some enchiladas? $17? And no lunch menu? You've got to be fucking kidding me, hombre. I'm all for Nuevo Mexicano but we are at the goddamned MALL, Carlos. And that's a lot of dinero for some tortillas and beef. 

The food was...fine. Not gross, just boring as hell. The guacamole was pretty good, but considering its size (not huge) and price (I forget - maybe $10) it wasn't memorable. If you're prepared to go the pricey guac route, just go to Los Sombreros instead.

When it comes to Maria Maria, I think Carlos said it best: "Just forget about it."
