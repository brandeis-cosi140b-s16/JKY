Sadly, another disappointing addition to the Cave Creek dining scene. Man, we really (as in desperately, really really desperately) need something decent up here - but this ain't it. If any restaurant developers or entrepreneurs are reading this - a decent, independent restaurant with a good bar and wine list would be mobbed! I think Tatum Ranch alone has 10k residents with basically nowhere to eat.

We've been here 3 times, all mediocre at best. Our last visit kind of sealed the deal on us never returning.

Outside patio area is nice, especially the booths! Great during nice evenings. Nonstop chips. They have really trained their servers and wait staff very well how to serve and cater to the customers. My only (weird) complaint really is that there isn't much "personality" amongst the employees/servers - it's obviously a very well-honed serving system that they have trained their people on, but it lacks authenticity a bit. It's not really a complaint, but it just feels a bit off I guess.

The food is pretty gross. My husband ordered the pollo fundido and the chicken MUST HAVE been frozen chicken. I could be wrong, but it tasted and looked just like that weird frozen, fake defrosted chicken color and tasted just like weird frozen defrosted chicken with the fake grill lines. It was literally inedible and gag-worthy. For a Mexican restaurant where pollo is front and center in most dishes, this is inexcusable. 

I am SO SO SO sad that we don't have another new restaurant to frequent. I will stick with Amaro next door that is so underrated that it's shocking. I love that place.
