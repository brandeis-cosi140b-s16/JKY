Went there around 8pm on a Friday and there was a queue and the place was packed. First time here and heard good things about this place so I figured I'd wait the line. The ordering chit provided was not very intuitive but there was plenty of variety to customize your meal. The wait was long enough to figure out what I wanted. Closer towards the ordering counter, there were pictures of the entrees so I figured I'd just order the 14!

The loud man at the cashier barked for me to come up and place my order. He gave me a scowl when he learned that I hadn't completed the order paper. He tossed it aside and rolled his eyes when I asked for the 14. 

The food was not bad. The place was crowded and cheap looking (why are the walls painted white?). Trash on the ground and around the soda, napkin, straws table. All the patrons seemed to be enjoying themselves and the place was loud just from the buzz of conversation. I can't remember if there was music or not. 

The customer service is ugly!! I mean, those employees are rude. I don't see why people are crazy about this place. Two stars only cause the food was tasty. I won't be returning.
