What happened to our beloved Chipotle?
We wanted some burrito goodness before the movie and now we're just sad. We experienced the slowest service ever. Because they were out of carnitas ("supply issue") we ordered steak. They were out of mild salsa as well. (no excuse posted for that) However we were handed what I can only call burrito balls. The two-hand burritos have shrunk by 25% at least. Then, to make their fall from grace complete, we had to pull at least half of our steak out. It was inedible gristle.
So very disappointed. I pray my popcorn is okay later.
