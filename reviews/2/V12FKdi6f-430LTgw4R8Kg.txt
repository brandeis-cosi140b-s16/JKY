I ordered the California burrito, Carne Asada, potatoes, cheese and pico. I added avocado and got it enchilada style. 
Once I got home and looked in the to go box I was very impressed. The portion was enormous and looked and smelled so good. 
The first bite is where it all went wrong...it was like eating a salt burrito. I have never eaten anything so salty! 

Too bad....
