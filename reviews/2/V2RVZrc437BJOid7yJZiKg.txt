The guy working the counter screwed up the order, which was very simple, a crunchy chicken gordita, with only chicken and cheese. Initially he put in for a beef gordita, then got an attitude when we pointed out the mistake. What we got was a soft gordita, when we went back, the guy was more concerned with sweeping then getting the order right, the manager stepped up and took care of it, but the counter person could have at least apologized.
