It's a chain restaurant, I guess so what can you expect? I was a tourist in town for MLB "spring training" and this place was right near the KC Royals' stadium. Had the chimichangas and maybe they'd spent too long in the warming area so they had gotten awfully chewy. I'd been hungry but it was too much trouble to eat these.
