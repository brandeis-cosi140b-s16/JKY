My fellow yelpers let me down!!  :-(

There is no way this is a 4.5-5 star place.  No way.  Not even close.  Go to La Tolteca and then try to tell me this is a 4-star joint.  Seriously.

I learned of this place because of restaurant.com.  I saw an offer there, so I came here to check them out.  I see 4.5 stars.  I'm thinking "great!".  So I snag the certificate.

We show up, and it's a hole in the wall.  Which is fine.  Some great food sometimes can be found in such places.  Inside was sort of divey.  Again, that's fine.  We both ordered combos.  I got the chimi (because I almost always do when checking out a new place), and my wife got the asada.  They apparently have only one chimi (beef).  I usually get chicken or machaca, but oh well.  Staff was friendly enough, so far so good.

The chimi was well-cooked.  The tortilla was light and crispy.  The one in the asada burro was fresh.  Again, so far so good.  But that's really where the goodness ended.  The chimi had basically no flavor.  And they did not provide any pico to put on it (they actually CHARGE for a tiny cup of pico).  The guacamole appeared to be fresh, but tasted like nothing more than mashed avocado.  It should have some zip to it.  It's more than just mashed avocado, but it sure didn't taste like it.

The asada burro was a bit better in flavor, but the meat was grisly.  Excessively so.  And the flavor was only marginally better than my chimi.

I would take this place over one of the national chains like Taco Bell, but there are so many better places than this that I can't see coming back here.  They weren't horrible, but "meh, I've experienced better".  For sure.
