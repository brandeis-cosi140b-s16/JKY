I came to this restaurant hoping that their Mexican food was better than their Cuban food, because they're not good at cooking it. The papa rellena was salty, the ground beef used for the filling was really greasy. Their black beans were flavorless, the platano frito was unevenly cooked, and the bread on the Cuban sandwich was burnt. It seems like they half-assed everything.   
Nevertheless, I never found out if they could make good Mexican food, because the two empty headed waitresses that work on a Saturday night seemed oblivious to the fact  that  I was still waiting for my order to be taken. I was in plain view(menu on the table) and one walked by me. After feeling that my time had been wasted enough, I left.  
I am only giving them two stars because I liked their salsa and chips, and the vibrant decor of the restaurant.  I dislike posting negative reviews, but  this place upsetted me.
