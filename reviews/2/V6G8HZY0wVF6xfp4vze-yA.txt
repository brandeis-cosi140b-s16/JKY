Very dissappointed with the customer service. Went there on Friday, 11/15/13 with my family. The waitress spent most of her time trying to upsale. She encouraged us to get extra cream cheese with out pollo con queso (in which we ordered 3). We did, and of course we were charged for the extra cream cheese. My son ordered the kids meal and I explained to her that it comes with a free drink. She already inputted the charge and stated that she would speak with her manager. She never removed the item from the bill. Normally, we overtip on our bill. We usually leave approximately 15% if the service was poor. We left an $11 tip on our bill that was $70.44 ($81.44 after tip) due to the poor service. I checked my bank account today and noticed that our waitress added an extra $1. Total amount charged was $82.44. Ajo Al's just lost a customer for life.
