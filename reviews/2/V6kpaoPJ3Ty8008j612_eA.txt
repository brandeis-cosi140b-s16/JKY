Tried Nandos for lunch.  Food is bland and salsa was not very good at all.  Tasted like something out of a bottle and just loaded it with chili flakes.  Good size portions, but that doesn't make up for the bland food and it was pricey....I don't see anything special about $9-10 for lunch specials!  Only reason I am giving it 2 stars is because their chips are good....sorry, but will check this one off our list :(
