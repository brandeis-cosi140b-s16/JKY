I ate here last week and have to say that it is worthy of three stars with the good attentive service however the entire time I was eating a small child was screaming at the top of his lungs , while mom and the restaurant did absolutely nothing about it. I will go one more time and see if things are better but their camarones a la diabla were not very good and they did not make it nearly hot enough for me. Obviously I will try another dish to see if it is cooked any better than my favorite.
