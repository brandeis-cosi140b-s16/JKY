I wasn't really very impressed. Bajio isn't *bad* by any stretch, but it's certainly nothing to really rave about.

The prices were a little steep for what you get and everything (keep in mind, this is mexican food) was oddly sweet for some reason...and that struck me oddly. 

Burritos and such, served in a very Chipotle-esque fashion, but for a few bucks more than Chipotle. 

I don't believe I'll be returning. Not because it was a negative experience, just exceptionally "meh".
