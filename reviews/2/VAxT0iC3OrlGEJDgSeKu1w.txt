Ok so this is a glorified airport Chili's so I had low expectations to start with. My margarita is pretty good, but expensive. I wish I could tell you about the food. Fact of the matter is, I've been here for almost an hour now. No sign of my burrito. Aren't most people here in a hurry? 

This is going to need to be one delicious burrito. Too slow service for an airport. I should have walked the mile to the Moe's in the A gates. Lesson learned. 

Avoid.
