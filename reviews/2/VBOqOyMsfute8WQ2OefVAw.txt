We went on a Friday night hoping for a quick meal. There was a six-piece Mariachi band playing in the restaurant (though didn't feel like it was the night's entertainment, maybe playing specifically for someone at the bar) and it was so loud, we decided to go for takeout. The waitress seemed rude and took a while before she took our order, and then we waited for another 15 before we got our food. The waitress was rude when we paid as well. On top of that, the food wasn't that good. The salsa tastes like vinegar, and my husband's tacos were corn and small even though he asked for flour. I had the vegetarian burrito, which was okay, but the guacamole on top tasted like dust.
