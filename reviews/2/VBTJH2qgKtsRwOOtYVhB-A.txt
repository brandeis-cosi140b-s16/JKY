This must've been an off night for them because I've eaten here and seen shows here before and raved about it to my coworkers afterwards. Service was slow, the kitchen got my wife's order wrong, and my drink (iced tea) didn't make it to my table until after my dinner did, and I had asked two different people for it. My impression was that staff were overwhelmed. Perhaps in the future when the Crescent Ballroom sells out a venue, they should staff a little heavier. On a positive note, my quesadilla was good, and they took my wife's order off the bill.
