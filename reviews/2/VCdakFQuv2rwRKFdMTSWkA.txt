Here's the thing--I like salty food. But, I feel like I'm being served in a third world country. Long winding lines for food--check. Food splashed all over the serving dishes and surrounding areas--check. If you go later in the day, items are not refreshed and it looks like a condiment junk yard, anything left is scraped from almost empty containers. Food flopped on trays--check. Mayhem in food prep area (people crossing others paths, reaching over others, melting cheese in tortillas on foil trays)--check. Parking is a nightmare. Basically, the polar opposite of a positive and appetizing experience. I have to assume the owners are currently raking in money until they shut this place down (or city inspectors do it for them).
