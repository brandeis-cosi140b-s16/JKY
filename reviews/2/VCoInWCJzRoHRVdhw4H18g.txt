Great for breakfast. Bad for lunch.

Breakfast items tend to be good (though, oddly, bagels seems to be an afterthought). I like the Huevos Rancheros. My friend likes the Western Omelet. Lots of free refills on drinks. Quick and friendly service.

However: 
Lunch/Dinner items are heavy on the pre-fab, deep fried side. 

Example: I ordered the special of the day "Fish and Chips".
The fish was two processed squares of what you might get in a McFood Filet-o-fish. The "chips" were standard frozen french fries (not even steak fries). Bleh..

Another example: the Chicken Parmesan was little deep-fried, battered chunks of Chinese fast-food style chicken served on watery pasta. Really not good.

I would like this place to do well because it is a convenient place for me to get a quick and hearty breakfast - but they'd better get their lunch game up to speed.
