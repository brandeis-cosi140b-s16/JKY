I got this place off one of my friends pages I should have asked her first‼‼ 

The only thing good about this place was its drinks and its fried bananas and ice cream 

Service was shitty no one is friendly and they seemed liked they only had one person working! 

I saw I would assume the "manager" or "owner" stick HIS HANDS DOWN HIS PANTS  what type of crap is that??? 

I would never recommended this place
