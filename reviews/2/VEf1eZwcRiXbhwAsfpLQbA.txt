I'd say sub-par / three stars would've been generous - the meat tasted good... But in pretty sure that it made me sick about 30mins later. The tacos were soggy / and there was excessive amounts of fat in the meat. 

The service was mediocre, I guess you can't expect too much from an airport stop / but, this wasn't somewhere I'd choose again.

Perhaps find somewhere with more standard food, if you have a sensitive stomach.
