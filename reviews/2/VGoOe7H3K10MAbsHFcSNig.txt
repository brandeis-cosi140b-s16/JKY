Not worth the hype! Servers were very nice but that was pretty much it. We went for a group dinner and were extremely disappointed - the food was not very good and too overpriced. I don't mind paying for good food, but this was not good at all. Everything was too spicy and salty and served cold. The only good thing on the menu was the guacamole which was served table side and the kale salad. Also make sure that when they sell you on the wines they give you the real story and not a fancy one to try to up sell you. Won't be going back.
