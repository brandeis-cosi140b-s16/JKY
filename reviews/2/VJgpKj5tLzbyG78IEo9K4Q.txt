Maybe I'm spoiled being from California, but this wasn't great (Tex) Mexican food. The service was fast and nice, but my chips were stale and the black bean burger was quite bland and underwhelming. I also loathe any sit-down restaurant that charges for chips and salsa...it's seriously absurd. 

In summary--bland and way overpriced.
