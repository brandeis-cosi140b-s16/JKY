I like Cafe Rio but this location is different.  It is the service that sets it apart and not in a good way.  I've been to this location 3 times and each time there was at least one undesirable encounter with the workers.  It is almost as if they are making money with or without customers.  Not very good attitude and almost condescending!!!
