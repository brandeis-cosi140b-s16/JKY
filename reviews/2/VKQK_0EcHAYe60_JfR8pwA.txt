Normally I would give Cafe Rio 4 stars. I like their steak burritos (enchilada style) and the queso dip is tasty. I was sad, though, that they got my online order wrong. I absolutely do not like rice in my burrito. They missed that detail/request. If you place a to go order make sure to check it before you leave the store. My burrito excitement was quickly deflated as soon as I cut into the burrito and I saw rice fall out.
