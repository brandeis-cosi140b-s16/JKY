Friendly staff but everything else is just bad, ( accept the salsa that comes with the chips... Which you do pay for ) first of all it's called tacos and beer but when you go in it doesn't feel like a place to relax and drink a beer it's more like a stuffy date restaurant with low lighting, they are really over priced for the portions they give and their food is nothing special. It's really uncomfortable if you have kids and the tables are over crowded with stuff. Would never eat there again and I love mexican food.
