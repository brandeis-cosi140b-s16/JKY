Came here cuz of the fantastic reviews on Yelp. I was sorely disappointed. There is no AC and its super hot and sweaty in here, that already diminished the dining experience. The meat slowly spins over a small fire and looks fantastic when the guy cuts it fresh on to your taco for you. Thats about where all the frills end, the meat tastes just OK. The sauce is refreshing and a nice complement, but overall everything was just.... meh. I'm glad I only had to wait 5 minutes or so in line.
