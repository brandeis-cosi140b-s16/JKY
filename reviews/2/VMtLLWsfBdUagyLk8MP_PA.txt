Mediocre food. My burrito was cold, the tortilla was stale, and the filings insipid. And the serving plate seemed to have been chilled, not heated. The margarita was also quite pedestrian, just some tequila and mixer out of a bottle. 

One additional star for the waiter that did not suck at his job.
