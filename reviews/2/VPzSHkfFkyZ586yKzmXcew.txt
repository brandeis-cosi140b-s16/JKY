I don't understand the ridiculous pricing.  I had the lobster enchilada and it literally had NO flavor.  The seafood inside the enchilada and the stuffed pepper was so overcooked it was rubber.  However, there was a seafood taco that came with my meal that was delicious.  Someone else in our party ordered the tabli, which is a large butcher block full of different kinds of meat.  The beef was delicious; however the pork and chicken were both very dry, tough and hard to eat.  The refried beans were absolutely disgusting and inedible.  I don't understand how this restaurant can get beans wrong.  

Unbeknownst to me, my husband ordered bottled waters for the table.  I made a comment that it tasted like the tap water at our home, and he told it was bottled.  BEWARE!  The bottled waters they brought were bottles that were being refilled from a tap.  They were not labeled and were not opened in front of us (I'm sure that's because they are reusing the bottles).  The small bottles were 10$ each!  I don't know exactly what they are doing, but I highly suspect that it's some sort of scam.  I asked the waiter to bring me regular water so that I could see the difference, and the regular water actually tasted better!  hmmmmm.....

The music was so loud that it is very difficult to have a conversation with someone accross the table.  Definitely not the place for a date.  It was my daughter's last night before she left back for college and it was extremely frustrating not to be able to have a nice conversation over our last meal together.

I won't go back here unless someone else is paying.  As a local, it felt like a tourist trap.
