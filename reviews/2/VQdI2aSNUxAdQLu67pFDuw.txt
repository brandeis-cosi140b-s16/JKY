There's a reason everyone calls this place La Canasty. Only saving grace is I can get a breakfast burrito at 6 am before I get to work.  Other than that the meat is grade D, like boiled meat, and the tortillas are really thick and never toasted on grill. Place is dirty as hell and prices are too high.
