Went to del taco a couple of nights ago with my son. and when we got there around 7:20pm the doors were locked and was told the dining room was closed. Reported it to corporate and just got a call from a manager that treated me like an Idiot and didn't know which doors to use. Saying she advises her managers to lock all doors at dark so no customers can eat in the dining room. Don't know whats going on with this del taco. or its managers. Something needs to be done about this. Managers should never treat customers like they're idiots.
