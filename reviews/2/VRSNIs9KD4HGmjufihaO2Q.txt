Murder mystery dinner... Walked into the restaurant and the servers stare right through you.  Waited a few minutes and finally sat myself.  Another few minutes goes by before someone even comes to table albeit looks very annoyed.  Placed orders for taco Tuesday ordered a variety of tacos while snacking on chips and salsa in a bowl that only serves about two bites.  20 min later receive good with nobody coming by in the meantime to refill drinks or refresh chips and salsa.  Look at food and notice some have avocado after explicitly telling server that it could not be there due to food allergy.  My co-worker did not even receive the right tacos that he ordered.   Brought it up as we were asking for check as this was the only time we saw our server and Was not offered to be comped for the mess up. The only reason this place gets two stars was because the tacos that I could eat were actually pretty good. Will never go back.
