Don't go to eat only! it's not a great restaurant, food is ok, server was cold and dismissive , tables and chairs are beat up and uncomfortable, salsa is out of a can. But it is a great place to go chill and drink with friends. I had a margarita and it was good. I would come back with friends to pre game or have a night out but not for a family dinner or anything like that.
