The dinner we had here was OK... nothing to rave about. The tortilla chips were very good as others have mentioned... a mix of corn and deep fried flour chips. The salsa was OK... lots of fresh tomato chunks but not much kick. We shared "steak fajitas for two"... plenty of tenderized flank steak but not much seasoning. The sides of Mexican rice and re-fried beans were bland... didn't taste homemade (could be). Gringo Mex as others have mentioned.
The margaritas were blended well... not too large but they did have a kick to them. 
We were told the drink/appetizer happy hour specials only apply to the bar area... only after we were seated in the dining room (they did offer to let us move). I've run into this a few times... think it should be stated up front. From reading other reviews, it sounds like they may honor happy hour rates on the patio as well (we were not told this)??
The service was OK... a bit slow at the end but I think our waiter was in training and the place was very crowded (on a weeknight!). The noise level didn't add to the ambiance. 
I wouldn't really rush to come back here. I might stop in and give it another chance if I were nearby to try some appetizer and drink specials... seated in the bar area.
