Not very good.  I had the salmon and the BBQ wasn't very good.  The veggies were supposed to be grilled but didn't appear to be.  My father had the ultimate fajita which included pulled pork.  We've never been to a Mexican restaurant that had that in it.  He was also disappointed with his food.  On the plus side the staff is friendly.
