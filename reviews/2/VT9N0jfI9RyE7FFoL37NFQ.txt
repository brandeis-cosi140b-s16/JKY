My husband and I went to Nacho Daddy hoping a new Mexican restaurant was opening in our area.  We were very disappointed when we arrived and were told the entire menu was not avail, only nachos and sandwiches.  Why would you open a restaurant and not have everything available?  When we looked at the menu, is was a disappointment because it is not at all a typical Mexican restaurant.  Not wanting to get in our car and drive to another place, we ordered nachos.  They were a big disappointment.  We ordered taco meat on ours, and it had more grease on the plate, than meat.  There were barely any chips on the plate - way too little food for the price.  The only bright spot were the margaritas - which were quite tasty.  The waitress was friendly, and everyone seemed to be very unsure of themselves.  It's a shame to spend big bucks to go into a location, spend big bucks to decorate and hire folks, then make a bad first impression. To the owners - don't open until you are ready.  Try out things for a week or so on "invited guests" then open when you are ready.  You have only one chance to make a good first impression.
