What was once Zanders, then Moe's, now Diegos in the matter of less than two years.

Came here for a weekday lunch and ordered the fish tacos.  (see uploaded picture)

The tacos themselves were average.  Nothing spectacular, but nothing to complain about.  The beans were terrible.  They were very bland, not very warm, and poor consistency.  Rice was ok.

Service was appropriate.   

Their atmosphere is hard to review.  It's basically a bar-restaurant scene.  I have nothing against this type of setup, it just doesn't deserve any extra points.   We sat at a high top table next to the bar where they were showing soccer matches on ESPN.

2 stars for a mexican restaurant messing up refried beans, and only average tacos.
