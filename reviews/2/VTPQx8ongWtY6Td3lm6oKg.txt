This place has gone downhill..every other time we had came the food was awesome and the service was ok since they are busy they try here and there to see if everything is ok and if we needed anything but the last two times and today food was just bland, customer service sucked..took us more than hour just to get out of there to pay! And it was not busy at all today. Only once they came on their own to see if everything was ok...didn't freaking ask us if we wanted refills the many times they've passed by to take other people's orders...and to wait for the bill or boxes to take leftovers was just ridiculous...I think it's just better to come when they are super busy that's the only time u will get good service! Btw you would expect great customer service with everything being so overpriced so if you expect to get what you paid for then this place isn't it....
