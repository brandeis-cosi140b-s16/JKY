Pretty bland and uninspiring!  Wife and I ate here one night when we had to be out of the house due to the A/C going out on a very hot day.  We thought we would try this place because Mexican food sounded good.  It was average.  The prices were average, the food was average, the service was below average.  I had a combo of a taco and enchilada with machaca (usually a very flavorful meat) - it was pretty blah.  My wife had the pollo something - basically a chicken chimi with a cheesey sauce.  The chicken was a bit off - she scraped it out and mostly ate the accompanying beans and rice.  Given the opportunity, we would probably not go here again.  If we want good mexican, we will bite the bullet and leave the Anthem area.
