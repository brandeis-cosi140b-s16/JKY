Well, it's safe to say that the majority of the reviewers were right when they said this is NOT authentic Mexican food. I usually like to see things for myself, and since we got a deal on dinner and a show we chose this place and the Vegas show (which is a must-see!). Anyway, we made a reservation because we were going to come in during the dinner rush (6:45), I figured they'd be packed and it'd be plenty of time to make our 9:00 show. We got there around 6:45-6:50 and the place barely had anyone in it so we were seated quickly. Once we told them we had the deal the waitress quickly snatched our menus and gave us a limited menu. What I wanted was on there anyway, but I didn't appreciate that she snatched our menus like that. Our food came out pretty quickly but my food was not smoking hot, but the plate was which was a little odd. I ordered the chicken enchiladas and my fianc√© ordered the grande steak burrito. No chips came with our meal, 1st issue. #2. My food was not hot. #3. We've made homemade enchiladas before and they clearly used the La Preferida red enchilada sauce from the can. Major disappointment. Why the hell would I come out and pay for food that you pulled out of a can? Anyway, my chicken was good, but the enchiladas also needed more cheese. I was so excited to come here because it looked good and exciting because of the yard long glass on their sign... Oh well, they got me in there once, but you can bet I won't be back.
