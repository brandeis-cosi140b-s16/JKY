Why would you eat at this cartoonish, small-children-infested sideshow when you could eat at Frank & Fina's across the street?!

We almost walked out as soon as we walked in, and I wish that we had.

When you walk into this restaurant, the ambiance stresses you out. The fake Mexican decor and the immense amount of noise in the place are just too much. If you want a peaceful meal, eat elsewhere. 

The food was laughable, though the waiters were friendly.
