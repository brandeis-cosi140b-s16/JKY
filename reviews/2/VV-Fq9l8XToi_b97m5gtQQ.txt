I love chipotle and I come to this location a lot. I also am not a person to complain but I guess everything changes including customer service. When I came in it was busy, the food is amazzzzing so no surprise there.  

However, the music was so loud, and I am so quiet, I practically had to yell to get my order across, which caused my order to be messed up 3 times. I asked the employee to turn the music down so you could hear us ordering, other customers agreed. But the music went down only a notch. 

I left with my order inncorrect for the fourth time. I came home and was pumped to finally be able to eat only to find there was no utensils and no napkins in the bag. I dont have forks at my place because i just moved in, so you can imagine how much that sucked. 
I will continue to eat here because I love the food, but please consider turning down the music during busy rushes so orders can be made appropriately.
