We stopped in late on a Monday evening. The food was good. Unfortunately the service left a lot to be desired. The waitress did not know the menu at all. She brought one of our party only part of his meal. Even if the waitress didn't know what was to be included, the kitchen staff should have caught it. Our server never stopped back to check on us unless we went to find her. Basics such as filling water glasses were ignored. It's not like the place was busy. There was only one other occupied table. 

I said the food was good, but it was far from great. Unfortunately for the owners there are a couple of excellent Mexican places a few minutes away. Casa Mendoza on Mt. Lebanon Blvd. comes to mind. 

They've been open long enough that the staff should have their act together. I'd like to see them succeed, but to do so they will need to make a few changes.
