I was excited to try the food after watching a show on tv .. I tried the the Enchiladas suizas, good at first but, Chicken was hard, so much cream and cheese got tortillas soggy so much onions, should of called it Onion Enchiladas.The vegetable were ok the salad was good. My wife got the shrimp tacos kinda pricey for three tacos almost $4 a taco one shrimp and lots of cabbage the only thing that gave it flavor was the suace. I skipped the dessert . I could of ate at home save the drive and $$. First time and last ... Don't get me wrong , we were expecting an awesome flavor , but it didn't ..
