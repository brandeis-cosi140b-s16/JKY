A big group of us went here for our friend's birthday. The place was a bit smokey. Our server wasn't the most pleasant person I've ever met.

We ordered chips and salsa to hold us over. They were marginal. I got a strawberry margarita - absolute waste of calories! Machine margaritas FTL! They have burgers, tacos, enchiladas and salad on the menu. The servings are small since they're tapas. I did like the Ahi Tacos - you can get them either soft or hard. What's strange though is that the tacos had more of a Japanese taste to it than Mexican because of the sesame seeds and pickled ginger.

There are so many other Mexican restaurants in Vegas. Go there instead.
