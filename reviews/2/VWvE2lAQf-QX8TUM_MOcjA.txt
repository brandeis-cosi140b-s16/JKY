This place has a really good improv group that performs twice a week, called Names From a Hat, so I'm here almost every week. However, that's pretty much the only reason to come here. 

The food is not very good, although it is pretty cheap. I've tried a lot of it - nachos, corn dogs, tacos, etc., and the fries are one thing they do right. The drinks are okay, although I've seen the bartenders snap at customers a few times for no good reason. The service is never very good either. You can hear the bartenders chatting loudly during the improv show, it's kinda rude. 

Unless you're coming to see NFAH, I'd stay away from here until they're a little friendlier.
