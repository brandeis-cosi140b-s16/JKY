We stopped by to grab a quick bite. Service was friendly and I like that they offer a well-stocked condiment and salsa bar. The food was on the disappointing side. 

My fella and I both ordered breakfast burritos and the tortillas were not fresh and the size of the burrito was skimpier than I'm used to seeing at other similar type restaurants. 

I might stop here again when I'm in a pinch but I won't go out of my way to return.
