To be fair I'm not big on Mexican food, but I ordered a tostada salad and figured it can't be that bad. Ugh, wrong. Not really at all how I had pictured it in my head. The crunchy shell was not a bowl but a little flat shell pasted to a large plate with black beans. The salad itself looked like it went through a blender. I tried to ask for it without tomatoes, but since I make it a point not to talk to peoples' back's I didn't get a chance to. Since it was blended it was a nightmare picking them out. 

Service was nothing amazing but I guess they did the job. I hate the uniforms they give these poor girls. While the men wore normal long sleeve button ups the gals are stuck with ill fitting tank tops. I thought empire waistlines were supposed to be flattering but sadly no. I would understand if they were cocktail girls but these are food service workers. I don't need to see someones armpit while a plate is being set in front of me. Maybe it's just me, but it's a food turnoff. One bonus star for the four different dips that come at the start of the meal, hooray for variety, at least they filled me up since the salad was a miss.
