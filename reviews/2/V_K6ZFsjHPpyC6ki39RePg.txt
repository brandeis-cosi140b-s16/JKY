This place was the hottest and sweatiest bar I've ever been to. As usual, the girls in Scottsdale are hotter than the guys. Their drinks were alright. I have not tried the food yet. It was so hot and sweaty in there that I probably wouldn't come back. I have never danced with so many ugly men in one night.
