I have been to Super Burrito a few times.  The sign has always caught my attention.  I mean I like regular burritos, but a "Super" burrito sounds better.  I went on my lunch break and the I couldn't make up my mind.  I mean there aren't that many items on the menu.  I was pretty sure I was going to get a burrito.  That makes sense right?  The guy watching the counter was really helpful.  He made a few suggestions and told me what he sells the most of.  I ended up just getting the carne asada burrito.  You can't go wrong with grilled beef.  It was made pretty fast, so if your are here for lunch, don't worry about waiting too long.  The burrito was a good size.  It wasn't huge, which was ok because I didn't want to fall asleep at my desk when I got back.  The burrito had a big garlic taste.  That was the only thing I didn't like.  The taste stayed with me the rest of day.  It was just a little too much.  The meat was cooked perfect and the tortilla tasted good too.  I drowned it in the green salsa they had.  If you are in the area or on a lunch break you have to check this place out.  They have a drive thru if you want to take it to go.  Cheers!
