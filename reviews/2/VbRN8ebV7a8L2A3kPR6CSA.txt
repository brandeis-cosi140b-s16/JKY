I was hopeful since it seemed like a cheap fast place for lunch without getting full-blown fast food. They have daily deals, mine was carne asada added to a burrito for around a dollar. The portions were small, there were no extras (no chips, salsa, etc) and the beans were thin and tasted like they were out of a can. Not a bad place if your options are here or taco bell, but otherwise not worth going out of your way for. 

I will try another location and see if there is any difference!
