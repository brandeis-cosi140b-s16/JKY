Food is okay, I am not a fan of self serving my own beans and salsa...yet the prices are very reasonable.  

Do not be in a hurry, the service is very slow and the waitress Hasmik is as slow as they come!  We usually ask NOT to be strayed  in her section.

Overall -- for quick eats it's fine & the food is fairly tasty.  Perfect for nachos and beer after a movie.
