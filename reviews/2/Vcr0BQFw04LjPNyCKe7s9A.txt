I really wanted to like this place more. First time food was ok. Service was slow. Had to ask for more salas but it never came. Ok. Maybe having a off day. Second try today. We had a lunch coupon $5.99
For either two tacos or two enchiladas. With rice and beans. After we both ordered the lunch specials we were told the coupon is only good for ONE person at the table. Ok. so order two item lunch plate $8.99
Taco was soggy and fell apart as soon as I picked it up. Again asked for additional salas and it never came. Both times they were not overwhelmed with lunch customers so you would think the service would be better.  
Back to our old standard Manuel's on Bell Ave.
