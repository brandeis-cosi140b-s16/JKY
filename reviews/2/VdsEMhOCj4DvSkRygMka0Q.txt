We went to this place this evening to redeem a yelp "$10 for $5" deal. I'm not sure how they manage to keep a stellar rating. It was good food, but the price was high and the portions were tiny. The quesadilla we ordered was the worst offender, as it was made from a taco-sized tortilla. I have never seen such a tiny quesadilla in my life. If it was a kid's meal I may have understood, but it was $4.99! The chimichanga was pathetic, too. I think the guy working there must have given us a kid's chimi on accident, because i can't imagine anyone spending money at this place on a regular basis for a chimi so small. It was literally 2" wide by 6" long by 1" tall. That's for a $6.99 chimi. Macayo's charges a few bucks more for a chimi that's more than twice the size. I guess the only decent thing was the free chips and salsa, although the chips had enough salt on them to decrease my cardiac health by about 50%. I'm not sure why anybody salts anything anymore, with all the negative medical news on excessive salt consumption, but that's another problem altogether. As for this place: I tried it...probably won't be back. Caramba is a much better restaurant for a much better price.
