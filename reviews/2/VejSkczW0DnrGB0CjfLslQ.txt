Not my favorite airport restaurant in the world,  but they're located right at the head of Term C so they are always right snack in my path.  Service can be sketchy,  the food reasonable quality - but the pricing is on the high end of airport pricing - and the beverage selections are pretty limited.  Use it for what it is but just don't expect to much.
