Let me start by saying .. I never give bad reviews. I always go with reason when I have a bad experience and focus on the plus side of things. I was reluctant to even write this one. The food is always tasty and fresh. However, the girl who seems to be the manager/supervisor is needing some direction. Bad experience dining in and for drive thru. I'm pretty she's the same girl who takes the orders for the drive thru. She's by far the rudest person in drive thru history. She was even snappy to us once! She obviously can't stand people and has no patience (it wasn't overly busy the past 2 times when we experienced this). She'd be better at just prepping the food with no customer contact.. although I read another review that mentioned her and she wasn't doing that properly either. She also acts like she's right when she gets the order wrong or gets huffy when we have to repeat the order to correct it. She seems annoyed to be there and annoyed with the public in general. Even when she has tried to be nice when handing off the order, she comes off as fake. I'll be back because the food is good and quick. Hopefully the 5th time will be the charm. Optimistically, maybe we happen to catch her on her bad days?
