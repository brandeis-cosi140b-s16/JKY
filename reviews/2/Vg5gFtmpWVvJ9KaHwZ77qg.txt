Bringing it down another notch.  I'm sorry folks.  I know people love this place but I do not get why.  I ordered the veggie fajitas yesterday and literally only sizzling onions came out.  I asked the waitress why there were only onions and she said because they only have peppers, onions, tomatoes and mushrooms in their veggie fajitas.  So, I asked why it said on the menu "and other mixed veggies" and she said she didn't know but she could add some more peppers to the fajitas if that would help. I asked for corn tortillas but got flour.  We asked for lemons for our water, they only do limes and forgot to bring them.  I asked if I can substitute other beans (ie black or charro) for the refried and she said no...The menu states no substitutions can be made to menu items.  Seriously?  

Our waitress had a sourpuss look on the face the entire time as did others that approached our table.  We asked for more chips and salsa and they forgot to bring them.  

Overall, a horrible experience.  I was willing to try them again because they seem to be the "hit" but they do not cut it for me. My original thought remains:  too big for your britches La Unica.  Get over yourself!!!!
