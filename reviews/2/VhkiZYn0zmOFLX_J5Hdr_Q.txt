This is a joke right?

If you follow me, you know I've spent three to four  months a year for the past 10 years in Vegas.  That's a lot of meals in a lot of restaurants.  It means something when I call this the single worst restaurant in Vegas.

The food is awful and uncharacteristic of Border Grill, it forced my dining companion and I to try the Mandalay Bay location on another evening just to compare.  This location has a serious problem.

Peruvian Ceviche - excessively tight and chewy pieces of fishy mahi mahi with ginger, lime, chili and DISTILLED VINEGAR.  The vinegar had an acidic bite so pronounced it masked all other flavors while accentuating the aroma of the fish.  Exact opposite of the vibrant, refreshing, tart flavor at the other location.

Roasted Beets - extremely bitter thanks to burnt pepper coating the surface of the beets.  The bitterness overpowers everything else in the dish.

Short Rib Enchiladas - Supposedly topped with a chayote, watercress slaw as presented by the other location, this one was simply sauced.  Very dry, dense, finely pulled short ribs on the inside.  Obviously premade, refrigerated, and poorly reheated.  Very one dimensional in flavor.

Special Fish of the Day - Spice rubbed then blackened (an understatement).  A quote from my dining companion "This taste like I licked the burnt inside top of a Webber grill".  Inedible.  

The kick in the nuts, the manager on duty's cocky response that his employees all liked the dishes before walking away.  (He sent our server to apologize for him and comp the meal).

Finding the good; warm ambiance, very good servers (excludes the manager), well made cocktails.  Unfortunately that doesn't cut it in a city with so many incredible dining options.  

A failure of a restaurant and one that will definitely bring down the reputation of Border Grill as an enterprise.

Avoid.
