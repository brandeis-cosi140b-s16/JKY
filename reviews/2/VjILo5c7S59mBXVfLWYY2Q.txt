It's really unfortunate that I'm giving this chipotle a bad review, because I absolutely love everything chipotle, but I've been in this chipotle twice now and both times have been a horrible experience. 

Twice now I've done the online ordering from this location (it's closest to my place) and every time I go in their to pick it up, and I'm usually 15 minutes late, they never have my order ready and act totally surprised when I get there. So I have to stand their and wait while they frantically make my order and receive death stares from the other guests waiting in line. Pretty aggravating.

I gave it 2 stars because my heart couldn't come to leave 1 star for a chipotle, since it's still an amazing restaurant (just not this location)
