Damn shame, this place. I had been to the location in Beechview a couple of times and loved it, but the widely reported startup problems here persist. Service was clumsy and slow. 

One of us had tacos, liked the pulled pork but didn't like the jerk chicken as much. 

One of us ordered shrimp burrito; it arrived cold, and was dry and entirely unappealing. 

I ordered oxtails, clearly pulled from the refrigerator and quickly reheated, gristly and not as flavorful as I expected, served with rice in a nondescript tomato sauce along with a couple of slices of good fried plantain. I'm just hoping I don't get sick. 

Maybe there is a Peter Principle operating here. Prospects of these folks succeeding in Eastside as they did in Beechview, where the operation was less ambitious, seem low.
