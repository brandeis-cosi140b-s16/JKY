I decided to try La Ristra for lunch today. I was seated immediately by the bar tender, quickly served water and chips & salsa. I was told that the green salsa was hot, and the red wasn't as hot. I didn't taste very much heat in either one. I ordered the lunch special, which is one entre with 2 sides. I chose the chicken enchilada with black beans & rice. The only other side to choose from was pinto beans. When my lunch came out of the kitchen, the plate was too hot to touch, but I didn't even need to blow on the food. It was just warm. As for the flavor, I have to agree with some of the other reviewers that it is pretty bland. 

With 4 stars after 97 reviews, I had higher hopes for the food. As much as I like to support local Mom & Pop restaurants, sadly this will not be one of them.
