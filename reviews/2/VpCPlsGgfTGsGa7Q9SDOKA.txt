Came here to grab a quick dinner before meeting our friends at another bar... we sat at the bar. Based on our experience, I feel this place is two-star worthy. Here's why:

-This place has no idea what it wants to be. There's neon, club-like lights everywhere and a bouncer checking ID's at the door... while its still set up like full on restaurant serving mexican food. I know a lot of places in Old Town have bouncers out early, but this place is just different.

-Big dude walking around the front of house, helping guests.. which wouldn't matter, but he had a chef's coat on that actually had the word "chef" embroidered on the front.. shouldnt you be in back of house orchestrating the kitchen? Whose making the food?

-Bartender 1 knocked my water all over me. Got my shirt and my pants. He offered me a free drink,  which was nice, but for some reason that just didn't feel like consolation enough. Bartender 2 watched the whole thing and just shook her head. 

-The tub of sanitizing water bartenders use to wash glassware was situated right behind the bar, in front of where we were seated. As bartender 2 washed glasses, drops of the sanitizer water hit my face. It probably got the food too. This happened TWICE. Definitely not cool.

-The food is just mediocre.

-When a place has the word "tacos" in the name, I expect a decently wide variety of tacos on the menu. Not the case.

I would eat here again if I was with a group of people who all wanted to go, but I wouldn't come here on my own accord, thats for sure.
