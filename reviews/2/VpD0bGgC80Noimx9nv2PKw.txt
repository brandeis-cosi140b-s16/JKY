I don't pretend to be an expert on Mexican food. But, oh man, isn't the food unnecessarily greasy here? I got a chicken burrito and the grease was dripping down my hands to my arms! Flies everywhere in March (!). . . Cannot possibly imagine coming here during the summer time. I'm from Tucson and I started to think Mexican food means something different to me. But seriously, what are you eating here in Phoenix?
