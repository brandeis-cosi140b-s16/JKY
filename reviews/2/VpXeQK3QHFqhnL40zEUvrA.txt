We stopped in for lunch because The Library wasn't open yet. 

The food was good. My companion had the Emiliano's special which was 2 plates full of food (you get one of everything - taco, enchilada, burrito, tostada, relleno, and tamale served with rice and beans). I got a create-your-own combo which I'm always a fan of. 

Service was inexplicably sloooow, we were one of 5 tables seated, There was a sign on our table that advertised guacamole "hand crafted at your table!" - it wasn't. The guac itself was okay, a little too smooth for my liking, I want to see chunks of creamy avocado and leaves of cilantro. 

This would have been a good experience if not for the fact that we each got a bloody mary. BIG BIG BIG mistake. It was basically tomato juice and turpentine with a rim of salt. If you're not going to put horseradish, Worcestershire, and Tabasco in it, don't call it a bloody mary!! Was it really too much to ask for a garnish (celery? olives? a lime wedge?) I even had to add hot sauce and salt. Needless to say I had to chug it in order to get it down. Oh, did I mention they were $8 a piece? Pure lunacy! 

Will we go back? Probably not.
