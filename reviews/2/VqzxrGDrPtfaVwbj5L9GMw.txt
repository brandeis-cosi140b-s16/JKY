Me and a group of coworkers went there for lunch, 16 of us in total. The food was just OK, and the service just about the same.

I'm from Chihuahua, so just seeing yellow cheese takes away from the 'authentic' factor.

I wasn't crazy about the food, but the lack of customer friendliness is what is getting them 2 stars instead of 3.

If you're open for lunch, and there are at least 2 large companies right around the corner, wouldn't you expect working people to come?, and wouldn't you think they will want separate checks and fast service? I mean, to me is common sense, it's a lunch crowd.

They refused, refused to give us separate bills or work with us. We have gone out several places, always a large group, and never had issues paying separate. But not here. HUGE inconvenience for just a so-so food and service.


I rather spend my money elsewhere, and as a group we won't be coming back.
