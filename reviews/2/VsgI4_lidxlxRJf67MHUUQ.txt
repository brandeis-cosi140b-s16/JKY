Many many years ago I use to take the family to the Tucson location and always enjoyed the atmosphere, food, Sangria Swirls and salsa. That location closed back about 6 yrs ago or so. This location was nothing to write home about the Salsa tasted flat with no zip and the swirl was weak. I'll pass next time
