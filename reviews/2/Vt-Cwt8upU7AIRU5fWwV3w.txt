To call this place Tex-Mex is tantamount to  treason. Ordering process was clunky. Not easy to tell pricing -- ended up getting uncharged $4 on my burrito for things like rice and beans that are standard fare at fast casual chains like Chipotle or Moe's. Food quality was average -- certainly didn't merit the premium pricing of a $12-14 dollar burrito. Staff was friendly and helpful.
