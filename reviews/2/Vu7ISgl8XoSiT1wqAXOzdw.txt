I don't think this place lives up to the hype. To start,  the waitress brought us water and when we asked for lemon, she brought it on a napkin as if it were an odd request. For our meal, I ordered the Green Chili Open-Face Burger with a side salad with jalape√±o ranch. I typically order ground beef well done, and this was no exception. Unfortunately, the burger I received was cooked to medium. I didn't notice at first because we were seated on the dark patio, and the string lights above us were burnt out, so we couldn't see our food. It was evening, and another waiter went around to light the candles on the tables, but I guess he forgot ours. Our waitress was unattentive, and my husband had to ask the food runner for water. When the waitress did finally acknowledge us, she apologized for not getting us more water, and then told me that my burger was probably undercooked because the stove doesn't work well. Good to know. Anyway, I'm just not sure I want to return. I came here a few years back, and the waiter forgot to put in my order until all the other people in my party were served. Unfortunately, the service here needs improvement, and though I like the food (for the most part), the service is bad enough for me to spend my money elsewhere.
