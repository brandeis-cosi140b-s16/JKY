Meh.

I wandered in here on my lunch break. I'm new here, and I heard the Mexican food is great in AZ and I just love Mexican! I had to try it. 

The Hippies Cove reminds me again how important Yelp is. Well, it was a bad $11 mistake that I won't be making again. Here is my review in short:

I was the only customer there at that time. The guy who served me at the counter seemed uninterested. Styrofoam plates. Microwaved food?? Not sure. Crappy cheese. Plastic cup for water. Cute decor, but didn't cut it. And upon leaving, he didn't even say goodbye to me because he was too caught up in his lady friend.

Avoid this place. I'm sure it's a great hangout for teens, but the experience overall sucked.
