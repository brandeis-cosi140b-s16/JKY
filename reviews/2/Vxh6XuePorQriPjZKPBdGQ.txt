4 1/2 stars is way too high for this taqueria. The meat is pre-cooked, stored in metal bins, and slapped into tortillas versus being hot and cooked fresh like many of it's competitors.

The carnitas lacked flavor and character. The carne asada was decent but nothing outstanding.

The best authentic tacos I've had in Las Vegas are at Tacos el Gordo but this would do in a pinch if you're starving for tacos and close by.
