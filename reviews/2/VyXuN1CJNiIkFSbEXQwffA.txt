We came here for a late lunch on a Sunday, perhaps around 2:30 in the afternoon.  The place wasn't as crowded as it apparently had been during the normal lunch hour as the wait staff informed us.  I asked for a quieter table in a corner somewhere and we were given the table next to the kitchen which was further away from the bulk of the other diners.

Two of us shared the chicken fajitas and a coconut mixed drink.  The drink was tasty and not wimpy.  It had toasted shaved coconut on the rim of the glass which was nice.  The fajitas were shared between two people and with a side of rice and beans provided enough food for two.  

Pros: lots of chips; friendly waitress, tender chicken
Cons: no onions in the fajitas (huh?!), had to ask for water refills, service was slow bringing extra plates, loud background music.

On the subject of the background music, when we came in the music was loud but not so loud as to prevent conversation.  We saw the head waiter/boss/manager-guy turn the music up to something that was too loud, and then at one point he turned it up even louder so that some waitress girls could dance on the bar top for (presumably) the entertainment of the diners.  The music unfortunately didn't make a descent down from the jet-engine level it had been set at for the amusement.  We saw one lady with her elderly mother get up, speak to the manager guy while gesticulating wildly, and then march out.  We couldn't hear anything of what they said because the music was too loud, but presumably they weren't pleased at the conversation-stopping level either.  

The location is convenient but if my memory serves me there is another cantina place in the same mall where one could go to eat and  communicate with fellow diners.
