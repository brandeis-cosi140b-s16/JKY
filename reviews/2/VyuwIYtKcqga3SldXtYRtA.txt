Hmmm, well, it's not what I would call authentic Mexican cuisine, not in the least, so if that is what you are looking for, keep on crusin' 

The positive
+ fast service for our Sunday lunch
+ friendly server 
+ iced tea was really good
+ chips were free and warm and good 
+ kids meals are $5 and include a drink 

The negative
- bland, boring & cheap tasting food
- the kids burger was weird I highly doubt   
   it was 100% beef, it tasted gross
- expensive menu, uffda! The lunch specials 
   were not available on Sunday.

I have been to this locations several times over the past few years and I have been consistently disappointed. I recommend this place for the chips and the drinks
