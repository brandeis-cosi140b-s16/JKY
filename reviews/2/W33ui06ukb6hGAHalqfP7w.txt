I love Chipotle. However, this particular location is not as good as the others. They gave me a smaller amount of the meat than the others do (really skimpy) and when I asked about it, did nothing to correct it. They treated me like I had the problem. I will go to the location at 67th and Beardsley or 83rd ave and Bell from here on out where they seem to have the same standards on how much of each ingredient to use.
