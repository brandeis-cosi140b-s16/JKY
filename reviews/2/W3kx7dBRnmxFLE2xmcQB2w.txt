Meh....its really cool looking for just drinks and a good time...I didn't like the food very much at all.  I had the street tacos and just wasn't too happy with the quality of the food...I don't know if it sat too long, or if thats just how it always is?  But the fish pieces were really good!  The service could be a little better, but overall its OK.
