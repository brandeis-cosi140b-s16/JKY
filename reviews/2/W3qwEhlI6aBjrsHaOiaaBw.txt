Been here twice, and I cant say either time was a thrilling experience. One thing I can say as a plus is the bartenders at lunch are always friendly and quick. The food so, not so great. I can never eat it all, the portions are extremely generous, but it's never very high quality. Just kinda seems like it is coming from a slop kitchen, and not really fit for a human. The house margaritas are actually pretty good, and a fair value. I recommend hanging out with a margarita and some chips and salsa (also pretty good) and then moving elsewhere for dinner. Call me crazy, but restaurants that leave me feeling sluggish and greasy are never my favorites.
