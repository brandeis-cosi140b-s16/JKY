Count your change, and look at your receipt. I had been going regularly, and last week I was hungry, hurried and distracted. Later whenI looked at my receipt I saw I had been clearly shortchanged by the counter-lady. Doubt if I'll return. Or if I do, I'll bring the exact amount. Their burritos are only okay, the ingredients tend to be clumped at one end or the other. Who wants a big wad of guac at the end of the burrito? Anyway, the place reminded me of the cool burrito places I used to go to in SF Mission and I prefer to avoid big chains. Not sure where I'll go now.
