I've been on a major taco kick lately, and while the tacos here are fine, it's the sum of the experience that results in the 2-star review. I'd say I've dined-in here for lunch/dinner at least 10-times since my earlier review.

- Chips are horrendous
+ Salsa is ok - nice, steady heat, but oh so watery
+ Campechano tacos are outstanding (steak + chorizo mix)
+ Great tortillas
+ Generous amounts of cilantro and onion with the tacos (yay!)
+ Steak and pastor = excellent
- Chicken = usually dry

- Service is so spotty, Dalmatians, Cheetahs, and Leopards get jealous. The servers immediately drop off chips/salsa and then want to take your order *on the spot*. After they take your order, your food will arrive quickly, and you'll never see anyone, ever again, until you need to pay your tab. It's bizarre. Need some more water? Need a fork? Need another taco? Good luck. You're on your own.

- They went back to the "get your own drinks from the cooler in the grocery store" service. Which is fine, but... all of the beers require a bottle opener... and the servers are no where to be found, so after you hike over to grab your own beer, you wind-up sitting for a while, staring at your beer, hoping someone will come by to provide an opener.** 

- The return to the "get your own drinks" started this week (12/29). I was there three days ago, and they served drinks without sending anyone to the cooler. When I asked why there was the shift, they said, "We have never served drinks to the tables - you always have to get yours." I argued (lightly) for a bit about past experiences, but then they pulled the, "Sorry, I don't understand" act. Ugh.

- If you order a Michelada (beer + tomato juice and hot sauce), they'll serve it to you... this makes zero sense to me.

So, why am I complaining about the beer thing? Because it's not clear who to pay for your drinks... the beer comes from a cooler in the grocery store; the food comes from the little restaurant area. When I went to pay for my dinner, there was much confusion about how I needed to pay for the beer... it took a solid 5-minutes to get out of there today... 

Factor in the time spent staring (longingly) at said beer while waiting for an opener, and I'm left a bit sour on this place. They eventually determined I needed to pay them for the drink, but crikey. What a mess.

Not sure I'll be back as often or as soon as I have been.

** Update: they have since hung a bottle opener on the front of one of the coolers - yay!
