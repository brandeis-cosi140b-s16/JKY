When this place was named Jacqueline's , I never had an issue with the place - In fact, they used to have the best muffins, enough to warrant me making a road trip from North Scottsdale just to get a muffin and espresso.

Although I realize that there are many good reviews associated with Cafe Carumba, this restaurant simply does not fall into the "foodie" category.

I always have an issue with slow service especially when considering that the dining room is half empty. Second issue is the service staff too busy chattering or catching up with the latest gossip, rather than paying close attention to guests.

The third issue is having a table that was seated after me, being served before me. And when it took literally forever for my order to arrive, not even an apology was extended. ON top of that, after that near exasperating wait, being charged for an extra order of tortillas.

Cafe Carumba is really not my idea of the ideal or cozy breakfast spot. It is amazing what  name change can do to the soul of a place. Okay, I agree and sympathize with the fact that restaurants can have an off day...but I always seem to be the victim!
