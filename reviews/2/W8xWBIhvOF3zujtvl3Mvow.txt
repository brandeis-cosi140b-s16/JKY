I went to Mexi-Casa last week. Let me tell you how excited I was to go to my local Mexican restaurant in good ole Dormont. I had come when they first opened and wasn't happy with the service and couldn't eat much because I am allergic to flour and there were no corn tortillas. I figured time had passed and it takes time for restaurants to get into a rhythm. I optimistically thought they must have just been out of the tortillas.

Wrong. I was shocked by how little had changed as well as a number of other things. One, THERE ARE NO CORN TORTILLAS IN A MEXICAN FREAKING RESTAURANT. This bothers me on a number of levels. One, IT IS A MEXICAN RESTAURANT. It makes me wonder if the owner has ever been to Mexico or even to a taco truck in Miami. Two, I am allergic to flour. I love Mexican restaurants because it is USUALLY so easy for me to order. Three, I like corn tortillas. You don't have to be authentic to just have the tortillas frozen somewhere for that person who like Mexican food to be a little more like Mexican food. I am cool with Tex/Pit- Mex, but seriously, this is ridiculous. 

So, we got the nachos. Which was a bunch of American cheese literally dumped on the nachos, black olives from a can, and some pretty good shredded chicken. There wasn't any salsa, jalapenos, sour cream, nothing. Then, the kicker is that she charged us a dollar for the ridiculously small helping of salsa we requested. This crappy nacho order cost ten dollars. WOW.

Oh, did I mention that we were given STYROFOAM PLATES. I mean, do they even make that shit anymore????

I love Dormont. I am trying really hard to support its businesses, but Mexi-Casa is making it really hard.
