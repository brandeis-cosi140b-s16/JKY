For what it is...meh it's okay.  Food is edible and will get you full for sure.  I'm not all into the decor - tad bit tacky, but I whatever floats your boat.  Service was lacking granted I understand lunch rushes, but seriously you don't have to ask if I need a refill 10 times when my glass is still half full - where's my tamales anyways!  I guess if you're really craving for some Mexican food it'll do the job just fine.
