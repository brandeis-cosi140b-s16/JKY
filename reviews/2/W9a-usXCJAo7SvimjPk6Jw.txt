Just went to China Poblano for Noodle wonton soup. The broth looks and tastes like beef broth. The noodle is not crisp and chewy. Not enough vegetable like wonton soup supposed to be. The wonton is fair. But it is overpriced  for half the portion most chinese restaurnat offer. Definitely need a change. If you are looking for authentic Chinese Noodle or Dim Sum, this is "not" the right place. Stay away from Fusion type restaurant. If you want good Ehenic foods, do not try fusion restaurant. I can't comment the Mexican restaurnat side. But I will not attempt based on the taste of Chinese food.
