Meh xican food. That's how I'd have to describe this.

We were promptly seated. We were quickly attended to. Drinks ordered and they brought out chips and salsa quickly. The mild salsa was sweet. Wah. The spicy was really spicy. Mixed them together and it ended up working out.

We ordered a cheese crisp. That came quick. It wasn't too substantial. 

The good deal was 3.75 margarita. I got a frozen one and id say it was worth it. 

For dinner, I got the pollo especial. This is their version of the chicken chimichanga with jalapeño cream cheese. You can get this, called various different names, at many different restaurants in the Phoenix metro area. There is a pretty good baseline to compare to. I don't remember the wait being anything annoying, so It must have come out in a reasonable amount of time.

The food was annoying. For me, Arizona is a beacon of Mexican food hope. You should be able to bring your friends and family from out of state and have them taste what Mexican food should taste like. Just like every dick from New York or Chicago tells you how great their shitty pizza is, so shall an Arizonan blabber about the Mexican food. This food was not bragable . If this meal was typical of Manuel's, it will let you down. This pollo especial was very bland. Nothing stood out. Not the chicken. Not the jalapeño cream cheese, the beans, the rice, nada. I'll bet you can get the same flavors in Idaho or Nebraska, and that is just sad.

So, to make a long story short, I'll be skipping Manuel's for the indefinite future. If you choose not to, I wish you good luck.
