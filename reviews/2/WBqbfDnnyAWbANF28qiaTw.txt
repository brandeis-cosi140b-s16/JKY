Food was served room temp. Wait staff seemed rushed and suspect the food was delayed waiting to be picked up. Flour tortillas were so thin you couldn't use tthem for making fajitas. Place was so noisy conversation was impossible. 
Had the food been warn it would have been just mediocre.  Will never return.
