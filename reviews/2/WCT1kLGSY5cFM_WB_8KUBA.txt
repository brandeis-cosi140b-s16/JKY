I read a few reviews about this place before I went.  Unfortunately I should have followed the negative reviews. The Flank steak was just strips of greasy meat they probably put in the tacos.  The rice was drenched in grease.  It even smelled bad as the waiter put it in front of me.  I actually gasped.  Let me tell you I LOVE, LOVE mexican food, and I truly got better mexican food off a truck stop (which was amazing, I might add) in Los Angeles.  I mean wow they have great service, a great atmosphere, and I didn't have a margarita (which I love) but the list was extensive.  I bet they are good.   Now, on to the first indication that the food would be bad, the CHIPS! omg out out a bag, just horrible.  The salsas were good.  The contrast of all these good things with very bad ones made me give the place the 2 stars.  I promise you I will not be going back.  Too mad for them because, as I said, I love mexican food!  I could pay a servicer's  tips in a year with the amount of times I've hit Maize and Mas Amigos
