This location needs drive-thru training ! Every time I come to this location it seems like the drive through workers are running at half speed. I never have a problem when beginning my order at the speaker and they read it back to me. However whenever I pull up to the window they have my order wrong when they repeat it back. 
On multiple occasions when I have come for the Thursday grilled chicken taco deal, they always "forget" some of the tacos I ordered. Either they just forget  and not give me a bag or they count the tacos wrong.
 Also the del scorcho hot sauce is my favorite and I only ask for that and they still end up giving me only two of the black packets and four of the orange packets of sauce and I just end up throwing them away.
It's very convenient they are open 24 hours and it's in a great location, but I would rather drive the extra couple miles to the del taco on arizona and pecos because at least I know I will get what I wanted..
