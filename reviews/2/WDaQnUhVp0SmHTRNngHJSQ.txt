I would love to give this place more stars because I thought all the food we ordered (thai chicken nachos + shrimp fajitas for 2) was really tasty, and our waiter was really friendly and prompt, but I just can't get past the price.  WAY overpriced.  Our nachos, fajitas and one drink came out to be almost $60.  That's crazy!
