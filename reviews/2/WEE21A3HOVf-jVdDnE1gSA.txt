We've been coming here for a few years now.  Not often but every once in a while.  When we first started coming, I thought the food was pretty awesome.  Since the, however, I feel like there's been a steady decline.  Today just kind of topped it.  The service was fine - nothing to complain about.  However, the chicken was so DRY!  And I saw a little bit of blood!  When we first came here we bought extra chicken for left overs.  Never did it again because although initially the chicken was yummy and juicy, the leftovers was dry and not good at all.  That's what our chicken tasted like today.  I was very disappointed.  Needless to say, we probably won't be coming back here.  That really sucks.
