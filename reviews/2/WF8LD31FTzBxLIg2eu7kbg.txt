I was really hoping that this place would have good food. I was disappointed to some extent. Latin food is my favorite. I'm always trying to checkout new Latin restaurants in the hopes of finding really good food. I ordered 2 ground beef tacos with black beans and rice. The tacos were decent but the rice and beans were horrible. Both were very dry and lacked flavor. If you come here dont order the black beans and rice.
