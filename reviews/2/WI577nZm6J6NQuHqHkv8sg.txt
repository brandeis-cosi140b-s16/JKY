Met some friends who were hanging out on a Saturday afternoon. The place has a nice vibe, with the indoor seating area open to the outside with lots of fans and a great escape from the heat. It does feel like you are in on vacation when you are there. 

Our friends were hanging out in a cabana and when it came close to 5pm, we were told the the space was reserved for another party. We asked how much they were and they said it was a $300 min. - WTH! More amazing is that people pay it! You know you are in Chandler right? 

Corona's were $5! of course you are going to have a mexican import beer when you are at a Mexican bar - so they have no pity in the price! No specials on the weekends. Did not eat, but had some chips and salsa. They tasted as expected. Do not expect fantastic mexican food at this place - just something to feed you while you enjoy the decor and expensive drinks. 

The service was good and the scene was alot of people hanging out with some Cougars prowling. If they made my wallet feel more welcomed and the food look better, I would visit again.
