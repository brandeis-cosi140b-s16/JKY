Went through the drive thru, the chef I'm assuming came out and said hi and went back in. 15 mins later a different guy can to take my order. I almost thought they were closed? I just got three rolled tacos with rice and beans for 4.20$. Rang up to 5.50$? Guy didn't give me a fork so I had to eat with my salsa lid. The rice was hard halfway in, probably old, I did come at 830am. Rolled tacos were decent, can't really mess that up. This place was a bunch of disappointments one after the other. I won't be back.
