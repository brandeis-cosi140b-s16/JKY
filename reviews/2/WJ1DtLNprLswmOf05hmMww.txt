My friend and I were swayed by other reviews to try this restaurant, expecting a gem in the rough - a treasure - an amazing find!!!!  We didn't find it here.  In clarification:  it didn't taste BAD.  It was just nothing special.  I've made better at home just by trying.  The most flavorful part of the meal was the hot sauce on the table...essential!  and not just because I like a little spice (and I do mean a little) but because I prefer flavor to my food - especially when I have a choice.  The reason I didn't give just one star is because it seemed clean and had a cool "hole in the wall"/mom&pop feel.  There was no "service" to speak of - it's a "we'll cook it and you pick it up at the window" environment.  Totally fine (if the food is good).  The people were very nice, but there are just so many other places to try that unless the experience is craving-worthy, I'm moving along, no harm no foul, just no looking back.
