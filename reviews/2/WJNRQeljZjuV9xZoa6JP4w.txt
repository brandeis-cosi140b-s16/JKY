My carnitas burrito was decent, and the chips and salsa were decent also.  However, service was somewhat lacking.  Food was slow to arrive, and came with no silverware.  We asked for silverware.  We waited.  No silverware came.  We went and got our own silverware.

By this time our lunch hour was running out.  We asked for the check and said we were in a rush.  The waiter brought the check and then disappeared again.  I had to go into the kitchen and hunt him down in order to pay.  The waiter ran away again while I was in the middle of paying.

Okay food.  Okay prices.  Don't go if you are on a schedule.  Possibly take your own silverware.
