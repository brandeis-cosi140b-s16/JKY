I want to give this Chipotle a good review, I really do...but I just can't. I love Chipotle and eat there once a week. The food quality is OK. Seems a bit lacking compared to other locations, but what is seriously lacking is service efficiency. Since they've opened Mid-May, I've probably been there 6 times. Every single time, I have had to wait extra for something they ran out of and didn't have a new batch ready. I did get my meal free once because of this (without me asking), which was nice. Maybe it's because they're new (I hope that's the case), but it's been a consistent thing that makes me want to drive farther to visit another location...
