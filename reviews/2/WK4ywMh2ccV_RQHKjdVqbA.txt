I absolutely adore Cafe Rio's food but this location is incredibly SLOW! Even during low traffic hours when there are maybe 2 people in front of you it will surprise you how long it takes to get through the line and pay for your meal.  It's incredibly frustrating. Sometimes after I'm finally sitting down eating, I'll watch others go through the line and am entertained at how long it takes them to make it through the checkout process. Almost makes me feel better knowing it doesn't just happen to me.

Aside from that complaint, I highly recommend the Sweet Barbacoa Salad. It really is to die for.
