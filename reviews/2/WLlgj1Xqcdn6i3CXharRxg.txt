Its just like a Federicos, Filibertos, etc but inside a gas station and the quality is for the most part the same except last time I went (today) my California burrito had a lot of fatty/non meat pieces in place of the carne asada which wasn't what I wanted. If you like Federicos, Filibertos then you will like this place because its almost the same thing and same menu. Like Young S said, it does take a while to get the food though. Not sure why.
