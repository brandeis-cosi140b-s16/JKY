I initially went because they served under-agers, the margaritas were good.  The food was decent nothing outstanding.

The reason it is given a bad rating though is because of its reputation of the management towards the employees.  The first time I heard it I thought someone was bitter at the management.  Within my 5 years at Frida's I heard many times at how the owner didn't treat his waitresses with respect or dignity.  This is why I don't go to this place or recommend it.
