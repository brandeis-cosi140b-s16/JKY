I came here with my family for Mother's Day Brunch. The place was busy but we had made reservations and got seated immediately.
We had been here once before for another Sunday brunch back in December for my brother's birthday.
Now the menu offered on that random Sunday back in December was the same exact menu offered on Mother's Day. Nothing was different.
Well there was one difference. A rather sizeable difference. The cost.
$20 for the brunch and champagne in December. $35 brunch + $5 champagne for Mother's Day. Yeah, nearly double the price for the same menu just because it was Mother's day and they know people will pay it.
I would still come back here though, the food is really good and the restaurant is beautiful.
