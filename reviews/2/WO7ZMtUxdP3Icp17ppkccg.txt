I do not have good luck at this location.

Drove 10 miles from Goodyear to this location in Buckeye to avoid the lunch rush at the Goodyear location that doesn't have ample parking.

I arrived at 11:30am and there was no line. Walked right up to the counter and the gal says the usual "what can I get you". I state my usual "chicken burrito please" she heats the tortilla, asks which rice and beans I want and gets to the meat and the chicken is empty. She yells towards the back that they need chicken and some guy comes over and says "we're out of chicken, can I get you something else?" I ask how long the wait is for chicken and he says "a while". I look over the other offerings and choose the steak which wasn't nearly as good as the chicken.

What surprised me even more than them being out of chicken right after they opened and before the lunch rush even arrived is the fact that they charged me extra for the steak I was forced to choose since they didn't have chicken.

When it was rang up I inquired why I was paying extra for steak when I was only settling for it since they couldn't fill my order for chicken. He then said, "sorry about that, I'll throw in a free drink for the inconvenience" which I took to mean he was correcting his mistake and going to throw in a drink for forcing me to eat the steak when I wanted chicken.

I got to me table to eat the burrito and discovered, nope I was still charged extra for the steak but he did give me a free drink.

As I said, the chicken is much better than the steak as the steak was a bit too chewy and tough for me in a burrito.

I guess I'll have to deal with the crowd at the Goodyear location to satisfy my Chipotle craving.
