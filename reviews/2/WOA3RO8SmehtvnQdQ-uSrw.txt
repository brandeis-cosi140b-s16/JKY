Poor customer service and food. The two stars are for the ambience. Ordered kid chx tenders, frozen low quality chx; too thin and all breading. Carcasada tacos was recommended by the server. They came out chewy and I took one bite and stopped. I told the server how bad it was... She said I'm sorry. That was it. No manager came by nor offered another item. Very bad and being a neighborhood restaurant you cannot afford such bad service and food. Being a restaurateur, it's very poorly ran place. On top of all that they were out of blue moon on Friday night.
