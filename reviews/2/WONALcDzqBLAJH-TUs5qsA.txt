Sunday night. Fairly busy, and there was a fun buzz goin' round the place. We were a party of five and seated fairly quickly.

Chips were fairly decent, and 'twas nice that they give you decent amounts of salsa plus a giant dollop of refried beans to go with 'em.

Drinks came promptly, and they took our food order. This is where the restaurant experience ENDS. LOL.

Most of my group ordered entree's, and I ordered soup. Shouldn't be anything extraordinary about it. Food wait was at least 30-minutes!! 

I will give them these positive reinforcements - 

1. Server was nice.

2. I ordered a tortilla soup, and it was hearty, and a good portion. I ordered extra avocado, and they gave me generous amounts.

3. The server came 'round and noticed that our drinks were empty (ONCE), but it sure as hell took him a long time to come back!!!

Ambience had a fun vibe.
Company was good.
Service was horrible. 
Food was OK. Soup had too much of a tomato-ey base, but it was still OK.

Wouldn't come back unless I had to, though.
