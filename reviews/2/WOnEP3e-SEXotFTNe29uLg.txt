I went on a Friday night. The adjacent bar was closed at 9pm, so we were offered soda. That was disappointing because I do enjoy a margarita when I go out for a dinner of Mexican food. This is especially odd because of their location on Carson St. 

Overall, I have to say my experience at Taco Loco was just okay. I liked the salsas that came with the tortilla chips, but the chips themselves were a bit stale. The green sauce and chocolate mole were tasty but nothing to write home about. I'll go back for a lunch of tacos. Dinner was too quiet and the entrees seemed overpriced. Their saving grace is the sheer quantity of food that is served on a plate. If you go for dinner, go hungry.
