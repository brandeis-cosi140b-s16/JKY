Chipotle is baller, but this location is by far the slowest one I have ever been to.  The employees move like snails.  None of them look like they have any sense of urgency (even with a decent sized line).  If I were their manager I would have some serious questions of my staffs work ethic. I personally avoid this location after many attempts for redemption of my opinion.
