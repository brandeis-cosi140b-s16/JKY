I was thinking about XXL Nachos and went to Taco Bell. I got there only to find the XXL Nachos have gone away! Boo. Next best thing, Nachos Bell Grande (no tomatoes) to share with my friend and a Cheesy Potato Burrito. While waiting for our food, I tried a couple of beverages. Mtn Dew Sangrita... didn't care for it. And Brisk Lemonade Tea... also not great. So I ended up with Pepsi. But even that didn't taste right. It wasn't sweet as Pepsi should be... Not sure what's up with their fountain drinks.
When the food came out, we found that my friend was shorted a soft taco. He went back up to get it and they ended up giving him an extra one. My burrito and nachos tasted as they should. Nothing amazing, they simply met my expectations. Wish they still had the XXL Nachos though...
