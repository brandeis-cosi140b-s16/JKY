I was hoping by the look of this place that it would be more authentic, but I was disappointed.  I got the chicken chili burrito and it was fine but not great and nothing particularly interesting about it.  It definitely did not taste authentic and there were no choices about what toppings or salsas to put in it.  I ordered a side of guac that was super tiny and it seemed fresh but had no flavor at all to it.  My 2 friends ordered a veggie burrito and a fish burrito, respectively but they switched them up and gave them the wrong orders.  Unfortunately my vegetarian friend didn't realize the mistake until he was several bites into the fish burrito and he was really upset after eating it and felt ill since he hasn't eaten meat in over 10 years.  Also the burritos are much smaller than what you get at Chipotle or Qdoba, even for their larger "grande" size and the prices are similar.  Also the tables were not very comfortable, there wasn't much seating, and the temperature inside was pretty cold on a Winter day.
