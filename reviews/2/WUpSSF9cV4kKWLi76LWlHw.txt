Went here based on the rave reviews on Yelp.  This is one of the first times that Yelp has led me astray, and it makes me sad.

First, let me say that the staff here are incredibly friendly and helpful.  They go out of their way to make your experience good.  Upon walking in, we were asked if it was our first time, and then were promptly given samples of all the meats.  I immediately noticed how low quality and fatty the meat was.  The chicken and steak, though flavored nicely, were incredibly gristly and fatty.  The kalua pork is cooked well, but a bit on the salty side for me.  I got a steak burrito with the mild salsa, which just ended up being way too sweet because of the sweetness of the steak and the fact that the mild salsa is basically limes and pineapple (my fault, I guess for ordering it).  My wife ordered a chicken bowl, which was decent but not great.  We also got a side of chips and salsa, which I regret immensely.  The chips were stale and tasted like they came from a bag.  The salsa again was too sweet.  Our total bill came to $20 without drinks (a bit pricey, IMO).

The dining experience in general was basically a Hawaiian themed Chipotle. In case you're wondering, overly sweetened Hawaiian topped with cheese, guacamole, sour cream, and sugary salsa is NOT a good combination.  The food just really isn't that good.  Not only have I had much better food in general based on recommendations from Yelp, I've had much better Hawaiian food in Las Vegas.  I honestly don't know how people are rating this anything above 3 stars.
