The food was great! We were highly impressed! Just moved to vegas from California and its hard to find good mexican food out here. Im only giving  two stars because my family and I all had upset stomachs and had to run home to immediately use the restroom (very urgent situations). Very disappointing considering the taste was great! Also had to pay $1.19 for for a small scoop of pico de gallo (rip off)
