I live five minutes away from this place and I always trying out neighborhood joints. The exterior and interior needs major overhaul. the outside is a bright yellow building with bars over the windows. the interior is just so dated with nasty vinyl table tops.

The food is okay. I always ordered the bistek ranchero. good sauce, nice meat to pepper ratio, and a little spicy. Tortillas are good. The rice always seems to be overcooked, always split at the ends.

I would give this place another shot sometime again. I drive by this place everyday at night. There is never any lights on in the inside indicating that it might be closed. However, there is always a couple of cars in the very dim parking lot with a bunch of guys loitering the lot. Every now and then there is also a blue trailer. There is definitely something shady about this place. Until then, I will give it another shot during the day time when i need a mediocre Mexican food fix.
