This place is still trying to figure itself out. The decor is simple, so it made me think they must be saving all of the excitement for the food. I ordered chicken tinga and some pork tacos. The meat in both tacos was pretty decent, but the tortillas were too oily. I suggest frying the tortilla longer or just grilling them? I'd love to give them a second try, perhaps to try one of their specialty dishes.
