My husband and I have gone to the Phoenix locations for years, but every time we go to the Tempe location it's hit or miss. Today we ordered two burritos and two Carne Asada tacos on flour. The girl ringing us up seemed distracted with her phone. When she repeated our order she left off the tacos so we repeated ourselves. When the food was brought out she had the burritos mixed up and we had to bite into them to discover the switch. When our tacos came out they were on corn not flour. All of the tortillas were dry which we've experience at this location before. I had to go inside to try and get the tacos switched out for flour. The cashier said she didn't hear us say flour and that she would get another out to us. More than five minutes later the taco came out when we were done eating. Wouldn't have been a big deal except that there were only two other tables in the restaurant and they already had their food. I don't think one taco should take more than 5 minutes to make. 

We'll go back because we typically like the food, but this was a bad experience.
