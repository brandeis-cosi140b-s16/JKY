There was a friendly wait staff, and the pancakes and eggs, and guacamole were delicious. The flour tortillas were excellent, and we enjoyed the quesadilla. However, the quinoa salad was not good. The chicken was very dry and burned on one side. The chips are way too thick. The corn tortillas for the enchiladas were also way too thick, and the enchiladas were rather plain. The beans were very bland and even bitter, and the rice was just bizarre. I wanted Spanish rice but got some strange concoction. If we go there again, it will be for the breakfast food, but we probably won't be going again.
