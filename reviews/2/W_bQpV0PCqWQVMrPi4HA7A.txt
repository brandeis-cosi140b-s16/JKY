Just Not For Me

The staff at Don Taco/Taqueria Tacubaya are warm, friendly, and extremely accommodating, which is why I feel terrible for calling out their Mexican food as bland. I really wanted to like Don Taco/ Taqueria Tacubaya so badly, especially after reading so many positive reviews. However, the food in my opinion just isn't good.

This was my first visit to Don Taco/Taqueria Tacubaya
 Mexican Food Restaurant, and for me the food is just so-so. Just one step above what you would be served in a fast food establishment.

The salsa at Don Taco/Taqueria Tacubaya is like a watery tomato puree posing as salsa. For my entr√©e I choose the Carne Asada Tacos, Refried Beans, and Mexican Rice, both of which had very little taste and the Carne Asada meat was chopped up into very tiny pieces and was tough to chew.  The meal was just very disappointing.

Don Taco/Taqueria Tacubaya isn't the worst but I'm not in a rush to visit again
