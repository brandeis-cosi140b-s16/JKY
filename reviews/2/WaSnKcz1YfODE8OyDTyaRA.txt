This was my second time at 1900 Mexican Grill. The first time was during a job interview so I was much more nervous about the day rather than what I was eating. Now that I'm not feeling that sort of pressure, I can report a more accurate experience. 

The service is good, the atmosphere seems lively, and the restaurant is busy (at least when I was there both times). However, the quality of the food is less than great. I ordered the veggie fajitas and while the sour cream, guacamole, and salsa added some flavor to the tortilla, the veggies seemed over cooked (a bit on the mushy side) and lacked seasoning. Beans and rice accompanied the fajitas, but also were lacking a distinct flavor. 

I can't remember if the dinner menu is the same as the lunch menu. This previous experience was during lunch and the veggie fajitas were $7. The portion seemed to be a good size and for a light lunch, I could have shared. Other items on the menu were around the same price. My husband ordered a salad and it seemed just his portion size. 

I was disappointed in the quality of the food and I do not plan on returning. I remember I had similar thoughts my first time around; I guess even under a lot of pressure, like a job interview, the quality of food is still on my radar!
