My husband and I were looking for a quick drive thru for some Mexican food.  We drive by this almost daily and decided to try it.  
My husband ordered the breakfast burrito.  He stated he liked it...but it was a typical breakfast burrito.  I ordered the carne asada platter.  The meat was really tough.  The rice and beans were standard.  There wasn't any guacamole.  But the tortillas were really good.  
We thought we were going to be able to go thru the drive thru quickly, however, it took forever!  I don't see us going back because we like Laurita's on Maryland and Pebble much better.
