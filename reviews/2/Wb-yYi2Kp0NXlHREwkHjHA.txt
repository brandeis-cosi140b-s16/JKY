Yah, the place is seriously called "Pink Taco." I don't know if there is some sexual connotation involved but I guess I have a perverted mind. Anywho...this place is defintely not the best Mexican food I have ever had.  It probably isn't even in my top 10.  I got the fish tacos, and was very unsatisfied, the fish was rubbery and had very little flavor.  The location is nice for shopping, nice shops around the area and the service was friendly.  It seems like the happening spot, but we went in the middle of the day.  It's geared to a younger generation crowd, maybe in the mid 20's...but next time I am in Arizona, I definitely will not hit up this spot.
