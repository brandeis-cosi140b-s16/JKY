It makes me sad that I can only give this Javier's location 2stars when I love the other Javier's locations in Newport Beach, Irvine and even John Wayne airport.
The reason for this review and the two stars is because their service is amongst the worst service ever, their waiters are rude and not accommodation at all, their hostess area is full of confused girls that have no clue about what they are doing.
Their drinks are not the same and services staff is horrible.
With so many good places in Vegas then this is rated amongst food court food and service when the other Javier's are amongst the best places in California.
