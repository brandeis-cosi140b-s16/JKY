My husband and I went today to Carlos O'Brien's in Avondale. Normally we would go to the 12th St & Northern Ave location, however this was one was closer to us so we thought Yahhh... We got 2 lunch specials. I got #C  -- Chicken Chimi with red sauce. My husband got a burrito w/ red sauce. Okay service was good, place was bright, clean and nice deco....However the food fell a little flat, not what we were exactly expecting. The salsa was watery and no punch, bland. My food had no spices and no punch to it. My husband says his was okay but not great like he is used to. In fact we agreed on the food bring more suited for white people (no offence - by the way my husband is white and I am Latina).. It was very bland, no flavor. The Northern Carlos's food is better, it has flavor you can actually taste. We may try it again, but then again maybe not.
