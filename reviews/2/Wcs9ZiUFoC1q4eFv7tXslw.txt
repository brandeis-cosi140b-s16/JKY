Went there with our my family sat outside in the patio they totally forgot about us we didn't get serve until 15 minutes after being there we had to get our own menus and get the servers attention to take our order , my daughter and I order the chicken fajitas those where excellent, however my BF and my sister order the half rack of ribs and they where horrible they sent their food back 
Server went on a smoke break and didn't refill our drinks we complained to the manager he never apologized for the food not brought us our refills he waited for the server to come back from break to give us our drinks very disappointed with the service and food .
