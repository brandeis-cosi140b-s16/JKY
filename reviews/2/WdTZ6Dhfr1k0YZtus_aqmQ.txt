While the people are very friendly, I believe the quality just keeps going down.  I had a truly awful chicken taco here last week.  And this week, I tried the nachos-well, that was a mistake.  I can't believe they don't even bother melting the cheese for the nachos- they just dump shredded cheese on top.

This place is off my list.
