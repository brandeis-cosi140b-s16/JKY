Food is standard Tex-Mex with some attempts at creativity that mostly fall flat. Admittedly, Tex-Mex is usually not my thing. The salsas were quite good. The margaritas and craft-ish cocktails seemed overly sweet; three of us shared 6 different versions of their drinks. Agave syrup may sound cool, but it is just too sweet for my taste. Great that they've renovated a beautiful old building, so I hope it improves. Given their success at other locations it doesn't seem likely.
