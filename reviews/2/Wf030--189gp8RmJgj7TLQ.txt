They must be cutting back on their overhead while still charging you the same price. My so called "Ultimate Double Chicken Bowl" barely has any chicken in it all. My friends "CHICKEN Burrito" has a couple of scraps of chicken. If I pay for what I ordered, I expect it to be what I want. It's not rocket science nor gormet. GET IT RIGHT!!!!!
