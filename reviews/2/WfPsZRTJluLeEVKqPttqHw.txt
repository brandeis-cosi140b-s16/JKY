We have been going to this bar for every Sunday football game this year and it's a love hate experience.  I truly believe the next time will be better and it usually isn't.  The service is really slow, the bartenders rather talk to one another over their customers.  I still don't know what the bartenders names are after several games.  On the flip side the food is pretty good and the Micheladas are delicious.  The outdoor patio area is dirty with sun rotted funiture - c'mon put some new material on the corner sectional at least....  I will continue to suffer through and enjoy my place to complain about for this season at least.  Enjoy and say hi to ..... oh wait that's right I don't know their names.... LOL
