I have not been to Garcias in a few years and I must say I will not be back.  The bar was so loud I could hardly hear my wife.  The waiter was the most bland person ever.  He never smiled, asked us what we wanted and at the end pretty much threw the bill on the table and said you pay me.  Also my wife made a mistake and ordered something with meat, she is a vegitarian.  I realize it was her fault but when I mentioned it to the waiter it would have been nice if he offered her something else instead of saying oh.  At least the food was good
