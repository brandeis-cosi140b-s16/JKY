I don't know where to begin, I was born in California, lived in Chicago for 15 years both of those locales had better Mexican food. Now after living in Arizona for the last year trying some restaurants and take away spots. What is the deal Mexican food here so close to the border yet the flavor and colors of this food don't illustrate any thing but drab and boring. Pureed guacamole is not what I was expecting when I ordered it to accompany my Combo Grande of Chile Rellano and Chicken enchilada, do not order the fideo way too soupy and it taste like watered down spaghetti O's not good. I love Mexican food but I won't be back here to have it.
