Checked in for a party of two, was told there would be a 30 minute wait.  In reality, the wait was 5 minutes.  Not sure the hostess' know what they are doing.

Was seated, took 10 minutes for the waiter to show up.    Drinks were slow to arrive.   Pollo fundido arrived cold.   

Waiter never asked how the food/everything was.   Drink refills were very slow/non-existent.    Manager never came by to touch-tables.   

Overall, have had much better food and far better service elsewhere.
