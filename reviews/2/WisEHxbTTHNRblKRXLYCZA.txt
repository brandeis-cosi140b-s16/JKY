This place was not impressive.  Went in on a Monday night.  It was deader than disco.  With that being said, it took 15 minutes and twice to ask the hostess "where is our server"  After that, the service was great and they even offered us a free dessert.  

I ordered the mahi mahi tacos which were good but RIDICULOUSLY overpriced.  There couldn't be more than 3 oz's of fish on the plate.  For $17 I expect more than 2 bites of fish.  My sister ordered the fajitas which she said weren't great.  

Overall, I'd never go back there again.  I rather travel 2 miles more down the road and get Rubio's.  I know my Mexican food and this place is a giant N Scottsdale RIPOFF!
