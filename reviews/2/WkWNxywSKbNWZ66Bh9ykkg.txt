I ordered the cheese enchilada combo. I got very nervous when I heard the microwave used three times and I was the only one in the restaurant. The beans were good. The tortillas in the enchiladas didn't taste like they had ever been in the oven. They were mushy and undercooked. The sauce tasted like Las Palmas. The rice was very strange. I didn't eat any more after one bite. I think it had been sitting in the refrigerator too long or something, and looked like couscous. There's too much good Mexican food in the valley to eat mediocre stuff.
