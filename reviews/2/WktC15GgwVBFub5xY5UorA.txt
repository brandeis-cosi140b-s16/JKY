When the Yelpers say half as much food for twice as much money - you should listen. Two bean & rice burritos (mostly rice & lettuce & seriously lacking beans & sour cream) & a tiny tiny (fits into a styrofoam fries container) bean tostada = 20 some bucks. No guac & two thimblefuls of salsa. Coming from So Cal... we miss the previous owner!!! Total ripoff.
