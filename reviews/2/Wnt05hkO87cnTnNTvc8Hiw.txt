I have had better mexican food.  I guess living in southern california i get the experience of more authentic mexican food than pink taco.  

We got seated fairly quickly especially being a party of 17 people.

I got the carne asada tacos which came with 3 tacos, side of beans and rice. The rice was too hard and not very flavorful.  The beans were your typical beans.  The tacos were ok, not that great.  I had asked for gucamole and sour cream but it never came out.

I wouldn't come here again being in vegas in the future.
