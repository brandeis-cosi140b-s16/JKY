We went to SuperMex for dinner last night and it was just okay. Bonus for serving refrieds with chips-- but bland salsa. And the chips are tostadas and they're not warm or crisp... I had the chicken flautas, which were uneventful but not terrible. My husband tried cheese enchiladas with 3 different salsa and thought it was good. 

I wasn't wow-ed by this place and don't have a real craving to go back anytime soon. I think there are better Mexican restaurants around here. Actually, I think Taco Bell has more flavor then this place... a shame.
