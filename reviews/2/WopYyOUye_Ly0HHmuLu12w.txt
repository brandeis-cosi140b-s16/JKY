Sooo...freakin...loud...whaa? My ears were ringing by the time we were done. We had trouble just shouting our order to the server...why oh why...the place already screams upbeat and fun, spare our ears with the volume!

Food is just okay. I am not a fan of tapas to begin with, but some of the dishes like the Mexican Pho is just plain weird. The only thing that's "pho" about it is the rice noodle. 

The 2 stars are mainly for the interior design.
