I've been eating chicken at el poll loco since 1986 and the Flavor has decayed over time. It's a shame, because it used to be so good. Same is happening to the rice and beens. I also had a mango avocado salad, it was plain. It had only a few minuscule pieces of mango, half an avocado, broken tortilla chips strip and no dressing.
