Stopped here because of the reviews. Not to sure why everyone likes this place. $8.50 for a torta ahogada was over priced. They don't even pile on the carnitas. Just slice open the hard as a rock torta and put in a little meat.
Tacos are $3.00 and a michelada is $7.00.  The place is clean, service was great but $36. For 3 tortas and 3 sodas
, I don't think so.
