The food is pretty good. The servers are pleasant but the cashier BETTY is awful .I dont know if its her old age or if she was having a bad day... Her attitude was very bad when taking a payment or asked to change items on our receipts . I spoke with a manager hopefully that helps get the customer service in this restaurant back up to the nice place it used to be.
