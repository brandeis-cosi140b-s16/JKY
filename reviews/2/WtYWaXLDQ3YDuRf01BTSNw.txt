I'm originally from L.A. and as I bitch about constantly, it is HARD to find good Mexican food in Phoenix and Ajo Al's was a bit of a disappointment. However if a step above Taco Bell works for you, then you'll love this place. My friends and I were on a kick for a time coming here, mainly because they have a decent Happy Hour. If anything, you should check these guys out for that. The restaurant itself is nice on the inside and they have a nice bar so you won't be disappointed if you want a drink and some munchies on the way home from work. My advice, if you're going to hit this place, is to grab a seat at the bar, order a drink and an appetizer, have maybe another drink (or two) then move on.
