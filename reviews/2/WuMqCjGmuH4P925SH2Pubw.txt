Tsk tsk se√±or taco, so disappointed.

I love this place but tonight was so disappointing! 
While ordering the worker could not hear anything my boyfriend and I were saying to him through the drive thru and by the time he finally got the order right we were practically yelling so he could hear us. 
Got the order, no forks. Opened the order (I got cheese enchiladas) the cheese inside wasn't melted, not even a little. The enchiladas weren't even a little warm. Rice and beans were okay. I live literally 2 minutes away, if even that, my food should be hot. Just really disappointed in service and quality tonight.
