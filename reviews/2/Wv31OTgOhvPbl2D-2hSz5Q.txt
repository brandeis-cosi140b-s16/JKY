Overall, the food is good but truly NOT mexican in the real sense of the word. It is generally well served but if you do request to hold the cheese in the burrito or omelette,do count of having it included since the chef/cook does NOT pay attention to the orders given. The coffee is flavored and NOT the requested regular coffee. The staff truly didn't care about the fact fact that you requested and pay for regular coffee and NOT hazelnut flavored coffee drinks. I would consider/ think twice before going there again.
