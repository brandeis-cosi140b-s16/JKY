This is an update to my review:  The day after I posted this review I received a message via Yelp from a man named Evan B.  He said that he was part of the management team and ran the social media for the restaurant.  He apologized for all of the problems we had that day.  He said that they were having issues with their "allegedly state of the art (and brand new) stove and oven."  He also stated that the "Chef has been sick all week so we were running 2 cooks and no prep cooks".  I completely understand this, however, the meat in my chimi had to be burnt before it went inside, so one of the cooks ignored the issue.  He also addressed the other issues we had.  He stated that on that day they handed out a lot of cards for free entrees because of the wait and food issues.  I have to say that I am impressed that someone contacted me about this. This is not the first time that I have had a bad experience at a restaurant and had someone from their social media department contact.  I think this is great and every company should do this.  Thanks again Evan.
