First time here, the place is charming, has a nice patio, but a little over the top with Stereotypical decor.   There wasn't a hostess, only one waitress and one busboy.  Mid-week in summer so not too surprised at the limited staff.  HOWEVER, very long wait, never got waters after many requests, couldn't remember our order, never came back to get a fresh drink, mediocre food, expensive for value.  We will try again 'in season' but not in a hurry to go back.
