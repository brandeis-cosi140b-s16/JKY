Authentic isn't the word for this place, Shrimp cocktail was over priced for the quality and contents.....all it had was shrimp and avocados where is the Onions? Cilantro? Cucumbers? Tomatoes? All diced of course!

My father and Sister had the Steak, Chicken and Shrimp Fajitas that was so generic it reminded me of Acapulco or El Torito style.... You know what Im talking about, it looks and tastes like bulk commercial style food.

On a good note the Salsa (not the chips) and the Sopa de Fideo where pretty tassty. Sorry I didn't try the Tortillas but I heard they are good.

I really wanted to like this place unfortunately it failed and the live music wasn't my cup tea either. 

So the question is, where in Las Vegas can one get a good Mexican style shrimp cocktail?
