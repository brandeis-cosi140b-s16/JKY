Went here for dinner over the weekend with husband.  I kinda know what to expect from this place but felt like a sit down Mexican restaurant and was in the neighborhood.  Vibe is kinda like on the boarder, minus the tex mex part....Right away we were seated to our booth, booth for two people was a little awkward.  It's a half moon shape but our view was looking out onto a huge party of over 20 people, not very chill feeling.  I ordered a large house margarita on the rocks and a Mexican pizza.  Food took awhile to get to the table, we were already on our second basket of chips before our food arrived.  Pizza was ok, seemed like they skimped out on a lot of the toppings.  Margarita was weak also.  I usually get a little buzz going on when I order a large one, but I didn't get anything from that one.  As always the food at Macayo's seems to all drop to the bottom of your stomach like a rock....I think it's time to try something else even if I'm in the neighborhood.
