Bad sign when the salsa tastes bad.  Not bad-boring, like, bad-bad.  Like there was something unpleasant in it.

We ordered an appetizer platter with a few different dips.  This wasn't bad-bad, just bad-bland.

By the time our entrees arrived, I wasn't too excited.  They were okay.  I had the mahi crisp, which is kind of like a tortilla pizza, I guess, and that was probably the best of the bunch.  Still, the described tamarind sauce didn't taste like tamarind, and the wasabi flavoring didn't have any bite.

Worst of our group was my wife's veggie torta - the vegetables were sparse and had a burnt aftertaste.

When I heard the place was "contemporary Mexican," I was hoping for something like Gallo Blanco's delicious interpretations of Mexican classics, but, overall, the place felt like an extremely expensive Taco Bell.  Attempts at "fusion" or "innovative" Mexican cuisine don't really work if the end result doesn't even slightly resemble authentic Mexican food - or doesn't even have a bold flavor at all, period.  I don't think there was a leaf of cilantro in our entire meal.

At these prices, the food should at least be notable enough to have a strong opinion about.  And, to add insult to injury, the service we got was terrible - when one of our friends asked if an appetizer would make a suitable entree, portion-wise, the waitress literally sneered at her - "I don't know how much you eat."
