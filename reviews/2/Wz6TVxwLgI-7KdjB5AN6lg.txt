They always get my order wrong. The girl at the register doesnt listen!

I don't eat beef, haven't in years. Twice now I've ordered something with chicken only to get home and discover there's beef in it. Threw it away cuz it wasnt worth going back.

No cheese, no sour cream. My husband is lactose-intolerant. Guess what's on the food when I get home? Lots o cheese, lots o sour cream. Why do I even bother?!
