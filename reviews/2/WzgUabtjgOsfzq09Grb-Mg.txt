Went about 1:00pm. Nobody in the joint but us, same when we left. It was clean, staff was very nice. When trying a new Mex restaurant, I always order the carne asada tacos. If they can't get that right, then they won't get anything right. Had 2 carne asada tacos, wife had chicken enchiladas combo. Carne asada was average, chicken enchiladas had no flavor, the rice and beans were spot on. Go figure. If you want rice and beans, this is your place. Thought combo plate was a tad pricey.
