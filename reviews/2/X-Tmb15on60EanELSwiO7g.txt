Mucho Crapo
By The Rue

The only reason this gets two stars,
Is becuase of the patio and the bar, 
Also because it isn't too far,
I've even had them double charge my card. 

They charge to much for a brew, 
The food is mediocre at best if only I knew,
I would have hit a Del Taco drive through,
Not even worth going to look for someone to screw.

The tacos were tiny and at six bucks,
I could have gotten a Double Del Delux,
You're just a trendy name for the college f**ks,
When ASU is playing Oregon you route for the ducks.

I really doubt I'll come in here again,
Not with an enemy or even a friend,
It seems that your greed has no end,
I don't care if it's $2 you call it's starting at ten. 

Uno Crappo!
