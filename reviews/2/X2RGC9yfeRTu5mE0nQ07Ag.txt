I finally found a Crappy Chipotle!!! I have been to Chipotles in Boston, California, LV, and even the crummy parts of Seattle and even that one does not compete against the bad service in this place.

 The tables were dirty and one of the young ladies that was coming on to her shift was picking her nose behind the cashier!!! I highly recommend skipping this Chipotle. 

The only good thing was the service was fairly fast.
