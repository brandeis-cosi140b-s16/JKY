My wife and I bought a $30 Groupon for Manny's.The tacos and enchiladas were decent enough.I liked the free chips and salsa.But the service was lackadaisical at best,and negligent at worst,and it was a very slow time of day.
                 We got our bill,and the total was about $21.We were then told we had to use the whole 30.I said it was ok,we can forfeit the rest.We were then informed that the bill had to be 30,so they could add the 18% gratuity in the fine print on the Groupon.Thats fine,go ahead.We get the revised bill,and they added the extra sales tax of bumping it to 30,along with the gratuity.To review,a $21 bill became a $39 bill.It was only nine dollars out of my pocket,no biggie.But what a rinky dink way of doing business.
           I live only a few miles from here.If the service and attitude had better,or even made sense,they would have had a steady customer.As it is,Groupon would have to pay ME to go back.
