First of all, the hours posted on Yelp are incorrect. They're open 11 AM until 9 PM. Don't go there 45 minutes before close. The workers did nothing to hide the fact that they were annoyed and didn't want to be there. The worker didn't care about throwing the top layer of queso film onto the burrito. Stingy doesn't even begin to describe the rest of the ingredients, like lettuce, shredded cheese, and pico. Panchero's is known for mixing the ingredients before wrapping the burrito. The spoons are in the logo after all. That wasn't going to happen with these workers. Of all the Panchero's I've been to across the U.S., this was by far the most disappointing.
