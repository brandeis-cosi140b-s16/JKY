This is for Espos the restaurant right next to Espinozas Market:

On the positive side - the food is very affordable and you get a lot.

I had high expectations after reading the other ratings but unfortunately my experience with the food was that it was pretty bland. The chicken on the chicken taco was so watery (perhaps from being boiled right before being put into the hard taco) that it took a good minute for it to stop leaking water out of the shell. The chips with Jalepenos were served with room temperature cheez wiz type sauce and canned jalepeno slices on top of hard chips. The chicken enchiladas were bland - lots of cheese on top but not very flavorful.  I wish I could give it a higher rating but based on the meal tonight I won't be going back any time soon unless a need an inexpensive meal quickly.
