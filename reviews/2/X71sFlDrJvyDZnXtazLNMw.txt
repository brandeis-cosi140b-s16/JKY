Be forewarned, this is quite possibly the worst mexican food spot I have ever eaten at! If you enjoy authentic mexican food, don't go here!

The only reason why I'm giving their rating 2 stars versus only 1 star was because our waitress was very polite and serviced us well. The food however was terrible! 

My husband ordered the two cheese enchilada plate, and the enchilada sauce tasted nothing like enchilada sauce! The rice looked like orange pasty mush and the beans tasted like canned beans. I ordered the chicken taco salad and this is the first time I've had cold chicken in my taco salad. I couldn't eat it! The only thing good was the appetizer sampler that we ordered. 

We were the only people there on a Friday afternoon and now I know why! Overall we overpaid for crappy food!
