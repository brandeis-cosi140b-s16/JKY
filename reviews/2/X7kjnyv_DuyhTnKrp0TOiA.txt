Ate here after a Panthers game. Restaurant was filled but not overcrowded. Bar was very slow and understaffed. 

Once we arrived at the table the service was very slow. There were plenty of wait staff, however they mostly talked to themselves and did not focus on serving. It took 10 minutes just for the drink order and then another 10 minutes for the water to come. After 25 minutes, food only came for half the table, it took 10 minutes for the other orders to come to the table. Food was ok, but we had been waiting for so long at the table we mostly filled up on chips and salsa. There are plenty of other choices around.
