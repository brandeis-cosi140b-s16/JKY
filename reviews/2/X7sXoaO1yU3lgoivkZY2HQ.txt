Service was very slow.  We arrived at 4:45PM on Wednesday.  It took 5 min for anyone to come to our table.  Our drink orders didn't arrive until 3 min before our food, even after reminding the waiter three times.  They got our orders wrong for two of the four of us.  They asked if we wanted more chips.  We said yes, but didn't get more for 15 min.  The food was good, for the most part, but if the service doesn't improve, they won't make it.   I would have given them one star, if they had been open longer, but I know there will be some growing pains and expected improvement.
