Home of the ten dollar burrito? Well, it seems this way! The place is clean, fast, and there's outside seating, but when you add guacamole, sour cream, and chips and salsa to your item, the words you'll hear at the cash register will be, "That'll be Eleven-Fifty-Seven Sir!" I think this place is a ripoff, but their food is good. Rice does not belong in a burrito, so be sure and tell them that, especially so you get more meat & cheese.
