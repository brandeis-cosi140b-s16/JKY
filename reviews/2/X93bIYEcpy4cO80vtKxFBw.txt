My first visit to Ajo Al's.  The waitress was kind enough, but she was overworked and not able to keep up...lots of waiting.  To start out with, and to repeat someone's earlier comment, the guacamole didn't taste like it was made in house...sorta tasted like a mix...it was a little off in flavor.  The main course, tacos del mar, was actually pretty good.
