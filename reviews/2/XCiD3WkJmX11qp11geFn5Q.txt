The free coffee is great if you get up early enough. It's lavazza and delicious. However if you don't get up early enough, you have to wait for incredibly slow service for a cup of coffee. I ordered a chorizo breakfast burrito. It's definitely not chorizo in this, maybe spicy Italian sausage. It's definitely not great and not worth the 20 minutes I had to wait for it. I do like the Latin music they have playing inside, and there's tons of outdoor seating.
