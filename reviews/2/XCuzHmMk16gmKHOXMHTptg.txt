It was my first time here. The food was alright. Nothing special. But my biggest issue is staffing. Get people who are more professional and are more attentive. Instead of someone who kept calling me bro, and a girl who added guacamole after I had time I say 3 times not to because I changed my mind. I didn't say anything though.
