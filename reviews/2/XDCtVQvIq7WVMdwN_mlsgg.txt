I had high expectations after hearing so much about this place. It was ok. Everything tastes the same. A lot of items with bulgogi. I would like to have seen more variety. Pork belly tacos were nothing special; nachos were ok, order the small - large is huge and eating too much of it is a little overwhelming. I was expecting more.
