Our group was stuffed from a big lunch so we just grabbed something quick while getting ready. Unfortunately, the food here is extremely overpriced (thanks to the Jose Andres name) and not very good. For a few tacos and noodle dish we paid over $80 and we were all left unsatisfied and hungry. I didn't even realize this was a Jose Andres restaurant until after I ate the tacos and was even more disappointed.
