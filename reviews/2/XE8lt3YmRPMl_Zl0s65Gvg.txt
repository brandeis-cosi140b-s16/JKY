My wife is in love with Chipotle, and I am in love with Qdoba.
I've tried to explain the difference to people, and I am bombarded with "They are the same this"!

My response to this obviously is, "False!"

So, my wife and I found ourselves venturing over to Middleton, and since it was around 11:30, we were hungry. She spotted this particular Chipotle, and being the great husband that I am, I agreed.
A very bad life choice on my part. 
I ordered a simple steak burrito. Got all the fixing's on it. Looked for some awesome hot sauce like Qdoba has....left with Tabasco Sauce....No Thank you!

My burrito lacked flavor. 
The Steak Sucked! It was chewy, and fatty. Not a good cut of meat. I found myself picking up my napkin multiple times, and spitting the steak pieces out.
No Queso sauce!!!!!!!!!!
I repeat, No Queso!

I get the whole eat healthy thing Chipotle has going on......"would you like brown rice", but honestly...."No, I want white rice, and I want some Queso". I'm not a total fatty. If I'm paying $8/$9 for a burrito, It better be great!
Also, I believe that nothing is better than Cholula hot sauce. It's the best. This is something only offered by Qdoba.

I gave this Chipotle a chance and it failed miserably. No thank you Chipotle.
I'll stick with Qdoba!
