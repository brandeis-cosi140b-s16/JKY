Ate breakfast here when we got bumped to a morning flight. Breakfast burritos are $9-10 each. They were pretty good sized but mostly egg and tortilla. Very VERY skimpy on the meat. The pico de gallo was fresh though, and a little spicy. Also came with a little cup of salsa that was ok. A couple of negatives...they wouldn't allow us to substitute potatoes instead of eggs for some reason, and because of the way the burrito was put together, the cheese was on top of the pico de gallo and didn't melt at all. At the end, I ended up just eating the bacon and pico de gallo out of it and throwing away a big chunk of the egg and tortilla. Not worth the price. You can get a breakfast burrito in So Cal that is ten times better for half the price.
