I just can't give them more than two stars, I wasn't impressed by any part of the experience except that they were very friendly.

"Sweet" should not be the first word that comes to mind when describing red sauce. I got a smothered chorizo burrito, and you would have never known it was chorizo, no spice or flavor at all. 

"Peppery", as in too much black pepper, is the word for their hot salsa. The mild salsa just tasted like cilantro. I love cilantro, but with some other flavor too, please.

I will go back to try their green tamales since people rave on here about them, but so far I'm disappointed.
