Seeing all these amazing reviews has me really second guessing why I turn to yelp. I'm not exactly sure if this is constant issue, but there were flys ALL OVER just landing on & around you & your food which from the beginning made me question what I was doing there. This taco cart really is not that great! I ordered a carne Asada & al pastor taco. The  flour tortillas were obviously freshly made, but lacking that special something of a homemade tortilla. I've gotten better tasting carne Asada at filibertos so I'm so confused why everyone is praising it. My al pastor was better than my carne Asada but weirdly chorizo-y tasting and crispy. The prices were decent & the size of the tacos were also decent so better than a one star rating for me.
