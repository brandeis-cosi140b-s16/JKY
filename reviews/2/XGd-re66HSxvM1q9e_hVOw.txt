It was my second time there.  This time we invited a family member.  I love the decoration and atmosphere, the service,  however,  wasn't great.  We ate outside.  The table wasn't clean and The floor either. The restaurant wasn't busy. The server didn't understand my order and he gave me attitude when I tried to clear the misunderstanding. Unprofessional and childish. He didn't even attempt to understand what I was saying,  he didn't want to fix it. The food was ok, I wanted a vegan burrito and I asked the waiter if I could choose the ingredients (the menu didn't offer a vegetarian or vegan burrito already). He basically told me that they made a veggie burrito but it wasn't on the menu,  and that the cooks were going to make it their way.  After that he offered me the vegetarian menu,  from which I decided to order the meatless chicken tacos and the organic salad.  He never brought the salad and he brought a vegetarian burrito instead,  that pretty much was pure red and green bell peppers,  very watery and covered in salsa...weird! I'm not going back.
