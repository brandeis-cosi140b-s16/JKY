As an Elite Yelper, I'm ashamed to say I did not read the reviews prior to scheduling a lunch meeting at Texicali. I chose Texicali because several of my coworkers had never been to the Music Factory and I know that most people in the group like Mexican food. We went on a Friday afternoon and were one of maybe 4 tables dinining in the restaurant. 

The salsa and the food were absolutely delicious, I wish their service was as good as their food. It took over 15 minutes for our drinks to come out, then took an additional 45 minutes for our food to come out (we ordered our food shortly after being seated). We got our food but had no silverware, that took an additional ~5 minutes. Then, we had to wait, and wait, and wait for our checks. All told, the lunch ended up taking nearly two hours -thankfully I was with all of my supervisors... but Texicali needs to step up their service. I'll miss their delicious tacos and tasy guacamole, but won't be returning until their reviews improve.
