Food was not very good.  Used to be better.  Chicken burrito had good pcs. of chicken in it and nothing else. The red sauce on top tasted like ketchup!  I had to get it off, NG! 
The Beef in the taco, yuk.   Chips and salsa were good.  Fresh cilantro was good at helping out the food and rice a little.    
Won't go back.
