I was in town and wanted a good machacha for breakfast. Looked this place up here on Yelp and this place had good reviews. As a result I wanted to try this place out. Ordered a machacha with eggs & potatoes and I ordered the chips. The machacha was very bland and did not have much flavor. I had to sprinkle a lot of salt on it for it to have taste. I was not happy with my food but I be willing to try this place again. Maybe that day nothing tasted good and other days it could be better. But I, unfortunately, came on the bad day. The chips and tortilla was good but not enough for me to give more than 2 stars. Try this place if your close by and maybe you could come on the good day when the machacha is good!
