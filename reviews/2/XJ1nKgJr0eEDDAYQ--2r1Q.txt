I absolutely love chipotle and am a creature of habit and get the same thing every time. So I know how it should taste and I'm sorry but everything tasted old and stale. Like the chicken was dry ands were the beans and the chips. And they were pretty busy when I came in so ic understand they and snd re busy, but there wasn't any sweet and low left, so I waited politely by the cash register to ask for some and the girl looked at me 3 times and didn't ask what I needed and then ended up walking away. I'm sorry but I will not be coming back to this location. The one on my side of town has better quality and customer service and it's in the ghetto.
