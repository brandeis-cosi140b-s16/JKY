Great atmosphere for a Scottsdale Restaurant. Although, I'd choose great food over a nice setting.
I expected more from an Iron Chef restaurant.
Service was really slow considering there were several open tables and it was pretty late in the evening. 
The best thing was the guacamole. The salmon I order was mediocre at best and the flavors just didn't work.
The tortillas for the tacos were rubbery and chew. The lamb meat wasn't well seasoned and needed salt.
