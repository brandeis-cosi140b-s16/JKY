Boo Los Favs

I've been hitting this location infrequently for many years. I was never impressed with the customer service but the food was decent and the prices decent. 

This morning was the last straw. I ordered a bean burrito, no cheese, on a wheat tortilla. $3 & change. What I received was the smallest burrito I've ever seen at a local non-chain place. This was Taco Bell small. 

I didn't say anything since the two lads running the place already seemed like they weren't interested in offering any more than bare minimum. 

The funny / ironic thing is that I watched the cook make two breakfast burritos ahead of my mini-rito bursting with carne in addition to eggs and whatever else. I mean gut busting size. That carne is far more expensive than my beans that were applied to the tortilla like a thin layer of paint being sprayed on a new McMansion. I guess they are more interested in slinging meat than beans. 

Meh. Los Favs is now in the dung heap with Filibertos. I'm sure I'll be healthier for it. 

(Side note, I have complete respect and admiration for those in the restaurant industry. It's a tough biz. I ALWAYS try to be kind and understanding that it's tough)
