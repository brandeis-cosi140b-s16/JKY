Place was fast and friendly when i ordered my burrito. The only thing that really had me mad was when i told a cashier that there was no more ice in the machine. She brought it out with full of ice but did not pour it in where it was supposed top go . Like what the hell was that am i supposed to do it . I ended up putting my hand in the bucket and got ice for myself this was on june 16 2013 around 8pm . Smh lazy people.
