I don't know what to say.  2 fish burritos and a coke for 13 bucks.  the burritos were big.  if there are two of you just get one and split.  The fish was deep fried which sucked.  I don't know if you can ask for grilled.  They don't ask.  I don't eat beef so that kind of limits me.  the beef could be awesome and chicken great.  Better than taco bell, but i would have to go back and try it again for a solid grade.  but if you are hungry and you will eat anything they seem to have a lot of specials.
