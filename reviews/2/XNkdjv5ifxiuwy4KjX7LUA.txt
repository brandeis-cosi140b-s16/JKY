Oh how I wanted to love this place.  I love that greasy spoon fast food restaurant with the mexician twist.  In my mind micky d's would have been a better bet.  Anywho I love customer service, check, got it.  Staff was lovely.  All I have to say is the owner should tell his partner/family member /friend.....STEP AWAY FROM THE SALT!! DROP THAT SALT LICK! Also taste what you are serving....of course with a clean spoon. I want you to be successful here in the Copa!!  My babies love Mexican food and this momma is to lazy to cook that.  I will return after I flush my system from the over dose on salt.  Note: I did call to let them know of their salt-tasticness and that I wanted to see them succeed prior to this post.
