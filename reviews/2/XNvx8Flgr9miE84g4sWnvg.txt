I want to love this place so much.  I want to roll around nekkid with it.  But sadly I had a very disappointing experience there.  We lucked out and got a seat at the bar in the basement.  The basement is one of the coolest places to take a date in town. The atmosphere and wine did not disappoint.  I ordered their caesar salad with shrimp. When asked if I wanted it grilled or blackened, I chose grilled. Sadly when my salad arrived, the shrimp had been blackened and all moisture evaporated from them.  They were like chewy Stretch Armstrongs.  When I pointed this out to the bartender, she simply said, "that's how it comes.'  I get that not everyone's tastes are the same.  But I cannot think of anyone who would have enjoyed gnawing on these poor little creatures who sat sadly in a bed of lettuce cores and stems.  The brie toast was amazing, so they are capable.

I will only return for drinks and to soak up the atmosphere.  They SO need to fix the quality of their food or at least their service when something like this happens.
