Food was okay. The enchiladas we ordered had some interesting red sauce that was drenched over my cheese enchiladas. The sauce was overwhelming and the enchiladas were tiny. The salsa bar is nothing fancy..there was a couple of choices to choose from. They gave out complimentary chips but they came in a reusable plastic basket. I would think they would at least be lined with wax paper. Who knows if they just re-use them without washing them.  Ok but will not come back again. Too many other better places to eat authentic Mexican food.
