The rice and beans are delicious.  I ordered the Taquiza taco plate (my choices: suadero, carnitas, pollo con mole, lengua) and besides the mole, none of the meats were distinguishable, they all looked more or less the same and even had a similar consistency and grill flavor.  If i come back I won't order tacos, as they were mostly flavorless.  I am not a huge mole fan, but it was tasty.  The salsas they serve alongside the food sucked:  one verde, one chipotle.  They both tasted unsalted and watered down.  Ive had better, more flavorful salsa from a can (Herdez brand).  The man at the register cared more about the movie on the TV than the customers.
Taco y Taco is so much better?
