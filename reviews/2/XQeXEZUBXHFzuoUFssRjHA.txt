I really wanted to love Tradiciones.  Really.  But I didn't. 

After weaving my way through the perplexing plaza that is in front of the patio in front of the restaurant (I saw a sign that said this NOT the entrance, but not one that said this IS the entrance), I finally found the entrance.  The smallish entranceway opens into a grand space that is incredibly lovely with tons of bent steel and bright colors.  I couldn't believe that I was in the same building as the Ranch Market.

I was so mesmerized by the beauty of the location, and the display of a gajillion tequilas, and the music of the roving mariachis, that almost any food set before me would have been forgiven.  Almost.  The chips and salsa were okay, but my entree was really disappointing.  I ordered the spinach enchiladas and got a bland enchilada with barely cooked button mushrooms and hardly a shred of spinach! Seriously. I expected to bust into my little rolls to find a plethora of greens, but actually had to dig and search for a mere shriggle.  And the beans and rice were mediocre at best.

But, I must confess, my partners pollo looked incredibly tasty and he said it was.  I'll have to take his word for it, because I won't be going back to try again when I could just as easily go to La Tolteca for much better food.
