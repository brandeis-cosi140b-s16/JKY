I had been meaning to check out Burritos Juarez for a while now, but never got around to it until yesterday. It was OK. I ordered a carne asada burrito with cheese, sour cream and guacamole. I didn't know that they charged extra for all three of those items. It wasn't much extra, but still. Extra for cheese? Really? Anyway, I probably should have paid more attention to the menu. 

The burrito came out and was pretty skinny. The flavor of the beef wasn't that great, and everything tasted pretty bland. Most of the flavor came from the cheese (which was very good, btw) and the sour cream. They also give you salsa in squeeze-bottles, which was nice and I've never seen that before at a Mexican place. The red sauce had a nice smokey flavor to it, and the green sauce was OK, though I'm usually not a fan of green sauces. 

I may visit this place again. It's pretty close to my work, the prices are reasonable ($7.xx for a burrito and soda, would have been $5 and change if I hadn't opted for the extra toppings) and some of the other menu items look pretty tasty. The employees were super-nice and the place was really clean, but, based on that burrito, not so great.
