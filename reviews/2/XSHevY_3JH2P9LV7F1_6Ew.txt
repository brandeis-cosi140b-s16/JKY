Well, finally tried this new location. Won't have to go there again! The food is mediocre at best. Small bowl of chips, with an even smaller bowl of salsa. I ordered the mixed fajitas and it was just okay. Not enough meat for me and enough green peppers to choke a horse. No sour cream or guacamole which is essential to good fajitas. Over cooked.
 But worse than the food was the poor lighting in this new place. Horrible florescent bulbs give the place the look of a morgue. The one great thing about this visit, was the live music (Fridays 6-8). So many places like this just expect you to be ok with sub-par and just take it.
