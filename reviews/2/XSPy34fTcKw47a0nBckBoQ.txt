$2 tacos is always the best way to get me to try your food!!! Fantastic idea....if only the service, food and prices were as fantastic.  We were a party of 8; but only two of us arrived early. So we sampled the avocado mousse before everyone got there. It was different, creamy and a little cilantro maybe, but something was not right so we ordered the Guacamole that is Hecho en Mexico. It was worse! Mushy frozen avocados with pico de gallo mixed in. The salsa verde was delicious though! The red salsa was just ok. Tasted fresh out of a jar but absolutely loved the chips! 

The food was priced much too high for the quality and service. They lack consistency; my first fish taco was served with 4 tiny pieces of fish, and then my second was served with at least 4 times that amount. The fideo was delicious, but the cheese in it was a little too much. I will definitely have to give this place another try, but ouch $12 for enchiladas? Even with the fusion of mexican food I'm having trouble seeing myself there for any other day than $2 tacos day. Especially when the server argues about the bill (even after i asked her to keep my tab separate due to ATM card only). On a much worse note: she tried to leave the charges for 4 bills that had already been paid on our receipt; and balked when we asked for an updated bill. TOO FUNNY.
