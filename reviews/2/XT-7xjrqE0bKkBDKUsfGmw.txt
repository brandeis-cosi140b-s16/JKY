Tried this location today and had a Chicken Burrito & while the service was very fast, and the girl taking the order was smiling and very nice, it was "More filler than Killer" compared to the one I usually go to by Stratosphere on LV Blvd where they load the Chicken on hard and you get your $5's worth. At this Location it was more beans & rice than chicken. It was good though but I'll be sticking with my neighborhood location.
