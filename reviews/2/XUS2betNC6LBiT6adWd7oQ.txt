"...the exception to the rule..."

As a regular of the "Los 24/7-bertos" style establishments, the chicken tacos, horchata, carne asade fries and breakfast burritos are usually synonymous valley wide as a safe bet for late night Mexican food.  This review is meant as a warning for those who inch through this location's drive-thru.  Here lay the exception.  Unfortunately, on more than one occasion, months, if not years apart, at different times of the day and night, THIS Filiberto's has screwed up  ...wait for it...  chicken tacos.
 
Such a cornerstone type order repeatedly subjected to blasphemy.  
Perhaps there's a sign in the kitchen directing to leave off the pollo in the chicken tacos and replace with lettuce and cheese.  Like being woke from pleasant dreams with a bucket of water, the craving for chicken tacos becomes disillusioned with the first bite; replaced with images of Clara Peller asking "Where's the beef?"

The place is clean, in a convenient location, and always open, but a Mexican restaurant in Phoenix Metro screwing up tacos has numbered days.  The places within a mile of here where a customer can get gratifying tacos are boundless.  If you have a hankering for this dialect of Mexican food, drive down the street to the next Filiberto's, or Julioberto's, or Los Beto's...etc. where they're going to hook you up.
Give this one some time to figure out their tacos.
