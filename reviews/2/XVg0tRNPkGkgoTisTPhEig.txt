I hate to give any place a low rating but getting ripped off is NOT ok so I suppose if they even care, they're lucky getting 2 instead of 1 ~ even though we WON'T b back!! Filibertos used 2 b the place that any other fill~in~the~blank: berto's tried 2 imit8. Gone r the days of nice ample portions 4 decent prices & quite frankly I haven't really considered them Filiberto's 4 awhile now... more like fill~their~pockets while giving u the shaft. 

   Burritos u can expect 2 b mostly tortilla/hardly any filling & if they were @ least longer & skimpy or stumpy but fat it might b ok, but here we go again w/ another drive~ thru mexican place that's cutting corners & charging more 4 less in quality, ingredients, quantity & don't even get me started on the so~called service aspect. (more complete lack~there~of). 

   Order & get charged 4 a Large Pina & discover it's water results in them looking @ u crazy like ur trying 2 get something 4 free when u tell them. Uhm, no just would like 2 get something close 2 what I ordered & paid 4. And speaking of water... red & green sauce cups r 1/2 filled & mostly water w/ color & little flavoring & they just love throwing them in ur bag on top of whatever u order so it gets all over the place & satur8es napkins (if they even include them) cuz they don't secure the cheap lids, even when u ask 4 them in a seper8 bag. Yeah, they understood me (I've asked both in English & in Spanish). Yes a 'gringa' can talk Spanish fluently... ;-p

   And I really don't get why a "drive~thru" can take SOooo Long when u discover there's nowhere near the food in ur bag that Filiberto's used 2 b famous 4. As I've said b4, if any place inevitably increases their prices as often will b the case, @ least let it b equivalent 2 what it was b4. Also when a Veg~head orders the very limited items we have 2 choose from & almost every time finds some meat that somehow managed 2 b in their pl8 or burrito, that's a Huge EWWW!!  So will we ever c Fili(F*ck)tards again? Best Amy Winehouse voice echoes No, no, NO!!!
