This place is a bit like stepping into a time machine and going back to the early 80's.

The decor is kitschy, and not in a fun way. The Tex-Mex themed dining area is designed to be comfortable, but is definitely aimed to please simple folk in lower income brackets. Tableware and accoutrements are of the sort used in cafeterias.

To be fair, service was top-notch and the restaurant was spotlessly clean.

My two star rating is mainly for the food. Very little on the menu is vegetarian. Many bean items contain lard. Anyone on a vegetarian diet, or trying to eat healthy will have problems finding anything to eat here.

Most dishes appear to be old-school Tex-Mex classics like one would have found at a Texas beanery in the 1960's. There is nothing modern or innovative on the menu. 

Sorry, but, the culinary world has moved on to bigger and better adventures. Most of us left this sort of food behind decades ago. If you have older relatives looking for simple, old-school, lard-filled Tex-Mex this is the place to go. Otherwise, prepare to be seriously chagrined.
