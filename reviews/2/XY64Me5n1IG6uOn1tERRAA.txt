Ok, so growing up in san diego I remember the original real robertos.  This now chain quenches my taste buds for a bit till I can get back to san diego to have better taco shop food.  Most robertos here are still good, but thisone, well thisone plain sucks.  Cant tell why, the meat is always tough, burritos are smaller, food is burnt.  This is the only robertos in town I would not go to.  Dirty also...
