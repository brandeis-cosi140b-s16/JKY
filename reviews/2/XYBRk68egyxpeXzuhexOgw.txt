Everyone I've talked to that likes this place says the same thing, "I've been going there for years."  Yes - and perhaps years ago it didn't feel like a dive restaurant in constant jeopardy of being shut down for health code violations.  But now...

The food is completely, unmistakably mediocre.  As is the service.  Maybe it's not filthy - maybe it's just the lighting and decor that makes it look like that way.  But I'm pretty sure the roach I saw dart up the wall was real.

(Okay - that's a cheap shot - there are probably roaches in many places I've gone and I just haven't seen them.  Fair point.)

Nothing about this place makes it a can't miss.  I get the history, the nostalgia, and the fact that some famous people have dined there, but you can find better Mexican food all over the Valley and some just a short drive away.
