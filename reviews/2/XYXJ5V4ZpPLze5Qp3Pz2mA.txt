Been there twice so far. First time was good but second visit was pretty bad. Waited at the door for 5 minutes then decided to seat myself. Asked for more dip and chips three times before we got more. Asked for no peppers on the fajitas but yes on the onions. Sizzling plate came out with nothing but a bunch of dried up burnt chicken. Tamales and the wifes salad were good.
