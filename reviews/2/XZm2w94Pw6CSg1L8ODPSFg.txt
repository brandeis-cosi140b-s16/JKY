La Gloria is located in the Forum Shops Food Court.

I had gotten Smashburger, my cousins decided for La Gloria.

They decided to give me a chicken taco. I remember it was chicken. Why? It was dry, had no taste, and looked unappetizing. For the Yelp? For the Yelp! If I recall it was ~ $6 for a pair of 3 tacos, which makes no sense. $2 for that sad thing you call a taco? What? Why?

Make sure you get more salsa or hot sauce. Something that will give it flavor. They have some on there but it's not enough.

To their credit though, they do put a lot of meat on there. It's just... something I would not get or eat again. 

Expensive food, but you know.. It's Vegas.
