This place brings great shows to phoenix. That's why I give it 2 stars over one. Also I like that most shows are all ages or 16+. 

Music is good and sound quality is nice!  They have messed up artists sound quality in the past . The staff is super hipster and not really my favorite. Security is pretty awful in my opinion 




I like other venues in phoenix way more. It's an ok set up and bar. And the scene is pretty horrendous
