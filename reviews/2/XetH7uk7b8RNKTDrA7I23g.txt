I've been to this La Parrila Suiza a couple of times now. I keep getting invited by some friends to join them in this Mexico City food fest.  They love this place so I've hesitant in writing this review but after our last meal I feel I must "spill the beans"...

Service ~ They are really friendly and helpful when ordering but they are very slow. I mean, come on!  You can only play "eye spy" so many times before you loose interest in why your there to begin with.  The only... and I mean only reason we did not leave was due to their tri-salsa dippage action with crispy chips.  It is really one salsa a pico de gallo and a green creamy kinda of dip

Food ~ Chicken flautas were ok, three of them fried, topped with sour cream and Piquillo sauce served with rice, guacamole cole slaw and beans. The cole slaw and beans were not goo at all.  

We also had the Chicken Melt which was very good but we were shorted one of the tortillas!  It was supposed to be two flour tortillas filled with melted cheese, chicken bacon, avocado and tomatoes, topped with cheese and a sauce. It also came with their beans rice and cole slaw.  It took so long to get our order we didn't bother saying anything...

Our last order was a chicken taco salad.  It was HUGE and served in a very crisp tortillas bowl.  The salad was tossed with all of the ingredients which was different.  I enjoy separating some of the chicken, cheese and other goodies in the salad bowl, but with this salad you could not do that ~ it was all tossed together.  The chicken was very cold and tasted blah. The bland dressing was also tossed into the salad which made this thing a big bowl of mushy lettuce, yuk-a-roo.

So if your meeting a friend and they are buying this might be a good place for you to go.
