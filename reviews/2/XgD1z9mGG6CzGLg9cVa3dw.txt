ok so I understand you get what you pay for and fast food isn't 5 star dining but....


this visit to taco bell was horrible I ordered the box meal and my two tacos had a barely any meat in them I wasn't going to pay for a cheese and lettuce taco so I asked for more meat and she said she had to charge me so I asked for a refund 

on top of that we were in the drive thru a total of 15-20 mins worst taco bell experience ever
