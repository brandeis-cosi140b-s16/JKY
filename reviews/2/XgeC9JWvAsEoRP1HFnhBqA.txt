So I am know for having a pretty sturdy digestive system and have been know to handle some pretty volitile foods with ease.  I eat at questionable roadside stands and holes-in-the-wall with ease in most cases.    Todays visit to Mi Pueblo challenged that fact.  

Going in with coworkers for a quick bite to eat I ordered the Nachos.  Seemed ok until I saw that they also had put their red sauce/enchilada sauce all over the chips along with cheese, grilled chicken pico de gallo and refried beans.  WHY did they have to put that red sauce....ugh.  I picked through what I could and couldn't avoid some of it.   I also tried their habanero chipotle salsa and their salsa fresca, both fresh and tasty.  

Fast forward about an hour.  Sitting in my meeting... *gurgle...gurgle...gurgle* Ugh... I pushed ignore.  But there came a point that I could ignore no more. Uhh Oh?!  Things were not right.  I may consider myself a queen, but the throne I have been spending the afternoon on is not what I expect. 
Had it not been for my digestive distress and that awful red sauce, I would have considered 3 stars for cleanliness, service, average and generous portion size.
