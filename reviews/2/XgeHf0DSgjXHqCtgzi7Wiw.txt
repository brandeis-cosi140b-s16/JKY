Disappointed to say the least.  I thought I'd give this place a 2nd chance...the first being so-so.  I had a simple order...a carne asada taco and a daily special bean burrito for $1...2 minutes later was my shell, my carne, and some runny guacamole or verde sauce on top...I honestly could not tell by taste appearance or texture and have been out here for years.  The bean burrito-what you'd expect...double the price if youw ant cheese..c'mon  It is just not the same as Roger's shop up in Anthem.  Boring, bland, and clearly riding the coattails of its once positive DD&D review.  Don't judge Roberto's by this location on Union hills.  The real deal is up in Anthem off of Daisy Mountain.  The two locations are night and day in terms of quality, service, presentation, ambiance (well that's not fair they are in a gas station).
