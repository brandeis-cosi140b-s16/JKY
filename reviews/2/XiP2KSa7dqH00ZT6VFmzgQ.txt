Dos estrellas.

My review has been fed into Yahoo! Babelfish Text Translation...twice.  First English to Spanish, then Spanish to English:

Not more than two stars. It ate the tacos of fish, #6. combined. The fish was exaggerated and oily and now I have a pain the belly. The rice was good, the beans was hardly acceptable. My daughter ate enchilada of the cheese. She was just very well also. My wife had kidney beans of the rice and the swindle of the flutes. Once again two to star worthy. Moreno' s does not come until now near my hole preferred in the Mexican restaurant of the wall, Mess orderly from in the boulevard of the chandler hardly to the east of the 10. Grieved, as soon as can' t recommends east place.

The original:

No more than two stars.  I had fish tacos, combo #6.  The fish was overdone and oily and now I have a tummy ache.  The rice was good, the beans were just ok.
My daughter had a cheese enchilada.  It was just ok as well.  My wife had flautas con arroz y frijoles.  Again, two star worthy.  
Moreno's does not come close to my favorite hole in the wall Mexican restaurant so far, El Ranchero on Chandler Boulevard just east of the 10.
Sorry, just can't recommend this place
