Unfortunately I'm extremely particular about meat that I eat...I can't deal with random fat chunks. Which this place seems nice and the one bite I did eat had good flavor, but does have the random chunks I can't deal with. If you don't mind that part then I'd say go ahead and eat here, you'll prob like it
