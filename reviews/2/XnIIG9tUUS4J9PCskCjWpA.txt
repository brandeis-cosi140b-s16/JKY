The place is welcoming, trendy, nicely decorated, clean, spacious, and family friendly. The downside is the food is not good at all. I had the three pinche taco combo and tried the fish taco, chicken mole taco, and the carne asada taco with rice and beans. I did not like how anything tasted. The tacos come preseasoned with a sweetish salsa taste. I'm not into sweet salsa. There was no salsa bar either. We were told the tortillas are freshly made so I ordered a few. When the tortillas came, I was disappointed because they tasted like the tortillas sold at the supermarket, and not hand made gorditas. I'm not going back. I'm not sure why this place has so many five ratings and am wondering if the reviews are friends or employees of pinche tacos.
