I would have put one star, but as the service has always been very friendly and prompt, I added one more. The last time I ate here the chicken tasted raw and undercooked, and this is not the first time. I used to love their chicken burrito, but the serving of chicken in it dropped until you were lucky to get one bite with chicken out of three bites. The prices are not cheap, but they would be worth it if the food quality was there. And the place itself is always dirty and unkempt, isn't there somebody who is employed here who empties out the overflowing garbage cans, wipes down the dirty tables, and cleans the bathroom? I chalk it up to management, they need to step it up.
