I admit I have a sick love of the ground beef taco salad at Taco Bell.  There's something addicting.  However, the taco salad I purchased here was horrible.  The shell was not cooked well, giving it a very raw, bitter taste.  The amount of meat, tomatoes  and lettuce given was quite pathetic.  A could count the amount of chopped tomatoes served on my hand. And the lettuce barely covered the button of the shell. 

Service was pretty quick and customer service was pleasant, but the restaurant seemed to be pretty stingy.  

Can't recommend this Taco Bell.
