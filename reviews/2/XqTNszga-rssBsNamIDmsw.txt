Over all it wasn't too bad - I would give it 2.5 stars.

I heard good things about this place, so when I was in the area thought I would try it.  Stopped in for lunch at 12:30 and the place was dead.  No customers at lunch is never a good sign.  

It is a huge large restaurant with a full bar.  It was porbably nice 20 years ago and is in need of updating.  

The hostess was talking on her cell phone when she seated us - bad manners.

We walked in and they had a janky looking buffet but the food looked okay.  For $7.95 the price was right.  The food was about average - decent.   I had chile verde, beef colorado, chile rellanos...plenty of food for the money.

Overall  -  This place doesn't blow my skirt up.  It wasn't bad just better options out there.
