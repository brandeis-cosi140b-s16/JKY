I was very excited to try this restaurant as there aren't any good Mexican restaurants in the Summerlin area... 

We started with chips and salsa and queso. The chips were decent and salsa was good but nothing particularly delicious. 
The queso had mixed reviews at our table some members of our party loved it. Other hated it. If you are a fan of artichoke cream cheese dip you might be interested in this.

The steak salads were decent. Meat seemed overly salted but overall not bad. 
The chicken tacos were the flop of the evening. Extremely greasy and tasteless. 
The beans and rice were fair. 

The carnitas enchiladas were the favorite at the table. I recommend those out of all the dishes we tried. 

The fried ice cream was so - so. The only downfall was it was greasy... 

Mediocre food but the real kicker was the price of the food! $20 for two tacos with a small side of beans and rice is outrageous. 
That's the reason for the two stars. Average to below average Mexican cuisine at sky high prices. 

I won't be returning.
