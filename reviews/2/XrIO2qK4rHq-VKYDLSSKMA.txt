My family and I went to this restaurant on Mother's Day so perhaps I am being biased as I know most restaurants are out of control on that particular date.

This was my experience: We had a group of 9 and got seated right away. That was initially impressive! Our waiter was a man named Lorenzo. We ordered drinks, got our chips and salsa/bean dip rather quickly. We ordered our food and from then on it was a 45+  minute wait to receive the food. I think I would have been okay with waiting on the food if I didn't notice that all other families that arrived after mine were brought their food right away. Small or larger groups everyone else's waiters were ON IT; however, ours was not. I finally could not stand it any longer and approached him to ask if he could bring our food as each plate was ready, versus waiting on all of them to be ready entirely. He seemed annoyed at my comment, but noticing how slow he was moving kept irritating me.

Once the food arrived, I was starved and shoved everything down. I had a combination plate with Huevos Rancheros. The hand made tortillas that came with the meal were a nice surprise. However, the rice was bland. My huevos rancheros had a weak red sauce with no flavor. I asked around the table, and the variety on our table had burritos and fish combo plates, yet they all agreed that each item was rather bland. 

The alcoholic drink selection although not that large, was very good. I ordered something called "Que Viva la Borrachera" and I have to say that probably saved this entire rating. They packed on the alcohol!

I would consider this place for appetizers and drinks with a friend, but not for a meal.
