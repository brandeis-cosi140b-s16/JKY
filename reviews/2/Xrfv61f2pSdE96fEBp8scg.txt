Went yesterday after a doing a couple of errands with my husband to the location near 75th ave. on Thomas Rd. This was the worst service we've ever received. If I was rating the food, it is always 5 star but our waitress, Linda S. was so unprofessional. She took our order and when it arrived it was wrong but kept arguing that she just brought what we had told her and that she wrote down exactly what we ordered.  Then she just disappeared and was not available to us or the other table she was serving. It was before 5pm, so it wasn't busy at all. We ended up being there for over a hour for our "quick" dinner.  IF we go back to that location we'll make sure Linda isn't our waitress!
