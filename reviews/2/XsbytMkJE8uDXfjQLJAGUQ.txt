We went to Arribas for Christmas dinner.  There was a 30min wait even though the place was about 40% empty.  People that were waiting started seating themselves at open booths in the bar even they it wasn't open seating.  When one person complained about it they were immediately seated at another open booth.  Being the chump that I am and having a party of 6 we waiting patiently.  I ran over to CVS to get a snack for the wait.

We were finally seated new an area that was closed off and near several empty and set tables while others waiting to be seated.  Our server only had 2-3 tables but was gone from the floor for long stretches.  It took over 10 min to get our drinks (probably more like 15).  

The food took at least 45min (although the guacamole came out fairly quickly).  I had the chicken breast plate.  The chicken was nicely seasons, the rice was ok, the bean portion was very small.  My wife's fajitas were good but the veggies were incinerated.  the kids enjoyed their tacos, salsa, bean dip and guac.  I tried a couple of the house beers but they didn't impress me.  My wife had a 99c margarita and liked it.  

While my wife was using the bathroom a waitress came in crying.  I can only guess that the kitchen was understaffed so they held people back to keep from flooding it.  The food was decent and there are other things on the menu I would like to try, so we may be back again, but not at Christmas.
