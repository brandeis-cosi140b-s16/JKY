After trying on wedding gowns next door, my group was in the mood for Mexican food.. UGH! NOOO! Ive got a gown to fit in to! I love the decor.. The staff was friendly.. The food.. was, so so.. I found the chips on the greasy.. as in.. greasy fingers side.. The salsa was great.. and my enchiladas were nothing amazing.. almost watery.. I dont think its nice to have to ask for app plates for my chips and salsa.. but we had to, because I thot it was ridiculous to be using napkins! 
Our waiter seemed off kilter when asked to split the check.. oh well.. so so.. is a 2 too..
