Just okay in my opinion.  Went here for lunch today and here's my review:

-Grilled Chicken Burrito:  Pretty good size, but lacked some taste.  The burrito was way too neat.  When you have a carne asada or chicken burrito, you expect a messy situation.  This also means that you are killing it like a mad man.  If it isn't all over the place, it doesn't belong to your face.  Scary when chicken doesn't taste like chicken. 

-Taquitos (Rolled Tacos):  I was disappointed.  Taste like cardboard and believe me, I've eaten cardboard before.  Dry as heck.  

The layout of this restaurant is a bit odd.  Small counter and located towards the front.  If you sit near the back, you may not even know your food is ready.  Ours sat there for awhile until another customer brought it to our attention.  

I'm still searching for a good FF Mexican Restaurant in Vegas and I'm not talking El Pollo Loco or Taco Bell.  For now, Roberto's by my house will just have to do.
