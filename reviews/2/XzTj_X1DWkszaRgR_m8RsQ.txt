We went to this place for lunch and ordered the Carne Asada burrito.  It was okay, there was not a lot of meat in the burrito and for the price we felt we could have gone somewhere else and gotten more for our money.  The chips were kind of stale and they only had one kind of hot sauce.  The employees were really friendly and gave great customer service.  But overall I would probably not come here again for the Carne Asada.
