Service at the bar suck! That's being nice about it. If you are not a regular, then you get overlooked for an obscene amount of time. As if the bartender is thinking, "If I ignore her, she will eventually go away". Wrong! I'm toughing this one out Boo-Boo! The bartenders card EVERYONE! So what if you look without a shadow-of-a-doubt like you're 75, you are getting carded. AND if by chance, your bartender takes a break and rude bartender #2 fills in, you get carded AGAIN. So freaking what if you have an open tab and an empty glass in front of you. Bring those credentials back out baby.  "It' for his own peace of mind." 

On a positive note, the Ceviche was out-of-pocket!!! I will put up with the rudeness of the staff just for that Ceviche! The Arizona burger, however,  was not so great. ...Reminds me of Wendy's square, flat-behind burger. The only thing that saves me from talking more about that sorry burger was those seasoned fries. They were hot and tasty! So, to recap... Service is non-existing, but take a chance!  The food is hit or miss! Lol. You're at a casino right!

County dancing is taught on Wednesdays and Thursdays. Dance lessons are awesome! It's a great group of people, including the instructor! The band that plays on those nights are good too.
