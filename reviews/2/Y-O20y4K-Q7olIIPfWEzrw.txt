This is a new location.  LOOOOVE the convenience of it in my neighborhood, BUT service sucks and portions are not consistent with other Chipotles.  I stood around for a while just waiting for someone to acknowledge me on a Saturday at 1:00pm - they were chatting about "some b***h" that just left.  Almost all the accoutrements were empty and it didn't look like there was anyone interested in restocking or wiping down the line as they dragged all the orders through food that had fallen and left ignored.  All 6 of my burrito orders were scraping the bottom and not the usual amount of loaded yumminess.  As I was trying to place 2 of the 6 orders together because they had the exact same ingredients, apparently multi-tasking is not a skill the line girl possesses and did not/could not make 2 burritos at the same time.... I'm guessing I'll be the next B they'll be talking about as soon as I walk out the door.  
No thanks - I'll go to another location where  its faster, cleaner and the staff is friendlier.
