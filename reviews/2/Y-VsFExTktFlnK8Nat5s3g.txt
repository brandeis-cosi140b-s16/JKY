Got 2 stars because the chicken mole enchiladas are very good but the service sucks! Can Menudo is much better than here! Couldn't get a glass of water and since when do Mexican restaurants charge extra for chips when the first bowl is miniature. Don't bother going. Couldn't even get a manager to talk to!
