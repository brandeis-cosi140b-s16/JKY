The first night of our conference, I met my coworker here for some margaritas. Boy was it slammed! The space is comprised of a small bar area and smaller restaurant.  They also have no bathrooms, so beware that if you drink too much water, you have to go downstairs to pee.  

We found seats in the bar at a high top and there were a few other high top tables open. So we waited. And waited. And waited. The waitress on duty seemed to be approaching the tables of men who sat down 10 minutes after we did before she ever greeted us. So we approached the male bartender who happily gave us menus. After about 20 more minutes of the waitress ignoring us, we approached her as she walked by us again and asked if we could order drinks. Sure. So I ordered a blood orange margarita without the mole on the rim and my coworker ordered some kind of margarita with pineapple in it.  The margaritas were fabulous. They both seemed to have been made skinny with agave in them and lime juice.  That was great. Sadly, our service was terrible.  As the crowd thinned out to only 4 tables, our waitress still did not approach us until we literally walked up to her. I can only guess she may have thought 2 young looking women would've tipped her less generously than the older gentlemen at the conference. That sort of becomes a self fulfilling prophecy because once you ignore us for so long, your tip decreases. My bet is that this place could use some systems and processes to handle busy hours.  But I wasn't all that impressed.
