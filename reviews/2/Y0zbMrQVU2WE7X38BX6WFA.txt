Came here to meet up with family who was in town.  My assessment? Eh.  I have definitely had MUCH better Mexican food.  Salsa was nothing exciting.  Had the golla burro after reading the reviews and it wasn't anything spectacular.  Pretty standard burrito with butter around it.  The beans are homemade so that was a plus.  Wasn't a fan of the fact that additional chips cost you.  It was something like a measly $1 but still.  Guess it's a good thing that the salsa wasn't that good.  After all the reviews I really wish I could have liked the food better especially since it's family owned which are usually pretty good.  Maybe it's what I got.  Worth another try.  Just not the salsa or chips.
