I found Pasqual's to be...average in nearly every way. Not bad, not excellent, just somewhere in the middle. 

Food was OK, portions were big but the flavor was missing something. I had a burrito with the bean mash and it reminded me of the frozen mushy stuff in the frozen microwave burritos. Chips were good though, did enjoy those before the meal and my margarita was nicely made.

The atmosphere doesn't factor into my review because I was seated next to a couple children who sounded like a cow trying to chew through a concrete block and being noisy little buttheads. I hate being sat next to children but if I choose to go to a restaurant that's kid-friendly there's really no choice but to deal with it (and I know full good and well the staff are expressly forbidden from saying something to obnoxious kids or their equally obnoxious parents.) One of these obnoxious uncontrolled children ran into a server with a full tray of food and was knocked over...I'll admit that made me happy.

I wouldn't say no to a return trip here if somebody suggested it, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it either. The food is OK, drinks are good, but it doesn't really stick out in my mind as a place to frequent.
