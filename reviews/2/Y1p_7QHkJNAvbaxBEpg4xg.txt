Super hungry after a long day and found this spot on Yelp, lots of reviews and a great rating so we went for it. Oh no, we got the bummer server! He was absolutely not interested in any kind of conversating. Very fast at everything he did, but a blank stare otherwise while he waited for us to place an order. We got a 1/2 carafe of margaritas which he dropped at the table with a shot of something next to it. "What is that?" we wondered...turned out to be the do-it-yourself Grand Marnier float after we asked his next trip around. The food was OK. Shared a chimichanga (which was not served with the caramelized onions or sour cream mentioned on the menu) as well as the garden enchiladas (flavorless, carrot-full and boo.) We chowed everything down quickly and hungrily but what a disappointment as we were hoping to stumble across something memorable and fun. I guess part of the excitement of being new to the area is taking a number of shots in the dark until you find something good. Cheers to the Yelp check-in free guacamole but we were too busy getting through our meal to discuss ever returning.
