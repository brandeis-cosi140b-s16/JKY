I love the taste and quality of the food at Rubios. However, this location my husband and I have been to 4 times and EVERY VISIT they have MESSED up the order!  The good thing is they are apologetic and remake it, but this last time they messed it up even after taking it back.  

The receipt will say the right thing, but the person actually making the food will do different.  1. Did flour instead of corn tortillas 2. Putting on sauces that we asked for not to be on the food 3. Chicken instead of steak. 

The food is good, and they were nice, and sorry for their mistakes, but the time & wait is not worth it. We will not return to this location, but will go to other locations.
