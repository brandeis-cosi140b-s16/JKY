I was very excited about visiting Silvi's after reading some good reviews.  I love Mexican food and am always trying to experience new places that have positive buzz.  

I have to say I was disappointed by Silvi's. I admit that they are known for the tacos, and maybe I should have ordered them, but I found the food a bit bland and not special. The chips and salsa were good, although not complimentary, and the chips are nice and fluffy. I tried the pork with salsa verde and the beef with red sauce.  Both meats were well-cooked and tender, but the sauces were lacking spice or tang. The pinto beans (not refried) had a nice smoky taste, but when you expect the meats to stand out, it's not that exciting. 

We did, however, try the flan, which was nicely presented and very delicious.  I'm not sure if they made it in store as the waitress made a comment about "I saw it the other day", but I could be mistaken. 

The service was friendly and the prices were reasonable.  I doubt they'll get a liquor license anytime soon, so you have to bring your own bottle.
