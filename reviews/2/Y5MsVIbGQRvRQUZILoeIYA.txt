The most tasteless mexican food I've ever had. 

I gave the 2 stars because the service was great considering we went as a large party. Everything came out in a timely fashion and correctly. Our server was also really nice.

But the food is awful. Just terrible. Kind of defeats the purpose of it being a restaurant... Just sayin'.
