Inconsistent.  I've been to Verde 3 times now.  The first time was perfect and delicious- I had the chicken tacos (not the best Ive ever had, and 2 tacos for 16 dollars is pretty steep) and my partner the carne asada (which he adored).  For our second visit, we got brunch.  I was totally unimpressed with their brunch menu, and ended up with a breakfast taco of some sort, and the second i picked it up, the tortilla just crumbled, spilling contents everywhere.  Well, ok, I can still eat it right?  No, the tortilla tasted super stale, and the egg/meat filling was flavorless.

Ok, I live really close to Verde, so I want it to be awesome.  Badly.  So I went a third time, this time for dinner.  I think to myself, maybe brunch just isn't their thing.  Dinner was great the first time!  Dinner the second time, I ordered fish tacos, was no bueno.  I experienced the same issue with the tortillas.  I understand that corn tortillas can be difficult to deal with, crumbly if not properly handled, but seriously?  Can you not make a taco that holds together?  Can you not make a fresh, flavorful tortilla?  And the fish was NOT fresh.  It was mahi mahi, and it tasted extremely "fishy", like fish that has passed it's prime.  I don't recall what he ordered, but my partner was also disappointed with his food.
