I feel like a wet blanket giving this place 2 stars, I know its popular, but its definitely not for our family.

The hubbie and I tried Guedo's YEARS ago (try over 10).  He didn't care for it...no chips n salsa to go w/ the meal?  No sides?

With him out of town, I figured it was a chance for me and the kids to try Guedo's since I didn't have any real issue with it when visiting it w/ the hubbie.

It was annoying that they do not take debit or credit cards...only cash.  Which I found out after they had rung up our ticket.  Fortunately they had an ATM machine in the place, so I was able to get cash along with a $2 fee.

The kids did not care for Guedo's.  Similar reasons to their dad...no chips and salsa, even if you pay extra for it at places like Rubio's?  My daughter didn't think her chicken Guedo burro was that good and my son wanted to get a refill on his drink, which he figured was not allowed, so he didn't ask.  For similar pricing, the son looks more favorably on Filiberto's where the burros are huge.  I did like my shrimp burro.

The indoor seating is cramped.  Tables are small; there really was only 1 table that could sit 4 in the space that was open.  I think there is additional indoor dining that may have been closed off, not sure, but it was too windy for me to eat outside.  No way I would eat outside too when the triple digits start hit.

So if you want a simple burrito, taco or torta w/ no sides and just a beer, I would re-visit Guedo's; however, to do so I would have to go alone or w/ someone that is not a family member.
