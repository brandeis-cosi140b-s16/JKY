This is my second time dining at the Mission. My first experience was quite positive and I would have rated this restaurant as five stars. Unfortunately, on my second trip it was quite a different case. My Bloody Mary was drowned in hot sauce, the chips were over salted, and my food was mediocre at best. 

All in all, my experiences here have been a mixed bag.
