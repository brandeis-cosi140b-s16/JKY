Americas Taco Shop is a little nieghborhood hangout. I ordered two carne asada tocos, chips and salsa (yes, you have to buy chips and salsa!), and a Jamaica drink. I got the last chips in the bag!, two tacos with the left over carne asada from the day before, and a Jamaica drink that was way to strong. This must have been a bad day for America, as it was a bad meal for me!
