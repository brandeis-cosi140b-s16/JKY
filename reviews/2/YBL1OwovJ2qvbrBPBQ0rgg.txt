Food is okay, but when you order five meals to go you expect that salsa would be considered complementary,  however it's not and when you ask for it they give you this tiny little container that holds a teaspoon or two, and if you ask for a bigger container they say no you need to purchase it.  Sometimes it's the small stuff that sets you apart from the rest and in this case the food is not much different than the rest and the service is all together less than good...
