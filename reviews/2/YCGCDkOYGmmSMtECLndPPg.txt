The only thing this place has going for it is the decor. We had to ask for chips and salsa---a no brainer at a Mexican restaurant. I ordered the fajitas -- another no brainer. No guac, no sour cream, barely any rice or beans. The service was OK. I wouldn't recommend it. Go to Fajitas for fajitas, or Teepee for old-school Mexican fare.
