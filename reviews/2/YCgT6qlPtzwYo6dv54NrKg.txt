Not as good as when they finished remodeling. We loved it back in January/February and went there several times.  Beautiful d√©cor.

Dined there Saturday night and ordered the Mexican pizza and chicken burrito. These are the same items we ordered several times before.

We were very disappointed with this visit.   The chicken burrito hardly had any chicken in it and the Mexican pizza was overcooked.   Burrito was not acceptable but were in a hurry so didn't send it back.

Doubt we will be back to this restaurant.  No excuse for scant amount of meat in burritos.

There are other better choices in the area.
