This place has awful communication and service. I have ordered from them twice now through doordash.com and once in the actual restaurant. Both of the times I ordered from doordash.com, I received something completely different than what I ordered. The first time, the manager I spoke with was very apologetic and immediately refunded my credit card. The second time it happened, today, the manager on staff was rude, unaware of their partnership with doordash and completely unwilling to refund my money or help me in anyway, completely unprofessional.

The one time I went to the actual restaurant to order take out I waited for 40 minutes. Each time I inquired about my order I was told it would only be 5-10 minutes. The person at the take-out counter was completely overwhelmed and clearly didn't know what was happening with the orders. I was told that someone made a huge order so mine got "bumped". 

The only reason I didn't give a single star is because the food was actually tasty, which was why I gave it so many attempts. I will not order from this place again.
