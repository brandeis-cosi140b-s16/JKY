Bad customer service. They got my order wrong then they started talking about me in Spanish not realizing that I speak Spanish. $7 burrito was the size of a taco bell burrito. I've lived in El Mirage for the past 14 years and have been coming to this spot and the one on thunderbird for years. This was definitely the last time.
