We went to this Chipotle location about a week after it opened. I hope that they have fixed things since then. When we went there were approximately 3 times as many employees working behind the counter as there were patrons in the restaurant. There were three patrons, about 8 employees. Maybe bc it was new they didn't know how busy it would be but it was annoying to literally have half a dozen people have their hands on our food. 

I liked:
-The spicy salsa. Usually when places say spicy they don't mean it. It took me a week to eat this little cup of salsa with chips because it was so hot I couldn't eat more than three chips at a time. 

I disliked:
-Disproportionate number of employees
-Dirty bathroom. For only being open a week it looked like it hadn't been cleaned since then. There was so much hair in the women's restroom it looked like someone got a haircut in there. Gross.
