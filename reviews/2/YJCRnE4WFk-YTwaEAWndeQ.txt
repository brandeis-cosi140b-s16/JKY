Went here for dinner with a bachelorette party. The service was so slow, took them over 20 mins to finally take our order and that's because we got up and found a waiter go take our order. Everyone agrees the food was alright. I got a chicken salad and it was gross. How do you mess up a salad? Chicken was undercooked, and the dressing had absolutely no flavor it just made the lettuce soggy. They were nice enough to take it off the bill. Won't be coming back here.
