New to town my boyfriend and myself went due to the raving reviews. HonestLY we were pretty disappointed. I used to work in a Mexican restaurant that was rating the best by the state and I didn't recognize half the food. Also I though it was strange my dish came with  coleslaw....and I'm pretty sure it was spoiled. The food was mediocre , but not excellent. My boyfriend insisted the chips tasted like sweat. BUT the reason I WONT go back is their margaritas. You get the choice of size and flavor, that's it . I figured I start off with a basic strawberry and I had 2 by the end of the meal. They were not worth it. 4 margs came to $34!! I was baffled. PASS
