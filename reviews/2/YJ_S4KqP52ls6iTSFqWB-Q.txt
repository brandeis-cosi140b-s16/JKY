I judge these Mexican dive places on what I call the "Shit Factor". If I get sick to my stomach, no matter how tasty it was-I am never gonna go back. That being said, I did like the salsa-not the green or red that is on the salsa bar, but the one you get when you order the chips or a taco salad. I had the pork chile verde. It was seasoned SO STRONGLY of cloves and oregano, that I couldn't stand to eat it. I did finish everything on my plate except the meat, which it what I suspect made me sick. The usual suspect for me is lettuce at Mexi-dives. My plate came with quite a bit and went well with the chips and salsa. However, I think they left the pork to stew too long at too low a temp. Tape worms anyone? The owner was super nice and even shut the door to the bar when some guy was being a real asshole. (We had kids with us) 

Remember my Mexi-dive criteria? Let's just say I decided not go back rather quickly and violently. 

Eve N, what are you thinking? That bar is disgusting! I used their bathroom and I am not kidding about this: there was a hooker quietly servicing a male client just out the back door. i know what I heard! Plus the place smelled like a mixture of urine, grease, and really nasty cigarette smoke.
