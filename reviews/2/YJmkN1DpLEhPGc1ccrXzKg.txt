After hearing and reading great things, I was very excited to check out Don Pedro's. The outside is a little run down, but surprising inside it has  a great Mexican feel. Upon arriving I was seated and unlike most Mexican restaurants, who bring chips and salsa immediately, I waited over ten minutes for the chips to arrive & place my drink order. I also chose to order the cheese dip w/ jalapeños! The chips were was cold & stale, blah. I asked for a fresh batch when the cheese dip arrived and the 2nd batch were the exact same. Unfortunately the cheese dip had no flavor, was cold, and the jalapeños were obsolete. On to the meal...I chose a chicken burrito & ground beef taco. Both had NO flavor. Everything was so bland I added salt to everything. The service was just as disappointing, as I had to ask for a refill b/c I could not find my waiter, even though there seemed to be about 10 employees just standing around. Overall, there are too many other great Mexican restaurants. So disappointed, as I had hoped to really enjoy it.
