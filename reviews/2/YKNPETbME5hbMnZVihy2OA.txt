Restaurant on the outside of security. Ordered 1 quesadilla at 11:08 and got it at 11:16 as the only person in line.... Ugh.

The packed the quesadilla full of shredded lettuce ??! What? The yellow salsa that came with was too sour and didn't pack any heat.

It needed a creamy queso component and the chicken lettuce mixture itself didn't really have any flavor.

They were also completely out of bottled water.
