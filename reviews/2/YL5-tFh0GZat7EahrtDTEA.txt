Stopped in today for the first time while the wife and I attended Sonoran Festival of Art. We just wanted a cocktail and a appetizer to see how good the place was. We ordered a beer, a margarita and a order of Guacamole served with pico de gallo and corn chips. The beer was $5.00 the margarita was the smallest my wife has ever seen for $6.00 and the Guacamole had no flavor and was bland. The pico de gallo was pulverized in a blender and looked like tomato sauce but at least it had flavor. The service was marginal. didn't remember to come back to the table with a item or ask if we needed another drink. But if you get a chance to go to the Art Festival make sure you go! That was great.
