First time to an America's Taco. I wasn't impressed.   I will say the Horchata was delicious.
The service was okay, the cashier was knowledgeable but they were out of Pastor so I got two Carne Asada tacos in the trio.  

I was told the Carne Asada is usually really good, but it was a little dry and over cooked.  Maybe it was just this location.  I might try another location because I love Tacos!
