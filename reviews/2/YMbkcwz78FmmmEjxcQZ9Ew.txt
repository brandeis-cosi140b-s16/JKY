This place makes me crazy, I'm not sure why I keep going back.

The food is so-so, I got a taco supreme the other day and my sour cream was on the OUTSIDE of my taco. As in, between the shell and the wrapper. Very helpful. 

Plus, they are the slowest place ever. I timed my last visit - from the time printed on my receipt until I got my food was 12 minutes. Seriously? This is fast food people. And it's not complicated. The drive through moves way faster - I'm tempted to go through that and just eat in my car in the parking lot.
