Nice outdoor ambience and good margaritas which are unnecessarily expensive. Do not waste your time eating food here unless you like Applebee's quality food at Ritz Carlton pricing. Their nachos don't have real cheese...it's the liquid version on top of grocery store bagged chips. Too many other good restaurants to go to in Scottsdale for Mexican food...give this place a pass.
