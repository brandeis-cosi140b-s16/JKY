Whoa.  Went to Los Sombreros on a Friday night at 5 and we were the only people at the bar.  Only one table in the restaurant had guests.  The bartender made very little effort to welcome us.  We were never offered chips and salsa or water.  We really wanted to like this place because it is close to home, but we left before ordering food.  Guess we will have to find a time when it has a few more customers so we can get a better atmosphere to try the food.
