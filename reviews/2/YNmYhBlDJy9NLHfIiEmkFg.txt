This is not really Mexican Food, but a menu that puts together items with a south of the border flair.  While the chips and salsa are good and served in a unique way, this may be the highlight of the night.  The food is expensive, and really not that great.  The margaritas are way too sweet, and the number of tequilas you can order is very limited for a place that serves Mexican Food.  The service is good and the decor is nice, and the outside patio area is great, but none of this matters when the food is lousy.  Been there several times, won't be going back.
