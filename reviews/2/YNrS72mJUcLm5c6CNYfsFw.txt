I didn't realize there were two locations. I had loved my visit to the one of Central Ave, so I expected the same when we went here a few weeks ago before a Suns Game. Unfortunately, the service was slow, the very expensive margaritas were made from a big slushy machine and our orders got mixed up with the wrong sauces. 
I used to say Los Dos was one of my fave mexican restaurants in town. I should amend that to say Los Dos on Central is one of my fave mexican restaurants. And, since its not that close to my home, I'll just keep going to Valle Luna on Bell...where the service and food is great. Maybe not as hot, but much better quality.
