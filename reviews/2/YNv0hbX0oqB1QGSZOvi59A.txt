I have to say the drinks here are very good, service is great but the food was fair. I got a Torta but the meat was very chewy and didn't put much meat in my Torta. It had a lot of cueros. It's very expensive here just for 2 Michelada it was total of $18 it was one of the best I've had but other than that, I couldn't enjoy my food.
