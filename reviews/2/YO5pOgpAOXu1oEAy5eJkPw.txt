I just can't bring myself to rave about Rubios.  I know a lot of my classmates love this place, but for the life of me, I can't understand why.  It's better than Del Taco, but that's not saying much.  The food is simply entirely unremarkable.  Almost every time I've been here, the chips and beans they toss on to almost every plate have that stale 'left under a lamp too long' crunch to them.

Now, I'll offer one caveat: I've not tried their seafood tacos, and I hear they're quite good.  I'm willing to give them a try.  So at some point, I'll give this an update.
