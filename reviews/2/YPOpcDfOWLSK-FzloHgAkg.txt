Step your lunch game up Mercadito. Having lunch menus out front when you're serving brunch and I came in for the skirt steak I can't even get. What too lazy to change things each shift but you pull summerlin kind of money. Ridiculous. Service, terrible. Broken glass my nephew almost cut his finger on, cocktails full of floating stuff in each glass and then you still charge me for it when I let you know. Whomever is running this place should care, because it doesn't appear like they do.
