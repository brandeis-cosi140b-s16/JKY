I'd give this place 2.5 stars.  It was fine, could be worse.

A couple observations:

1. The interior was a little dirty, none of the tables were wiped down.
2. They were a little understaffed, I waited for a little before my order was taken cause there was only one cook and one cashier for both dining room and drive thru.

I'll be honest, I ate most of a chorizo burrito about 20 minutes before this review and I feel like shit.  I don't know if it was something in the food, it tasted good and didn't seem abnormal in any way.  It was fast and cheap.  waiting to see if I get sick before I decide if I'll go back haha.
