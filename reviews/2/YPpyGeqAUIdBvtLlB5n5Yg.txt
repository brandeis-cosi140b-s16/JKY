I went to this location on a Friday night and the following Monday night, both times about 30 minutes prior to their closing. The first time I ordered a burrito with a side of guacamole, and the girl taking payment gave me the bag without the guacamole (which I had ordered specifically from her). When she requested it for the second time from the line person, despite his concerted attempts at scraping the container, there was not enough. He checked for more in the back, but there was none. Since the container was only 3/4 full, and the guac comes at a premium price, I voiced my displeasure. The charge was refunded to me. Okay, mistakes happen.
When I went back the following Monday, again I ordered and paid for the guacamole, and the same girl gave me my bag with no guacamole. When I pointed this out, she inquired, "isn't it in there?" No, it was not in there. She handed me the guac without apologizing, and I proceeded not to thank her.
Prior to my checking out, the woman in front of me had to wait several minutes to do so, as team members demanded, "CASH!" at least four times. Finally the same woman who messed up my order got to the counter to check her out.
This criticism would appear to target a lone, lacking employee, but her incompetence/lack of attention to detail appears to be chronic and is a detriment to the experience as a whole. It should be addressed.
