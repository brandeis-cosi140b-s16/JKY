I just missed breakfast but I wasn't overly disappointed. 

I was disappointed, however, when my burrito arrived feigning lukewarmness. 

The waiter was very friendly without being annoying. The decor was nice and there are a few spots with electric for your laptop. 

The food is nothing to crave but it's edible and in an interesting locale. It works.. but just barely.
