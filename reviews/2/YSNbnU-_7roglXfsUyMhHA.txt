Was visiting for spring training from orange county where we have a number of mom-and-pop Mexican joints. Although this place was fairly crowded for a Sunday morning and was highly recommended, my breakfast was very mediocre. At best. First, took forever to get anyone's attention so I eventually went to the register and got my own menu. Then, took another 15 minutes to get chips, salsa and a drink. Finally it took another another 30 minutes to get served the worst version of huevos rancheros I've ever had. Eggs were undercooked and the sauce was thin and tasteless. I would have added the  house salsa (which was actually not bad) to jack it up, but I could not get the waitresses attention to get more as I was only given about three or 4 tablespoons to begin with. Washer down, I also ordered a beer with tomato juice. Maybe this is an acquired taste, but after two sips I wasn't able to choke down anymore. I don't know if this was supposed to be tomato juice but to me it tasted like beer mixed with catchup. Overall just a bad experience.
