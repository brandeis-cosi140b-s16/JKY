The other guy's review is a little overly dramatic. This place isn't great, but it's solidly mediocre vs straight up bad. Carne asada is shredded beef not steak. Their al pastor was kind of bland.

We only stopped here because I got furniture from heritage distribution and its in the same building. Would I go back? No, but at least it was clean and fast.
