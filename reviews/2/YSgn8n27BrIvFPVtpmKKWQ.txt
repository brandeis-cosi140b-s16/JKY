2015 update: they're closed and now the next budget Mexican food had moved into the old converted pawn shop. The new place is called "The Steamed Tamale " which I haven't tried yet but several of my coworkers have and no one has bothered to say to me 'oh it's SOOOO good, you have to try it!' So I'm guessing it's probably another cheapo Mexican place not worth your time. As the previous owners found out,  you gotta sell flavorful food at a better price or you aren't going to be able to compete in downtown.  So, I guess in a way it is about big parking lots, ambiance,  and decorations isn't it? Because if the best you can do is charge restaurant prices for pawn shop food, then you probably ain't gonna make it, right? Right.
