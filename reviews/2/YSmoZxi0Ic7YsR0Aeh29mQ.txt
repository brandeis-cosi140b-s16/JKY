Was excited to try a new restaurant, especially since I saw that they had a happy hour . It said on the menu appetizers are $5. When we got there at 5:50pm we were only allowed to sit outside Due to 95% of the inside being held for a 645 reservation . So for an hour our group of 6 got attacked by mosquitoes. Waiter comes and We told him which appetizers we wanted ; told him we were excited about $5 , he's said yah it's a great deal. Appetizers can fill you up . Had to ask for waters twice .Speed to bill time , we noticed the bill was ran for $10 more then was expected . We asked for the original receipt , in which the waiter said he would go find it in the garbage . We looked at the receipt that he put on the table and saw the appetizers were full price . We inquired with the server and he said , oh it's only for the corn and cheese crisp ;(which mind you are $5 all the time ) he apologized and walked away. No manager , no offering to fix it , just called it a night .
