First time here and probably last (unless a friend insists). I got the shrimp fajita taco salad. The shell was stale and not even warm. So I ate the salad with the chips. Way too much guacamole (which I love) and sour cream. Queso came with it which was delicious! But it's not difficult to melt cheese. Service was mediocre. Like previous posts, my drink was never refilled and when my waiter never came by with my bill, the manager took my credit card and handled it.
