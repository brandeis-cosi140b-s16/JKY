Wanting to eat quickly and get back to losing my money at Red Rock, I hit the food court running and settled on Rubio's.  I've never been blown away by their food at the few store locations I tried, but at least at the other ones you can use discounts or promos.  Not here.  I get ticked off that, just because they're in a casino, these franchise operators have a holier-than-thou attitude and exempt their facilities from letting the customer save a buck or two.  I didn't have one, but it still pisses me off.  On the upside, they do have a sign at the register telling you in advance.

The cashier was very friendly.  She asked my name for the food delivery, and when I checked, I was amazed that she spelled it right.  Almost nobody does that (yeah, yeah, I before E, except after C.  Unless your name is Sheila).  For that reason alone, my 1 1/2 stars was bumped to 2.

I had a chicken taco platter - 2 soft tacos with a lot of lettuce and a decent amount of chicken, a little cup of watery and too salty pinto beans, and surprisingly unsalted tortilla chips. It was okay - not terrible, but not great either.  It must have given me a lot of energy, though, because I walked out of Red Rock $25 richer, and that almost never happens!
