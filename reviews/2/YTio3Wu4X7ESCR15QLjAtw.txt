I just moved into town from CA and was eager to find my favorite neighborhood taco shop. There are several within walking distance. Lulu's is my first attempt. This ain't it.  I got a mix carne assada burrito with a side of rice & beans. The burrito was almost flat...almost nothing inside. The beans  in the to go carton were half filled. I'm still hungry and I got the friggin special! What little meat I did get tasted good enough but the portions were scarce. Very skimpy for the price. And I was the only one there so it wasn't because they were busy.... Now I know why no one else was there. I won't be going back
