I am a huge Chipotle fan. I would rather have a regular chicken burrito from there than any other burrito from the competitors and I don't even mind that you have to pay extra for things like guac and chips. In college I even drove the 40 minutes to the nearest Chipotle when I was homesick. 

This location, however, needs to focus on their supply chain management to achieve the quality of other Chipotle chain restaurants. It isn't the quality of the food, it is the quantity. As other yelpers have noted this location does run out of ingredients quite frequently, which is annoying for those like me who have a go to order. The assembly line needs attention as well, since I have gotten the soggiest burritos I have ever seen from this location. 

To be fair, the staff has always been friendly and I have had many visits without incident. While the issues they have not worked out are annoying, it is the closest location to both my home and office so I will return.
