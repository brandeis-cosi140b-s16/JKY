The last two times I've been to this place the food was absolute garbage.  Onions are always rancid and the tomatoes were green.  At one point they were out of coke and salsa.  Had to get my $ back and leave.  Maybe one of these days they'll get their chit together and put out a good product.  Same experiences at the Sahara/Decatur one.  The only one that had been consistent was Charleston and Ft. Apache.
