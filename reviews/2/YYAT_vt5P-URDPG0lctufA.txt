I have to start off by saying this restaurant is visually very appealing, but when the food arrives it's like finding out Santa is not real- every time. Seriously, the salsa was so watered down I bet a baby could drink it out of a bottle and not flinch. Super Mex, I want to love you. Your prices are really reasonable, the staff friendly, but it all comes down to the undesirable food. Here's the scoop on what I've tried:
Chicken Chimichanga-  Now the meat is moist and flavorful, but the burro doesn't seem crispy enough and the toppings are bland. Even trying to put everything on my plate on my fork at once cannot save this dish.
Guacomole- I had everyone at the table try this and we agree this cannot be fresh. It tastes just as watered down as the salsa!
Steak Fajitas- Chewy meat chunks, but good veggies
Cheese Enchilada- This was the only selection I mildy enjoyed. Snaps for that Super Mex
Overall, what is a Mexican restaurant without a decent salsa and guacamole? Simply not a fan, amigo.
