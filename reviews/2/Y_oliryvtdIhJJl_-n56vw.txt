The problem I encountered at midnight on this idle Monday night was the hunger for some Mexican food. In Colorado I have had Albertaco's, and I have had Filiberto's here in AZ, and unfortunately Poliberto's seems to be riding their coattails. The rolled tacos tasted burnt, or like the fryer oil was bad. The mixed burrito was hot, but lifeless, no flavor. They need to add salt or something. All in All, not terrible, but not for me. The salsa bar was cool, but I really wanted there to be a drive-thru. I would say, drive a little further, and get Filiberto's.
