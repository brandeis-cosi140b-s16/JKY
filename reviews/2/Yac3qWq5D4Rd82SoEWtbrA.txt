I've got mixed feeling about this restaurant---I was taken there this past Sunday evening as a birthday treat by my son and husband. Got there around 6:00pm and although the place had empty tables we had to wait to be seated. My son has eaten here before and raves over the food so we thought an excellent choice for dinner. Now, the first reviewer on Yelp really raves over the service and warm staff, but I found neither to be true. They barely acknowledged us ---the chips were terribly stale and salsa bland. 
   Now , we placed our orders and we waited 45 minutes for the food to come---I had asked our server if something was wrong as it was 7:00pm and still no food. She said one of their cooks was not there that night and they were a bit behind. No dear, you were way behind ---when the food came out all the rice and bean sides were stone cold but the entrees were at least hot. We informed her of this and they brought out all  new (and hot) rice and bean. At no time did the server ask to refill my husband's ice tea ---that is just poor service. I do think the food is very good and high quality but the service and professionalism is sorely lacking. There have been at least four different restaurants located at this site--maybe some of you remember Glorious Cuisine from the late 80's , then Rao's and another Mexican place which did not make it. I would at least try the place one more time just to see if the service gets any better because the food is well prepared and good---just indifferent on the service.
