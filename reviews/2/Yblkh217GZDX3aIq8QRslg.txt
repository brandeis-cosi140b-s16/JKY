Unbelievably overrated. This place is way over priced.  $17 for a left over recooked carne asada burrito plate. Located in not so desirable neighborhood. Stay clear!!! The quality of food is sub par.   They are trying to get hotel prices in a ghetto neighborhood. I'm sorry...but I will never return.  They charge $4.25 for microwave tamales.... :(
