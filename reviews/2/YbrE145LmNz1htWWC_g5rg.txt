Ive been going to americas for a while now and the last few visits there have lead me to change my rating of them. I really want to like coming here, their happy hour specials are great and they have a really good breakfast burrito. However, the counter service the last few times ive been in has been seriously dissapointing. Actually, they've been downright rude. There is no "hello, how are you?"when you arrive. Nothing. In fact, on our last visit,my husband and i were completely ignored while the girl behind the counter finished her conversation with one of the kitchen guys. i find this unacceptable. I refuse to frequent establishment  that obviously does not want me there. Well dont worry, i wont be returning.
