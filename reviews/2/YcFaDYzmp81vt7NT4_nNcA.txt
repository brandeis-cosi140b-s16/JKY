I love the food at this restaurant. I usually go to the one on Lindsay rd.  However,  today I had the worse experience ever with them. I called in an order before 11 am, they told me it would be ready in 15 mins. I got there and waited until 11:25 and still had no breakfast burrito. I asked them about it, they said it was on the way out in a minute. I waited another 5 mins. Needless to say, I left at 11:30 with no food and a refund, since they haven't even started cooking it yet. Not sure I will come back to this location again. The only reason they are getting 2 stars is because the woman up front who I believe is the manager,  was very nice apologized and refunded me my money and provided me a $5 gift card for my time.
