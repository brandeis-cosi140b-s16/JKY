I'm stuck between TWO and THREE stars. After all it is Taco Bell. 

You can usually count on them for cheap and fast food. The cheap part is always standard. But, the fast part for this location has struggled for a while. I mainly visit this location for weekday work time lunch breaks (12 or 1 pm.)

Maybe I should give them some slack because most places are slammed around this same time, but I feel they could step it up a bit and decrease the wait time a little.

Although, I do really have zero complaints on the food. After all it is Taco Bell.
