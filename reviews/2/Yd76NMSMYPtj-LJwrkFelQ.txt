To start, what Mexican restaurant charges for the first round of chips and salsa?  And what salsa is so garlicky that it will be coming out of my pores for the next few days?  I had the chicken enchilada and it was very dry along with very dry  beans and very dry rice - at least it was consistent.  Nothing redeeming about the food. Should have gone one more block to Viva Mercado.
