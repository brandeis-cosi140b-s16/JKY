The food at Manuel's remains very good, however, the service is deteriorating. The most recent time I visited the service was quick, and the person refilling water, chips, and salsa was very attentive. The manager brought out the food. I noticed that my taco had the wrong meat in.It. As I was waiting for someone to come back to the table with the rest of the table's food, the waitress came back and said the manager "brought out the wrong order because yours wasn't done yet." I hope manuel's can get their act together because my family is ready not to come back. I visit from out of state and like the food.
