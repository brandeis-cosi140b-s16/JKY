Do yourself a favor and avoid this place. The chips are fried in peanut oil, which leaves a horrible aftertaste. The Machaca chimichanga I had was just shredded beef with canned green chilis added and a quart of sour cream on top. My wife had the baja chicken chimi, it came with a whole brick of very salty cream cheese on top. I feel like I want to throw up just thinking about it. Very disappointed. Next time we'll go across the street to Don Lencho's!
