Not impressed. I think this will be good for a teen age hangout like filabertos. But I would rather drive to some burros. The place looked close from outside. The open light was off and it had a hand written note on door.  The cashier was chilling while the place was empty but a table was a full mess. I just wanted and asked for a bean and cheese burro and didn't pay attention to total but ended up with a full meal with beans and rice. No big deal though. The burro was fine but was buried in beans. Couldn't pick it up. The place is small and a little dirt my for a new place. Same owners as the original Mattas in Mesa. Obviously not aware . This place is getting its teeth kicked on yelp . But like any new place in QC it will go good for awhile cause we need options. But this place better get their act together . I might go again out of convenience but certainly not tempting.
