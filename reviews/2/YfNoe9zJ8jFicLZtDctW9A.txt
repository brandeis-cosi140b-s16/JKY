Don't waste your time or money here. Mediocre food. Just hit one of the better fast food spots in the airport. My "beach salad" was majorly disappointing. My friends got the nachos which were decent but not worth $15. I ended up buying a pizza 2 hours elsewhere I was so hungry. One thing positive: tt looks cool inside.
