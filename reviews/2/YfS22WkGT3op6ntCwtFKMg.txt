Are you really crazy for some chicken? Save yourself some time and a couple of bucks by going to a CostCo to buy one of those rotisserie chickens.

What sucks: Customer service, wait time, chicken. 

First, let me tell you about the drive-thru. We probably waited 10-15 minutes to receive our food. I don't know why it takes so long to make a salad, put some chicken in a box, scoop some sides into styrofoam containers, and call it a night. 

Even waiting in line indoors takes a long ass time. Waited around for a guy to figure out what he wanted -- I don't know, guy, they serve grilled chicken. Maybe you might wanna get some of those? The lady taking orders didn't even bother to call anyone to help her; she just allowed the line to grow longer by the minute.

Real efficient procedures taking place here.

How about the food? MEH.The chicken that I had during the both times I came here was dry and not good.
