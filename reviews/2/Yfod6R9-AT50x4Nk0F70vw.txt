I've eaten here a handful of times and have had a mediocre experience or even less than mediocre each time I have visited. I wish this place were more like Smoke in Homestead, or even Edgar's in the Strip (those are two excellent examples on how to make delicious tacos), but it's not even close. The tacos lack flavor and are far too expensive for food that's not nearly as good as I can make at home. I sent the steak tacos back once because they had nearly no flavor. Another time we ordered the guacamole and it was made with unripe avocados. I gave it one final chance after they sent out an email saying they had retooled their menu, but the tacos were still incredibly disappointing. It's frustrating given it's one block from my house. I'd go here at least once a week if the food were better.
