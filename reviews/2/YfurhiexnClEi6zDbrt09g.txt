Hola amigos.  Rey Azteca is your typical Mexican restaurant... the music, the decor, the ambiance... I actually like the II location up the street better... its newer and definitely cleaner.

As to the food, Yelp's default wording "Meh, I've had better" is the perfect description.  The service is pretty good though.
