Small plastic fork. Let's start there. I had the fish tacos and they were edible only because I was starving. Poor excuse for salsa bar. Service was ok served with a smile at least but all in all food was horrid. At least it is hard to mess up Horchata :) 

Rivas or Filly B's next time I need a quick Mexican dive fix for lunch or very early AM snack.
