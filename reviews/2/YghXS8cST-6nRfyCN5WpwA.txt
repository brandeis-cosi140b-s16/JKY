Can someone explain to me how Chipotle's stock has gone up when they serve such bland Mexican?  It's almost like the Ikea/white guy version of Mexican.  Ick, ick, ick.
I love Baja Fresh soooo much more where the food is not only hot--mine being cold from here (not the meat, but the beans and rice were cold)--but so much tastier.
Tried the chicken meat which was ok, but the steak...OMG...it's like someone poured hot sauce all over the steak and said proudly to themselves, "OK..now it's Mexican."  Not.  
Never again.  I really hate the cold, bland food served here and am just scratching my head how anyone--other than those who have never had great Mexican--could even like it.  What give folks?  I just do not get it at all...and I mean at all.
Back to Baja Fresh for me:  hot food, cooked just for me and good sauces not some Tabasco bottles sitting around.  This Chipolte chain sucks big time....ick.

OK, I tried it again yesterday.  This is my review:  If you love non-spiced, mediocre, fake Tex-Mex Mexican food this is your place.  It's edible I get that, but surely for $7 or so you can get better.  This is Phoenix after all!
I heard a nice looking man in his early 60's talking to his wife and grandkids next to my table about how wonderful the food is "as usual."  Goes to show you that one man's trash is another man's treasure.  I think the food is about so bland as it comes myself.  But, then again, maybe his wife's cooking sucks--and from her size 4 size--it probably does, so Chipotle is wonderful compared to her cooking?  Only thing I could think of that would make an intelligent man rave about this bland mattress stuffing crap they try to pass off as Mexican.

...and their darn stock is still going up.  I guess I just do not get it at all at this place.
