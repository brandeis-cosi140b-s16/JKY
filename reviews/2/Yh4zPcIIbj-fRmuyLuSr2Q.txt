Went to try this after months of driving by. Its right by our house so we thought we would finally give it a try. The food was ok and way overpriced. I paid $10.99 for a chimichanga that was the size of a taco bell bean burrito and the beans werent very good either. I will not be back. Macayo's here I come!
