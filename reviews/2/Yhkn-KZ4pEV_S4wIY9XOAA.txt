I want to be impressed with this place.  I really do.  I will give it one more shot.

I liked the flavor of the green chili, but as with most places there is always too much tortilla and not enough meat or insdies.  Its beans and rice people - fill it up.

The Salsa offerings were okay.  I would have like my tortilla chips when I paid so I could dig in while waiting for my burrito.

I like the decorations, it really fit the type of restaurant.

Burrito Co, if you're reading this - more on the inside will give you less tortilla.  Or you could just rip us off and make the tortillas smaller.
