Meh.  Spoiler alert:  I won't go back.  It wasn't "bad," but it certainly wasn't "good."  

I arrived to find the restaurant half full (at least 10 open tables inside) and was promptly informed by the hostess that we'd have "at least a one-and-a-half to two hour wait" if we wanted to sit inside.  "Lots of reservations!"  Umm yeah, when we left an hour later...tables were still open.   By no means crowded.

Immediate seating outside, ok whatever.  The service was a bit slow but I remained optimistic.  I was a little skeptical of the menu and specials -- wild rice in chile rellenos?  The fish of the day....walleye?  What is this, Minnesota?

We went with the carnitas tamales and fish tacos.

General review of the food:
**Margaritas - VERY good, and strong!  Two thumbs up.
**Chips and salsa - Salsa was WAY too sweet.
**Tamales & Carnitas - Odd.  Covered in BBQ sauce; rather than using masa they appear to have used sweet potato (???) and it ended up dry and WAY too sweet.
**Spanish rice & beans - kind of gross.

All in all, it was edible.  But it won't be on my list next time someone asks "where should we go eat tonight!?"
