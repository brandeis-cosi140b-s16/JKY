I'll be short and quick. This is our second time here the first time food was amazing customer service was ok we were please that we decided to go back with the thought of getting delicious meals, but nop. 
I order nachos I had the craving for them and my wife order a veggie burrito . I'm sorry to say but the nachos were super horrible greasy blunt nothing there , circle k has better nachos for half the price they were gross my wife veggie burrito was also bad just no flavor nothing to be amaze . Very disappointing. Our waiter said that food comes out differently sometimes because depends on the cook who's making the food . No consistency at all in meals. Our waiter could care less. We eat almost nothing of our food just plane gross !! I'm going to have think twice about giving them my business . That's what happens when you try to support local businesses.
