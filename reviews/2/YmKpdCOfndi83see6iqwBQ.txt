The policies of this establishment are very poor.  My colleagues and I agreed to meet here after work, within a 30-minute time frame.  There was no one in the restaurant and they still refused to seat us until "everyone in a party was there."  We were not even sure how many were going to show...it was quite frustrating... 

The chips (which you must pay for) are tasty, but I only give the margaritas 2 limes.
