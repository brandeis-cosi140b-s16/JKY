I wish you would properly train all your employees on how to maintain proper bean consistency as well as teach them how to properly roll a buritto. I have to re-roll my burrito everytime I come here. They're always loose and stuff falls out. Tight is right!! Now get it right please.... oh and don't forget to teach them how to spread the ingredients through the whole burrito. One time my first bite into a burrito was all onions.... your job isn't that hard, if you want $15 and hour you better produce the best burrito I've ever seen.
