The most awesome part of Pasqual's is their salsa -- mild, medium, hot, love it all. I think at one point in history they even called themselves a "salsaria." The salsa makes me want to salsa dance even though I know I can't dance and I'm not even sure what salsa dancing is. That is how good it is, which is precisely why I'm so disappointed in Pasqual's today. With a large plate of nachos, they serve about a tablespoon of salsa in a tiny little cup. This happened last time, too, so we ordered extra salsa, but we got the same tiny little tablespoon cup. The chicken, the beef, the nachos, the tacos here are 3-star stuff, but I truly believe it's the salsa that makes it so. Gimme more!
