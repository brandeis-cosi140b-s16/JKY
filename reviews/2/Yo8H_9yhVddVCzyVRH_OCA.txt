Our service was extremely slow the night that we visited.  We waited, and waited, and waited for our food.  I tried to give them more of my money by trying to order more drinks while we waited, but our server did not jump at the opportunity to run up the check and get a better tip.  So not only did we wait for our food way longer than my patience could handle, we also were left hanging with dry cups for most of the duration of our wait for our food  =(

Once the food came out I was not impressed with the carne asada.  I probably should of just stuck with the tacos.  

I was very disappointed that I wasted my time and money at this place with all of the other options for great food in Vegas.
