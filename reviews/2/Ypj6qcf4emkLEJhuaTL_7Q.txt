Flavorless shredded-beef anything!  Too bad, this is a nice building with a few really cool seating areas.  Unfortunately, they just seem to load up every weekend night with so many people that the food has taken a back seat.   The revenue must be great!   

I'm a big fan of shredded beef mexican food.   At Macayo's I have to change up and hit a carnitas or fajita deal.   They need to put some love back into the flavoring.   

Ask for the 'hot' salsa (sauce) they will not bring it unless you do.   Oh, by the way, it's really not that hot.   

I'll still go there in a pinch if I need to, but giving anymore than 2 stars would be way to generous.    To me, this place is just a local "Mexican-Food-Denny's'.
