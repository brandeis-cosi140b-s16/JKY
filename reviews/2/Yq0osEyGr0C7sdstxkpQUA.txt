Dissapointment... 
That was the feeling I left with. 
I have been wanting to go here for awhile. We finally made it in the other no\ight for a cocktail. the decor is dark and romantic. They have movies in Spanish plaing on a big screen in the middle of the dining room.
The bathroom set up is strange. They are very clean and had really good smelling candles in them. The sinks are in the hall outside the bathroom. It's kinda cool and I'm sure many conversations happen there.
Were the dissapointment happed was at the bar. It took a minute for someone to acknowlede us. 
I ordered a vodka soda. That was not what I got. I ended up with the flatest vodka tonic I have ever had, it was nasty. My guy got a really flat beer.
It took awhile for the bartender to comeback and check on us. He replaced my drink for a vodka soda, but again it had no bubbles at all. 
To add insult to injury there were some drunk typical Tempe turds trying to start a fight with my boyfriend for absolutly no reason. 
Maybe I'm finally too old for Mill...
