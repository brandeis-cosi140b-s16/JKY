I have to admit to being pretty seriously underwhelmed by Barrio Caf√©. It wasn't awful by any means, but it wasn't worth the 45-minute wait my friend and I endured last night for a table. The guacamole was perfectly serviceable, with the addition of pomegranate seeds a very nice touch.  It was probably the best thing we ate. The other appetizer, a queso fundido, was under salted and straightforward. Likewise the Yucatan pork tacos, which I thought were utterly unremarkable. We also ordered chicken enchiladas with a black mole. I enjoyed the sauce, but my friend thought it was too molasses-y. And even so, I thought the sauce a little one-note. All chocolate, not much else. 

Oh, and the tortillas? Not even in the same ballpark as Tortillaria Sinaloa. I'm telling you Baltimore, you don't know how good you've got it.
