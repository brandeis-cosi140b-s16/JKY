There really isn't anything special about this place.  Your run of the mill fillabertos is tastier than this place.  I have been here twice now and am willing to drive the extra 2 miles to the burrito place over on bell rd.  If you have had real mexican food you will be a bit disappointed in the  bland menu and yellow cheese they use.
