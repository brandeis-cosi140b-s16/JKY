I go to this location because it is two minutes from where I live, but I think I'll be going to either the Tempe marketplace or other Scottsdale Road location from now on. The service is always sooo slow here. I get that its a busy place, but watching the employees, I can see they aren't really trying to move things along. Last time I got home to find out that my boyfriends burrito was ice cold. He made me feel the chicken and it was seriously freezing. I had to drive back and the girl stirred the chicken around and measured the temp in front of me. She claimed the sour cream must have cooled his chicken. I think they must have just put a new batch in before I came back. 
Today, they didn't seal my bowl for the to go food, and when I picked it up getting out of my car, the juice from the pinto beans poured all over my lap from the bottom of the bag. 
Also, I understand that they do call ahead/online orders, but they clearly aren't organized about it. When I finally got to the front of the line, the employee asked me to wait as they prepared a web order. I watched two of them take about 5 minutes to make 4 bowls together. And the guy picking up the order had been there since before I got there, so obviously ordering ahead didn't do much for him.
This location continues to disappoint.
