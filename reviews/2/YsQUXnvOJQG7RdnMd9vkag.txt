Our waitress was rude and pushy and the food was absolutely terrible! I will definitely not be back. Watery salsa and overcooked chips to start the meal. We decided to get the table side guacamole and neither of us were impressed. My meal was mostly rice and beans and the chicken inside the burrito was not good. I have almost nothing positive to say about this place besides their decor. Not sure why they're getting 3+ stars because honestly chipotle would've been better and worth the money.
