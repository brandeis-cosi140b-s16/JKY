I have to say, it was mediocre at best. The chips and salsa were good. I usually test a new place with my go to enchiladas, rice and beans. I got one each chicken and cheese enchiladas. They were just ok. Really small helping of beans and the rice was maybe a couple of tablespoons. The decor is really sparse. they could have done a little better in that department. Service was good but the food was a little slow in coming out. 
Will not rush back here. Still on the lookout for really good mexican food in Casa Grande. Red Estillo Mex is pretty bomb.
