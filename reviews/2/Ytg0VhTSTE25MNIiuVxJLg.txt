Had fun at the open Catina area, but that's about all. This was only our second time at El Encanto Dos, but it was not any better. Food is mediocre at best and over priced for Mexican food. Our server had no personality what so ever. It seems that more and more servers are from Boringtown. The service was extremely slow as well. With plenty of Mexican food restaurants to choose from, this one is STILL at the bottom of our list.
