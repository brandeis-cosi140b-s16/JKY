I came here with some girlfriends and we were looking for a great place to kick off our first night in Vegas. 
The waiter was friendly and seemingly great. He brought us chips and salsa before we ordered, asked us if we liked guacamole and recommended it to us. He returned with our drinks and guacamole. Overall the dinner experience was great, until our bill came with a $10 guacamole charge. I was SO irritated. It's not about the $10 so much as it is about the fact that I got tricked in to buying $10 guacamole! Don't act like you're giving us something complimentary and then charge me for it. It was B.S. 
It wasn't just us either, by the time the tables on each side of us got their bills they were mad about the same thing.

Aside from that, the food was okay. I'm picky about beans and these weren't my favorite, but I liked my tacos. The drinks weren't exceptionally strong or great especially for their price. 

But it's Vegas, what do you expect? I for one expect not to get tricked into $10 guac but that's just me.
