Went for dinner for the second time on the one on craig rd , parking is bad bad  and the food was not so hot . Asked for a chile Verdi  burrito and it looked like a enchilada rolled on my plate . Was bad food  I have had better Mexican food at other places . Won't be going back and also pricey they raised their prices on some dishes that are valued at 2 or 3 dollars less .
