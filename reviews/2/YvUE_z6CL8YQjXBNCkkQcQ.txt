This review is not about the food... obviously Chipotle food is always damn good. All of the workers making the food were wearing gloves (A+) but it's left up to the cashier to place the food onto a tray. The cashier digs her unloved money touching thumb INTO my bowl of food. Says "oh shoot", smears the sour cream mess on her shirt/pants and continues to reach for payment like all is gravy. 

It doesn't take a rocket scientist to know money and debit cards are crawling in bacteria. She did not apologize, nor did she offer to have them remake my food. I doubt this why would fly with a health food inspector, but it certainly doesn't fly with me. 

I hope other things like this don't fly under the radar at this location.
