Went here for midweek lunch. The nearby high school had gotten out early so the place was packed with screaming teenagers. We should have left but decided to hang in there. We were 11th in line...

The chicken burrito was just fair; the rice and beans were watery and soft. My wife had a quesadilla whose crust was burned.

This location has outside seating overlooking a large manmade pond with a fountain and ducks. There's an awning to protect you from the heat and summer sun; nice.
