I've worked around the corner from this location for 2 years at have eaten at this location at least a few times a month. 
Customer service is hit & miss. 
Cleanliness is hit & miss, especially the tea. It's MISS MISS! I choose EPL because it's a quick healthy option, and I choose iced tea for the same reason. EPL's mango iced tea is yummy and I look forward to having it with my chicken salad. The last few times I've been in, it's in a nasty stained plastic gallon pitcher. Very unappetizing and I'm sure would not pass with the Health Dept!
El Pollo Loco get it together or you will lose a regular customer!
