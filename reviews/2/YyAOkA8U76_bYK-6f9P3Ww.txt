We tried this place twice.  The first time, they had only been open a few days.  So it was a disaster (super busy night, people waiting even outside, general mayhem).  The food was mediocre at best, so we thought maybe we'd wait a bit before returning to let them "get the kinks out". 

 We waited a year and returned.  The food was once again bland and the service left a lot to be desired.  Also, way overpriced for what you actually get.  I wouldn't even care if it was bland and you had the option of different sauces to liven things up, but that is not the case.  Additionally, they definitely use jarred salsa.  It was not fresh.  Disappointing and will not return.
