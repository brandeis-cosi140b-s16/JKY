it was not bad but not good. I found that it was overpriced and a much more appetizing read than eat. 
For appitizer we got chorizo app which was just a quesidilla with chorizo that was cut in half that cost $8. It was good but not $8 good. 

For dinner I ordered Lamb Shank that was like $15 which had great flavor but I was only served like 5 small super tiny pieces of lamb that where over cooked.

For dessert I ordered a crape which came out cold

I was not impressed with the place or the food. 
Service was great but in my opinion not worth it.
