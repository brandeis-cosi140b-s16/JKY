Came for lunch around 2pm on Friday (yes I know I have weird lunch schedule if I need to leave office). Ordered taco salad. When I was asked what kind of dressing, I should've known to change my order. Taste was blah, too much beans, no salsa. Meat tasted like Taco Bell's taco. Not impressed at all. 1 star for food.  Service was average, 3 stars.
