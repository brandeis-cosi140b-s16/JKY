This is the only Chipotle I've ever had a problem at in 4 states. I'd placed an online order making a special request. I'd spoken to them twice on the phone before getting there only to be told when I arrived that my request wouldn't be fulfilled. To make matters worse, they had a rude girl at the register with a terrible attitude who patronized me and my request. I will definitely not be returning to this location.
