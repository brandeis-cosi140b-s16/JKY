I came here looking for the usual- California Burrito and some Jamaica.  I did not get either.  I went through drive-thru and the person taking my order didnt understand my English, so I had to come to the window to ask about their menu.  I could barely understand her English, so I just opted for some quesadilla.  It was okay and I cant compare it to the usual Mexican food I have at Vaqueros on 19th and Southern.  The food was just okay and I was disappointed mostly because I did not have someone who spoke clear English- customer service was okay otherwise.
