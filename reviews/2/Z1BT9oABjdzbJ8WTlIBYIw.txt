We went here last weekend, and I almost forgot to review it because it was just that underwhelming.  

We were seated by the kitchen, which meant every 5 seconds someone came bursting out of the metal swinging doors running.  I was briefly impressed by the quick pace of the waitstaff even though the constant bursting of the metal doors was annoying.   It made me think "oh wow, these guys are on the ball!"  That wasn't the case for our waiter.  His demeanor, movements, and voice indicated that we had gotten the stoned waiter.  Not the the giggly, silly stoner, more like the "I'm barely conscious" stoner.

I had to repeat my order three times to him to get it right "Mole burrito with mixed vegetables."  At one point he asked someone in our party if they wanted a refill on their soda, the answer was yes.  The refill came at the end of the meal with the check.  As other waiters were practically running back and forth, our server was seen trudging slowly and aimlessly at times.  Maybe he was lost, maybe he was on a journey, maybe he got some bad weed.  

The food itself was underwhelming, that is, when it finally arrived.  The tortilla used for the burrito was pretty soggy, indicating it had been sitting around for a while after it was made.  The mole sauce was insulting.  I make a better, meaner mole at home that puts Casa's to shame.  The appetizer cornbread was the best thing out of all the dishes, but like someone else had mentioned, there wasn't enough butter to go with it.  

The atmosphere is strange.  Big, open, cavernous spaces filled with tables, and a terrible acoustics problem.  Get a bunch of people in there, along with the exploding metal kitchen doors, and I couldn't hear anything my dining companions were saying unless I leaned in, turned my ear toward them, and asked them to repeat themselves.  

Bad service, mediocre food, and terrible atmosphere combined equals a bad time, and no repeat performance.
