The service was adequate the food was not.  Overpriced and lacking flavor.  I had the short rib taco, pork belly taco, and the pastor taco.  None were what I describe as "good" or even approaching noteworthy.  The chips and guacamole were pretty standard, but when you ask $9 for guac it should be something special imo.  

Maybe my standards are high, but this was just a culinary disappointment.
