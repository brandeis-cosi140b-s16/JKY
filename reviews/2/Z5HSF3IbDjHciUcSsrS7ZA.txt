The service was alright. The guy that took my order seemed annoyed that I was there, and also that I couldn't read their tiny printed menu.
The food was really good, really authentic.
I grabbed some silverware and it was still dirty.
Service is everything to me, I wouldn't come back just because I hate feeling like I'm an inconvenience to people working.
