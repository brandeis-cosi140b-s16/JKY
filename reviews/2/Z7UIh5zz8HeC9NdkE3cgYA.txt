Despite the mixed reviews you can read for yourself about Mexi-Casa I think the food is decent. Is it authentic? Not really. Is it the best quality? Eh, not so much. But it IS decent, and I enjoyed my chicken burrito.  

My issue with Mexi-Casa is the amount they charged. My I felt the portion was pretty large and I didn't end up finishing it- but don't think I wasn't charged! I thought the drinks were over priced as well. 

I would come here if I was really hungry and craving a burrito in Dormont, (that happens more than you think!) but otherwise I'd rather drive to a Mad Mex.
