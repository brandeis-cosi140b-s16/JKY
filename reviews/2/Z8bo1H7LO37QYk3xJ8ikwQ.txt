Took Grandma and the family out for lunch here yesterday. Had not been here in a while, but remembered it being a fun place. The restaurant has fantastic decor, but that is about it. We had some tacos - shrimp and fajita, and grandma ordered enchiladas. The fajita taco was pretty good, shrimp tacos were bland, the jalape√±o/shrimp wrapped in bacon app was fantastic, chips and salsa were good too. 

Here is where it went wrong...SERVICE! We waited about 7 minutes before anybody came to our table to get us drinks. Our waiter seemed good at first, but would disappear for long periods of time. We ended up being at the restaurant for well over an hour because of this. However, all of this is tolerable. What caused this to be (initially a one star) review was the fact that grandmas food came out wrong - she received a bland dry crappy tamale. When we finally were able to alert our waiter (8-10 minutes later) he told us, rudely, that we were wrong and she had ordered that. The only thing that saved this from being one star was that the manager came out and apologized for her waiter being rude and took the tamale off the bill.

Worst service I have had in a long time. I will never eat here again.

Food gets 2.5 stars, service zero
