Walking up to this restaurant, it looks pretty neat and authentic. That all ended when we were about to order. The menus were not very professional and alot of the items/prices were written in pen. On top of this, the pictures for their listed menu items did not look appetizing at all and clearly should have steered us away from here.

But stay we did because were hoped it would be the "hidden gem" other yelp reviews described. I got the carne asada nachos and frankly they were the worst nachos Ive had in a long time. The chips were stale and straight from the bag with the rest of the toppings not being fresh and definitely tasting that way. The steak was serviceable, but just barely. 

The only plus about the meal was they do provide a large portion, but in the end I would rather have a slightly smaller size with better ingredients. Will not be returning.
