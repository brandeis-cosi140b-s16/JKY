Salty Senorita in Scottsdale... mexican food, football on flat screens, outdoor seating, margaritas!  Kinda sounds like a little piece of heaven to me?  What's not to like, right?

The horrible service.  

You might have read the other reviews.  You might be asking yourself if it's really all that bad?  The answer is yes it is.  The little girls they hire to wait tables are across the board worthless.   After watching them I started to question whether or not they literally walk out of their way to avoid seated customers.  

It's too bad, because Salty's has all the right stuff... but apparently also has all the wrong people.

If I'm wrong, I'll never know.  After eating there twice and having the same experience, there simply won't be a third time.  Too bad.
