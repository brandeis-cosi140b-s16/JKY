The menu is very limited, but the tortas and tacos we ordered were very good.  Also exceptional were the house bottles of hot sauce brought to the table.  No so exceptional was the fact they were out of churros, out of agua fresca, only had paid bottles for water and said the house made tortillas would be $4.00 instead of the $3.00 menu price becuase they "made them extra large" that day.  We also had to wait for the waitress to complete the texting on her phone to get her attention.  Overall, there is someone running the kitchen making some great food, but the rest of the operation is run so poorly its hard to call it a restaurant.
