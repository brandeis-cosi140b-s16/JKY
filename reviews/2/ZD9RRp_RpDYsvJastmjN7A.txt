I'm not crazy about the Blue Burrito Grill. I like that they have all you can eat chips and salsa. They are serve yourself and the salsa are good. I usually get the vegetarian burrito bowl and for some reason it always ends up watery and not very flavorful. I think Chipotle, Qdoba, and Fiesta Burrito are a lot better.
