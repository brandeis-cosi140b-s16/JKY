Having eaten at Moe's several times before across the east coast, my wife and I were very excited to see a new location opening up in Summerlin. We had very high expectations and sadly those expectations were not met. The portion sizes were smaller than they used to be and the prices were not worth the meal that we received.

Besides the food, the staff for the most part seemed very miserable. Some had very bad attitudes while others had no idea what was going on around them. The restaurant was not very busy at the time, so there is no excuse for being miserable. 

The cleanliness of the restaurant left something to be desired. While there was one employee sweeping the floor, there were tables that we dirty and the garbage was overflowing.

Overall the experience was very disappointed. We may attempt dining there again in a few months once they figure out their way.
