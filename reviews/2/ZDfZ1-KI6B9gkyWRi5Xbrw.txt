I am sorry but this place gives you way too much food and I don't like the vibe of the restaurant. The employee didn't speak English and didn't know what to say to me. I tried my best to make him understand but I totally got the wrong food. I did not care but he was annoyed I wasn't eating it. He gave me a dirty look and I was very annoyed as well. I don't think I will be going back......
