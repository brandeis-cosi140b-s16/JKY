A small little Mexican joint located in a small shopping center, Mr Taco is decent food, but nothing special. I prefer several other small Mexican restaurants to this place, that have better tasting food.

This place is pretty small, but I've never seen it packed. It received some publicity in the Charlotte Observer a while back as a Mexican "find," so that's the reason I checked it out. The Mexican dishes are your typical ones, but I've definitely had better. One plus is that it's pretty cheap so you're wallet won't be hurt too badly.

Overall, there are plenty of other hole in the wall Mexican restaurants near Mr Taco in Charlotte that are around the same price, with better food.
