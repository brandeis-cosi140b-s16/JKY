i liked the food, it was a nice diversion from "chain" mexican restaurants, which are quite frankly NOT my favorite, but thanks for playing. shredded beef taco and bean/cheese burro. LOVED the tortilla, nice and chewy, not all chalky and almost crunchy like some. Matthew got a chicken taco that he said was good. the chips and salsa were also quite tasty.

however. it's dark in there. like hard to see the menu kind of dark. it's also COLD, i bring a hoodie everywhere and that usually solves my delicate flower tendencies. not here, still cold with my hoodie.

i really want to give this place 4 or 5 stars, i really do. but the service was just not that caliber.
the service was awful. asked 2 separate times for more chips and got them at almost the end of our meal. my drink sat empty for 10 minutes. the servers were nice, but they got my order wrong and put the tacos on the wrong plates.  now, to be fair, there was a "party", looked like some corporate event or something. but, they were attentive to the other tables that had been seated and not us. it may be that i attract bad service at mexican food places, i hope that's not the case!

anyhow, i will patronize this restaurant again for TAKE OUT!
