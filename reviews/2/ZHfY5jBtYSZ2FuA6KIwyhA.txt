Food service was terrible both times we visited. Once on a Saturday night , second, on next the Saturday. It wasn't overly crowded, however we were serviced well after other patrons who came in after us. We sat for 20 minutes before our order was taken, and another 45 minutes before food was brought to the table. The food quality was ok, but seasoned poorly. We did NOT get what we paid for (portions were pitiful). The table was dirty, as well as the floor, with each visit.  Again, it was NOT crowded or under staffed.   I will not be returning here, nor recommending a visit to anyone I know.

Update: Thanks for bringing the typo to my attention Kylie; I said Sunday and they are never open on Sunday. I meant the second Saturday of following month.
