To write about this Mexican place and being Mexican will not be good.  I have lived and been to border towns and South American so sorry about this but this place is cheap in taste of food. Not cheap in price.  The yard drinks tasted good but made us sick.  We believe they used cheap alcohol .  We saw bottles of taka tequila or it looked like the brand.
