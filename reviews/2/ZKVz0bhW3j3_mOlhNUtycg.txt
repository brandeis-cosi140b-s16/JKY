So I finally got to try this location (Eastern/Richmar) after eating plenty of times at their other location on Tropicana.  Upon walking in my husband and I thought..."oh they did a nice job with the remodel inside"...until we sat down and really got a chance to look around.

We sat facing the stairs (right in front of what appeared to be their booths) so this enabled us to see the upstairs.  The curtain appeared to have fallen off.  The front area looked odd...was it a place where people can eat or is it a sort of lobby/waiting area?  Maybe If the place was packed with people it wouldn't look so empty?  The bar area only seats about 4 people...and we thought it was suppose to be somewhat of a bar/restaurant?  The ambience just didn't fit well with the type of food they serve. 

Now the kitchen...they did a great job with the remodel of the kitchen as the restaurant before did not have all that kitchen equipment.  It started to make more sense to us once we saw the kitchen...as a lot of money went into getting all that equipment so I'm sure the owners just wanted to open the doors to start recouping some of that money.  

Now the food...we were disappointed as it just didn't taste like their other location.  We love the Al Pastor tacos; however, their Al Pastor seemed to be heavily spiced with cinnamon that it over powered even their salsa that they put right on top.  We also had their Barbacoa tacos and the meat was on the chewy side rather than what we're used to with the meat just falling apart easily.  We overheard a lot of new customers confused at where they are suppose to order.  Now I read the other reviews from other yelpers and you'd think they would put up some directions by now as to not upset new customers...but they haven't.  Maybe that will come when they start focusing on the dining areas...

Sorry for the 2 stars...as I do like your tacos (at least the once we had at Tropicana).  I will wait until you all settle in...to try it ince again.
