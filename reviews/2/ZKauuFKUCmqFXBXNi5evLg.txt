Let me preface this by saying, I love Chipotle.  It's one of my all time favs, and I've been to dozens of different locations in various states over the years.  Now that I live in Gilbert, I've been going to this particular one for a few months and it is by far the worst one I've ever been to.  They are VERY skimpy with all of the ingredients in the bowl, especially the meat.  A double meat barbocoa at this location is barely equal to a regular portion at any other Chipotle I've ever been to.  Service is slow as well.  I would never go back, but it's only a couple blocks away so I can't justify driving across town.  On two occasions they have been completely out of pico de gallo.  Really???  I rarely write reviews on Yelp, but after about a dozen visits to this location, I had to share my experience.  This two star review is in no way a reflection of Chipotle as a whole, as I'm a huge fan.  It's just this particular location.
