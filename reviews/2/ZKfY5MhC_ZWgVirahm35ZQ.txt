Very disappointing.  I was really looking forward to a clubby bar with great appetizers and conversation.  I arrived first, valet parked, walked downstairs to the bar, turned around walked back out and told my friend to meet me at Richardson's instead.  Downstairs was too small.  Too dark.  Too warm with the fireplace going.  Bar was packed and the chairs and couch I tried weren't comfortable.  I also checked out the upstairs bar which was too exposed to the kitchen and garbage.
