We decided to go here since there wasn't much to choose from (wendy's is across from here but wasnt in the mood for it). The food  was not anything exciting. I got the shrimp tacos. I didn't care for the tortillas nor the rice. The shrimp was alright, they just grilled it no seasoning at all. And the guacamole looked very unappealing. Overall I was disappointed in the quality of the food, but the service was pretty decent.
