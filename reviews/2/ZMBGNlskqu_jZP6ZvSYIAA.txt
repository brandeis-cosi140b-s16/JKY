It's just "OK".

We were seated very quickly which was Great.
We ordered and got our waters quickly but that's about as good as the service got....

The waiter forgot our order of Chips and Salsa.  Really?  How hard is chips and salsa... especially when they charge you for them?  And it's not like he was busy... he had 2 tables... ours and one other.  It seemed like he was zoned out on something.

Thankfully, he got our orders into the system and the kitchen got our orders out fairly quickly.

Food was ok... a little salty for my taste.... but I was so hungry I chowed down.  

Had the Enchilada Suiza which was good... lots of chunks of chicken and not just cheese so I was happy with that.  The beans were good but the rice was dry so I mixed it with the beans.

I probably will NOT go back to this La Salsa.  It's a chain so I'll find a different one.
