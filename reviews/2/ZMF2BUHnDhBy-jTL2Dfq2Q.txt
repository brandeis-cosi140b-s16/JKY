My friends and I were hungry after the ASU football game and decided to come here before a night on Mill. BIG MISTAKE! Coming here after Mill when you're too drunk to know what's good food? Maybe.

Being from the OC/SD area, when I heard they make California burritos I had to try one. While it wasn't absolutely horrible, it was totally not up to par with all the amazing SD establishments. It was a burrito that much I know. However if you were to blindfold me and ask me what type of burrito it is, I wouldn't be able to tell you it's a California burrito. Pretty scary if you ask me.

I also tried their chips which seemed stale and their horchata, which passed as horchata but was pretty watered down.

Maybe I'll have better luck trying one of their combos next time. AFTER Mill...
