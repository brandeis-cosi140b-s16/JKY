We were here for a family gathering.  They set us up in a nice room. The chips were good but the salsa was very bland and watery.  I got the a chimi which is a signature dish. The beef was ok but really didn't care for the cheese sauce. The rest   of my family said their food was just ok. I really expected it to be better.
