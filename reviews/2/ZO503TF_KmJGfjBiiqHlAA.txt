Not a great place for the kids. Limited menu for them and nothing American kiddie food like other Mexican places.. My oldest tried an appetizer instead Mexican sliders on a bun... Gross. She didn't touch it an neither did my husband or I. I had the carnitas and they were OK. Nothing to rave about. Service was OK and they weren't even busy. I think Roberto's down the street taste way better for a fraction of the price.
