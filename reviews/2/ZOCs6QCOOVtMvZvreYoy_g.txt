Outdated decor and average, slightly overpriced food. OK, I could end the review right there, but I shall elaborate a bit further.

Seems like Aunt Chiladas has seen some better days. It looks like a water park for midgets outside, when you approach the entrance. Very cool... For 1974.

It's a very colorful place, but seems as though it hasn't changed since the aforementioned year. Just guessing there. Menu items are all priced about 3 dollars to high. Glad I went once, probably won't re-visit.
