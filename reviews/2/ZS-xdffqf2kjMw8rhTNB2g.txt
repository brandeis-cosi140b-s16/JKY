This is the last of my visits to this location.  3 strikes and you are out.  Especially when its 0-3.  Since Chipotles inception, I have always had good experiences at all the locations I go to.  The only complaint I ever had was that it may have been too busy, but thats a good thing.  This location across from Scottsdale Fashion Mall is (To me) a horrible example.  95% of this is attributed to the staff there.2 out of 3 times Ive been there, they didnt have any Chicken at lunch time.  I can see once, but twice?  And then I was told 20minutes before it would be ready.  They didnt see that they were getting low and have it started.  Each time Im dealing with the staff on the line, they are inattentive at best.  No beans, they start to put beans on.  Ask for Fajita, they pass it by so I ask again.  Light Hot sauce, nahhhhh how bout a huge spoonful.  Light SC, nope..you want a giant glob of it.  Today I saw 8 people working.  somehow 1 of those 8 was making orders alone. (this is at 115 pm).  Finally as hes making mine some backup arrives.  Well at least I thought so...and then he leaves to take out trash with my poor burrito sitting in front of the cheese, incomplete.  He said someone finish that.  after 2min someone finally got some gloves on to finish it up and they instantly rolled it without asking me if it was done.  It wasnt.  So they unrolled it, made a gdamn disaster of it to finish it.  Guess what, it fell into 3 pieces when I took it out of the foil because of the gallon of hot sauce on it, and the re-roll.  Oh, how delicious, the fajitas were black/burnt too.  yum.
