Usually, when you go to hole in the wall places the food is always exceptional and worth the trip. However, in this case it was the exact opposite. The food was not that good. I was actually disappointed. I was expecting kick ass carne asada or al pastor tacos. To my dismay, I had better food at a Baja Fresh in an all gringo neighborhood. Minus three stars for wasting my trip to North LV. 

Historical Note: This place used to be a Boston Pizza # 5 a long long time ago in a galaxy far far away.
