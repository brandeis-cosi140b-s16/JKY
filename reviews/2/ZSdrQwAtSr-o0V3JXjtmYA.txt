This place is a freakin' joke from the beginning. Let me preface this review by saying we had a group of 5, and 4 of us had 2 drinks before our 5th got her mojito. It seemed as if the bartenders were capable of doing a beer or margarita, but nothing even remotely complex (not that mojitos are really complex.) The food was absurd, and a joke to call it "mexican." I was sick all night, as were two of the girls in the group, and one guy. The service in the restaurant portion was the exact opposite of the bar, and was very precise, even though they were bringing out sizzling hot plates of death. 

It's a fun place to go and have a drink before or after your dinner which hopefully is taking place elsewhere in Old Town. It's also a fun atmosphere on Tuesday nights, when you see all walks of life. I think if they changed the name to crappy taco, so as to lower my expectations, I might like the restaurant quite a bit.
