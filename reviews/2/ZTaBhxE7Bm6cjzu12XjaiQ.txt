I used to come here quite a bit but it's been a while and I have to say it will be a while if ever that I come back. 

We orders the fajitas for two. At least half of it was onions. There was definitely not enough meat for two people for the $26. 

We also ordered the pitcher of margaritas. And it basically tasted like sweet and sour mix on ice. There was little to no tequila. 

The service was not great either.
