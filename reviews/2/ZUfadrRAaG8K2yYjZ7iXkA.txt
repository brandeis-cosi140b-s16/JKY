Tried the bean cheese burrito and the quesadilla. Bean burrito was very bland, I could have made a better one with refried beans out of a can. Salsa wasn't spicy at all and my quesadilla had little cheese. The quesadilla was good but it was more like a taco than anything, even the size was of a taco. For $4.75 I expected a bigger quesadilla. They also give you a slice of lime, radish, and cucumber... Still trying to figure that out.
