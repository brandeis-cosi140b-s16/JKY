When this place first opened they were good but then we started noticing changes..like when you would ask for potatoes in your breakfast burritos and you would get partially cooked french fries instead. Yuck. 
So we hadn't eaten there for awhile until tonight, hoping they got better.  Nope. I ordered the grilled chicken salad. They didn't give me dressing so i went up to ask. "Oh we are out of dressing sorry." Gee that would have been nice to know when I ordered in case I wanted to get something else. No bell peppers in the salad which they used to do. The carrots they used were the pickled carrots they put in the cooler in the front. Yuck.
My husband ordered the fajitas and got chopped meat! Since when does fajita meat come chopped? His veggie mix had jalape√±os in it and the mix was undercooked. 
We should have gone to subway instead.
