Gordon Ramsey would take one look at this menu and scream. It's Asian. It's American. It's Mexican.  It's confusion. 

Even though this is a casual place, they have a wine list that aspires to be The French Laundry's wine list. I can't imagine going to a place like this and ordering a $180 bottle. Totally incongruous with the menu, the decor, the waitstaff, and the conspicuous absence of a sommelier.  

Lastly, my wife ordered a dish that had a hidden surprise -- a grilled habaniero pepper. No warning whatsoever. She was in tears from the heat. Not enjoyable to say the least.  There's no excuse for that.
