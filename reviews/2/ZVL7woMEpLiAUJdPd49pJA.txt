This place gets 2 stars cause the food is decent.  The biggest problem I have with this place is they can never get my order right. I always check my order before I leave but the burritos they always screw up. Can't really tell what's in it until you take a bite and I'm not about to unroll a burrito before the leave the restaurant.  Maybe I'll be going back to Robertos
