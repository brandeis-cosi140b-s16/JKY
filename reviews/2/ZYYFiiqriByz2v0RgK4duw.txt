Stayed down the street at the Hyatt and needed something easy for dinner.  I wasn't expecting much and that is exactly what I got.  The food was ok, the atmosphere was weird, and the service was decent.  

The restaurant is huge and really doesn't create a great atmosphere when there are only 15 people in the entire place.

I'd say skip it!
