I'm in town on business and was told by my hotel staff that El Encanto was a great place to go for Mexican food. 

The atmosphere is great. The tables, decor, duck pond on the patio are worth a visit. I would stick to drinks and salsa though.

My make-your-own margarita was good and the salsas were really tasty so I was extremely disappointed when I got the guacamole. Probably some of the worst I've ever had. 

I ordered the Chile Relleno for dinner which was also gross. The dish itself was average but I could tell the second I got it that it had been sitting under a heat lamp in the kitchen for a while. Everything was dry, the melted cheese was hardened and the sauce had that layer of film on top. Blaaah. 

After reading others' complaints about dry food and the staff being unwilling to make changes to the menu, I'm convinced they pre-cook dishes and let them sit under the heat lamps until someone orders one. I've worked in restaurants and know exactly how a plate looks that has been left in the window. A lot of the dishes I saw looked that way. 

Service was slowish but my server was nice. He took the guac off my bill because I barely touched it. I hadn't even complained. Wonder if he's used to that...

So go early for drinks, salsa and ducks but don't waste your money on the overpriced food.
