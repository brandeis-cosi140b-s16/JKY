Well let me see. Where should I start. My wife and I came to Robertos because its normally a safe option for fast Mexican food. We came in and tge lady behind the counter did not even great us. We placed our order and the cook kept on looking at us with an attitude.  He made us feel like we were disturbing his day. The food came out fast and tasted good as Robertos always does. However the service at this location sucks. They are rude and make customers feel uncomfortable in the building.  Two stars because of the food.
