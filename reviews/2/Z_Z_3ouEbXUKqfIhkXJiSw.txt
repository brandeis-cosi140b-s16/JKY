They're ok. The steak isn't tender so that means it's not my first nor second choice. But I do stop in when I specifically just want chicken tamales, rice and beans. Not as attentive sometimes, I have to ask for every detail and one time the waiter got frustrated. I may not know everything they have, excuse me. Maybe he didn't understand me. I wanted mole sauce for my tamale.
