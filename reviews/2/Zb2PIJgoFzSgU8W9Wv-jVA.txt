Not a big fan. There are similar Mexican joints near me that are better.

The food was fine. Nothing great. The service was slow the night I was there. If I lived near it, I might go back. But I would not make a special trip for it. Again, there are a number of similar Mexican places around town. This does not rise above average in my book.
