Howdy Az Foodies

Don't you just love driving down the road scoping out new places and promising to one day try them.... and then  you finally do?

That's how this review will start... I went to get a burger from a place that used to be a burger shop but apparently is now this mesquite mexican and burger place?

This piqued my interest.... it's kind of like mixing an italian restaurant with a chinese restaurant...

I go to a mexican restaurant to get mexican food and a burger place to get a burger...but who knows... maybe they do make a good burger?  Never got the chance to find out what any of it tastes like..

It started like this... I walked in and there was 2 people ahead of me.

A nice man...looked like a manager/owner?.... greeted us and as they took orders found they didnt have the carne adasa or rice therefore they stopped production and went to chop up meat and find rice and no idea what else because we all just stood there waiting while this young female employee stood there looking dumbfounded!

The beans sat there on the tortillas on the work area waiting for ingrediants to arrive...I should mention at this  time that they took the tortillas out of a grocery store plastic bag!  I was hoping maybe they made their own?

After standing in this line 10 minutes I politely said to the dumbfounded girl... " I have been waiting too long and I think I will leave"  I said Thank You and left.

To be fair I know they opened not too long ago, so i think i will wait a few months until they have their act together to possibly...maybe try again...

Not sure they will be there months from now if they dont made some serious changes.

Good luck to you Julia's....

And to the rest of you......

Bon Appetite'
