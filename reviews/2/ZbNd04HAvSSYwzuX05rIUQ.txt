Tonight was the saddest dinner I have ever had from this location. I used my chipotle app to place my order on my way home from work, I got to the restaurant early but when asked about my order no one acknowledged the questions. The staff was all young and acted like it was a game to be there, yelling at friends with no regard for customers. When the girl at the register was embarrassed enough after I had been there for ten minutes and another order came it she started to hurry the rest of the staff along.
When I finally got home and sat down to eat my salad, it wasn't a salad like I ordered. The rushed unaware staff made a regular burrito bowl, forgot my dressing I asked for on the side and I found a nat bug on my cheese. It was disappointing and inspiration for this review since I never write any. I'm willing to try this location as long as the staff is softener that day
