I was pretty excited to try this place. We were told to seat ourselves and someone would come by.... 20 minutes later, I got a walking by waitress and asked her if she could get someone to bring us menus. She was super apologetic. The food was less than decent. I had chicken tacos which was good and a carne asada taco which was NOT, bland no flavor. Service was slow, place was not too busy. Not impressed. Not worth my money, even with the discount I got from Living Social.
