A-ok hole in the wall authentic Mexican seafood place in a not-so-great part of town. 

Coworkers and I tried this place out for lunch. One of them was raving about how great it was. And I am always one to try new things especially seafood. 

Restaurant itself is spacious and clean. Inside you can buy fresh seafood. We sat down and waitress came to our table. I don't like how she didn't address us in English. Only one of us knew Spanish :-/

They serve chips and salsa on the house which was nice. It was very tasty with the right amount of spice. I ordered a langostino dish - don't remember the exact name. Refer to the pic below. It was served with rice, beans, salad and tortilla. The dish overall was ok. Edible but there was something off about the taste. Maybe I was scared to break out which was what happened to my other coworker the last time he came so I had some trepidation about my meal. (He had shrimp in a prior visit. He avoided it this time around)

And the tortillas tasted weird. I don't know if it was homemade or cooked in lard but I only had one and it was enough to keep me from wanting more. 

I don't see myself coming back. The price overall was decent (it was paid for LOL, but I wouldn't come back and pay on my own).  I'm not sure if I'd really recommend this restaurant due to its location and overall average experience.
