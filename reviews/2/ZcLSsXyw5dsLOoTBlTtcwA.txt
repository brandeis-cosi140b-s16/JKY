nasty late night food.. ewww I was in Arizona on Thanksgiving weekend stopped in after the casino and wow so nasty! The drive thru was supppppperrr slow I had a van with 8 other people the food took about half an hour! ohh you know when ur really craving something and it isnt fullfilled!?? Dont get the horchatta! sooo watered down it was disgusting and no one was impressed by any of the items we ordered. Half the order was done incorrectly anyway. But, the positive part the lady giving us our food took back my horchatta very rudly and gave a soda instead. Then she literally threw my old horchatta across the resturant into a trash can..i guess thats were it belonged oh well never doing that again!
