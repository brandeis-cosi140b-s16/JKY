I continue to have bad experiences here.  I keep coming back because it's close to where I work, but I've had enough.  I can tell they have high turn over because they have different people working there all the time.  Maybe if they hired the right people it would make for better customer service.  The taste of the food is the only reason I gave two stars.  The consistency of the quantity of the food is poor. I pay the same price for the salad, but it is pretty much all tortilla and lettuce now.  Not that I need huge super sized portions, but just the standard portion I'm become used to at other locations.  Lastly, because it's a place I always enjoy, one of my friends gave me a gift card for Cafe Rio. When I went to pay, the girl behind the counter told me it wasn't working and that I needed another payment method.  I wish I could get some good old cafe rio service back.
