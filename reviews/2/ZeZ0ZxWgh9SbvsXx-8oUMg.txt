I ordered a chicken taco, but I've had much better. Go to Chipotle or Qdoba or Blue Burrito instead ... the customer service and food is SO much better.  Yes I know they're not real "Mexican" food but neither is this place. Lol.

Also, the owner was really, really rude and unfriendly. I haven't had service this bad in awhile.

This place is just ... ick.

Edited to add: If you're interested in legit Mexican food, go to America's Taco Shop on 1st Street. It's SO good and the service is excellent. Much better than  this place.
