It's a better option than Taco Bell, but what isn't?  I think this place is a little over-hyped.  It's not that expensive which is good, but the food is extremely greasy and sub-par.  If I am really hungry, it is tough to go the place because I'll usually end up with a stomach-ache - and I consider myself someone who has a pretty strong stomach.  Also they don't have a "only chips" option on their menu.  Not a huge deal, but the only option on the menu is "chips and cheese."  The cheese isn't even melted, so it's like a lazy version of nachos.  I'd give this place a 3, but I feel I have to balance the force of the review system.
