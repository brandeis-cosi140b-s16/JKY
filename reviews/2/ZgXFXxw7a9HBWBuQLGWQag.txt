Nice environment but not much Mexican influence.  Food was bland.  Sent out my son's pollo fundido and the burrito was burnt on one side and the bland sauce just covered over it.  We had 6 people with us and nobody was impressed.  Too bad because we were hoping for a good new place.  Also a little pricey for the food served. Check the menu before you go because it is not traditional Mexican choices.
