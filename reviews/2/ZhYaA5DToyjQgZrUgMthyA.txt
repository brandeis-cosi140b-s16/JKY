I didn't feel it was fair to give this place only one star without actually going inside as atmosphere/cleanliness is one of the categories I like to rate on. I had a positive drive through experience.  The service was prompt and friendly.  

I was surprised when I tried to order a diet soda and they told me they don't have diet anymore.  

I ordered the Carne asada burrito.  The size was somewhat small compared to many other places.  The tortilla was dried out and split on me while I was eating the burrito.  It looked and tasted like it had been frozen at one time.  The Carne asada was a little salty.  I had to constantly spit out pieces of gristle and fat as I was eating.  It was the worst Carne asada I've ever had.  There was very little guacamole and the pico was non-existent.  

For a burritothat size that cost over $7 I would expect a much better quality meat.  I was very dissapointed and will not return.
