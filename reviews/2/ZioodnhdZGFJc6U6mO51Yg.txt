I am actually a Filiberto's fan, however this location just doesn't do it for me. Every time I have ordered from here. There food just doesn't have much flavor. I always drive by them on my way to work, like the idea that they are opened 24 hrs. But there are too many choices to choose from (three by the time I hit the 101 fwy) to settle on their food.
