Caramba isn't the Best or most Authentic Mexican Food but it is a Budget Family Friendly Place that happens to serve some seriously VERY strong $3.75 Margaritas. (I think they were $3.75)  It's casual as you order at the counter, seat yourself and wait for your number to be called. 

They also serve breakfast items all day and all your Mexi Favorites.

Caramba is a better alternative to Taco Bell or Chipolte and offers a large patio and is one of the better fast casual Mexican Restaurants in the immediate area.

Many Caramba locations are in the area.
