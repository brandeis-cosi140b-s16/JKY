The food here is definitely subpar.  I ordered a hard shell shredded chicken taco, and it was unappealing.  It had no flavor, and the shells were soggy.  The chicken was flavored with salsa, but it tasted like it was flavored with some cheap tomato sauce. The rice and beans were unremarkable as well.  The only good thing about the meal were the chips.
   Unbelievable to me how the Phoenix area is lacking in decent Mexican restaurants.  With such a large Hispanic population, I would think there would be a better selection.
