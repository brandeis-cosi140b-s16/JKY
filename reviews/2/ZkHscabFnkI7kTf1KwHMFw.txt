I'm from Philadelphia so when I first moved here I thought this place was so good, what do I know, I'm from the east coast. 

The longer I have lived here, (7 years now) I realized how many Mexican restaurants are better than this place. Each time I went it got worse and worse, not only the food, but the service. Annoying things like not enough tequila in my margarita, cold meat in my taco and cold cheese on my Mexican pizza. Even if those things didn't happen I would still would not ever be going back.
