I always enjoy Chipotle but had an odd experience at this one. My wife ordered a bowl with beef and the girl put chicken. When I told her we wanted beef she said "I thought you said chicken" , then in stead of making a new one with beef she starts trying to scoop the chicken out of the bowl with her spoon. I gave her a puzzled look for a moment and when I started to ask what she was doing and my wife realizing that this women couldn't buy a clue just said "that's fine, I'll just take the chicken" just to avoid making a federal case out of it.  Of course the girl never bothered to apologize for the mistake. Very strange...
