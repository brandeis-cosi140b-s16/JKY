This is not the best Mexican food, by any means. The chips are okay; the salsa trio that is complimentary is probably my favorite item here. I've tried various dishes, from enchiladas to ceviche, and have not been overwhelmed by anything. I started coming back only for drinks and chips/salsa, but the drinks are VERY light on the alcohol, mostly mixer. The bar ambiance is pretty, but the service is very mediocre. They've certainly improved since their grand opening, but are still a bit slow.
