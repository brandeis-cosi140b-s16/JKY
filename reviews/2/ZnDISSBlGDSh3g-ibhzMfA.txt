Looks like I went to the wrong place. . .

I was hoping to go to the same Tee Pee Tap Room where the American Progressive band Cartoon first planned their compositions.  Apparently that was the OTHER Tee Pee Tap Room.

How was the food here?  Well, lets just say that we all know what The Great Cornholio does with "tee pee".

I ordered a two enchilada plate.  The refried beans tasted really fresh. . .from the can.  That was pretty much how the whole of the meal was.  It was edible, but not enjoyable.  I was hoping to have a decent meal in a place with some history, and instead I have a meal in the wrong restaurant that was on the bad side of mediocre.  There are many good Mexican restaurants in Phoenix.  The Tee Pee Tap Room (at least this place) is not one of them.
