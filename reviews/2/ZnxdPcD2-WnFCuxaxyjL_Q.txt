Warning Yelpers: This place no longer honors Restaurant.com coupons. There are signs all over the front doors stating this, which is ...weird. I didn't have a coupon but several reviewers here mentioned them. 

I ate here and died of boredom. 
We ordered the smaller plate of Aguachiles ($17!) and Enchiladas in Mole sauce ($7 for lunch)

The wait was very long because I ordered from the dinner menu at lunch time, but that's not a problem. There were 3 complimentary bowls of salsa:  standard, tomatillo and pico de gallo. I liked the pico de gallo, they all tasted ok but they were so bland that we finished all 3 bowls without even noticing it. 

I ordered the Aguachiles because the dish looked exactly like ceviche of filet shrimp that Fiesta Jalisco used to serve at this same location.  But Jalisco's was hot and  delish while this was nothing of the sort. It didn't even have avocado and red peppers like the picture on their menu. All we could taste was first sharp red onions, then lime juice and finally ground jalapenos, bitter and sharp, $17 for a small portion?
1 star

Next the enchilada, the mole sauce was not bad, not great but the chicken was dry (because Gringos insist on white meat only) and when I was offered a bit more all I could reply was "no thanks, I'm bored with this"
 
 I'm giving them 2 stars instead of only 1 because the waitress cared and tried her best, but next time I'll drive down to La Unica instead
