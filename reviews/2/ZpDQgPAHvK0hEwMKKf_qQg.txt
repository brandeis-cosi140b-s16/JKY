So I walk in and order 3 carne asada tacos, 2 carne asada burritos with everything and 3 drinks. Total price 33.51. I asked the cashier to repeat the total, because I taught it was wrong, so she did and it was correct 33.51 was the total.  So I looked at the reciept and found out why it was so expensive. Tacos are 3.00 each, burritos are 4.50 each. What they don't tell you is that if you want your tacos and burritos with everything it's going to cost you an extra 1.50 for each taco and burrito, so instead of paying 3.00 for a taco your actually paying 4.50 for one taco and 6.00 for a burrito. Burrito not worth the price. The taco was very good, but not for 4.50. As for being the best as I read some of the reviews, not really.  I live in Los Angeles and I've had way better tacos and burritos for much less.  I would never go back to this place.  Way over priced.
