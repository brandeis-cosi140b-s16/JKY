Taco bells are basically all of the same but avoid around the time high school / middle school let's out because it's full of very irritating teens- not even eating ! I'm addition to playing catch in the parking lot- ball missed my car but the teens thought it was okay to hang out sitting on mine & other peoples trunks!
