meh-

Carnitas was super duper fatty and crispy in other parts b/c it was like refried. So not very healthy at all.  Like I was picking through parts of it to find the edible parts in my opinion. guac was good, pico de gallo was good, tortillas were good. 

I don't think I'd run there anytime soon and probably would opt for Del Taco across the street if I was craving Mexican that badly.

My favorite mexican place is still Border Grille at Mandalay Bay.
