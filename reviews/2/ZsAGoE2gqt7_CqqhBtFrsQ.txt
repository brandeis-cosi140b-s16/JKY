If you like Lawry's chili powder and cumin, you will love this place because they are on EVERYTHING. Chips? Check. Salsa? Check. Rice? Check. Chicken? Check. The tableside guacamole and margarita were the highlight, though the guac needed salt (easy fix). Service was good. In my opinion, the food is reminiscent of what you buy in a plastic box at an airport. Won't be back.
