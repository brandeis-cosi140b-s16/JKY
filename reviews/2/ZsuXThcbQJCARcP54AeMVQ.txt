Sure not the best margarita I've ever had, the food was just ok.-I have made better at home.  Service was slow , considering there was less than 10 people in the place during the day- there  decor was all right, nothing memorable. It's a not a second trip type of place for me.  Been there, won't go again, not awful just mediocre.
