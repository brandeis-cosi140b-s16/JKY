Went there on a Saturday night and the parking lot was almost empty (should have clued us in).

Very average food -- not the kind anyone would want to pay for or that they couldn't make at home.  The Spanish rice was like Rice-a-Roni out of a box.  The beans/cheese was okay, but who can screw that up?  The steak fajitas tasted funny like the beef was aged, but the waitress said it was a marinade.  I pushed it to the side and ate some of the peppers and onions instead. 

The salsa was bad tasting.  One was too hot, the other was weak and had a odd sweet aftertaste -- maybe mix the two together?  Still, it didn't taste fresh made.  I can't imagine any Mexican restaurant in the southwest surviving at all without good salsa.  The chips themselves were okay.

Very, very blah food.  Why bother having a restaurant if you're going to be so average?  Don't bother going.  I could cook better and I'm not even that good of a cook.

The building itself looks like with a little work it could be a pretty place, but it's kinda run down right now.  The "Now Serving Brunch" sign was at the front door, but it was 10:00 p.m.  They are asleep at the wheel over there.
