Two stars for this location, ultimately because of the poor customer service. The food was good as usual, but the cashier Sheri C. was abruptly rude straight from get go. My brother and I came through the drive through this Easter Sunday. "What can I get you" is how we were greeted, no hi, hello, or friendly context. We asked for two regular double decker tacos with no tomatoes. Her tone was really rude, and instead of just saying OK, she became argumentative about tomatoes only coming on supreme and not regular so no tomatoes come with that. We were going to order drinks but she just ended the order by giving us the total and saying pulling to the front. When we got to the window, she asked if we wanted sauce and we asked for fire, but she gave us mild. When I handed her my card to pay she turned away and came back asking for my ID and said " there's been a lot of fraud and you don't want that to happen to you do you??" in a smart tone. She practically dropped the food in my lap instead of handing it to me...and then just walked away. Overall, it was just a weird and awkward experience. As much as I love taco bell, it is not worth coming back to this location to be treated like dirt or an inconvenience in fear that Sheri C is working.
