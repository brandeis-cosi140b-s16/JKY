Super slow. Food is good but when I called ahead they said 25-30 min. I thought that was crazy for take out but I went to ace and shopped. Arrived at Se√±or Taco 30 min later and my order hadn't been started yet. The place was packed and everyone was talking about the same thing. Is it really worth the wait? Again, food is good but I hate when my time is wasted. Phone ran off the hook when I called and called 3 times before they answered. Each time I called phone rang like 15 times. When they have help in the kitchen this place rocks. Still here after 44 min.
