This place is freaking weird. Came here after seeing the rave reviews.. Idk how anyone can call this place a restaurant, it's more like a mall food court. The menu is tiny. Two entrees, water, and one pork bao was $30+.. The salmon bento box came out cold and the shrimp in the curried noodles was oddly soft and unpleasant. We sent the box back and are currently waiting while they refund us because it was taking forever to reheat the salmon. The only thing "Latin" on my noodles was a sprinkle of what looked like chicharrones. Wound up throwing the noodles out and cancelling the salmon. Giving two starts because the pork bao wasn't bad. But.. even that feels gratuitous.
