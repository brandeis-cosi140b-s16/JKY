Definitely not for kids!  This is all very unique food and tacos. My kids didn't eat one bit of their food because it was so unique. I like the Baja shrimp tacos and thought they were decent but everybody else's food was pretty much wasted. Maybe I just have some really picky eaters.  We went to McDonald's right after Ha.
