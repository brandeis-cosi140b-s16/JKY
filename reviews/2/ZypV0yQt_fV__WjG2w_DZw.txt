The sign on the outside claimed that this is a "fine dining restaurant."  I suppose it may be fine dining, if you compare it to a restaurant in Tijuana.  So, take their sign with a big grain of salt.

The chips & salsa are better than most.  The chips were fresh and hot and the salsa had a refreshing, cilantro-infused taste to it.  

The rest of the food was mushy and bland.  The waitress raised her voice from 15 feet away to ask if our food was okay.  In all, I'd only come back for the chips & salsa.
