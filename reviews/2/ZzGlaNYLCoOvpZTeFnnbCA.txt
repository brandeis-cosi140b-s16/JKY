For some reason, mostly one-word descriptions come to mind... The first is "overpriced."  The shrimp and corn cheese crisp was $11+.

Second word: "skimpy."  For almost $12, that little cheese crisp should have been covered in shrimp and corn.  I actually had to ask my wife if there was any corn as I searched out one of the micro-shrimps.

Third word: "Meh."  We tried three items to get a variety and a feel for the place and none of them was memorable or anything I would choose to go back for.  The tortilla soup was more like a party dip than a soup, the cheese crisp had hardly anything on it, and the portion of the unmemorable signature dish was pretty small for $16.

For my money, I'll definitely be heading to Blanco next time.  Black Chile seems to be an imitator that falls flat - like a bad impersonation act at an Arizona casino.

Thank God I had a $20 off coupon.  The $16 total seemed a whole lot more appropriate than the original $36.
