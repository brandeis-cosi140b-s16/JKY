Horrible.  Very, very Midwestern Mexican.  (Disclaimer: I grew up in the midwest, but I have traveled and had Mexican and Southwestern food, and I've enjoyed trying the many Mexican themed restaurants in town.)  

Chips were okay - crispy and pretty tasty.  Salsa was okay.  Chips and salsa were, probably, the best part of the meal.  So, +1 star for chips and decent service.

My girlfriend wasn't feeling well, and wanted something lighter and got the guacamole salad.  What she received was a plate of iceberg lettuce, shredded white cheese, and very salty guacamole.  The guacamole tasted like it came out of a jar.  The combination was exactly as appetizing as it sounds.

I got a burrito plate.  The burrito was not wrapped up.  It just had some filling dumped into it and had been shoved into an oven, so the edges of the tortilla had become hard and browned.  It was impossible to pick up and broke into pieces when I tried.  The filling itself consisted of stewed, mushy beef with stewed, mushy tomatoes and onions.  The sides were forgettable.   I really hate to throw away leftovers, especially if I think they can be jazzed up somehow, but that's what I ended up doing with the rest of the burrito.

You do get a lot of food on your plate, but if it's bland Mexican that's very, very reminiscent of what you can get out of a box at the supermarket, why bother?  

If you'd like better Mexican, try Huaraches Moroleon or Mas Amigos.  Or Taco Loco.  Cocina Real and Dos Reales aren't my favorites, but they're still better than here.  (I haven't been to Maize and can't comment on it.)  

If you wish there was a Burrito King off campus, this is pretty much it.  Except they do, at least, leave off the salty white cheese sauce here.  Overall, I would avoid this place and go to one of many places that is cheaper, more charming, and more authentic.
