What shoes should I wear? Seriously I am going out so I can't wear sneakers or sandals but I don't want sand on my nice shoes. What to do.

First off I have never eaten the food here. I usually come to hang out with friends and have drinks.  

First who has a outdoor patio in AZ with out mist and big fans?

The beers and other drinks are a bit pricey.

After 10 there is a cash only cover charge so they can evade paying tax on it.

In general nothing great at all.
