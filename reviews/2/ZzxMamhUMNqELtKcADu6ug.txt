We had a large group (14) or so.  I was really appreciative that the restaurant was willing to accomodate a large group and our server even split the checks that evening.  The first item (guacamole uniquo) which had guac and crab was so salty it had to be sent back.  The second order came out beautifuly and was delicious.  The rest of the entrees seemed hit or miss.  A girlfriend had to send back a glass of one twice since both glasses had turned.  The burger was tasty.  I am mixed on the tacos which seem pricey (three tacos without any accompanyments left many of us hungry).  The flatbreads were tasty but overly cheesed, and tended to be oily.  I'm still wanting to try out their brunch which looks tasty.  
Service was not great.  To be fair, we were a large party and there was another realy large party on the patio, but we would put in orders and wait and wait and wait about 20 minutes before someone checked in on us only to find that our drink orders hadn't been put into the bar.
I'm excited to have this addition to the neighborhood but probably won't go back for dinner for another few months.
