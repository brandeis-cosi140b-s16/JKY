Food handling by the employees appears to be acceptable now. The dude with the giant ass beard is now wearing a beard-net & I don't see employees eating on the line or keeping their drinks in view of customers anymore. 

The wait times suck! Usually there's only 2 people on the food line, including the cashier. There should be more food assembly line workers, especially during lunch rush hour.
