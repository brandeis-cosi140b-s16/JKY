Just barley a step above Taco Bell unfortunately. Cheap quality made food. The rice is dry, the guacamole is all lime taste and the salsa tastes like spaghetti sauce. I ordered the beef and bean chimichanga, more flour tortilla than anything else.

I wanted to like this place as Mexican is my favorite, but it's just not worth it.
