Food was a four star rating BUT I almost walked out before I ordered. Our waitress was so condescending, rude and was rushing us to order. If it wasn't for her that it would be a five star rating. If you like service from a waitress that makes you feel small as she holds her hand on her hip tapping her foot anticipating you to order stupidly, then this is the place for you. Although the chile rellenos were off the hook we will NOT return. Carmen made our $257.00 dinner for four disappointing and unforgettable for all the wrong reasons.
