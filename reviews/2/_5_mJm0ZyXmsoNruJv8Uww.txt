There was a time when I ate at this Qdoba nearly every day, but those days are long gone. 

The food is pretty standard, but I got sick of paying $6-7 for a naked burrito with literally nothing but rice, meat, and pico on it every day. I also grew tired of the inconsistency of their meat. Sometimes the chicken would be overcooked and I'd just be crunching on charred bits of chicken, or the pulled pork would be nothing but fatty pieces. I just can't justify leaving lunch smelling like fried tortilla chips for the rest of the day if the food isn't even good.

The service and cleanliness also leaves a lot to be desired. While, yes, I'm typically there during the lunch rush, the quality of both has never impressed when stopping in during the evening, either.

Assuming you can find a bottle with sauce left in it on their messy drink stand, the only saving grace of this Qdoba is that they have Cholula hot sauce. With enough of that on my burrito, I can tough out nearly anything they'll serve up. Too bad I can't douse the staff with it, too, to give them a reason to act as miserable as they do.
