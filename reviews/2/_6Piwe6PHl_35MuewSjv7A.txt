I kind of wish I had read the Yelp reviews before eating here but such is life. After some thinking, I believe this restaurant is short staffed. The hostess was friendly and explained to us that there would be about a 30-45 minute wait so she said she would text us when the table was ready. We decided to walk around and get some Starbucks to pass the time. After no notification, we walked back where the hostess said she had called us twice. She was really sweet and let us sit in a booth upon request. Half of the restaurant was empty so we didn't understand why there was a wait but again, maybe it had something to do with them being a short staffed?

Our waiter came and brought us some waters. We ordered some drinks and after receiving them we didn't see him for awhile. We saw two women from another table bring their receipts to talk to him. I'm assuming some drama went down because it wasn't until another 20 minutes went by that another waiter came and told us he would be taking over. Our food came out 20 minutes later and it was okay. I ordered the Sweet Corn Enchilada. 

The bathroom is upstairs and there is a bathroom attendant. She was very kind, however this made me feel incredibly uncomfortable because I was the only one in there and I didn't have any cash with me to tip. I just feel uncomfortable any time there is a bathroom attendant anywhere honestly.

Overall, the staff was nice but the food and service were eh. I wouldn't come back here and pay $16 for their enchilada again.
