Opens at 6am. They finally finished opening, turned on the lights at 6:14 to take my order. When I pointed out that this is the second time I've seen this, I got a very passive shrug from Cecile, who never actually addressed my concern. 
When ringing me up, I noted that the bottled water was really expensive at $4, and could I please have a cup of water instead. Got a reluctant sigh from Cecile who eventually slid an empty cup my way... No explanation that the water is available next door, had to hunt for it. Her attitude is unnecessary. 
Food is fine. Breakfast potatoes were bland.
