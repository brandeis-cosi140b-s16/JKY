Well after seeing several good reviews on here I gave them a try. I had the beef chimi, and it was different. They put big slices of cheese, tomato, onions, and bell peppers in the chimi. This makes them look much bigger than you expect. I have eaten Mexican all over the country, and I've never had anything like this, and I  have to say it just didn't trip my trigger. Not much seasoning, and the green and red sauce was not that great. 

I also got a green chili burrito for later, and it was horrible! They used the same shredded beef that was in my beef chimi, and added a small amount of the green tomatilo sauce, and a bunch of rice. There was no green chili in it at all.  The service was friendly and quick, but I was the only one there. The people who wrote good reviews about this place don't have a clue what good Mexican food is!
