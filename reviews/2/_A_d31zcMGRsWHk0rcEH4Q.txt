The food is okay.  The whole set up is kind of awkward.  You walk in and boom, the bar and cash register are right there and you feel like you need to decide what you want right off the bat because the door just opened and everyone is looking at you.  We went and grabbed a menu and a seat and then headed back up to order our food.   The food choices and prices are great, but the quality just isn't there.  Very, very loud place.  Oh, and Sunday they had a Bloody mary bar.  VERY generous on the vodka.  I would think the health board would have a problem with the serve yourself items that you put in your bloody mary.  Not too clean in that area.  YIKES.  We've been twice, and I don't think we will be back.
