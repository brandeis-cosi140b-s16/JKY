My friends have eaten here for dinner and enjoyed it. So, we decided to come for brunch. Bad decision. After placing our orders, we waited over an hour for our food to arrive. When it did, it was cold. Eggs congealed, shrimp & grits a solid mass. 

While enduring our wait, I Had 2 "special" bloody mary's with chili and with bacon-infused vodkas. Marginal; nothing special. We were far from the only table experiencing problems: during our wait, we saw the manager putting out fire after fire. One table apparently reporting long wait & cool food too (we found out they were right); at another table, 2 young ladies had a mimosa poured on top of them. 

It should be noted that the manager did step up. He took care of our bill (drinks only; we did not eat the cold food but left still hungry & went elsewhere to eat) and offered to take care of our bill the next time. However, we live out of state, and while my friends come to Las Vegas annually, who knows when or if I might be back? The point is, the manager should not have had to "make it right." Very disappointing.
