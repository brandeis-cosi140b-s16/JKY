Came here for the taco deal 3 tacos for $5. It was decent at most, they were pretty much like the tacos you can get at taco bell. Service was kind of slow here. We only wanted the tacos to go but there wasn't anyone to take our order for a good 15 minutes until the guy at the adjacent bar came to the rescue. 

The tacos are not filling especially if you are partying and drinking after. Trust me in half an hour or an hour you will be hungry again.
