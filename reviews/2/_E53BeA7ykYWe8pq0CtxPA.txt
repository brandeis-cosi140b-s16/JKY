I just want to start this review out by saying if you think wearing heels to the Sandbar is a good idea, you are f'ing retarded.. And yet, I see the same hoes wearing the same hoe-y heels and complaining that they cant walk and that the sand in between their toes is disgusting. God people are irritating. 

I don't love this place. In fact, I don't even really like this place. I feel like everyone who goes there has a giant stick up their ass, stares at you like you have 10 goddamn heads and the dudes.. don't even get me started on the dudes. Lets just say douche to the bag. But pluralized. 500 times.

I once cut my foot open on an enormous shard of glass that was peeking out of the sand because I was dumb enough to think it was a good idea to empty my shoe out and step on the ground. Don't do this. Don't even take your shoe off ever. Also, don't get in that water. I swear a layer of syphilis was floating on the top of it last time I was there. I think a decent rake job on their pseudo beach is a must after every shift.. and perhaps some chlorine, or better yet...  bleach. Seriously, think about it.

The one cool thing that ever happened at the Sandbar in the handful of times i've been forced to come here was that a dude bought 100 beers. He bought ONE HUNDRED BEERS and passed them out to whoever was close. I think I walked away with 3, and who the hell doesn't love free beer. Other than that, this place is enormous and confusing and dirty and there are random shards of glass and STD's floating around everywhere. 

Sorry dudes, im just, not a fan.
