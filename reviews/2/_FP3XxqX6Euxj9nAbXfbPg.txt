I came here because it had good reviews, a groupon/living-social voucher, and was craving some Mexican food that is actually spicy because I'm tired of going to restaurants that put that little jalapeno pepper graphic next to an entree only to have be as if they never put any spicy peppers in the darn meal.

Well unfortunately, that was the same case here. My boyfriend loves extremely spicy peppers and ordered an entree off the "spicy" list, "for those who are daring", and was extremely disappointed. I do like spicy but not as much as him, tried a couple bites of his dish too, and I didn't taste anything spicy.

The reason for the 2 stars is because of expectations; you can't name your restaurant "Jalapeno Inferno" and have the spicy dishes taste so boringly unspicy. Now I really am tired of going to restaurants where they promise sweat-induced spiciness but fail to even tickle my taste buds.
