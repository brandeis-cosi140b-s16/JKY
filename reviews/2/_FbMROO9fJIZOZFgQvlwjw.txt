Meh, with the abundance of much better Mexican food available we won't be coming back for food. 

Food was totally plain Jane and overly greasy.  Our server wasn't very knowledgeable about the menu and forgot about us midway through the meal. We had to flag down a different server to ask for to go containers for the second time and the check. 

Not impressed.
