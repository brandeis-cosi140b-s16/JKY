I hold the Southside in low regards including the restaurants, stores and the rude/hipster snobbish disrespectful crowds that are drawn there.  

Anything dealing with the Southside I normally cringe and make up an excuse why I cannot partake....however 

I went out to dinner for a friends 30th birthday dinner, we were a party of over 7 people.  

Yo Rita's wait staff made us feel comfortable and not at all like a burden. 

When I go to an Spanish restaurant I have an affinity towards any dish with chorizo . I ordered a mussel and chorizo dish. It was easily one of the grossest sea food appetizers I have ever had the displeasure of eating.

 It was a bowl of dry hard chorizo bits and the mussels tasted like dirty bathtub water. 


Anthony Bourdain has this to say about mussels served in restaurants, "I don't eat mussels in restaurants unless I know the chef, or have seen, with my own eyes, how they store and hold their mussels for service. I love mussels. But, in my experience, most cooks are less than scrupulous in their handling of them. It takes only a single bad mussel, one treacherous little guy hidden among an otherwise impeccable group." Kitchen Confidential.  

He goes on to say that mussels are left in a bucket of their own waste.  That's not something that any diner wants going through their heads while slurping on mussels. But with the way that dish tasted I had to believe that Bourdain's quote had some truth to it. 

Yo Rita's just another reason not to go to the Southside some more.
