Champaign, IL is a place in which I've learned many tragic truths in this thing called life. One of the more prominent ones, specifically in relation to the central-Illinois locale, is that there is no good Mexican food here. You may recieve recommendations and you may choose to believe them, but remember this: it's all relative.

During my 3 year stay in this small midwestern town, I was duped into trying the fare at a variety of Mexican eateries. Always hoping to replicate my Pilsen, Clark Street or the lady that sells tamales out of a cooler experience I never turned down an invite. On a recent trip back in search of gainful employment (in the form of a university sponsored job fair) I was implored to try Fiesta Cafe. It was the straw that broke the camel's back.

Quantity over quality appears to be the motto here, as it is at many C-U establishments. I ordered tamales and was greeted with rubbery and unpleasant masa wrapped around a minimal amount of chicken. The sour cream did indeed come in a school lunch single serving container as mentioned in another review, and the rice and beans were sorely lacking in positive qualities. 

I gave two stars, however, because the service was good and they carried tamarind Jarritos. Tamarindo! The food was edible, but it just wasn't quite what I'd expected.
