What a mistake. I ordered rolled tacos with guacamole and it looked like Kermit the frog  had diarrhea on my rolled tacos. You call that guacamole? It was so watery. Guacamole should resemble avocados. 

The beans were disgusting as well. I'm from San Diego and I'm getting convinced I will never find good Mexican food in Arizona.
