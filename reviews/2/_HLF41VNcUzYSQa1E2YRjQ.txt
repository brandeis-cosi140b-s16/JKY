A total chipotle rip-off. They have the same setup, with the white rice (with green seaweed things in it) and choice of meat beans etc. The prices are higher than Chipotle, a buritto was more than $6. The people weren't especially friendly or anything, but not a big deal. The food is nothing special, unoriginal, and expensive. If you'd like food that is exactally like Chipotle, then you may as well actually go to Chipotle and pay less for a meal.
