We've gone to Dos a dozen or so times over the last couple of years and the place just keeps getting worse. Service is incredibly slow with us waiting with empty drinks for long periods of time as we try to find our waitress. The last two times we were there (both on a Tuesday evening), we ended up leaving after 20 minutes because the 5 servers that passed our table never stopped to take orders, or even make eye contact. The only time we've been able to be served in a timely manner is if we're sitting at the bar.
