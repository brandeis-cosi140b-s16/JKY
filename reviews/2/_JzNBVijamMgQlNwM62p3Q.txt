FOOD POISONING!!! [ May 18, 2015 ] A friend of mine and I went to Chipotle on Scottsdale Rd/Thomas for lunch. I ordered a bowl with a tortilla on the side, ingredients: chicken, both beans, both rice, sliced peppers, lettuce... basically every ingredient except red chilli and guacamole. My friend ordered everything I did except sour cream and for a protein, he got sofritas instead of chicken. The bowl was okay, not great. There was too much of something, possibly bean juice, that made it slimey and the sour cream was a little warm. Returned to work after we were done eating. For dinner, I had a bowl of cereal, granola w/ corn pops. [ May 19, 2015 ] Woke up at appromiately 1:30am freezing. Covered myself with a thick blanket and was still freezing. In house temperature 77°. Mouth thermometer 101.1°. Symptoms: fever (chills and hot flashes), headache, bloating, upset stomach, diarrhea and nausea. Felt queasy all day, wanted to vomit. [ May 20, 2015 ] Feeling better, a little queasy, some bloating and diarrhea. [ May 21, 2015 (Today) ] Upset stomach and LOTS of diarrhea. Started around 6:00-7:00am. The toilet looks like a crime scene, a location where several turds got slaughtered. [ Comments ] I love Chipotle. I ate at several differenylt locations numerous times 50. This is the first time I've gotten sick eating at one.
