So, I came to visit a friend in Arizona and after a weekend of hearing about this place, we came here for our farewell lunch. Poor decision. 

Perhaps I am just spoiled by Mexican food in my area (and the fact that I am half Mexican and often cook Mexican food at home), but the food was awful. 

Between my husband and myself, we ordered an Enchilada sampler and a Bean & Cheese Burrito - simple right? Apparently getting the food right is not a priority at this place. The green sauce on one of the enchiladas was more of a cream sauce with cheese - seriously disgusting. The bean and cheese burrito obviously used canned beans instead of anything fresh and the tortilla was crispy (not on an awesomely good way either). 

Our server was attentive and the Margarita's were decent (the original is refreshing and good with a meal, the strawberry I could have passed on), which are the only reasons that this place is bumped from a One Star to a Two Star review.

If you are in search of awesome Mexican food, this is NOT it. If you want a super sub par meal with mediocre drinks, head on it.

I will likely not be back, ever...unless it is at my friend's request - even then, it's a maybe.
