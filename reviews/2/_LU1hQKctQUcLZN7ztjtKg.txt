I was so excited to see that this restaurant re-opened... Unfortunately that was short lived :-(  Took our family of 5 there tonight for dinner. Service was very poor, I think we actually offended our waitress by asking for drink refills! Food was was too salty and we all left with stomach aches. The salsa's were good... But they charged 1.89 for about 2 tbsp of mango salsa :-O.  After they nickel and dimed us we left disappointed .. And will not return
