Why am I reviewing Taco Bell? I like this particular Taco Bell because it also is a combined Pizza Hut. 
I like to get pizza on the go when I am in a hurry, so this is pretty convenient for me. What I do not like is that they ALWAYS mess up my order here. I can't even count how many times I've had to walk back into the store and ask for them to fix it. 
One time, they asked me to pull in front of the store to wait for my pizza because it was still baking for about five more minutes. If I wanted to wait for my pizza I wouldn't have come to a FAST food joint. If you don't have it ready, tell met that so I don't have to wait and be late getting back to work. Anyway, I ended up waiting about 10-15 minutes before I walked into the store just to find out that they completely forgot about me. I had already paid and everything! 
I do love that they have Mountain Dew Baja Blast at this location.
