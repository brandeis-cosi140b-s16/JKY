I've eaten here twice now, just to be sure of whether I liked it or not.  I'm sad to say, eh... Not so much.  I tried their carne asada tacos, and the meat was so dry I had to drown it in lime just to get it down.  The enchiladas are a little better, but not much--unless you get the cheese.  

I could live without or without this place, which is such a bummer because it's so close to home for me.
