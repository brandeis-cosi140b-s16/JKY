The silver burrito looks good but has let me down for the final time.

The more I have visited Chipotle over the years the more I realize how lazy they have gotten with their one-item menu. There meat and salsa have become so bland you're almost better cooking your own at home with some marinade.

Many competitors have popped up over the years that are not Mexican food joints but direct "burrito only" type competitors and have given Chopotle a run for their money. While I don't see them going out of business any time soon, they sure need to get their act together. With the recent reveal of almost an entire GMO menu, I have one more reason besides flavor to never return.

Goodbye Chipotle, for good.
