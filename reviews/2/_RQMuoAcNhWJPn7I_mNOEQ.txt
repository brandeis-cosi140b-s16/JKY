I came for dinner for restaurant week and was disappointed.  For such a highly reviewed restaurant, I was surprised how poorly executed some of the dishes were.  

The service staff was polite and attentive but needs more training.  It may seem like a small issue but, at these prices I expect to eat my soup with a soup spoon, not a teaspoon.   I brought it to the attention of the staff, but did not want to seem precious, and did not make a big deal of it. 

The salsas were OK.  The highlight in my opinion was the tomatillo salsa. The arbol lacked heat and the chipotle had a muted taste of something. Perhaps garlic?  Anyway, not my favorite. 

The shrimp gazpacho was good. A solid dish.  Fresh and simple, I enjoyed it. 

The ribeye was a disaster. The meat was overcooked with one side obviously cooked longer than the other.  It seemed that the person minding the grill forgot about it for a couple of minutes then served it anyway. 
The chilaquiles under the meat were too greasy and soggy and did not let the flavor of the meat shine. I think this would have been helped by putting them to one side  and letting the cut of meat speak for itself. That said, I personally thought the meat was under seasoned. 

I was conflicted about the flan. The texture was thicker than I expect from flan. I have had flan many times from many countries and this was the thickest consistency  I have had. Just shy of extra firm tofu. The flavor was good.  Not too sweet... And the berry on the side were a nice touch.   

Decor was beautiful and pleasant. 

All in all though, I would not go back. For $50 on a restaurant week prix fixe I would have expected more from the food. Other dishes may be much better but I would have thought they would have highlighted their stuff for Restaurant week.
