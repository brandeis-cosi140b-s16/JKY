Because of the good yelp reviews, my wife and I decided to try this joint out.  It is just a whole in the wall.  There was no one else inside when we showed up around 7 15 on Saturday night.  I ordered three tacos--chicken, fish, and steak.  My wife ordered chicken enchiladas.  We got it to go and it was ready in about ten minutes.
We got home and were excited to try our food.  Unfortunately everything was under par except the chips and salsa.  The chicken and steak were a little over cooked. Flavors ok, but nothing amazing.  Enchiladas were just ok. The beans tasted like they were from a can.  My tacos were a little bland.  Really, nothing was great.  
I really wanted this place to be great.  I'm always rooting for little places like this...but I cant tell people to go here over Carolina's.  Cheap food and cheap taste.  Maybe other items on the menu are good...but I don't think I'll be going back to see.  Good luck taqueria Los Angeles.
