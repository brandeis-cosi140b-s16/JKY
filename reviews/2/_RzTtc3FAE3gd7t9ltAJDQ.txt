I just paid $24 ($27 with tip) for a bowl of soup, a diet coke, and an order of chips and salsa! The service was good. The soup was a decent portion and tasted good. The chips that came with the salsa were so hard I couldn't chew them without fear of breaking a tooth. When I ordered the chips and salsa, the waitress told me they cost $9, and if they were actually edible I would say OK. However, this was a huge waste money. I even tried soaking the chips in the soup to soften them up, but that didn't really work. I left nearly the entire bowl of chips. I walked out of there feeling totally ripped off. Soup, a soft drink, and hard as hell chips for $24! I won't eat here again. I know its an airport, but that is ridiculous.
