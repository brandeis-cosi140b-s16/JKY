Ok noobs. 

Whoever gave this place a 5 star ratings you guys were probably drunk. Friend and I went there, got seated right away but we waited 20 minutes until the server acknowledged us. We hella devoured that chips and salsa and even memorized the menu in 20 minutes.

Got the nachos and steak tacos. Mehhhhh I'd rather go someplace for that! So not worth the prices of $14 for nachos and $15 for tacos. I had the original margarita, yest that was delicious, but for a $12 drink? Eh. 

On their menu, it says "If you don't like our service, tell us first not Yelp." something like that...well, TOO LATE! For my bottom line here, bad service, over priced food, and good margarita. TWO STARS!
