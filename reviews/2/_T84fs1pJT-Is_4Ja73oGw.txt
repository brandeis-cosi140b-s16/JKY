I think I am going to coin a new term for this type of "mexican" food: WASP-Mex.  It's where restaurants take mexican food and what they think is Mexican decor and put an anglo spin on it. 

I know some people like it and that's ok for them, but for an authentic experience Phoenix and the rest of the valley offer so much more.

When I went I had a green chicken enchilada and taco. The flavor was bland and lacked other seasoning too. The green chiles tasted canned, the corn tortilla was tough, and the taco was greasy.  It was just not good.

I find it sad because Mexican food has so many regional varieties and wonderful types of cuisine to choose from, but this type of restaurant really bastardizes the food and flavors that deserve to be among some of the world's best cuisines.
