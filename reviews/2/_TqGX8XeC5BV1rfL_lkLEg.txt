It wasn't busy for 7pm on a Friday night. It should have been a sign. Waited 10 minutes for our server. We ordered the Cubano Torta and the Rotisserie Chicken Tacos. We waited another 25 minutes for the food to arrive. It was obvious that everything had been sitting for at least 10 minutes. The Cubano was very soggy and didn't just have have mustard on it but was a lot of mustard with a little meat. The tacos were also very soggy and I had to eat them with a fork as the corn tortillas were breaking apart. The flavor was pretty good although the cabbage was a bit too sweet for my liking. The lentils and the rice that came as a side were not at all fresh and dry. We did tell the server that the Cubano was inedible and he gladly took it off the bill. I appreciate that willingness to accommodate a customer. It's a great little space and I was hoping for a lot more.
