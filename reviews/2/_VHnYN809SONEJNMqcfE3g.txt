Chips, bean dip, and salsa was ok. Green burrito, rice and beans were below average. There was no green chili flavor at all - basically it was a brownish, dull flavor. The meat chunks were tough and not fit to eat. The rice and beans tasted a few days old. Margarita was ok, not much alcohol though. I usually go to Rositas which is right across the street - their green burrito (try it smothered in green sauce and cheese) is 100 x's better than Serranos - in fact every thing is better at Rositas. I will head over to the chandler Serranos and try that next time - hopefully they don't bring their food in from the same place as this one.  Honestly I can't believe this place is still in business. Try Rositas instead for some excellent mexican food.
