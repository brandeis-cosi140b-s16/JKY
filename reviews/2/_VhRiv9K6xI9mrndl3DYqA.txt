I was so surprised by how poor this food was.  I know that it was very full that day, but the beans were cold, the burrito sub-par and the price did not match the poor food.

The regular Tia Rosas was much better.  I hope that they straighten this place out as it was a long wait and an unpleasant experience.  For my money I think that Cafe Rio is a better buy if you are looking for Mexican food on Gilbert rd.  

Sorry Tia Rosa's but  two stars is a stretch.
