Been here several times before and it seems to get slower and slower every time I go.  Maybe it's the staff playing with water guns while at work.  I don't much care getting hit by water and neither did my friend.  You see, this hair of mine takes time to straighten, so I don't appreciate getting it wet.
It would also be nice if a server would come around and take an order.  Especially after I have already ordered before.    If my glass is empty, I might want another.
I ordered a vodka with sprite and a beer and it came out to $10.
