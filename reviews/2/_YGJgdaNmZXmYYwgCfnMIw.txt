Apparently, they are cracking down on portions. I noticed right away when the chicken went in the pan. I totally understand controlling costs and for a long time, this location had been overdoing it. That said, this is an overcompensation that feels like a slap in the face! Do the math, increase your prices or negotiate better deals with your suppliers. But never, never serve a product that does not satisfy you customer. I've had bad experiences here before, (mostly due to service, which has improved), but this is the first time the meal was unsatisfactory. Hope it gets better.
