The location is great and the restaurant is gorgeous but just got back from dinner and although I would be back for the chips and salsa and drinks, the rest of the meal was very difficult to enjoy.  This is opening week so I feel a bit bad for this review, but they have several other restaurants and I feel the food should be up to par with the understanding that service would be slower, the waiters might not know the menu as well, etc.   Our waiter was very nice and helpful but the food was freezing cold (it was clear that it had been sitting for awhile because the cheese was hardened onto the cold beans), and my dish, the fish tacos, tasted like an extremely poor quality cod on tortillas that were so mushy I had to eat them with a fork.  However, I couldn't finish them because the taste/food quality was so poor:(  Luckily I had done a decent job of filling up on chips and salsa, which were amazing.
