What a letdown! I always like samples from Abuelo's at Taste of Madison. The restaurant experience was quite disappointing.

Hostess(es): Two women were seating people when we arrived. I watched them as we waited for our table. I never once saw a smile -- in fact, their facial expressions were complete scowls. 

Server: Our server was friendly. He may have simply been a bad server or overwhelmed, but the actual "service" was not there. We left the restaurant quite thirsty since we finished our drinks about halfway through our meal, and our server never refilled them. 

iPad thingy: ***Abuelo's, get the technology off the table!*** I don't want to use a touchscreen device at my table to place my appetizer order and/or "call server." (A button on the screen actually says "call server.") If I'm spending a good hour of my night at a sit-down restaurant, I expect prompt and professional service from a competent human being during my dinner -- not a button. (Does this tech rant make me sound old and out of touch? I'm not even 30.)

Atmosphere: Stucco arches mixed with Victorian-style curtains. Top 40 music on the speaker. What is this theme?

If you're in Madison and want Mexican/Tex-Mex, go to Eldorado Grill.
