Food was okay ... There was never anyone checking on me  to see if I needed anything like a napkin, sauce or a refill of drink ... Restaurant is nice ... Average I would say on this visit ... Nothing special about it .  

The salsa was extremely watery and the Taquitas were very dry ... Can't comment on much more as I never got a chance to order anything else as the waitstaff was non-existent ...

I came I ate I left ... Not bad but lots of room for improvement if I was to come back for more ... I can get (  ignored ) that kinda service at home ... Disappointed
