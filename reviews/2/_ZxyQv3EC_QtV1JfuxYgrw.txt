I wish this wasn't the closest Chipotle to my house. Their biggest problem here is inconsistency. The portions are never the same, you have to keep repeating yourself. 
Sometimes they give you a good scoop of rice, other times you can still clearly see the bottom of the bowl. 

I always get a vegetarian salad, with the vegetarian options Guacamole is included. Countless times when I say I want guac they tell me it's $1.80. Instead of correcting I just say OK with the hopes the cashier is smarter than the salsa girl. 

Countless times there hasn't been any hot sauces put out. None by the soda machine, none on any of the tables. 

We try to avoid this location at all costs, unfortunately it's the closest one to home. I just wish they would train their staff better and be more consistent.
