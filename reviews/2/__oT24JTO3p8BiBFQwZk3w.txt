I took my family to lunch on this past Sunday. We did not order anything special. Although we where seated before the lunch crowd came in we where last to be served. The prices where a little much for what we got. My wife and have been to this location a few times and where pleased with both the service and food. This is the only reason I gave two stars in place of one. We will never return.
