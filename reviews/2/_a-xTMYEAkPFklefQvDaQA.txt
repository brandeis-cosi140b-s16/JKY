Pasquale's seemed worth a try after hearing about Mexican food and their half priced margarita specials. Unfortunately, the food was really nothing special. No one in my party even took any leftovers home.

I love margaritas, but the margaritas were some of the strongest I've ever experienced and not in a good way. For that very reason, I could see how this place would be very popular with students.
