Montezuma's revenge is the lunch special. Wan wah. Eat with caution. While recently visiting the Tres Pesos, service was not ideal; below average with the waitress ignoring most customers while disappearing for most of the time we were there. Too bad--that would at least be worth +1 in star-ratings. Overall the food is not what I would call incredibly delicious or superbly authentic. I am not a Mexican foodie but, at the very least, I believe I know good food when I taste it. This was not the case. I would guess they make most of their money from the lunch crowd--local business execs and other salarymen--looking for a bite to eat between cranking out spreadsheets and inarticulate powerpoint slides.
