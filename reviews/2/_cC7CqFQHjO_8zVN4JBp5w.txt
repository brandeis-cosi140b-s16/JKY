Way overpriced for the quality of the meals.  Paid $180 for 6 people.  Our party of 6 was one of two tables, the rest of the place was empty and the service was sloooowwww.  Mango salsa with the chips was very good.  Only good thing we ate.  Cuatro mole was probably the worst mole I've ever had.  Chicken and beef was way over cooked.  I went here because of the good reviews but don't waste your time or your money.  There are better Mexican restaurants in Pittsburgh.  Definitely wasn't what I expected for the Strip District.  I would have spent the same amount in Lidia's Italian restaurant down the street and had a much better meal.  Live and learn.
