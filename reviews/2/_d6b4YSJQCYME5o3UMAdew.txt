I don't know how anyone could possibly give this place four stars.  Yes, the hot dogs are definitely four star worthy.  But the rest of the food only earns one star.  So, I guess that averages out to about two and a half.  I'll go ahead and round down due to the dirty tables and sketchy parking lot.  And can someone explain to me how they can afford five flat screen TVs just to display the menu but they still serve their food on styrofoam plates with plastic forks?  I don't get it.
