The food is pretty good, but the service is ............ very bad. I ran over around 8:00 pm to get a bean and cheese burrito. It took around 30 minutes to get that order. All of the employees working that night appeard to be under 18. There looked to have been some kind of small fire in the kitchen, but they never came out to say what was going on or any kind of updates on the status of the orders. I was not the only person waiting, another customer was there 40 mins +. With the abundance of mexican restaurants in that area, I doubt I will be back.
