I was not impressed but my husband liked it more.  We went for Cinco de Mayo so it was busy. I noticed their happy hour ends at five.  Am I the only one who thinks that is weird? The tacos were ok but over all not really worth the price.  Drinks were decent.  The decor and atmosphere were great but there were a large amount of flies.  I think there would have been less trouble with flies if we ate outside.  I might give it another try but maybe just a drink and app but there are better places nearby.
