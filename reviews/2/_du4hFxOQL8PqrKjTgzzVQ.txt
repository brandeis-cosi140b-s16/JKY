This is Americanized Mexican food. You are much better off going to a dime a dozen Mexican restaurant served by real Mexicans.  They are much cheaper and taste far better. Our waiter was enthusiastic but not very helpful. When I asked for recommendations, he pointed to every picture on the menu. Uh, that doesn't tell me anything. I ordered the chimichanga and my sister got the charcoal chicken.  She said the black beans were good.  We got the guacamole appetizer.  My sister thought it was made table side, but this ain't that type of spot. The guacamole was OK, but the flour tortilla chips that came with it were terrible. They were doughy and needed to be cooked longer.  The only half decent thing was the margarita. For almost $10, it is a large drink.  It would be the only thing I'd ever order again but I don't ever plan to return. The waiter and the manager (?) came by the table and asked, "The food was good??". I said it was alright but they didn't really care if I enjoyed the food or not anyway.  There were some folks there and some seemed to be regulars so I guess they have a market. But for this first-timer, it is a last-timer for me. Bottom line: you can get much better food for a lot less money (well under the $25 I paid).
