I wish that I could give more stars, but I can't at this point. When they are on, they are the best El Pollo in Vegas, but when they aren't, it's pretty bad. Messed up orders, food is not good, and the employees have issues. It's almost like 2 different restaurants. When they are good, the entire experience is good. When they are bad, it is entirely the opposite. Hope they can find the magic of when they are good and keep it.
