I swear, I hear about this place all the time and I'm not sure why. 


The ambiance is that of an old dive bar, which I don't mind, but nothing special. I felt the service was pretty good, although people were slightly confused by who's tab is who's. 

The drinks were good and the selection of draft beers was small, but they have some good choices.

Oh my, now the food.... It was not impressive. My chicken tasted like it had been cooked while still frozen, it almost has no flavor and an undesirable texture that made it impossible for me to eat. I also tried the scallops and they were yummy, but I think scallops usually are, unless you over or under cook them. 

Overall not super impressed. Also, let me just add that walking through the kitchen to the bathroom is just not appetizing to me...probably won't be back.
