I'm a huge foodie so I guess I'm a pretty tough critic, but this place just missed the mark for me.  I saw it was listed 3rd best new restaurant in Phoenix magazine so I decided to try it. The restaurant itself is beautiful. Good atmosphere.  The service was just ok.  The food was very interesting, but the flavors were just not there. The edamame was charred and had a very burnt flavor, which I guess is what they were going for.  Would not order it again.  I had just had Mexican street corn the other day at Taco Gulde, and it was way better than sumomayas. I got the chile garlic crab noodles.  All I could taste was chile oil and a burnt flavor again. Not good at all.   I work at one of the best sushi restaurants in Scottsdale, so I didn't even bother trying the sushi. TOYAMA restaurant= best sushi in the valley. Hidden gem.   We heard the table next to us rave about the tres leches cake so we decided to get it. One of the worst tres leches I've ever had.  Gooey marshmallow on top of the cake, with chewy old tasting chocolate rice Krispy treats, in a nasty condensed milk/tapioca flavored sauce.  Whoever came up with this dessert has the palate of a 10 year old.  Not very sophisticated flavors. Will not be returning.  You want good Mexican food, go to the Mission in old town Scottsdale, or the barrio cafe in Phoenix. You want good Asian food, come visit me at Toyama. You want the worst of both worlds, go to sumomaya.
