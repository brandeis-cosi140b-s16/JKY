Good taste, small portions. The chips were just small flour tortillas cut in half and fried, and were very thick and tasteless. I was missing the thinner, more traditional chips that are usually found in Mexican restaurants. The salsa was wonderful, though. I appreciated the vegetarian options and enjoyed my three street tacos. Rice and beans were not automatically served with the entrees. I had to pay $3 extra for a very small (but tasty) dish of black beans on the side.
