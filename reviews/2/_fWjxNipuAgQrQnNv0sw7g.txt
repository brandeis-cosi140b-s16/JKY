The quick and easy breakfast burrito (that I'm accustomed to getting at the old location) was anything but that yesterday morning when I went here to grab 4 burritos for co-workers and I.

It should have been a sign telling me to leave when I walked in and a woman was upset because she called in her order 20 mins prior and when she arrived they had not started it yet even though she was told on the phone it would be 10-15 mins.

Considering I was ordering for more than myself (didn't want to disappoint friends when they thought they were getting La Canasta and I showed up with a breakfast jack instead), I stayed.  

25+mins later my order was called out and I asked if I could have hot sauce please.  I was then told "they in there" so of course I looked and I found 2 small containers...for 4 burritos.  I'm close with my co-workers but not that close that we need to share 2 hot sauces for 4 burritos.  When I asked for me she told they charged for extra and then gave me two more (which I did not and would not have paid for).

I would give this a 1 star, but nonetheless...the food is still decent.
