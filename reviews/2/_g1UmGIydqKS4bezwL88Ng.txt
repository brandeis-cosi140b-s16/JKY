I've been wanting to try this place since it opened! The atmosphere looked really cool and I like the Dia de Los Muertos theme throughout the restaurant. Unfortunately I was very disappointed. Ordered the Elote appetizer, which that I loved! I got the carnitas and a friend ordered the chilaquiles. For a big skillet I only got 3 tortillas which left me eating the rest with a fork, they were much drier than what I'm used to and the rice and beans tasted like they were cooked straight from a box. The chilaquiles....paying the price we did for basically a plate full of chips lightly covered in salsa. Have I mentioned how pricey this place is?! I could have gone anywhere else and paid half the price for much better meals. At least now I know I paid $55 for an atmosphere and not the food. Will I go back? No.
