The only reason I am giving two stars instead of one is that my husband ate at their and said his was good.  I, however, was unable to eat my Togo order. The food was cold and the carnitas meat was so crispy I couldn't bite through it.  I reached out to management and we were offered a $20 gift card to come again. I declined it since we are from out of state and we're here while our child was in the hospital.  Lesson learned? Eat at the hospital.  It is fresher and much tastier.
