This makes me sad to have to write this one.  This second location in Fountain Hills seems to not be consistently providing quality recently.  I got my favorite El Diablo Shrimp Burrito.  Normally they are huge and loaded with shrimp and lots of rice and sauce.  Two weeks ago, there was barely any filling at all.  It was mostly eating a tortilla.  Ok, one off day - no big deal.  Went in a week later and ordered it again.  It was burned.  Filling volume was better, but it looked all dark spotted inside and just didn't taste right.  And the bag of chips I bought was stale.  The main reason to have to write the review is what was seen while waiting for the takeout order. The woman making a margarita for a dine in guest stuck her bare, unwashed hand deep into the lime bin on the customer salsa bar, touching numerous lime wedges on the salsa bar to grab one to use in making the drink.  She didn't use the tongs that were present there in the container, but stuck her bare hand down in it.  I hope the manager of this location revisits food safety and procedures with staff as well as need for consistent quality of items going out the door.  Please get the quality, consistency and cleanliness back to where it should be...I want to LOVE Senior Taco again and specifically this location...
