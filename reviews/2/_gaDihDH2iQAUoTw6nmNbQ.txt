We entered as a party of 5 and the hostess did not greet us nor ask anything else as she displayed a clueless stare.  As I got her attention I advised that we would need a table for 5 outside. It was a glorious afternoon in Madison.  We were seated on the patio and found a dirty wood slat table that they cleared while we waited. As we were invited to be seated, the entire party noted old  food smeared on the floor  beneath  the table from the previous party.
  Servers were pleasant but not very attentive to much but bring out the food and quickly collecting their tips from the 3 other dirty tables they were clearing while we awaited service. BTW, our order arrived hot and pleasing. Tasted okay. I asked for some ketchup and then waited quite a while..... .then a while longer...... ...and then completed eating half the burger before the server returned and then scampered off to "find" some ketchup.  I'm a big fan of refills on the soda and  server wasn't to keen on my empty glass or others at the table that needed more iced tea.  We were visiting the UWM campus and will return next month, but won't be back to Pasqual's at Hilldale Mall.
