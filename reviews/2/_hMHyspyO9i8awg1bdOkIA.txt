I been to the location over by the airport one night with some co-wokers, seems like that location taste much better than the one here over in the SW on Durango. The service wasn't soo great, the dish i ordered wasn't as nearly satifying as it was over off Sunset, i think that's the street. I won't ever come back to this Durango location, maybe i'll go back to the other place, maybe.
