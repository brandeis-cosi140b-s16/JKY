Review is based on a lunch, not the alcohol as I didn't have any.

Initial impression was that the service was slow during lunch.  I ordered the Tortilla Soup and Taco Sampler.

The soup is a bowl and not a cup.  It has a lot of chicken so you can have it alone for lunch and be full.  The flavor is not impressive but it's still good.  El Torito soup is much better than this.

All three tacos in the sampler were dry and that sucked.  The flavors were weak.  The rice was properly done but the black beans were bland.

All in all, better to just go to a Chipotle for *much much* better tacos.  Also a *good* El Torito location will also blow this place out of the water.

Won't be eating here again.
