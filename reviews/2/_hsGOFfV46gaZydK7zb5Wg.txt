Got a to go order there about 45 minutes before they closed. Had never eaten there but drive by it a lot. Got the 2 battered fish tacos and 2 carne asada tacos. Took about 20 minutes for a to go order and they weren't busy. 

I went straight home but found that the food wasn't warm. After biting in, I realized I probably should have heated it up. Not bad but not very flavorful. Overall ok and I'm not going to turn down tacos. They also forgot my side that was supposed to come with the meal. There is another taco chop nearby that I'm sticking with.  I will give them 5 stars for their churros though. I'm really picky about churros and these were great. 

I tried it which was my goal but I don't really see myself returning.
