Came in here during my lunch break. Yelp has pretty average reviews and it was close to work. I got greeted very fast and sat decided to sit at the bar. Right away I noticed it was very dark and 70s music playing not quit what I was expecting from a Mexican restaurant. 

Got the rolled tacos and within minutes got my food. Pretty fast which makes me think the food was sitting there, but i could be wrong. Overall was descent: tacos were good, beans ok, and rice was very dry. 

My waitress kept sitting down by the bar and had to ask another waitress for extra food.
