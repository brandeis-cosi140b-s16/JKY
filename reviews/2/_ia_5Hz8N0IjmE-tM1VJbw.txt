Food is great, service is a joke... I've been going here for about 7 or so years and I must say... The service has seriously gone down hill.. I know it is family owned but I think the owner needs to have a chat with his staff.. I took my kids in there and saw they had a kids size bean burrito.. Asked if I could get a breakfast burrito that size and was made to feel stupid by the larger employee who worked there.. He looked at me as if I was speaking a different language, he could have been polite with his answer, but no, he was rude!  They also have an issue with being lazy, open at 8:00 am on Saturday is fine, but be open at 8:00am and not pick and hang up the phone twice! It's sad because I've met the owner and he is nice and the food is pretty decent, but I'm gonna have to take my weekly burrito orders somewhere else :(
