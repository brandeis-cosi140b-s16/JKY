So the gf really wanted to try this place after a little over a week we finally found ourselves here. Long story short it did not live up to the anticipation and hype and we were both unsatisfied with both the service and the food. The staff was a pretty rude besides maybe one person who helped us. I understand trying to work fast but your job is still to provide quality service. The line servers and cashier had a ok bye demeanor like you were a bother to them. One worker was really nice and walked around with a smile. I asked her if she could fix one of the drink machines and she took care of it happily. As for the food it was nothing special what do ever. You make your own tortillas cool, the difference in taste wasn't that big of a difference. Might be because the sugar burrito I ordered (the sweet pork barbacoa). I love sweet food but the barbacoa burrito tasted like straight sugar. I had to drench the second half in hot sauce just to balance out the taste a little. The steak burrito was mediocre definitely not worth $9. We both had to eat our burritos with a knife and fork because one the burritos weren't rolled good and they were soggy. Idk about you but I hate a messy put together burrito. I'm not a chipotle guy but I would def go with chipotle over these guys. Won't be coming back here there's too many better options I wouldn't even suggest it just to try.
