I went to this Roberto's this morning for a breakfast burrito, as I've been to other locations and had good experiences.  This one was different, however.  When I walked in the single employee working there was not friendly at all...almost seemed like I was bothering/inconveniencing him by coming in.  I asked what was in the breakfast burrito, and the employee stated "egg, cheese, bacon, tomato, etc...".  I asked if they have a ham, cheese and egg burrito because I don't like bacon, and he said "yes".  I then went ahead and ordered the ham, cheese and egg burrito, and asked for it 'to go'.  When I got to work and opened up the burrito, sure enough it was the original breakfast burrito with bacon.  Maybe its just me but I really look forward to a good breakfast burrito sometimes, and it was really a bummer to have to throw this thing out.

I may go back to other Roberto's locations, but I was not impressed with this one and won't be back.
