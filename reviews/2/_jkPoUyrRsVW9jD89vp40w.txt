In fairness, I only tried the house margarita, chips and salsa, and the tortilla soup.  The rather plain location along with some of the glowing yelp reviews, wants one to like it (root for the underdog), and I certainly entered the door with that attitude.  the staff was unpretentious, as was the inside decor.  the chips and salsa, standard fair; the margarita, was ok, more in size than taste, but i've certainly tasted worse.  the tortilla soup was served in a large bowl, plenty of grilled chicken to be seen, but can't honesty say that if I was ill, I'd be calling out for my loved ones to go get me a bowl to make me feel better.  would i order it again, nope.

so like so many restaurants, i wanted to really like this one, and maybe i didn't give it a fair swirl given my limited order, but i'm unlikely to give it a second chance.

sorry fellow yelpers.
