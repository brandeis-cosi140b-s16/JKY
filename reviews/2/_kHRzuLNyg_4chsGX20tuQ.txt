Let's start by talking about what I DID NOT have....carnitas, lengua, cabeza, Al pastor. ....they don't offer any if those! Only chicken, Carne asada or fish. This is Phoenix and you don't offer anything except those 3 for tacos or burritos? With all the taco and burrito options in this town, chicos falls on their face with very limited options. as for what I did have, the carne asada burrito was not very good. I specifically asked if there was rice in it they said yes but there wasnt any. The meat was just okay nothing stands out. don't waste your time here. There are way too many other options close by that are awesome.
