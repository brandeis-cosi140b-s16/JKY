I have always been pretty satisfied with these wanna be Chipotle's. Been to a lot of different Qdoba's and the food and service has been  consistently solid.

Until I spent half an hour at this place. 

I was one of only 3 customers to come in the whole time. When I walked in both female employees were sitting at one of the tables and chit chatting. They didn't look happy that I walked into their empty restaurant and interrupted their conversation. 

One of the girls got up and dragged herself to the counter to see what I wanted. Told her chicken ancho burrito. After she heats up the tortilla she asks me if I want chicken or pork. Not a big deal, but try and pay attention, I know you are extremely busy and all. 

When I pay I ask why they are so slow. She says they have been slow all day. Whatever. Get my drink and there's trash at the beverage counter, there's 3 empty napkin holders, trash on the floor, and 4 tables with trash on them. 

You would think if they were slow all day the place would be spotless. As I sit there eating my (actually quite tasty) burrito the girls head back to their table and keep on yapping. Fail!

You barely get the 2 stars because the burrito was good.
