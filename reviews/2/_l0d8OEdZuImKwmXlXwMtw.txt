My third time getting take-out from there and getting screwed on the guac I ordered. I called and spoke to the manager and was offered a free appetizer next time I came in. Nonsense... what incentive is that... to spend more money someplace that has already screwed me 3 times. The food s good... but there is better out there in this town that delivers and gets their orders correct every time. Thought I'd give them another chance and they BLEW it. How hard can it be to put a side of guac in a bag when you're not even busy? C'mon!?!
