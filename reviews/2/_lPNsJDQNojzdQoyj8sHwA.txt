As a local! I love Pepes Tacos! Food IS great however u notice its inconsistency...not only do they charge you for sour cream and avocado which IS normal Now days but its seems as though more often than not they forget to put it on...after a while it adds up...tried complaining to someone but all they do IS say sorry and STILL forget to put it on...as a more than once a week customer I may be saying goodbye to this place and going back to Tacos MÃ©xico...dissapointed..Just left and again payes for a dry sourcreamless taco...even though i paid extra!
