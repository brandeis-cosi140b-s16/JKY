Meh...

I've been here a few times. That said...

When was this place built? I'm pretty sure the furniture is original... Check out the bar. What? I remember when TV's looked like that! 

The food os OK. Tiny little menu with only a few things to choose from. It is decorated like a Mexican restaurant. Maybe I missed something here but my opinion is that this place is like stepping into a time machine and being transported to outdated.
