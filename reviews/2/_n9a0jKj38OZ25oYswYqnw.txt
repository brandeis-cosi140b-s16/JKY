I came here for the micheladas.. They were good but the service not so much.. The waitress didn't speak very good English, so my mom ordered her food in Spanish.. She wanted a red Chile enchilada with a shredded beef taco, and beans, no rice.. Her order came with a green chile enchilada, a chicken taco, and rice and beans. She told the waitress And asked for her correct meal to go.. She got the same exact order that she ordered in the first place.  So I will give them two stars because of the micheladas.
