We came here on Sunday to grab a quick bite to eat after a long drive back from the beach. It was a great expereince but not a horrible one either.

Decked out in our Luke Kuechly jerseys, we decided to grab a seat at the bar to watch the Panthers game (yes, we won!!). The game was on a basic channel but the waitress (after 30 seconds of trying) gave up finding it for us and just handed the remote to my husband. I recognize this isn't a sports bar but there were like 15 tvs in this place all on ridiculous channels and we are the home to the Panthers! About 15 people started watching and cheering the second we turned the game on!

We ordered two beers. Didn't realize that when we ordered the bigger size, it would be a full 32 oz of beer. Not really complaining here cause both my husband and I love some beer and finished them. Just know the big beer is definitely big. Had to ask for limes for Dos Equis and Modelo. Pretty bare minimum service from the bartender.

Chips and salsa came out. Salsa had flavor but was super watery. We also got the queso with bean dip. Huge portion. Just ok. It was crazy crazy thick. I think i could have turned it upside down for 20 minutes and it wouldnt have moved. The beans dilluted the queso some, which made it a bit tastier.

We split the shrimp burrito, which came with rice and beans. Definitely a big enough portion for two. The burrito wasnt particularly good though. Kinda an odd mix of flavors and the shrimp were the baby kind. Not the best quality but the burrito was like $10 so guess I can't really blame them. 

Took us a while to finish those beers after we ate but we had the game on and met a few people! Even though this place is close to our house, we most likely will not return.
