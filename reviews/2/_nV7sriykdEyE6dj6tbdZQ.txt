I eat out a lot and frequent Mexican restaurants. This is the first time I ever ate at on the border. First off the salsa was a bit too hot to be served to the general public without letting you know that it was hot. Moving on I ordered the stuffed jalapenos they were stuffed with cheese and chicken and then deep fried with a tempura batter. The presentation looks great but when I bit into one it was absolutely unedible because of the heat index. They should warn you on the menu that this is a very hot item. After eating only one of the six I found it to be too excruciating to even finish it was like having acid in my mouth. My mouth continue to burn for almost 30 minutes for sodas later and two glasses of water I was barely able to eat my main course meal. The manager so grateful I removed it from my bill because I only ate one of the pieces and he asked if I wouldn't like to take it home to give it to somebody that I know. I stated I wouldn't wish this upon my enemies it was way too hot. The fajitas that I ordered with a trio of meat shrimp beef chicken and it tasted OK but was not worth the $17. Please remember I have eaten at all the Hispanic restaurants within the area and all of them have been much more satisfactory than this one especially for the price.  I must say my waiter was very accommodating and very apologetic for the issue and I left him a good tip for his service. But I can only give a 2 star rating for on the border considering the cost versus the quality of the food
