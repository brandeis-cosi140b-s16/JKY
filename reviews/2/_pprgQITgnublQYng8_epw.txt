I was excited to try this place out. I got out early from work before noon and decided to check them out one more time. And ta-dahh! They are still in business. Lol. I was mainly excited to try their crepe, i got the banana cream cheese crepe, I also ordered two burritos, lengua and asada. I appreciate the size of the food for its price, but not the taste... :( Waste of money!! 

The place itself is clean and very spacious! There were only 2 employees, 1 in the kitchen and 1 lady takes the orders and cleans the tables. I waited about 25 mins for my order, I didn't mind since I wasn't in a hurry..

The burritos consist of meat, rice, and beans only. I asked the lady if the guacamole is an extra charge, she said they ran out of guacamole... I was like, WHAT?! How can you serve burritos and tacos without having guacamole?! :( And it was only noon! Too early to be running out of stuff! Lol

The crepe? It was ok. Ive tasted better! When it said on the menu, Mexican with a French twist, I said to myself this should be good! But nah. Id stick with Robertos across the street, and Ihop for crepes, which is on the same shopping center, just to satisfy my cravings.
