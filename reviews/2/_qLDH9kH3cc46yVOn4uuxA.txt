so after driving around south phoenix for an hour on a sunday, in search of an open mexican dive joint to get a breakfast burrito, and extremely hungover and tired, i somehow ended up at fili b's.

they serve breakfast all day, which is quite an amazing thing.

i think that if i hadn't had spent so long searching for a joint that was open and starvingly had to stop here before hunger completely overwhelmed me, i would have just gone to a more familiar mexican drive-thru, like the one at 5th ave and camelback, or 40th st and indian - all which serve some pretty dank breakfast burritos.

but i ended up here, and the food was meh. it didn't really hit the spot like i was hoping it would have. too much cheese and the bacon wasn't cooked long enough and was fatty. my friends got chorizo burritos which were bland and extremely greasy. i usually try to avoid fili's and go to one of the sister/knockoff joints like rollbertos, eribertos, armandos, etc.
