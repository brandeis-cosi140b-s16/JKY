My friend and I went here for lunch yesterday (on Cinco De Mayo), and we were surprisingly seated right away. The restaurant was very clean, as was the table we were seated at. Our chips, salsa, and bean dip was delivered to our table as soon as we sat down as well. 

Our server was less than friendly, and he didn't even introduce himself... He seemed more concerned with being efficient than being polite. Don't get me wrong, efficiency is a great trait, but some resemblance of people skills would have been nice too. Throughout our meal, he checked on us maybe once, and that was because my friend and I were both out of drinks (and had been for a while).
I got the 2 option lunch plate with a chicken enchilada and a shredded beef taco, and an iced tea. The enchilada was really good and so was the taco, but because of the service, the experience was just mediocre. 


We waited for ages for our check to come, and even then our server didn't ask if we wanted dessert (which my friend did) or how we wanted our check (separately). So, we ended up having to wait for her dessert to be made and then wait again for our correct check. 

I don't think I will be returning in the near future... At least not to this location.
