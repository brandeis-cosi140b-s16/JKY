My friend and I were seated right away. Decor is very "Nacho Libre"-like. Staff very friendly. It wasn't crowded since we ended up eating a late lunch. We both ordered the 2 tacos for $8 deal. Both fish. Like with the some of the other reviewers, I was expecting a tiny nugget of fish in my tacos and BOOM that's what we got. It was no more than 2" long encased in two really dry corn tortillas about 6" in diameter. The fish nugget was hidden in a 2" pile of thick shredded lettuce. 10% fish, 75% lettuce and 20% very dry corn tortillas. Just plain awful. I ended up picking through it and barely could finish it. Very bland. Nothing to hoot and holler. I guess this place would be good after a late night out of the town. But if you're better off saving your $ finding a taco truck for more bang.
