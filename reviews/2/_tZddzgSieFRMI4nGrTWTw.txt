So I had Macayo's the other day...I ate the carne asada burro....with a CRAPLOAD of jalepenos...well 1st thing they charged me $1 for extra jalepenos....LAME! im eating mexican food, i expect it to be spicy! the burro had cheese sauce like stuff in it (i was not a fan) im from southern california...im used to AMAZING mexican food so maybe im biased...but yea not going back anytime soon. at least the service was friendly....but not too speedy- and it wasnt even lunch rush time!
