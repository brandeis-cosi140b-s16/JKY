I came here once, after being remodeled and not being called "el Nuevo taquito" anymore. The cashier was SOO rude. Her attitude seems like she hates her job and doesn't want to be there. Customer service is everything. And since I didn't have a good customer service, at that point the food doesn't really matter. You can have the best food but with the worst customer service, it's worthless.
