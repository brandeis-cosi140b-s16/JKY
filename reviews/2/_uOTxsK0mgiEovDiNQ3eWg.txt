The food was okay, but worst service EVER. I have never felt compelled to write a yelp review before, but it was such a bad experience I felt I needed to share. We were passing through town on our way home from the pirates game and wanted to try something new, and we love mexican so went out of our way to come to mad mex. My boyfriend had been to the one in robinson twp and said it was really good. It took forever for our server to come, and we he did, he acted as though we needed to hurry if we wanted anything. As he took our order, I had a few questions as we ordered because I had never been to a mad mex, and he seemed annoyed and kept looking away at his other tables as we told him what we wanted. Slow for everything, and I felt like it was an inconvenience to even ask for a drink refill. Even when he brought my togo box, we had our payment ready he told us he would be back to take it. Like if you're at our table, why can't you just take my card with you? What if we were in a hurry? I have been a server and I would never say that to a table, and I have never experienced this at a restaurant before. I get you have to do other things, but as a server you should be able to multitask. My boyfriend kept apologizing that he suggested going here because it was such a disappointment. I would maybe try a different mad mex location, but I wouldn't plan to go back to this one.
