I saw on Google reviews, that out of 36, this restaurant received 3 stars, so I figured it was safe to try.
we were seated immediately
got drinks & chips within just a few min (chips were good & fresh-salsa was weird, had an extraordinary amount of cumin, but ok-spicy after half a bowl)
our server greeted us &  gave us a few minutes to look over the menu, he didn't recommend anything or mention any specials, which was ok with me.
I asked him how popular the fish tacos were, he stated that a lot of people order them-which, in retrospect I should have asked if people LIKED them??!!
so we order the fried avocado appetizer & I ordered a cup of tortilla soup, 

appetizer (fried avocado ) takes about ten minutes to get to us, but , alas, no soup. we finish the app & first basket of chips, twenty minutes goes by - NO SOUP, guess what?? entrees hit the table after 30 min elapsed....we ask the back waiter - wheres the soup??? his blank stare says it all - i tell him cancel the soup

I ordered the 3 fish tacos - my wife orders the fajita chicken salad, my son gets teh shredded beef burrito

to sum up - Son's burrito, ok ok, temp ok, but shredded beef had a not normal flavor, not bad, just weird

chicken fajita salad...platter was barely sizzling at arrival, but that's ok, chicken was very tasty, but the contents of the salad were pretty dismal in my opinion, and the dressing, im pretty sure was Ken's ranch, otherwise a lower quality ranch dressing

fish tacos - ** note to restaurant** A fish taco is supposed to be CRISPY, so taco items should be served on SIDE, if you put all the meaningless crap on the fish taco , IT MAKES IT SOGGY!!!!

server could see we were not enjoying meal but made no effort to even engage us to ask any questions

the restaurant was busy, but I could tell the servers, all of them, were relatively new, none of them looked like they had a clue. i saw our waiter forget things, from other tables, see the dumbfounded look on his face & watched him turn around to retrieve whatever it was he forgot at least 5 times in the course of our meal

there are so many good restaurants in this town, it makes this bold face crapheap of a food establishment, look like the dismal failure that it was
wont be back, telling all my friends, STAY AWAY
