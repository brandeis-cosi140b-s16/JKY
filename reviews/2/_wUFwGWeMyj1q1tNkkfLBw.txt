Great Margaritas.

But it's hard to review a mexican restaurant that's as good as the next.

I still wish there was a TRULY good mexican restaurant in Madison...

Still waiting.

And don't come tell me ... um... the one on Park.. what's that name???

....

La Hacienda.

I'd rather poke my eye out or eat at La Bambas....
