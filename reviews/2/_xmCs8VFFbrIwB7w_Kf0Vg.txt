My wife, myself, and my wife's mother visited the cantina while in Las Vegas for a conference. We noticed there was a restraint.com coupon and decided to give it a try. The server was great and drinks were never empty. The mariachi band was funny and very entertaining. 

The reason for the low review is the food was very lack luster for the price. My wife's fajitas came out sizzling like they should but they just kept burning her vegetables to the point that they were black. Her mothers sizzled and then cooled down as they should. I ordered their burger and I ordered it medium rare and it came out well. Finally I ordered a bud light lime and I was served a bud light with limes in it. 

Upon leaving and after we paid I notified the manager and he said it would he would look into it. 

Overall we won't be back.

First review on yelp, hope this helps!
