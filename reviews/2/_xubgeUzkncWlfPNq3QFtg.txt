Look, the food was fabulous. Very very good. The atmosphere was extremely off-putting with LOUD club music blaring throughout the restaurant so we had to shout to communicate with dinner companions. Would NEVER go back because of this. If I want a club, I'll go to a club. Turn down the ridiculous music and embrace the fact that you run an excellent eatery.
