Tell me why when I'm hungover or still relatively drunk and woke up too early, a burrito just seems to be what I need?  AND why is airport food so damn expensive?  ESPECIALLY when it's not good.  I know now why as I was waiting for my flight back to SF, I saw so many people just settle with Burger King.  Smart people.  

I should have followed what these people were doing, but nope, went and ordered me a "homewrecker" (nice name...not)  but it was just a regular burrito with suprisingly sour cream AND guacamole.  And for about $11 bucks, which I guess isn't bad too.  To be honest, I came here because I thought I'd get full for the amount I spent.  And so I did.   

But there was something funky about this burrito.  The meat, which I got was steak, but it tasted sour.  I'm hoping it was lime juice or something that they cooked it with because it didn't seem very appetizing.  
Secondly, they got a new batch of guacamole, and believe me, I absolutely LOVE guacamole, but I wouldn't be over doing it for a burrito.  It needs just the right amount.  BUT instead, when I got my burrito I could feel the center being cold because there was so much in there.  And worst of all, the guacamole I got was turning brown.  ANd yes I know that's what happens when guacamole is left out for a long time, and it means its fresh, but pleasE, don't let me see that.   

Overall, its nothing great, just a good price for expensive food in the airports now.
