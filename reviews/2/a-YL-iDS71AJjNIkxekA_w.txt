Vitamin T is in my building, so I decided to give it a try for lunch today.  I was very unimpressed.  I ordered three streets tacos for $7.  I realize street tacos are small by nature, but these were smaller than what I have experienced at other restaurants.  I ordered the Barbacoa, Chicken and Pilbil tacos.  The tacos were all smashed together in a foil wrapper so that when opened, the ingredients the three tacos were all over each other and very messy.  The Pibil pork was a little tough and without taste -- the pickled onions did not mix well with the pork.  The Barbacoa was okay -- if I had to choose a favorite, this would probably be mine.  The Chicken was okay once I added some green salsa to it for flavor. The meat/chicken in all three tacos was skimpy.  I was disappointed with the use of flour over the traditional corn tortillas, plus the tortillas reminded me of cheap store-bought tortillas.  My friend ordered chips and salsa for $3 -- this was a tragedy.  The small portion of chips were clearly store bought (and bad ones at that...), and the salsa portion of the order is whatever you select yourself from the do-it-yourself salsa bar, which, by the way needed restocking -- a couple of the salsa containers had next to nothing in them.  The service was quick, and the staff was very cordial.
