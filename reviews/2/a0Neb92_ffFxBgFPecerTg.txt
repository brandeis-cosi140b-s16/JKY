When we arrived we sat ourselves it was pretty busy on the patio. We were there for a birthday celebration. The service was terrible we had to walk up to the bar to order drinks and flag down a waitress to give us menus to take our food order 45 minutes later. Lemon drop shot tasted nasty for 7.00 wasnt worth the tsp of liquor in the huge shot glass. We then tried amf's ( 8.00) while the first round was good the 2nd and  3rd were too sweet and didnt taste like the first. My friend asked if the bartender could re make her drink and the bar tender manager that was making the drinks i believe her name is miranda got rude and upset. Said shes remade the drink 3 times and that we had 30 minutes to finish what drinks we had. What she didnt know is the drinks were for individual people but didnt bother to ask. And had a bouncer of a bar come and stand by our tables and watch the clock till our time ran out to make sure we would leave. When sitting there with a group of people for 3+ hours and then asking why the drink is now tasting too sweet and not like the first ones you ordered and being asked to leave obviously your customer is never right. While we were told to take up our complaint with manager joey of the store we decided it wasnt worth our time as we will find a new place to celebrate with our family and friends on birthday occasions and take our money elsewhere. My advice for the cost of drinks and the not so awesome service go someplace else.
