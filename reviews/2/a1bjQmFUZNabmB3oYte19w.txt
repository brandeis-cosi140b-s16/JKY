I usually love Morenos in chandler!! I went to gilbert location this morning. I had con queso and chips that were good. Then, I had  the shrimp /mango quesadilla. Not only did this meal not have all ingredients the menu said it had, the shrimp tails still had poop in them and the first bite tasted like San Pedro wharf!! The tortilla was so soggy!! What a disappointment. Had the coupon in the mail so my whole family was excited to go. Would def never order shrimp or this dish ever again.
