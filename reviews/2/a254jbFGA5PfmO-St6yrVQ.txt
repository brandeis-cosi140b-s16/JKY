There was nothing remarkable about this place.  We went on a Saturday night and it was DEAD.  We were running late so we called and asked if they could hold our reservations for 30 minutes.  The hostess said that they were packed and they could only hold it for 10 minutes.  We rushed from our hotel, only to find that the place was dead! There was plenty of seating indoors and outdoors.  Our server was nice, but the service was slow.  The food was average.  From what I hear, the Pink Taco in LA is much better and tons of fun.
