I will admit, I have no idea what "New Mexican" food is and after eating at Carlsbad Tavern, I still have no idea how the style differs from typical Americanized Mexican food. I should also add, one of my main motivations for eating here was because Phoenix magazine named the Carne Adovada one of the top 50 dishes in the valley. -- I hope this isn't really one of the top 50 dishes in the area. 

The decor was nice and the service was good. My margarita had very little flavor and although I knew what I was going to order, I thought the menu was too long and a little kitchy. 

So when the Carne Adovada came I was expecting some flavor and spice...not spicy at all. And as far as flavor goes, it wasn't offensive by any means, but it really lacked a distinctive flavor that would set it apart from Chef Boy-R-Dee "New Mexican" food.
