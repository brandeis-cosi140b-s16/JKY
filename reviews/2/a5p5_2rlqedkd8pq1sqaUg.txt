Met some friends for dinner Sat night. It was totally empty in here for a Saturday evening but the friends we dined with have eaten here before and had good things to say. 
I ordered a glass of wine and my husband tried a spicy jalapeno margarita mixed drink. Not bad. The chips and salsa they bring to the table include three salsas (one is a more a traditional salsa, one is a bean dip, and the other more of a creamy verde sauce).
Our server told us the fish tacos appetizer was excellent so we ordered those. I ordered the shrimp diablo and my husband ordered the seafood stew in a creamy sauce. 
The fish tacos were just ok. They weren't "excellent", I've had far better fish tacos, although I did like the mango-jalapeno salsa that came on the side. My entree was VERY spicy, fitting with the name and came with black beans and I decided to try the lemon-cilantro rice which was pretty good. I don't think it was worth $24 though. Highly overpriced for such a simple meal of a few shrimp with rice and beans. 

My husbands meal tasted good, but he said it was more reminiscent of Italian flavors, and nothing really Mexican about it other than his sides of black beans and Spanish rice. One of our friends ordered a pasta dish with a cream sauce he loved previously, and was disappointed when it came out with spaghetti style pasta vs the linguine he'd had before. 
Although our server was friendly, she was scarce. We waited and waited, even for our drinks. After she took our drink order she apologized for the wait as she said the bartender was MIA all of a sudden. 
Even our friends who had better experiences here said this evening was lackluster at best. I just think it was also overpriced for what it was. 
As a side note, I was expecting a huge tequila menu and was excited to try a few, but their drink menu just included wines and specialty mixed drinks. I'm sure they have tequila at the bar, but I guess I was expecting it to be featured more.
