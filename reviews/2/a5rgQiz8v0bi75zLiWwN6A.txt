I've eaten at this Macayo's three times, and each time I leave unimpressed.  The service is ok, the food is ok.  That's about it.  

The plates I've ordered were drowning in cheese - now I love cheese, but I almost need a spoon to eat these meals.  

I know some people have raved about Macayo's, but I'm not thrilled with it.
