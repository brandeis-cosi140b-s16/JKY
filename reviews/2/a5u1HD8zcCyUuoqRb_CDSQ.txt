Many companies try to copy the Chipotle model and fail. Burrachos isn't bad food, but comparing it to Chipotle is unfair. This is similar to comparing McDonalds to Red Robin. Sure, they both have burgers and fries, but the similarities end there. Same with Burrachos and Chipotle. The caliber of the food isn't the same.

You order at the counter, starting with your basic dish. In my case, I went for the burrito bowl. They asked what kind of rice I wanted, and my choice was brown or white. I chose the brown as it is the healthier choice. I knew the Chipotle model was not being copied as soon as the rice was being dished up. Rather than some scoops of rice, the rice was measured out into a thin layer meant to cover the bottom of the plate.

I was then asked if I wanted beans or vegetables. I went with black beans. Again, rather than getting a decent scoop of beans, they were measured out and placed atop the rice. Same for the meat. Same for the salsa. Same for the cheese.

The taste and texture of the food could best be described as "fair." My ground beef tasted overly seasoned and dry. That's a personal preference, as I know some people will prefer that, and I can't fault Burrachos with it. The rice was crunchy in some areas. That is something that should never happen. Properly-cooked rice should always be soft and never crunchy.

It is easier to suggest the restaurant model more closely matches Subway, where everything is measured down to the wire versus Chipotle, where portions are scooped out and unmeasured.

The price was in the ballpark of Chipotle, Qdoba and similar-modeled restaurants.
