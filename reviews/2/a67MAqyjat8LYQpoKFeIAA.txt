Update after recent visit: while I still find the food very good I have to downgrade my previous rating due to price increases and poor service. 

Recently I noticed that beginning with your second bowl of chips you are charged. I asked the waiter about this and he said it was because they found that they were wasting too many chips. To me these are throw-away items at a Mexican restaurant anyway. 

It also appears that their dinner pricing has gone up with the food quantities staying abou the same. One comment in my group was "this is Chandler, not Scottsdale! Why are the prices so high, especially for Mexican food?"

I have also been experiencing mediocre service. Recently we were in after the lunch crowd but before the dinner crowd and really got poor attention / service. Particularly since the place was relatively empty.

Shape up El Zocalo or you'll find yourself a victim of this recession. That would be a shame because Chandler could really use a more upscale Mexican restaurant with REASONABLE pricing.

I don't know why but Chandler is really hurting for great Mexican food. Considering that, this place rocks. My favorite is the Chicken Mole. You cannot find that on most menus period and this is definitely authentic. I also judge a Mexican restaurant on their rice. Most rice is horrible, this place has very authentic rice (I use my grandma and aunt's cooking as baselines). 

Next is as mentioned, the ambiance. Great place, particularly when the weather permits you to dine outdoors.

As noted, this is not a cheap Mexican joint. You would think you could find great Mexican food at cheap prices but you'll have to go to El Rancho or the  Food City restaurant (name escapes me) for that.
