My husband & I went to try Wahoo's as we were excited for a new restaurant to open! He ordered from sh tacos, I had some sort of smothered chicken burrito, & we got a quesadilla for our daughter. The quesadilla was the best tasting food item we ordered. The food was bland & my chicken tasted like canned chicken, just not very good. Oh well.
