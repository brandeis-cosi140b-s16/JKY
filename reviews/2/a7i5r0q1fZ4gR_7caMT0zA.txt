I was turned off by the smell as I entered. Kind of a damp musty smell. 
The biggest turn off by far though was the pre-formed of the "store bought" variety,
Taco shell. In a Mexican restaraunt that makes killer tamales...REALLY???
The beans tasted like the canned refried beans, although they might not have been.
I probably will not return to that location at least.
