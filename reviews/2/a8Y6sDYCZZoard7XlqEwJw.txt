After having lived in Scottsdale for a while, I've driven past Barrio Queen many times. It seems like a good place from the way the restaurant looks, their menu, etc. but it's not really worth it. We were told we would have two waiters, and that didn't seem to work out well. One of them decided to point out to me that there was a fly in my food and flying around my face. THAT'S THEIR FLY. Flies in THEIR restaurant and the waiter has the nerve to point out to me that there's a fly on me. No apology. The tacos are TINY. You'd have to order AT LEAST 6 of them to feel full, and that would run you $20. The carne asada was tough and not very tasty. The brisket, however, was rather delicious, especially with the tomatillo salsa. Also the tamarind agua fresca was good, but it was $5. My girlfriend ordered the azteca enchilada, and everything on the plate was soggy. Soggy beans, soggy vegetables, soggy enchilada. I asked for a water towards the end of the meal and never received it. This place is nothing but a tourist trap. I could have had better tacos at Chipotle. Take your money elsewhere.
