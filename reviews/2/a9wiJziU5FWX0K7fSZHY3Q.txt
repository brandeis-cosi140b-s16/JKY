A co-worker and I stopped in for some tacos and a Sonoran dog.  We had the duck tacos (on special), carne asada tacos and a Sonoran dog. The carne asada wasn't bad...it was just okay.  However, we were extremely disappointed in the duck tacos and especially the Sonoran dog! The duck tacos were mixed in some sweet sauce that did not quite mesh well in a taco.  If maybe they did it Peking duck style like you get in Chinese restaurants, it may have been half way decent.  The Sonoran dog was the biggest disappointment! It was in a dry bolilo roll with black beans and cabbage! It shouldn't have been called a Sonoran dog! For those of you who know Sonoran dogs (i.e., El Guerro Canelo in Tucson), this wasn't even close.  I may go back but maybe just for the margaritas and tequila...the food needs work!
