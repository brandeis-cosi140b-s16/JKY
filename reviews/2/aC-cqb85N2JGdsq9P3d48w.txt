I would give it 2.5 if I could. The problem was not the ambience or the location because they had pretty great entertainment and the location is better than OK. I believe that what made my party and myself have a less than great time is the fact that three of us payed $27 each for a yard stick drink that had almost no alcohol and instead was loaded with ice and sugar. If the drink would have had actual alcohol, then Se√±or Frogs would have received a better review. We ended up heading over to Gilley's, which is also inside of Treasure Island, and it was funner and had better drinks.
