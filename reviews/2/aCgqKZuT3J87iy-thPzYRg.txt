We had a little extra time before a Diamond Backs game and decided to stop in here for a couple beers.  The guy behind the bar was a total D-bag.  We ordered 2 pints and he didnt even fill our glasses up all the way.  After the game we stopped again, same thing.  Then we ordered 2 Jager bombs.  Instead of having separate glasses for the shot and red bull, he mixed them.  And he knew that wasn't the way youre supposed to make it because he made a comment about it.  The guy made several rude comments and seemed to be trying to get us out of there...and it's only 8:45. For the prices they charge here, i want my shots made the right way, my beer filled up and with a little less douchebaggery!  Only reason they get 2 stars is for the extremely convenient location and 3 flat screens in the bar area.
