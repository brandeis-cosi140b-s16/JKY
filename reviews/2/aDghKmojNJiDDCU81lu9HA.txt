Heads up, the hours listed on Yelp are wrong- they're expanding hours to include weekdays as of January 12! Hallelujah, now you can get your menudo fix any day of the week not just on weekends. However, I believe they'll still be closing at a ridiculously-early time of 4PM, so plan ahead.

The menudo and pozole are the highlights of this menu, both available in rojo or blanco broth- I'm only familiar with red, so that's what I had. There seemed to be minimal difference between the two soups, but I did prefer the menudo.
Unfortunately, maybe because I came in so late (2PM), both orders we received were mostly hominy, bone, and gristle/fat.  BF tossed the pozole, saying it was the greasiest he's ever had, and all of the "meat" it contained were pieces of fat. The broth is good, but $10 for good broth is not what I think of when I venture to this side of town.

In addition to the soups, they also offer plates, tacos, and burritos- the beef in verde sauce appears to be another of their specialties. Tortillas and sopes made fresh in house, service is polite and speaks English.
