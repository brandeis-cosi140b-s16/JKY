Average fast-Mexican food, on the bland side.  Service is Chipotle-style assembly line, which is unique for small independent Mexican places like this.  Still, I thought the flavors were minimal and details throughout the experience disappointing.  

The upside: good prices, military discount, fast service, and really friendly staff.

So what exactly am I talking about?  Flimsy plastic silverware that was just about unusable.  Watery horchata (a crime in my book!)  Bland refried beans, plain chicken and uninteresting enchilada sauce.  It's like they basically don't spice anything, not even a little bit.  No salsa bar... I mean c'mon, where's the salsa bar???

Based on the strong reviews, I was expecting a pretty awesome experience.  I'd eat there again, but it wouldn't be my first choice.
