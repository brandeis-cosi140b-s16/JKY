My friend and I came here after work for margaritas and to just catch up. We ordered fried ice cream to share, a pina colada for myself and a strawberry margarita for her (both frozen). The interior is well-decorated. This location is a bit fancier than the E. Independence one. The E. Independence location is more casual, replicating the scenery in Mexico.

DO NOT order the fried ice cream. First of all, the ice cream isn't even fried. It is just blobs of ice cream in a fried bowl, drenched with whipped cream, chocolate and other toppings. Basically, a sundae in a fried bowl.

I tasted my friend's strawberry margarita. It were okay, nothing special. I definitely have had better pina coladas. I guess I had higher expectations for a Mexican restaurant. I do love that they come in giant glasses. Neither of us were able to finish (weak sauce.. I know =P). I do confess that it's probably not because of the percentage of alcohol in the drinks but rather the fact that neither of us have developed tolerance lol

We didn't try the food at this location, but I've tried the E. Independence location. I'm not a huge Mexican food fan and this place did not do much to sway me otherwise. If you want a large portion for $4-$6 entrees, you should come check out their lunch specials. The dishes are filled with beans as a side item and covered in cheese. That's great if this suits your palette, but personally, I think it just results in a very heavy, awful feeling (not so great if you can't nap afterwards and have to go back to work =/). If you love freebies, you'll love this place! You'll get free, bottomless chips/salsa and a sweet treat at the end of your meal (though I'm pretty sure this is typical in most Mexican restaurants).
