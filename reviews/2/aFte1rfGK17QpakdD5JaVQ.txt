Excellent customer service is imperative, this location does not have that. Visited this location on 4/29/14 around 10:45PM and the girl that took our order was rude. I'm chalking down that she hates her job and probably her life. Granted, she did say "thank you" once, so she has some hope of success in customer service. It's nice this location is open 24hr and 70% of the time they get your order right. I'll drive to another location for my hungover needs.
