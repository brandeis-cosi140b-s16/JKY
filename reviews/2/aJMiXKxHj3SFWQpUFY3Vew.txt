I've passed this place several times on my walk & I just happened to have skipped breakfast and was hungry around lunch time & found myself across the street & decided to give it a try.

 I didnt even look at the menu & ordered a Chicken Burrito To-Go & it came to $8. I was a little surprised at the price but went with it hoping for the best. It was lunch time and most of the tables in the small dining room were occupied with what looked like Business people from DownTown. I was offered a seat to wait for my order but probably moreso to be out of the way of the waitress as this place is very small & compact.

As I waited I looked at the signed pictures on the wall = Penn & Teller, Ray Charles, Freddie Fender, and alot I didnt know. I didnt have to wait very long and was asked if I wanted some chips & salsa to take with me and I initially declined but the nice waitress sold me saying "Its all fresh & Homemade" I ate the chips on the way home and they were as advertised = very lite with a little salt and the red ones were very good.

When I got home I was very disappointed in what I had got for my $8. The burrito was good enough but only a medium sized portion compared to Roberto's or the other Mexican place I have reviewed here which sell bigger & better for $5. In hindsight I should have had lunch there and ordered a special from the menu, which is what I will do next time I'm hungry & in the area.

The place was almost full so they must be doing something right.
