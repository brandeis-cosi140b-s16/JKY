Heard really great things about this place drive, run, skate by it all the time always smells amazing.

Pros
-Quesadilla was bomb but more like a large taco
-Friendly cashier
-just added umbrellas for shade on the patio

Cons
-Carne Asada was dry
-Guacamole was something from a squeeze bottle
-flies were all over the patio
