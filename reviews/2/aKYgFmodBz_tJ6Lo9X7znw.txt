Loud, small restaurant.  Third visit.  It gets worse each time. Waitress wanted us to order the second we sat down.  When we asked for a few minutes,  she disappeared for twenty.  I asked twice if all the appetizers were half priced. She responded that they were. When I went to order the shrimp cocktail,  i was told it wasn't half priced. I ordered two lettuce wrapped tacos-from the appetizer menu. The chicken one was so dry, I thought it was dry fish.  What kind of a Mexican restaurant cannot grill chicken?  The salmon taco was fine. Surprise!  The tacos were not half priced either! 
Dried salsa on the wood paneling. Children standing on chair screaming.  It was NOT a happy hour!
