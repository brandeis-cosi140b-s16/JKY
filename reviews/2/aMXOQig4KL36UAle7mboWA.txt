1 hour layover, so why not? It was breakfast time, but the entire menu is available (except for the carne asada). Ordered the chicken soft taco (meat was dry and pretty tasteless) and the shredded beef (juicy, flavorful meat). Taco is dressed with iceberg lettuce and diced tomatoes. Not super interesting and the hot sauce doesnt add enough "umph" to fix this. Considering the options in the area, this place is fine in a pinch. Just skip the chicken.
