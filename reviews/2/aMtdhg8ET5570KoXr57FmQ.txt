Honestly I am at a bit of a loss as to why this place is rated so highly. I have been there twice and both times have been supremely disappointed. The place is totally dirty (I dare you to look at the floor behind the counter...) and the food is far from fresh  or tasty. I had a tamale the first time and it was dry and oily. The second time I had tacos and the meet was over done and chewy (not is a good way). I know some before have claimed that this place is authentic but I must disagree. Spare your self and look toward Yelp highly rated Mexican grills in Phoenix if you want a fiesta for your taste buds and your wallet.
