I was so excited to try this place out but left underwhelmed. 

The "buffet" simply consisted of a salad/dessert bar and another with only about 6-8 trays. Most of the trays were either soups or stews that were described in Spanish and hard for my S.O. and I to understand. No chips and salsa, tacos, quesadillas, etc. here for those of you craving more Americanized fare.

That said, the vegetables/salad were extremely fresh, the BBQ chicken I had was very tender -- I chopped some of it up and wrapped them in some flour tortillas brought to the table -- and the dessert options (Churros! Caramel Flan!) were great. Also worth mentioning was the service was very attentive with drink refills and any other requests.

I would be willing to try this place out (and re-review) again in the future. They simply need to broaden their buffet menu some more and offer translations for the non-fluent crowd!
