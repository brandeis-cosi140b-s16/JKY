I went to school at CMU and while I was there everyone seemed to love this place, but I never got too into it. Its best feature is that after 10pm you can get a 22oz Margarita for $7, which is probably the cheapest way to get yourself on the way to a good evening at a bar in Pittsburgh. The margaritas themselves are nothing too special; however people who are on their second may say differently (this includes me).

The food is fine but nothing special and the place is extremely loud, crowed, and dark. It takes a while to get a table and even if you just want to stand at the bar it is often hard to find a good spot. Also for college students there is the added irritation that they enforce a rule that if anyone at the table is under 21 then nobody can drink unless you have somebody over 25.
