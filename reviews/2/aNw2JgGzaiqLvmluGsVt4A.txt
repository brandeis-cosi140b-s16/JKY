I normally really enjoy this restaurant. We get takeout from there pretty regularly and everything is usually pretty good. However, the last time we got takeout the entire order was messed up. I didn't receive an extra side item I ordered, and the two combo meals we got (both with 3 item choices) didn't have one correct item in them. We called to inform the store. The manager was nice and offered to send us a $30 gift card in place of a refund. That was over a month ago and we still haven't received anything. Very disappointing. The meal was over $30 plus a tip I left. When you eat at a restaurant they fix things for you, but when you order takeout you're at their mercy. You have to trust they got it right, or after you take the drive home you just have to eat whatever they gave you or take more time to drive back and wait for them to hopefully get it right again. I work in a restaurant and know mistakes happen. Also I'm not big on freebies or comps. But I do expect a restaurant to follow through when they offer something. If they didn't want to send the gift card they shouldn't have offered, and I would have driven back for an actual refund or replacement order. Now I probably won't be going back.
