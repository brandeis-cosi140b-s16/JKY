Chino your food is awesome but you are an older establishment and you need to focus on cleanliness. Being older is understandable but being dirty is another. Your air vents in the lobby and throughout  are disgusting and filthy! Air conditioner  is caked in grease and dirt. That alone could make you sick. Your walls need to be wiped and cleaned. You floors need the same. Do this and you get a 5 star. . Without it...two at best.
