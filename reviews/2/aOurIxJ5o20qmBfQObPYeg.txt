Where do I start? With this being one of the oldest Mexican restaurants around the area I thought they would have mastered what they served! Im a fairly adventuras eater so I deceided to try the tongue. I didnt know that you could keep tongue for the 80 years or so that the restaurant has been there but I guess they did! It was soo pungent and gamey I could only eat a few bites and that flavor and aroma stayed with me for many hours with every acidic and bloated belch!The good thing about the place is that it has survived this long and is a good place to hang out and drink if you dont want to have to do it with a bunch of roudy kids.
