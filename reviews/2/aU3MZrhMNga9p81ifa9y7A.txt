Had the marinated pork burrito.  The pork was very good - juicy and flavorful.  The rest, however, just wasn't good.  The tortilla was noticeably sweet - an interesting touch, but it just didn't work with the rest of the ingredients.  Rice was a bit acrid, as well.  Despite the good reviews I've seen, it's unfortunately a place that I probably won't be going back to.
