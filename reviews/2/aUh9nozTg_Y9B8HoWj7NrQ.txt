I have been here on several occasions, it's feels like coin flip every time I come here because there are times when the food taste good (4 stars) and there's days when it just doesn't feel fresh or clean (1 star).

What makes me give them one star is an experience I once had here on my birthday. I had 15 people join me for a birthday lunch on a weekend.  At the time, it was my group and about 4 other customers in the restaurant.  There were however, close 15 people who made up a huge band, THIS IS NOT A CONCERT VENU, they were not on a stage, but next to customer tables.  They did not work for the restaurant by the way. We had small children and they nor the staff cared to consider how rude the level of noise they were making was, we had a trombone near one of my guests! We asked for the bill, I only paid half and left the place.  NEVER COMING BACK
