The only reason I'm giving Vida Vida 2 stars is because the food (if you ever manage to get it) is rather delicious and well priced.  The Fried Chicken Taco is one of the best tacos I've ever had, and better than any of the tacos on Vida's menu IMO.  

The service however, is atrocious.  The concept here is that you sit down, fill out a slip of paper with your order selections, the waitress takes your slip of paper, and then brings you what you ordered.  Seems pretty simple huh? Well apparently it is much harder to keep track of pieces of paper and enter orders correctly than one could ever imagine.  I've been here 4 times and during 3/4 of our visits, someone in our party either had their entire order lost, or the wrong items entered.  The waitress' have never been apologetic or attentive and all seem like they stepped out of la la land. As a former waitress (for 8 years) I know we all have our bad days, but these ladies have all had bad months, and their aloofness doesn't help.  

I want to be hopeful about the future of Vida Vida and attribute the terrible service to the fact that the restaurant is new, but there are only so many times you can go to a place and continue to be disappointed before you don't go back anymore.
