If you're looking for authentic Mexican food in Arizona, do NOT go to Macayo's. It's a standard chain restaurant which has decent food - but not representative of the true pizzazz that Mexican food has to offer. If you MUST go to Macayo's, go for some margaritas during happy hour - and then kick it over to a better, local place like Valle Luna.
