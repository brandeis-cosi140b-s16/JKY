Went here tonight for dinner around 8pm it was slow we were sat right down and asked for drink orders ...... then we sat and sat and sat till I asked for our c hips n salsa we ordered guac as an app wich was tinny and flavorless the salsa was crazy spicy with no option for something more mild I ordered the chimichanga with pulled chicken again bland no flavor and the Verde sauce was so damn spicy it ruined the whole thing my other half got the fajitas how can u mess that up right ??? Well they did  they were ordered with no peppers extra onions and double rice they came out with no onions  extra peppers ...we told the waitress and she got new ones brought out however they came with no sizzle both times and we never got the rice at all like I mean the whole time ..... ya so it's nasty over Spicy and bad service  never returning sad that I waisted 45 bucks here and barley ate our food  ... oh and I almost forgot our daughter said her hot dog was nasty .... she eats hot dogs everyday how  can u make a hot dog Nasty !!!!!
Update ..... woke up the next morning sick as a dog vomit and the runs :(
