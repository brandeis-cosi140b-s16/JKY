Seeing how little went into my quesadilla, I'm not comfortable with paying over $7. At least use a mixed cheese blend!  And seeing how little effort went into making my quesadilla, I am really not impressed (you would think a labor charge is rolled into the price of food.)

Maybe what distinguishes Qdoba are the burritos with their special combos, but I am nonplussed to try them again. Oh well.
