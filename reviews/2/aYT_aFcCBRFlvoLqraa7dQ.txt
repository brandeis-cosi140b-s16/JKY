really disappointed after going here on 9/30. ordered a am crunch wrap meal. half way to Madison, i took a bite of it and it was cold. not that big of a deal but got to the hashbrown was rock hard. like over cooked and then sat out for a couple of hours. then i drove back and went inside and i talked to the manager. pointed out the problem and asked them if they would eat something like that. then she proceeds to tell me that the person preparing it may have not noticed it. doing some food prep for my job, i called bs on her. 

in the end, would not recommend the taco bell.
