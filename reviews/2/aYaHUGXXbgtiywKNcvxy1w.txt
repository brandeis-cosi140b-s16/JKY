My bestie tried the fish tacos and I indulged with the chicken/steak fajitas.  Fajitas are always a winner... I mean it's pretty hard to mess those up.  The fish tacos were great.  The only thing lacking was the service :(  I hate being pitched... this guy was trying to make a quick buck and was so busy trying to up-sale everything he kept forgetting what we needed or asked for.  The manager Ashley is wonderful and helpful and really seems to have a firm grasp on how important the customers are to her line of work.  Our server- not so much.  On a side note... all the servers seemed pretty miserable.
