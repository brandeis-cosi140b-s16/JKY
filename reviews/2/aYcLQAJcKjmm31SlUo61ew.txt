Went on Sunday morning.  Lots of empty tables.  Food is a bit overpriced for what you get. $12 for two avg sized signature fish tacos plus rice and beans?  $8 for 2 steak street tacos?  The fish tacos tasted a bit better than Rubios but cost ~$5 more.  Why?  Maybe the aroma of beer from last night?  The sticky tables?  It kinda smelled like a authentic dive bar in San Felipe..probably won't be returning.
