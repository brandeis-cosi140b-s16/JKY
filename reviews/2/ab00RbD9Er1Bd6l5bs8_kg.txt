With limited options within walking distance I ended up at McKen's out of curiosity. I had low expectations and even those were not met.

I ordered a burrito bowl with pork, steamed rice, jalapeños, sour cream, cheese, green chile and green onions. I also took some hot sauce on the side and it was served with a small bag of tortilla chips. 

None of the food did anything for me. The chips were stale, so I tossed them in the trash. The bowl was a flavorless mess. So bland even tons of jalapeños and added hot sauce didn't help. I got halfway through my meal and gave up. 

Good if you lack taste buds, otherwise it's a no go.
