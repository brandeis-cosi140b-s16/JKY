It's Mexican food so how bad can it be?  Answer:  Bad.  I had the veggie burrito figuring that would be safe.  I knew I was in trouble when I had to choose between the "Mexican" option with pico de gallo and sweet pickled onion or the "American" option with lettuce, sour cream and cheese.  Seriously, how is that the American option.  With my expectations managed at that point, I was still disappointed.  A Chipotle could easily put this place out of business.  Service was efficient though.
