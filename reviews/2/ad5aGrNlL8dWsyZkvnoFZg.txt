Sadly, the service has slipped. Not enough help to wait on the customers. Wait staff was waiting tables, serving as cashiers and bussing tables. Slow to get drink refills, didn't offer to bring more chips. Food wasn't hot either. The place was a huge disappointment on our visit this week. We are not likely to return.
