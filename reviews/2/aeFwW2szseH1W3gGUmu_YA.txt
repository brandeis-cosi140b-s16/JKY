Went here during a training class in the area.  My group ordered a variety of things.  Tacos, enchiladas and a tortas.  Where do I start?  The enchilada eaters described their meal as "bland and stale" to include the sauce that was nothing to write home about.  The torta consumer says "where's the beef?"  Still unsure about the "authentic" nature of food.  The carne asada tacos were edible but nothing spectacular.  The beans and rice were just that.
I was quite disappointed from all the rave reviews and will not be returning but you can be your own judge.
