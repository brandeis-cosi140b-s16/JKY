The videos were awesome. When I sat down "Smoking in the Boys Room" was on. Not one of my favorite Crue songs. But then it started a run of all of my favorite Crue songs in a row, including Corabi's "Hooligan's Holiday" (which I'm surprised they run) and the criminally underrated "Hell on High Heels". 

That was amazing! 

But that's about where it stops. The place was pretty dead. Although in fairness to them, it was 5 p.m. on a busy holiday weekend (conference championship games),so it's not like anybody was in Vegas. Yes, I'm being facetious about that. I was actually kind of bummed it wasn't more happening. 

I also went back there for late-night happy hour after the Rock Vault show. Why and the heck is this place not next to the theater where the Rock Vault show plays? Talk about poor planning. I mean, Rock Vault, Vince Neil. What am I missing here? 

Instead it's tucked down a long hall way. Which might be for the best. Because the food isn't great. I have suspicion it's just Smart and Final boxed Mexican food being served. Although, that might be mean to Smart and Final. 

I really wanted to love this place. I'm coming back for the Guns 'n Rose show in June and my friend really wants to go here. But I don't know if I can allow that. Which breaks my heart.
