Very over priced for generic mexican food.  The salsa is like seasoned ketchup.  I asked for something spicier and got roasted habenero.  It wasn't bad.  The margaritas were decent.  
We had two burrito dinners and a fajita plate.  Also 1 beer and 1 margarita.  The bill was $66.  $ 45 would be more than fair for what we got.  (The service was good.)
