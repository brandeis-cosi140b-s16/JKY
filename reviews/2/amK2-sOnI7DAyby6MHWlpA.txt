Not all that. Not so happy cashier lady. Got two burritos and the tortillas didn't look cooked enough asked if they can toast it like they do their quesadillas server took it to the back and came to ask if I wanted deep fried because they don't do such a thing even though our friend had a shredded beef quesadilla right in front of him.
