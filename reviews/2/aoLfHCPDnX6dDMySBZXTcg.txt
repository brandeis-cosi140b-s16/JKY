EW.

I had their tacos and it was by far the nastiest tacos I've ever had to this date. The chicken was so dry and bland. The steak had a bit more flavor but she took spoonfuls of guacamole and sour cream and everything else just made this taco more like a throw up inside a tortilla. Im just glad I got the drink, I really did like my raspberry tea.
