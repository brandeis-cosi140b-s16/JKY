I've been here twice always hoping it will be better than I remember and I was disappointed again! I will say the decor is absolutely beautiful but the food is garbage. This is more of a Tex Mex place then I would consider authentic Mexican. I had the Chimichanga and it seems that anything you order comes prepared basically the same way with the same flavours (kind of flavourless.) Majority of the staff are teenagers who don't really care about service. Sadly I won't return again as I've been disappointed too many times, I want AUTHENTIC Mexican.
