Not as good as expected.  We drove further than normal for good Mex food to check out Los Dos Molinos and will not do so again.  The salsa is extremely hot and while flavorful, in the hot for hot sake category.  (I am no chili wimp often making up dove popper's with habanero)  The food was OK, but nothing special.  Easy to do better for the same $$ as others have said.  Margaritas were the bright spot as the premium fresh version at $20 is worth the money.
