First time here and I ordered a carne asada torta from the lunch menu.. The service here was so great, but the carne asada was just a sad mess. I spit out the majority as it was full of fat and rough parts. I ended up eating the bolillo, avocado and papas for $10  Carne asada should be delicious if it's a headliner on the menu!
