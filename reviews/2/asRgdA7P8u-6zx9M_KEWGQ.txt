Somethin is off balance at this place.  I decided to pop in as it is right next to Taco Bell.  The picture of the Big Nachos or oh la la nachos, or whatever looked really good.  Why doesn't anything look as good as the photo ever.  Anyway it's just a hole in the wall, but they are friendly I ordered the nachos to go and got my order fairly quickly.  I got it home and was surprised......heavy stuff, I opened it and was amazed at how much food.  Here's the problem....flavor or lack there of it.  The beef had no flavor, lots of it, but no flavor.  It also did not have much cheese.  The guacamole also did not have much in the way of flavor.  I was very hungry so I ate alot of it, but I think some of these places including this one get the balance wrong.  The order doesn't have to be huge, it could have been 3/4 of the size, just make up for it in flavor.  I'm still a little surprised at how a Mexican food place like this could have little flavor.  Go to the coach next to Charlies on Camelback instead--their asad burritos are to die for.
