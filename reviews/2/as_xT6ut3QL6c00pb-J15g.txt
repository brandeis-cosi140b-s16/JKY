Me and my husband did not have a good experience when we went on one occasion.  We ordered chicken quesadillas and our chicken according to their standards was "charred".  I was not fond of their "charred" chicken!   The last time me and my husband went to this location we opted for the ground beef instead to avoid any "charred" chicken.  There meat could have used a little more flavor, but it beat their chicken that's for sure!  We will probably not be frequenting this location very often.
