This place is an insult to their customers. I expect the tourist traps on the strip to be overpriced, but they should be ashamed to charge those prices for the product that they provide. The food is hardly edible,  and the drinks are so overpriced that I would have saved money by drinking at the blackjack table.

The first table (outdoor) they tried to seat us at was only half covered, and it was starting to rain more than just a drizzle. I ordered a combo plate that didn't even come complete with all the items that were supposed to be included, and my steak was raw. They tried to charge us for a side of dressing after serving us a salad that had no dressing on it. There's no way the 22oz specialty drink we ordered held 22oz, it had very little alcohol in it, and it cost about twenty bucks.

I have always enjoyed Senor Frogs, Carlos and Charlies, El Squid Row, etc in Mexico, but do yourself a favor and avoid this store.
