Im giving it a very weak two, probably should be a 1. Came in this past Sunday, chips and salsa were alright. Some batches of the salsa were mild, some you took a bite and your mouth was on fire. Wasnt a huge fan of the thin chips that werent fresh. Ordered the Chimichanga plate, and it took almost an hour to get to our table. Beans and rice looked like they had been under the heatlamp for awhile. Not good! The Chimi was medicore at best, the pork inside was dry. I also had a peach margarita which tasted like a Slurpee with no alcohol in it. Dont waste your time and money at this place.
