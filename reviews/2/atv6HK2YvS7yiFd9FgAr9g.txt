First let me say the chips are very good, and the bean dip is excellent, BUT for the most part the rest of the menu is mostly bland.

They make a very good red chilie burro, and chile Colorado, but everything else is meh!

Cheese enchilads? meh.
Tacos? meh.
steak? meh.
fajitas? meh.

Polo fundido is good, my wife orders it almost every time.

One note for this and other Mexican restaurants. Why are people charged more when you order something with out rice and beans? Most of the time the amount of food minus the rice and beans is way more than enough. I can't tell you how many times I see plates with rice and beans left on them. They just get thrown away.
