I had a soft spot for Gardu√±os because it was where I had my first date with my husband back in 1998. Back then, it was located in the middle of the Fiesta Casino. The food was amazing (I'm of Mexican decent and know my Mexican food). Fast forward to this last weekend. I haven't eaten here in about 5+ years now and was really looking forward to a nice meal and margarita. I ordered the blue corn chicken enchilada stack with green salsa, the charro beans and posole. I should have asked if they could make it with regular corn. I think it might have been better? The tortillas where tough and flavorless. the green sauce was hardly existent and the same for the cheese and chicken. I lost interest in the tortilla and ate the little bit of chicken and cheese. The flavors were nothing special. The charro bean were my favorite though. Excellent flavor and reminded me a little of the ones my mom would make. The posole was not very good. No flavor and the meat was dry (in the soup!). My daughter had the stuffed sopapillas and those where pretty good. Nothing special though. The margarita sampler was a cool idea but because they are samples, they make them all on the rocks. They didn't have enough ice and each was warm. Not what you expect from a refreshing drink. The hostess was excellent and sweet as can be, the waitress never came back to check on us or refill our waters. I see the other reviews and I'm so sad to know that they went downhill.
