I took my son to eat here for lunch.  They made it hard for him to order (he is 7).  He couldn't really get any meat or melted cheese on his kids burro, so he got pinto beans and cold shredded cheese.  He would prefer Taco Bell.   i was 3rd in line and waited 20 minutes to order.   They forgot my taco and just seemed very dis-jointed.   Honestly unless something changes, Chipollte is just down the way and much more organized.   The manager was cool!  Although I asked him for salsa for my son and it never came.
