sub-par service. food is overpriced crap. you can find better food at hole in the wall's like Dona Maria's or Tonys...even Roberto's Taco shop has better food.

Also, the Battle of Bands that they are currently hosting is sure to be rigged. For the past two weeks, the losing bands had received more fan support than the ones that actually "won".
