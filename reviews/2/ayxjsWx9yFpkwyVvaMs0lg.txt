I will start this review with saying that The Garcia on 35th Avenue is the only one you should go to.... this location was a huge disappointment...the only reason I give it a 2 star is because the service was good...our server was really nice, we had the tortilla soup, salad, and a grande burrito, I think... Let me start with the burrito...aside of onions and the dried chicken and beef inside, there was nothing to this... I think I make 100% better mexican food than this people, and I'm from Panama--LOL... now the soup, yak... horrible and the salad, had a big peace of lettuce that looked like fungus was growing on it... my little one gagged... I almost complained, but what's the point, we are never going there again... better off going to and Humberto, Roberto, Filiberto...whatever you called those places... believe me you will never be this disappointed.
