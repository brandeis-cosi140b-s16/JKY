We had dinner there tonight, there were some pros and cons. Our server was very friendly and the atmosphere was nice. However, I know we waited at east 30 minutes for our marguerites after placed our order. Our appetizer arrived 15 minutes before our drinks.  Our experience was lass than positive. One other thing, on our arrival, I heard a lady at the table next to us complaining to the manager about how long she had to wait for her food.
