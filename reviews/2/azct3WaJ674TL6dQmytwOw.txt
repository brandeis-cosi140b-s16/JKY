I used to love this place now I hate it. I went to dinner tonight (Tuesday) and the place was basically empty so should be fast. It was one of the worst service experiences I have ever had. I ordered a seasonal draft and was brought a two dollar light draft and our server was more than inattentive. So don't waste your time....
