No Bueno Abuelos 

My husband and I rarely have date nights...and just had dinner at Abuelos. While the food and drinks were delicious, the service was horrible. We sat in the bar for dinner and Spike was our server. It was like pulling teeth to get a drink menu and he was so inattentive and unfriendly, it was completely uncomfortable. We couldn't wait to leave and even mentioned that to each other when our food was brought out. 
I'm glad we had a gift card and didn't spend any of our money, the experience was less than a pleasure.
