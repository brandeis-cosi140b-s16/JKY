The margarita was delightful. The food, not so much. Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing. The grilled skirt steak was neither tender nor tasty but the complimentary chips and salsa were good so I used the salsa to add some flavor to the meat. 

We have all been so excited to see a fresh new restaurant in our neighborhood. They have done such a great job with the decor and we were really hoping the food would be as good. Sadly, our first impression was not stellar.

The place was pretty empty when I was there and I feel bad for the owners. The first few months in a new place are so important for it's success and things just don't look all that hopeful.

We may try it again but right now, the thought of going back just makes me feel kind of sad.

Please, please, please turn things around. We really WANT to support a great restaurant in our neighborhood!!
