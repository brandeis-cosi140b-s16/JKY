Looking for a quick fix to a taco craving my friend & I had.. We venture a few miles away from my loft to go get our fix fixed..  Umm ...  I don't think so... Chips & salsa? More like a styro to-go box filled w unsalted chips & pico de gallo over the chips?! Who does that?! Taco.. 2stars.... I always get a chicken taco, if I can get the meat in shredded form.. I'm weird about my meat! But this is more like ground chicken..& they placed it in the styro to go box next to the cheese enchilada I ordered to go with..so the taco became a part of the smothered enchilada mess.... Yep... Drowned in lukewarm red enchilada sauce... That enchilada... I couldn't finish... The cheese was not melted inside.  Ok.. Should I have complained..(as a very advising yelper once scolded me for).. Probably! But in truth.. The girl behind the counter had rubbed me wrong already... By telling me I looked 'tire'... & secondly by having a host issue with her credit card machine... Asking me to pay cash... Whatever.  I'm harsh? Possibly... 2stars... & that's a compliment.
