This bar embodies everything Glendale truly is, which is more of a slight than anything else. Every time I some how end up at this place I always get the same experience. A mediocre night of waiting for drinks, watching people who I vaguely remember from high school, and waiting to find out where the party is afterwards. That last part should really be the point of interest for this bar since after-parties seem like a fairly common thing to do after visiting Salty's. Either way, I really wish my friends wouldn't want to come to this bar as often as they do.
