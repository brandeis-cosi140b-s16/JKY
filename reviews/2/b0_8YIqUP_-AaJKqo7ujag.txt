I don't like writing negative reviews but what is up with La Paz lately? They are always out of avocados (so NO guacamole) and I have found their servers to be argumentative. I ordered a salad that came with cotija cheese and avocado. Not only were they out of avocados, but my salad was delivered sans cheese. I told my server the cheese was missing and she insisted it didn't come with cheese. $13 for lettuce and bland chicken? I think I'll pass on that.
