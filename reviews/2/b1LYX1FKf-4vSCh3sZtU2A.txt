I wasn't expecting downtown Phoenix Mexican food, but was looking forward to a good burrito. Highly disappointing. 
Tortillas were cold/crunchy, burritos were mainly tortilla. Maybe it was grocery day for Mi Familia. I'm almost sure the taco shells are made before hand and then sit until someone orders a taco. 
"Salsa bar" was pretty cute. Salsa was watery and bland, too much pepper & not a lot of substance. 
If your going to offer chips & salsa, deliver. We got a small 3 inch in diameter Styrofoam bowl of maybe 12 chips. 

Del Taco does better.
