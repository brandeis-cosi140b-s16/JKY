While reports from the table on the tamales and the poblano cream chicken enchiladas were good, the enchiladas were rated just ok, the chili rellenos were a huge disappointment. Advertised as New Mexico chiles they were no more than your average  anaheim peppers in a pre made coating that was flat and tasteless. When you expect the 7 to 8 inch spicy New Mexico pepper and you get a 4 inch anaheim you really don't want to return. We won't be back.
