To start, it is super warm in this place.  Even the little cashier was sweating.

The prices are outrageous for what you get and I should have gone down the street to fausto's for what is probably the best coctel de camerones in town.  But I'm hungry and a little lazy today so what the heck.  $15.99 later and it was okay with enough hot sauce.  But the restaurant being so warm the hot sauce me me sweat twice as much, haha.  

Don't think I will be going back to dine in, but in a pinch I might get something to go.
