I'm not quite sure what the hype is all about here. We came here for lunch, I got an enchilada and a taco. We constantly had to ask for more salsa, they serve it in these little containers and after two chips it's gone, it got to the point where we specifically had to ask for a bigger container. 5 people and a 4 oz plastic container of salsa just didn't cut it. The food came out luke warm and I have to admit I was not impressed. I kid you not the taco shells honestly tasted like the store bought "Old El Paso Taco Shells". With all the other authentic Mexican restaurants in the valley, I think I personally would pass up coming here again. They have a great concept just didn't deliver for our group on the meal
