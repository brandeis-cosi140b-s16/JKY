Came here on a Tuesday to watch the FIFA game.  The place is located inside The Graduate Hotel and from what I gather it was pretty dead.  

I started by ordering some Happy Hour specials; chips and salsa and a beer.  For my entree I went for some tacos; pork shoulders and the chicken tacos.  I thought the chips and salsa was decent at best.  I would rather have fresh made chips and salsa; plus the salsa had a weird strong vinegar-like taste; both red and green.  The pork shoulder tacos were a tad bit cold my partner and I thought plus could use a little more kick and spice.  The thing I like about it is the pickled onions giving it some texture.  My chicken tacos was probably my favorite of the night.  I love avocados, but again would want some more spice to it and also more cabbage slaw for more texture. 

In the end, Tapacubo was a nice place to visit and chill for drinks.  I didn't really care for the food and thought the chips and salsa at least be complimentary.  No Taco Tuesday!? - Enjoy!
