Now I know why this place is ALWAYS empty.

About the only "special" food they offer are their fresh chips and salsa; which they charge after the first small basket.  

I ordered the pork green chile, wife got two tacos, and sis ordered chile relleno and the special.  

There was absolutely not one thing about any of these items that was good or memorable.  Seasonings are skimpy, as the green chile pork was flavorless.

This place needs something special; they offer bland and mediocre Mexican-Americanized food.

We figured we were going to be disappointed way before we decided on this place.  We based it on the fact that it never has customers and that they uber-advertise outside.  Very disappointing.
