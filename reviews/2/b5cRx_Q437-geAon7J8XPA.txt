I have to disagree with the previous comments. While the bean dip with the chip is a good option, the food is below par and the prices are way too high. The tacos I got literally looked like the ones at Jack in the Box. And slip a brew or two into your experience and you're looking at over $20. The service was ok, but the food just really isnt that great imho, and i've been there a couple times.
