PAPA - PLEASE WORK ON THE FOOD PREPARATION  AND PORTIONS FOR TO GO ORDERS.  

It's 8:30 at night and I haven't eaten.  I was excited to try out a new place.  It's open and bright with windows around.  You can see the food being prepared.  I usually order rolled tacos when I visit an eatery like this for the first time.  I figure it would be very hard to mess such a simple thing up.  After all its just meat, rolled in corn tortilla and deep fried until crisp.  Well, it was a bit of a disappointment as only the ends of my tacos were crisp, the insides soft and soggy.  This made me worry that it wasn't cooked thoroughly.  

My receipt was pushing close to 8 dollars for 6 rolled tacos, rice, and beans and guac. 
I rate the portions of the side dishes - STINGY - not enough for the price tag.  
I rate the Rolled Tacos D -   Soggy middles - yuck. 
I rate the guacamole A+  - It's the real deal, not the watered down stuff.  Very good.  
I rate the beans A+ - flavorful and wonderful.
I rate the rice   C-  as mine was on the undercooked side, slightly crunchy, yuck though it seemed to have a good flavor. 
I rate the Salsa - B - it was average, expected salsa for this type of venue 
I rate the restaurant ambiance A+
I rate the service A+ 
I rate the cooks - well, they leave more to be expected.  Please work on it Papa Chevos, you have time because I won't be back anytime soon.  Maybe I will try again after some more weeks pass.
