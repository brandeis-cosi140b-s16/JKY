This was my second go-round here at Tee Pee Mexican Food, and this time wasn't that much different. I realize that this is a historical venue and has been around for a very long time. Great. The wait at lunchtime on a weekend before Christmas was not too bad. Our wait staff was quick and friendly. The salsa was very flavorful, but the bowl of chips (while hot) were some of the smallest and most broken-up chips we have ever seen. My green corn tamale came cold. Yes, cold. And the rice and beans were average. Hubby's carne asada burrito was better than my tamale but it wouldn't take much to get there. If you're desperate, come for the salsa and margaritas or a cold beer. But, that's about it.
