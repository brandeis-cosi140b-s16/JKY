Disappointing. I wonder if this place imagines itself more as a tequila bar than a restaurant. We went there for a meal. I like fish tacos (some people think it's an odd combination), but this was so overcooked I could barely bite through it. The black bean side was good. The pickled vegetables I think I liked the idea more than the executable. Rice was bland. 

My dinner companion said his salad was just OK and didn't even bother to finish his margarita. 

The potato wedge appetizer was good and the aioli was nicely spicy.

All in all, it was just ok. I'd probably go back, but I'm not in any rush.
