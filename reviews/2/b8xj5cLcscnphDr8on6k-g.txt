Decided to try Del Taco and we were very disappointed. My two tacos maybe weighed 2 or 3 ounces. They was barely any lettuce and the lettuce was the most of what they put in the taco. I would have had to order 4 of the meals to match any 1 meal at other fast food places. When letuce which has NO nutritional value is the main ingredient in your lunch you had better find another fast food place to eat at.
