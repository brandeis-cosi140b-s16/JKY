I was really disappointed in this place. I went for music with friends and the venue was new to me. 

The set up in the long, narrow bar is bizarre, with high-top tables up close to the stage blocking the view of everyone at the low tables behind. The noise level was ridiculously high, with lots of TVs playing sports competing with the music. The acoustics were also very strange.

The service was atrocious. I waited 10 minutes to even catch the eye of a waitress. She immediately told me they were out of chips and salsa. This is a Mexican restaurant for heaven sake! How can you run out of chips and salsa. 

Once I ordered my tableside guacamole it took over an hour to get it, and once it came it was unmemorable, bland with a couple of unexpected spots of fiery chili. My fellow music lovers had similar experiences with the service and food.

I hate to say it, because I love to support venues that feature live music, but I will not be back to this restaurant.
