If you want over-priced, absolutely flavorless tacos, Roberto's is the place for you! I was starving last night, craving some tacos. I haven't had Roberto's in ages, and was looking forward to some delicious tacos. I ordered a pile of crunchy tacos & a quesadilla, then went home to eat.

The chicken was an odd texture, with zero flavor. Seriously, why do I have to ask places for flavor in my food?

The quesadilla was just a foil wrapped puddle of grease that was leaking everywhere, and I couldn't get more than a few bites into it.

Seems my memory needed a reminder about why I didn't eat here anymore.
