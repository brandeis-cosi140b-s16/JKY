I thought this place was okay. I ordered shrimp tacos and they were just plain. In fact, I think even the chips and salsa were just ok. The atmosphere was inviting and seemed busy. The waitress was very kind and prompt. We even had some random guys sit at our table and she came over to see if we were ok and if she needed to get of them for us. That was greatly appreciated!
