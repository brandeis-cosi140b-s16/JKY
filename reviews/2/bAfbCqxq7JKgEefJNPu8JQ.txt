Blech, yuk, really??

Well, I had family visiting from Europe and made a list of places that I'd definitely want to take them.  Penciled in at number 22 was this place - a charming restaurant in a charming town that I'd often taken out of town guests over the years.

Big mistake.

It was terrible.  

Parking was in the very, very back as street vendors had taken over the parking lot selling what my dad affectionately calls UBS (useless bunch o' shite).  

Once we got through this, we put our name in for a table.  We were told it would be a 30 minute wait, and it was.

Service was great, but beware of the bill padding and mediocre, at best, food.  There were 4 adults and 2 kids and our lunch was $100.  I had the chicken parcel thingys which were terrible and around $11. When hubby ordered fish tacos, they asked, "fish tacos with rice and beans?"  he said, "sure."  (ADD $4)  My kids ordered juice with their meals (ADD $4) - seems the kids meals come with milk or soda, not juice.  Sister-in-law orderd enchiladas (ADD $4 - $2 for each one to add chicken), Other sister-in-law ordered fajita salad with tortillas on the side (ADD $4 for tortillas).  YOu get the point, I'm sure :-)  

However,  if the food was good, all of the ridiculous upcharges would have been bearable.  It wasn't.  Mediocre food at best.
