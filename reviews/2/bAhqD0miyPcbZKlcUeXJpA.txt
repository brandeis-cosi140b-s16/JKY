They have good Mexican food. Although, now you receive smaller portion then before and still pay the same price. Customer service isn't good. One of the main reasons I'm rating it so low and don't recommend anyone to go is because if you decide to go through the drive -thru they take soooooo long, defiantly longer the average and it's usually not even busy. My standards aren't met.
