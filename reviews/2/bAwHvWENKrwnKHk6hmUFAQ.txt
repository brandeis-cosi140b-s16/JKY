A bit overpriced but good, not great. This place can be a lot of fun with large frozen drinks. It is a bit dark and loud, even during the day. A big minus, hold on to your hats, they charge $4.95 for chips and salsa!! For $4.95 this salsa better cure the common cold. But if this is your thing worth a stop. Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!
