The food is ok, but if you like imitations mascaraing as authentic this may be your favorite spot. What is most interesting to me is not the food, it's the other patrons. If you are people watcher THIS IS THE MAIN REASON TO COME HERE. There majority of their clientele have something just a little bit different about them. It's pretty creepy, and very entertaining. 

If it's between this spot and Taco Bell, come here... unless you are in a hurry.
