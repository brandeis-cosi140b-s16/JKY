I love Chipotle, but I do not love this location. The service is the worst of any location I've ever been to. Each time I've been here, I've waited in line more than 15 minutes, regardless of how many people are in front of me. They skimp pretty badly on all of ingredients so that you constantly have to ask for more than a tablespoon of something. Such a letdown because we need a good lunch option in Shadyside, but I would stick to the Baum location from now on.
