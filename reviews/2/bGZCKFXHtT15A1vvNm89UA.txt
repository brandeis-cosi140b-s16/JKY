Was greeted not by hello.. but "it will be about 10 minutes" ummm we didn't even say why we're here. Just wanted to relax on the patio on a Friday afternoon. 

Very slow service, then got our orders wrong. Icky margarita. The waitress seemed annoyed we were there. Drinks were nothing special. 

Lunch special consisted of a little chunk of fish buried under sour cream and cabbage. Chips and salsa were ok. All in all, nothing I would rave about. Honestly Some Burros up the street is just as good!! 

Get some customer service and this place might be ok...
