Bland bland bland. The guacamole is not fresh made- it is obviously from a pouch . Everything needed salt. I ordered the flautas they were very strange  not like typical flautas that you would find at a typical Mexican restaurant. Everything needed salt. I can't complain about the service it was perfectly fine . The prices seem too high for the quality and quantity of food . Did I mention everything was bland and needed salt?
