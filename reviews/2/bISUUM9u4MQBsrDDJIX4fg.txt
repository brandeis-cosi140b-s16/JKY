I shouldn't expect much from late night eating, but it's Mexican food. It should be good whatever time of day. However, I ordered menudo due to a heavy hangover. Maybe this was from the bottom of the pan because over half of it was just bones. My dogs will be happy. The menudo broth was not very tasty. Missing the seasonings, such as salt. They provided lemon, cilantro, and onions but no ground oregano.   FYI- the guacamole and chips were not kid friendly. This is my kids' favorite item. The guacamole had visible tomatoes in it. My kids said nah. I'll stick with my Juliobertos, Filibertos, and Herreras.
