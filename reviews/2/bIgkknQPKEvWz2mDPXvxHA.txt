I went here for dinner with my husband tonight.  We were sat in one of the booths that are close to the entrance and had virtually no view.  After eating our bland meal we walked down to the area behind the bar which had an awesome view.... AND 90% empty seats.  The food looked good but was very bland, I added the salsa from the chips to my meal.  The sauce for the green pork burrito was odd tasting too....very lime/citrusy tasting.
