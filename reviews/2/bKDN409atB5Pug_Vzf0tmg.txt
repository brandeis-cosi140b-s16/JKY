Yes I've experienced better Chipotles. This location is always busy so when we order lunch for the office we fill out the fax sheet. Kinda hard to screw that up but somehow they did. My co-worker crossed out both squares for the beans, which clearly means NO BEANS. Well she got both black and pinto beans. She also complained that she didnt get enough meat. 

My order wasnt screwed up but about halfway through my bowl I kept asking myself  "where the f is the meat." After digging some more there was still barely any meat. 

We have eaten at that location several times and although the food is always good, they often times manage to screw something up. Never big screw ups but something is always off. 

No complains about the Alma School and Queen Creek location.

Pluses: Nice location, liquor license!
