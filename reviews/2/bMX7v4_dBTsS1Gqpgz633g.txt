For the first time, Yelp has burned me.

I see nothing but glowing reviews, but what I got wasn't amazing. It was mediocre.

It was taking everything I knew about good mexican food and bastardized it.

Who serves non marinated carne asada? Who serves up tounge that has been cooked to crisp?

First off, Carne Asada needs to be served up with lime and guacamole, not fried-ish with cheese.

And Lengua( or tounge), has a very distinct flavor, very hard to describe...something close to corned beef. This tasted like fried beef. And had cheese on it.

And the baby banditos are just like taquitos, and their "bandito" sauce is nothing more than  whipped butter with a few butchered slices of jalapeno in it.

Their salsa was tasty, that gets them a star. And they have awesomely large community tables, that gives them another star.

Don't believe the hype.
