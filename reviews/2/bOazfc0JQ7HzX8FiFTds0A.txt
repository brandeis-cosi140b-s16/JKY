This is a review of Macayo's in general. 

This is a typical Mexican chain restaurant. These are way worse than authentic Mexican food which can be found all over the valley at a family owned restaurant. Prices are typical of any restaurant 8-15$ range. The margaritas are terrible. I had one with my girlfriend recently, and I did everything in my power just to choke it down. I think they poured sweet and sour mix in a cup and gave it to me. She couldn't even finish hers, and I noticed another table ordered margaritas that were left 3/4 full when they left. 

The food is pretty bad. Last time I went with my girlfriend, she threw up an hour later and I had heartburn the entire night (probably because I finished my margarita). I would never go back to a Macayo's again.
