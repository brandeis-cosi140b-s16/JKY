I wanted to like this place but I didn't. 

The food was okay. I had the veggie fajitas they were way over salted, like waaaay over salted. It was inedible. However the rice and the beans were good better than average. The regular house salsa was bland and too sweet but the hotter sauce they have in the bottle was great. It had the right amount of spice. Overall the food was "meh" I would have given this place1 but the hot salsa, rice and beans were good.

Drinks: I only had a margarita. One. It was too weak and way too tangy. I'm tiny so usually one margarita is all I need. I could have easily had two more and drove home.

Service: They tried to seat other people ahead of us and once we ordered the waitress forgot we existed. Additionally, they gave me my tortillas late and my fiance never got his. 

Place was over lit and quite tacky. I do not plan on returning as Elvira's was way overpriced for the service and quality of food.
