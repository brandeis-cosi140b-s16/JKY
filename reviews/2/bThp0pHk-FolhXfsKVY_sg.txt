Worst tacos Mexico, I have ever been, where do I start, from the moment I walked in staff is unfriendly, like they dont want to be there. They charge me wrong, my asada plate was cold by the time I got it, have you ate cold meat? You can taste the grease, tortillas hard and stuck together, had to peeled them apart, not fun, had to ask for spoon and napkings, they dont stock their self help area often...overall BAD...when you come to a place hungry, you expect good food, I left discussed...they should close this place, if they dont take care of it..only person I give props is the busgirl, mopping, cleaning, sweeping...she did her job right
