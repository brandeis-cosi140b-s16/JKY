Food was ok. Guacamole tasted ok but a menu partner was Cavalo. This company makes guacamole for a living. Is their guacamole really fresh?  

They sent a mixed message with music, a cross between classic rock and pop in a great Latin atmosphere.  While I know it was Monday night and probably no need for a band, they could have done better with the music selection.

At 7:00 PM parking lot lights between them and PF Changs were completely out - It's fall reset your timers or check your photocell.
