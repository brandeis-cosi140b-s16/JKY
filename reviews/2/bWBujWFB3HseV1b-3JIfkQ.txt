Not the best mexican restaurant. The food was very bland and a little bit over priced for what it really was. I ordered pollo fundido which is pretty good, but they served it with slices of american cheese on top, which is not how pollo fundido is supposed to be served. I would not recommend this mexican restaurant if you are looking for authentic mexican food.
