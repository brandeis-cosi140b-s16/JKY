After passing this place twice a day every day and reading an article on a fish taco battle I decided to stop.

My first impression was that it was another hipster dive in the neighborhood and I'd say I was fairly accurate. Staff not very friendly or helpful, not exactly the cleanest place as some of the tables were still dirty while the staff talked amongst themselves in the kitchen.

The fish tacos were not that great so I don't know where the competition was, but I've had much better in other shops in the valley.

The prices were decent for what it was so I don't have a complaint there, the chips and salsas were decent, but over all i was not really impressed for ll the hype.
