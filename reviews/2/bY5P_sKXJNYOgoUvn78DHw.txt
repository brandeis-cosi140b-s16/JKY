One chicken chimichanga later, I'm baffled by the rave reviews.

At lunch time on a Sunday, the place was quiet, possibly because it's not really on the main drag in historic downtown Wickenburg, possibly because few people other than me think going to Wickenburg in August is a great idea.

One gal, who appeared to be in charge, was a sweetheart and very on the ball. Unfortunately, the other staff were... not naturals at working in a service industry.

Great food might have saved this situation, or at least rendered it humorous. Unfortunately, the chicken chimichanga was filled with bland, unseasoned chicken: I guess the regulars know to order it enchilada-style to get flavor from the salsa. The beans and rice were beans and rice. I can't deny that the true, natural flavor of the chicken was front and center. So if you want to savor that chicken in its full chickenosity, this is the dish for you. In its defense, it was genuinely a nice chicken, with no icky bits left in.

Best part of the meal was the "hot" salsa, which is actually hot -- not a given in Arizona. It comes in a set of three dips: hot, normal, and refried bean. This is adorable and fun, and I wish more restaurants did it.

If I were compelled to eat here again, I'd order something that is definitely, positively slow-cooked in its sauce. If I were bringing an aging relative who didn't like "hot" food, I'd order the chicken chimichanga.
