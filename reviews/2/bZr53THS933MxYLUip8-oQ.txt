I am not 100% sure why, but I just don't feel like this store is very clean-- I haven't seen any evidence of dirtiness- just has that feeling.  But I keep going back because the food is good and is fresh. The staff has been friendly and professional. Prices are reasonable for the level of food that is offered.
