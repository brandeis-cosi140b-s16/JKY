Chips and bean dip are good.
Salsa doesn't have a bite so to me it's lacking.
Came in here around 3 p.m. and almost expected them to be closed but nope, late lunch crowd.  That would be us and another party of six?
Beverage delivery to our table was super slow.  Busgirl asked our drink order, then server asked, and yet it felt like it was forgotten.
That is until server finally shows up, with the wrong drink.
Entrees ordered and they arrive.  Two entree with one side combo wasn't quite prepared right.  It appears they served a cheese enchilada with meat on the outside to make up for the fact it was suppose to be a meat enchilada.
Mexican veggies side and black beans had cheese all over them.  Enough already with the cheese.  I was trying for something with fewer calories.
Server was kind to stop by to fill sons soda but overlooked water glasses.  Did return, took one of the glasses and filled it from the sink behind the booth.
Lovin' me some tepid tap water.
Hostess/manager passed by to ask how everything was.  I always say, if you really don't want to know how the meal is you visit the table right when someone puts a bite into their mouth.
Food was alright.
Service wasn't what I would have expected.

We used to come here pretty regularly as a family but the quality just hasn't been up to snuff and now the service.
