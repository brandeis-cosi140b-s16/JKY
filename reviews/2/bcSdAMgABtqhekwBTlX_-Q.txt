The saving grace for Escobar's is the decor/ambiance and the quality of food, but I would not go back given the poor service.  My boyfriend and I went here for our belated Valentine's Day dinner on Saturday and I had never been there before.  When I walked in, I was pleasantly surprised with the warmness of the decor.  It was very cute.

However, when we were seated, it took a very long time for our waiter to get to us.  The busboy also kind of tossed/threw the bread bowl on the table which was weird and definitely made me raise an eyebrow.

We ordered the guacamole appetizer and a caesar salad to start; my boyfriend ordered the hanger steak and I got the mushroom enchilada.  The guacamole was pretty good and both of us really enjoyed our entrees.  However, the salad failed to come and our waiter only noticed it once he brought over the entrees.  We still got the salad but it was pretty bland and unexciting, despite the enticing description on the menu.

The worst part of the evening was the service.  Even though our food was good, we could never find the waiter to refill our water or order dessert.  He took so long we ended up deciding not to get dessert at all.  

Even though the interior of the restaurant is cute, I would not go back.  Compared to other places in Chambana, the prices are high and I can also get really good food elsewhere.
