Oh, how I wanted to love this place . We always want to support the businesses in Slope. 

On a positive note, the horchata was excellent - not too sweet. The also have a great looking menu with tortas, tacos and cool apps. 

Unfortunately, the execution was horrible. We had to throw away both orders of elote (one of our favorite dishes). The corn was rubbery and SLATHERED in mayo. Also, no lime included. No lime with the elote? This was the very first time in my entire life I have had elote I didn't like. They need to send their cooks to Gallo Blanco to check out good elote. 

After seeing their PapaNachos dish on Facebook, we also ordered that. The picture showed cheesy waffle fries with jalapeños. Yes please! Like the elote, they were extremely disappointing. No jalapeños - just cheez wiz on waffle fries. Boring, soggy and gross. 

We didn't finish any of the 4 items we ordered and left extremely disappointed. I'm being nice giving it 2 stars. With so many good options around (Reyes, Gallo, etc), they are going to need to improve quickly to stick around.

Maybe their cooks need more training - not sure. I would skip this place for a bit until they get this figured out.
