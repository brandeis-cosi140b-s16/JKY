Average to good food if you're hungover or drunk. Haven't eaten there on any other occasion so can't speak to that. Might have given them three stars had it not been for the STUPID ASS CURB that extends PAST the drive through window on your right therefore forcing you to drive your car along the left side of the road like we're in god damn England. I LIVE IN AMERICA, LOS CERRITOS! I INSTINCTIVELY VEER MY CAR TO THE RIGHT SIDE OF ANY ROAD I'M ON. PLEASE DON'T BLOCK MY NATURAL PATRIOTISM WITH A GOD DAMN FOUR INCH PIECE OF CONCRETE.

So yeah, if you haven't guessed, I romp that curb every time I go through the drive through there and it moderately irritates me. 

Service is slow. Hot sauce is weak. Two stars is all they get.
