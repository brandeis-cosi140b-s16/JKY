This place has the potential to be an adult chuck e. cheese for happy-hour-nacho-and-beer-aficionados... however, thats not the experience I had. I sat down and immediately wondered what was in store. What followed (a bland burrito) was both surprising (not in a good way) and disappointing (for the obvious blandness). In short, the food left much to be desired. I did enjoy the kitschy ambiance but it did not make up for subpar food. Venture into this establishment at your own risk.
