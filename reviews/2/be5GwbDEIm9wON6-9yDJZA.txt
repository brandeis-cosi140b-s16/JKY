I feel like this is the P.F. Chang's of Mexican food.  I think that they are still working out a lot of kinks in service.  Our server was very sweet and pleasant but she was clearly overworked and the kitchen was slow.  The salsa tasted heavily of lime and no other flavor.  The chips were warm at least.  Ordered their house specialty of black chile pork.  I was expecting something redolent of spices and maybe even chocolate.  We got instead something tasty in a reddish oily sauce.  The pulled pork quesadilla was good, (and reminded me a lot of the black and blue quesadilla with its sweet flavor at Sam's cafe).  The burger was actually the best, with a juicy patty.  Ask for a side of chipotle rance, it'll make the skinny fries taste out of this world.  Not a bad choice at the biltmore, just not a destination place and not what I would go for if I was craving Mexican food.
