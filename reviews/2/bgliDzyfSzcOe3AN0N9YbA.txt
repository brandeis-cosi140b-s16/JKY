If you find yourself on a frontier or delta flight, AND you'd really like an overpriced ticket to intestinal distress HAVE I GOT THE SPOT FOR YOU!

My shrimp salad gets a two word review - "Sh*t Salad"

Horrifyingly bad food, syrupy sweet margaritas, and "What did I do in my previous life to deserve this" service.  

One extra star because it's the only booze game on this side of the airport.
