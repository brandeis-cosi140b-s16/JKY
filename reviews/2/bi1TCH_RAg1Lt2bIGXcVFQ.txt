With all the hype before this place even opened I epxected a whole lot better. There are so may flavors lacking in the basic tacos. The tamales are so generic and dry.
The place is nice and clean and the staff is friendly and the little salsa bar is a nice addition which I had to give this place 2 stars. If you want geat tacos go to Gallo Blanco or to Americas.
