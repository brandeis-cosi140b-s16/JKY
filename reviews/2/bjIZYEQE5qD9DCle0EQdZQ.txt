New to the area we visited for lunch with high hopes for authentic carne asada  tacos and Tostadas. The room and seating were good, the service was prompt and friendly, but the food fell flat. 
Everything tastes as though it came from a Sysco foods can, including the guacamole and salsa. We were comparing our food to Los Gemelos on Odana Rd where the meat tastes homemade, the salsa and guacamole are fresh, and prices feel almost too low.
