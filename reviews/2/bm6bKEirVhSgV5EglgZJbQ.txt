This is one of those reviews can be mistaken for someone who is very upset and saying things that are exaggerated. I don't exaggerate ever. We decided that after waiting an entire hour for our food that we should leave. Several weeks earlier, our experience there was pleasant and the food was very good. The truly most offensive part of this afternoon was that we waited an hour before we walked out but immediately before we walked out we witnessed a large group that was seated at least 45 minutes after us get their food. This is absolutely unacceptable and even though the food is good the best they're going to get for me is two stars and I consider that to be a generous review.
