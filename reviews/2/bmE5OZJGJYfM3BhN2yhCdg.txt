I really love this place but tonight not just the salsa but also the hot sauce was sour. Maybe it was because of xmas I assume theu closed. We asked for the manager and he brought out fresh salsa that was also sour. I cant think of any reason that would be acceptable. I know for a fact this placw jas a clean kitchen but maybe they need to revisit the inventory and product rotation. We got 10 percent off. But so me one please give me a reason why I should go back? Thank fully I did not get sick. Also let me add I love their crispy chicken tacos.  Tonight is just wasnt good.  Let me add that I have provably ate 100 of them over The last 15 years.
