Gotta go with Liz B on this one... I just don't like it. 

Much of this could be what I order, so I'll most certainly be back to try the things that folks here have raved about. But the positive reviews make me wonder if I'm missing something. The salsa is rough. Watery. Flavorless. I'd rather have Pace. And the chicken fajitas have no flavor. I don't understand! Throw meat onto a screaming hot skillet and your certain to build up a nice crust on the the outside. But nada. The rice and beans follow suit. Bland and boring. Again, maybe I'm not ordering the right things?
