not too thrilled. food is overpriced, the portions are mediocre, and while the ingredients are of decent quality, the result is very dull, and bland. Tried the Al Pastor Vampiro (this little... tostada thing), and the Carne Asada Burrito.. (though it was more like a taquito, in size), and refried beans. Beans were decent.. soupy though.
