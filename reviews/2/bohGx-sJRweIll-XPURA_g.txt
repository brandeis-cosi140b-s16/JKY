This place used to be great!  
What happened?

Came buy with the family for a nice Sunday dinner. Was sat immediately because the place was half empty. (should have guessed why) Then waited for 15 minuets for someone to come to the table. Because we were sat across from the wait station I could see and hear what the problem was. The wait staff was arguing over who's table we were. Finally the new girl was thrust upon us even though it was her first night and she. 
To their credit, the margaritas were very good when they finally came out. My wife ordered chicken enchiladas suisas. They were just "ok". she was disappointed because she had got them before and they were very good. I ordered a combo plate with a taco and a beef enchilada and rice and beans. Again, just "ok" but sub par from 90% of the other Mexican restaurants in town.
Our waitress did a great job considering it was her first night, (and the fact that I over heard another waiter deliberately try to sabotage her.) I felt bad for her.
I gave her a large tip because it is not her fault that the management is extremely poor in this restaurant.
