The food is always delicious. I have never eaten on site always order delivery. While the food is one of our favorites I have some serious complaints about the customer service. 
It is always hard to get a hold of someone to place an order and more often then not we are left 'on hold" which means placed on the counter to hear everyone's conversations.. 10 min later we are usually helped and it takes quite a while for the person to take the order down.
One of my biggest problem with Davids is we order for the office 4 different  meal orders, all being delivered to the same location, and each order is slapped with a delivery charge. ( most other lunch spots we order from divide that fee up or only charge once.)
Its a bummer when choosing lunch that we have started to look elsewhere so we don't have to deal with their customer service.
