Disappointed

 I've been wanting  to try G's food for a while now. I'm glad I went because I got it out of my system, but I won't be back. I guess I was expecting more because of all the positive reviews I had read. That's why I feel bad saying the food at G's is somewhat  bland and tasteless.

 Basically, G's Food offers speciality hot dogs.  In addition, to a buffet style hot dog bar which is a great idea for a restaurant, Unfortunately, it is very poorly executed. 

G's Food serves a mediocre hot dog at best. On out first vist we actually tried 3 different types of dogs. First, I ordered the Chicago Polish Dog and my lunch companion ordered the Ruben and Coney Dog.  The hot dogs and buns tasted somewhat stale. The food just wasn't very good. Although, G's offers numerous toppings from the buffet style bar, the items look and taste like they came straight from a can. 

Not the worst dogs I've ever eaten but definitely a contender.
