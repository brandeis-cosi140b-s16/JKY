Cozymel's is an ok place in terms of food. It is not great yet it is not awful it is merely decent. I had a beef burrito and it was to say the least mediocre. One reviewer said it best if you are in Vegas skip Cozymel's and find another place as I found Cozymel's to be both expensive and underwhelming. On a positive note Cozymel's has a very nice atmosphere. Also it is next to Hamada of Japan.
