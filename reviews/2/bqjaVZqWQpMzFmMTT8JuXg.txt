Speedy Street Tacos is NOT a must have for me. Their food is mediocre and highly over priced. For lunch (9.3.2015), I ordered a taco and quesadilla, both carne asada. The taco was good however not $3 good. I've had better for less. Quesadilla, OVER PRICED! More so then the taco. $4.99 + tax for a one that's 6-7" in diameter is ABSURD! Whoever stated the portions at this place were generous is LYING! I can go to just about any Mexican restaurant and order a carna asada quesadilla that's 3x bigger and tastier for the same price, this applies to their been/cheese burritos as well. A friend that joined me for lunch ordered one for $3.99 + tax and it was the same size as a $1 been/cheese from Taco Bell. Again, generous is far from the truth. The burritos from Vaquero's and Filiberto's are much larger and the beans taste freshly made. The beans according to my friend tasted as if they came out of can which I thought was hilarious because somebody also stated this in their review.
