My son and daughter wanted Si Senor's for dinner. We got their about 8pm not many people in the place. Our server was nice and timely with the drink, that was the plus side to my night.  After reading in the menu that the 1st bowl of chips & salsa are on the house, additional bowls will be 3bucks, told the kids this is the only chips they are getting. My daughter ordered the cheese enchilada dinner and it came with 3 huge enchiladas, which she enjoyed, my son ordered the chili rellenos which were also huge in size.  I ordered the shredded beef tacos combo, when I picked my 1st taco up, the filling feel right through breaking my shell, the meat was soggy like it was soaking in water, the other taco feel completely apart as well. The rice was lacking in flavor and the beans tasted like rosarita made them, I wasn't that impressed with the place so No Senor No Mas....
