Like other have said the service want great. There was nobody in line and 7 workers yet I walked up to order and waited over a minute before I was acknowledged. The girl was friendly though. When I got to the register there was nobody to help me bc someone was on the phone taking an order. The burrito was not very good. I had the pulled chicken one and the chicken and tortilla were fine but some of the rice was hard. I have never had hard rice in a burrito in my entire life. We will not go back.
