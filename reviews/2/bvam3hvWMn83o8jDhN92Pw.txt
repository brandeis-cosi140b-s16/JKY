Food is good.  Service wasn't too good.  Tables not cleaned quickly.  The food that had fallen on the table by the prior customer was just quickly swept to the floor with a rag that didn't smell very good.  Hard to get the server's attention. Server forgot to bring one drink and Served one beer in a cracked glass. Didn't have enough glasses to serve us.  Only had small foam take out trays rather than larger ones.  But... The food was good.
