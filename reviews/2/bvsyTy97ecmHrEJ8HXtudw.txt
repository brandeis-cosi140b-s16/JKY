I have generally had great experiences with the Fox Restaurants - not so this time.  Hubby and I dropped in on a Friday night (not many people there).  We sat on the patio where the misters are impressive I must say.  I ordered the Sangria - a big why bother and not worth the calories.  Then my fish tacos arrived. . . meh - just nothing exciting, I can whip up better ones at home without even trying.  The beans - not tasty (read boring) and the rice would pass for a dessert.  For a town that has a lot of Southwestern / Mexican  type restaurants one has to be on their game to do well in that genre.  This one is definitely not in the game.  Servers were good though it was like we had 2 and they neither one knew the other one had us covered.  It was a bit like a comedy.  Next time we will keep on walking to another restaurant.
