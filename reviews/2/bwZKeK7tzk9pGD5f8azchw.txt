Had been wanting to check this place out for a while. Decent sized and typical menu. I opted for an al pastor torta. Unfortunately when I got home realized I was given carnitas.

There was only one lady behind the counter. After finally being acknowledged my order was taken and she prepared my food. There was a salsa bar with 5 different salsas varying from mild to oh dang, that's hot. 

My torta was toasty with the required layer of beans on the bottom, layer of smooth guacamole, mayo, meat, lettuce and tomato. It was good, and filling.

I'm unsure of returning despite the food being good, as I was leaving and at the salsa bar stocking up I saw the order taker/ cook handle someone's money and go straight to the griddle where she was cooking. She did not wash her hands!! Now do you ask someone to was their hands and risk her (maybe) sabotaging their food? I tried putting that out of my head but it left me wondering if she had washed her hands after she took MY cash??
