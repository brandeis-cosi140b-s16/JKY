The restaurant itself is really nice and clean with a big outdoor patio area. As for the food, the salsa was eh and so were the chips. The burrito supreme with rice and beans was fantastic with a large portion size even at lunch. My son loved the kids beef nachos. What kills this place is the terrible service. There was 1 family guy working for 5-6 tables and he was very short and never asked how things were the entire time. They first brought out the wrong plate for my son and 10min went by without him even saying a word or even an apology so we had no idea if they were correcting it or when to expect it to even come out. Don't be cheap and hire more servers because you obviously have the business to justify it.
