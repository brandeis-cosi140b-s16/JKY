I had never been here before, but I had a buy one get one free coupon, so I figured I would check it out. The first thing that threw me off was the fine print on the coupon. It said buy one get one free, not to exceed $6. And most things on the menu are between 7and 10. So really, the coupon was a load and I was immediately irritated by that. 

We went around 1 in the afternoon and ordered the beef tacos plate and a burrito. The burrito was delicious, stuffed full and super tasty, made to order. The tacos were horrible. The ground beef was burnt and so greasy that the bottom of the tacos were soggy and falling apart by the time we got to the table, less than 5 minutes after being made. 

The service was okay for a to go place, friendly enough to get the job done, but not overly happy to help. Overall, I would probably go back for a burrito, if I had another coupon. But their prices and service, along with the bad first experience would not bring me back without a coupon.
