I moved all the way up to 2 stars because of the outside patio, and in the desert, that's a necessity. The food is good for a chain. The margaritas are good, and cheap. Service is alright, but why do they have to be so stingy on the chips? Is it so expensive to have more than one bowl of chips? Fail.
