I'm generally very fond of Rubio's, but this location just isn't up to snuff. The food is good, but somehow not quite as good as other locations (it doesn't seem as fresh). The restaurant isn't as clean as it should be, the tables are always kind of sticky, and the restroom... well, it smells like swamp gas (and not just once). Also some of the seats are town and have been "repaired" with large amounts of tape (the tape is worn and sticky and if you're a dude wearing shorts, it will pull the hair right off your leg!) ...To be fair, I guess it could pull the hair off a non-dude's leg too, but let's just not go there.
