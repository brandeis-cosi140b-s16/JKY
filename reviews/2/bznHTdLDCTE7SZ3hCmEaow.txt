Hmmm...

I don't know how they got such good reviews. Tacos were scarcely filled with the good stuff, the shells were also under fried. The beans were too runny as well.

I was so stoked to find a place near me, with good reviews. Guess I'll have to keep driving to Tempe for Taco Tuesday. I still think Fillibees on Broadway and Priest is where it's at.

Oh well!
