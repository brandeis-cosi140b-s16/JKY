We went on karaoke night so we had no issue with the off tune singing, in fact it was about the best thing in the restaurant. We were a bit disappointed by some of the bad language of the karaoke MC though. 

The hosted was great and she also took the time to joke with our daughters as we left. 

The waitress was less than helpful and seemed a little annoyed to even be there. When she took our drink order she told us there were no fountain drinks even though they were on the menu which meant "Mexican coke" was my wife's only option. This also meant no refills which is a tad annoying. When I asked which beer they had she just stared at me so I ordered the club sandwich of beers...coors light.

My wife ordered the pulpo mojo de ajo which had decent flavor but was swimming in oil and was too salty.

I kept looking at the menu for a plate to order but all that was listed was tacos and burritos for carne asada. Finally I asked if there was a carne asada plate and the waitress said yes with no price given or  explanation why there was no listing on the menu. The meat was very tough and flavorless but came with grilled red onions which were a nice touch.

Salsa was decent and the chips were fine but nothing stood out. 

We will keep on the search for a "go to" restaurant in our area but this one is not even on the short list.
