Wow felipitos, I can't believe I'm giving you  2 stars after all we've been through . Seriously , you were one of my favorite places until you tried ripping us off . 

First you make the all day special (5 taquitos with quac, sour cream, cheese, lettuce) 25 cents more expensive AND you give 50 percent LESS meat in it ? I feel like the taquito was vegetarian. Sorry but I like meat in my taquitos. 

And you think we didn't notice ? I see you .  I no longer crave your food anymore and I'm ready to try out the taquitos at Roberto's now. 

I will always remember how I loved the uniqueness of your little shack and the friendliness of your staff , however I get hungry and Id rather go to a place that gives me a decent amount of meat . 

Ta-ta until your taquitos come back .....  :)
