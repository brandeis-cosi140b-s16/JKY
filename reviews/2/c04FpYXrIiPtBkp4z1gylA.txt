I tried out Rubys Food truck tonight. Ordered the adobada taco and a carne asada quesadilla. The taco was awesome ! The quesadilla had good flavor but once I bit in I found a hair in my quesadilla. I immediately called back and they offered a new quesadilla, refund, and were sincerely sorry. I still recommend it but I want Ruby's Food Truck to still be accountable on yelp. My advice is to still give it a chance but if food safety is really important to you like me I say skip it!
