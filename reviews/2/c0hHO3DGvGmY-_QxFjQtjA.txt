Fist I will say the staff is friendly and the patio has a great view. They have pretty good drink specials. Really the only reason I would ever come here again is to drink on their patio.

The food is quite bland. I mean, the "salsa" is like runny marinara with some onions in it. I ordered the veggie burrito with no cheese. The thing was loaded with rice and lettuce, save for a few carrots, peas, and corn here and there. There was no seasoning, or none noticeable. It's wasn't all bad though, at least the ingredients were fresh and not over/under cooked.

As stated, this would be a good place to have a drink on the patio, not so much for lunch, and definitely not for impressing others.
