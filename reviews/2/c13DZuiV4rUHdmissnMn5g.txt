Rule 1: Don't expect brilliant Mexican food in a suburban restaurant.
Rule 2: When the clientele in said restaurant has a large number of mom-jeans-wearing WASPs, rule 1 x 10.

 Z'Tejas promises "Mexican-inspired" cuisine but they deliver a tepid blend of ingredients that do little to inspire one's tastebuds.  The baked seafood enchilada had next to no taste, and when combined with a cardboard-like texture it was entirely unappetizing.  The fish tacos were slightly better but a Filet-'O'-Fish is more drool-inspiring.  

On the positive side, the cornbread wasn't bad and the service was reasonably attentive, but it's not enough to rescue the poor offerings from the kitchen.
