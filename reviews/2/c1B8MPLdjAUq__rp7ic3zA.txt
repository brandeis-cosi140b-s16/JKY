My conclusion after dining here for the first time is that hubby and I  have had all of these menu items before- and done better at other restaurants. The chips, carne asada, and carnitas were all sub-par. The rice was pretty good, however, as was the guacamole. The waiter had no clue about what type were the beers listed on the menu. The one shining star was the flan: perfectly smooth and creamy, and one of the best I've ever had. I'll be back for dessert- but ONLY for that.
