I was unimpressed with Tapas 51. The lighting was extremely bright, reminding me of the interrogation rooms on tv. The chili coffee crusted brisket tacos were just okay with little flavor. We had to spit out several fatty and gristly pieces. The grilled shrimp pupusa was delicious with multiple flavors and textures. The chorizo brussel sprouts were good but nothing to write home about. The Colombian chorizo sliders were pretty good. I was extremely disappointed with our waitress as she was lacking in personality, never cracked a smile, and never said you're welcome when thanked for bringing out items. We waited entirely too long for her to run our credit card considering the lack of other customers. We never got a visit from the manager or chef even though the chef could be seen outside the kitchen a couple of times. If the customer service were better it would certainly have improved our experience.
