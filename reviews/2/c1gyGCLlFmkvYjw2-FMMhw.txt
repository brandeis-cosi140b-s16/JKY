I don't understand how my office continually ends up at this place when we go out of the office to eat.

Food is horrible (fake orange plasticy cheese on everything). Even the Caldo de Questo has that gross cheese. Yuck. I've eaten here MANY times and the best thing I've had have been the Huevos Rancheros (and 'the best' is a relative statement).

The redeeming parts of the place are the patio and the "bar/cantina" area. Fun when you're in a group of people. They have some margarita specials during happy hour (no food specials during happy hour though) that are decent. Other than that, stay away from this place.
