The chips, salsa, and bean dip was the best part. Service was slow. Mistakes in food order. Shredded beef? Where's the beef? Nachos had maybe 2 spoons of beef. The Beef meal was mainly rice and beans. My dads Pepsi was mainly ice and carbonation. We spent a lot of time correcting the order or reminding them. 

I was very confused by the massive amounts of olives on my nachos. One there was more olives than beef, second, WHY THE CRAP ARE THEY ON THERE? Disgusting!!!!
