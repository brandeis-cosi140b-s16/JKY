not bad, but not all good either.  ordered the carne asada burrito with black beans and rice. meat was a bit dry and chewy. The burrito was wrapped like a giant ball......kind of strange. a bit pricey as well. burrito and a small drink almost 10 bucks. YIKES! After my lunch I thought I would use the mens room to clean up before returning to work. OMG the bathroom was dirty and had a stinch like it was backing up. It had a very bad fowl smell and almost made me vomit....no lie! May return but not to this location. Would suggest to take your own beverage to save a couple of bucks.
Oh, one more thing was not to crowed but the ambiance was cold and noisy inside. Music was very loud and the crowd noise even though it was not to crowed was fairly loud as well. The accoustics are not good at  all.
