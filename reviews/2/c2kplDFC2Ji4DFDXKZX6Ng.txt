Excellent chicken that I like more than some of the other quick service tex-mex places; HOWEVER, the quesadilla comes with no extras. Salsa is 99 cents, quac us 99 cents.  I can understand the quac, although the portion size is a partially filled 2 oz container, but to pay for salsa??  The quac does not compare to chipotle. And I wouldn't pay for it again.  The rice and beans are decent, but I would gladly give them up for some salsa!
