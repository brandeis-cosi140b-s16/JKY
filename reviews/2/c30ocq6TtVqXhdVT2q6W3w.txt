Why can't there be a decent Chipotle around my area?

Went for lunch with my wife yesterday and the dumb girl and guy making our lunch scooped up the beans and didn't drain them so I got a spoon full of liquid that went running out and they had to switch tin foil twice. He then scooped the mild salsa and got a spoon full of liquid and I had to ask him to please drain that out of my burrito as it was running all over the place. He couldn't get the burrito closed because the soggy shell tore and I though he was going to do a new one but nope, just closed the foil up around it.

I got it to the table and the burrito was a soggy mess and my basket was full of liquid. My wife's salad had a half inch of liquid in the bottom of her bowl and she threw 3/4 of it away because it was soup.

I love Chipotle but hate the two locations that are close to me.
