No beans in a carnitas burrito?? Wtf?  I arrived in the Phoenix airport tired and hungry after being stuck on a crappy flight in steerage from the other side of the country.  I needed some food in me and there were very few choices.

The service was fast and the people at the counter friendly enough.  The burrito itself was disappointing and unhealthy without the benefit of being flavorful.  It is one thing to indulge in a guilty pleasure (think cake, donut, similar) and trade the fat and highly refined grains in exchange for something delicious every now and again.  But to get a white flour tortilla with unremarkable meat and nothing else is hardly worth the calories.  How about some guac or salsa (inside the burrito), some flavor in the meat, or at least some BEANS?  Fail.  I got on my next flight unsatisfied, with sticky fingers from the burrito falling apart on me, and a vow to never return here again.
