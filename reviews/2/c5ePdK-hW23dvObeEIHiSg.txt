I normally go here because it's so close to my house,  but tonight, the service was terrible. Went through the drive thru around 1:30 am and sat there for about five minutes.....no answer. So I pull up to the pay window to get anyone's attention....aaaaaand nothing. I pull around the front and see the workers standing behind the counter through the front window. How can you not hear or see anyone?! So I finally manage to get the kid's attention...and let me tell you, this kid did not look fully there....if you know what I mean. Yeah, im sure you catch my drift. Absolutely love filibertos but sadly, I won't be back to this location for a while.
