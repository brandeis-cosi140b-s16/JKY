Crispy Calamari" limp. Carnitas torte lacking meat, got 3/4 thru it then i was eating a avocado sandwich. Server said it came with a side of vegetable which were the carrots and jalapenos out of the jar. The  shrimp Diablo lunch taco two measly pieces of shrimp wrapped in two measly pieces of bacon in the tortilla with and and ice cream scoop of beans and rice for $8.00.... It was not Diablo at all. Shrimp is not that expensive. Chips and hot sauce nothing great. Disappointed
I hear their fajitas are good and they well should be for $29.00.... Server was very nice....
