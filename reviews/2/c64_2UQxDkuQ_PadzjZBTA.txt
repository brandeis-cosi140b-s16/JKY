Sigh... late night munchies hit me in a big way - long week, long night... Desperate, I went online to see who was still delivering at 1:00am. Burrito Drive jumped to the top of the list.

Ordered a "make your own burrito" (braised pork, tomato, cilantro, hot salsa) and a side of chips and nacho cheese. 

+ Website is phenomenally easy to use for placing online orders
+ They communicate flawlessly - confirmation of order, order being prepared, order out for delivery notifications
+ SUPER fast delivery. Ordered at 12:48am, had food before 1:00am - crazy
+ Driver was super nice and friendly

- Burrito still sucks. 100% flavorless. I had to disassemble the burrito and add a healthy dose of salt, pepper, and hot sauce before it had any flavor. Ugh. It's huge - I mean, massive, but what good is a 10-lb pile of tasteless, pasty burrito?
- Chips and cheese were disappointing; the majority of the chips were par-cooked and super greasy. Nothing like chewing on a tortilla chip that resembles a soggy, oil-filled rawhide. Yuck.
- Hot salsa wasn't included on the burrito, but rather as a side item with the nachos. Why is this?

I must not have been intoxicated enough to enjoy this, because it was truly not very good at all.
