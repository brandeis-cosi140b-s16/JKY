Located in a very run-down strip mall, if you're going to go you have to be prepared for the hole-in-the-wall place that this is. When I was there, there was only one employee in the place (Noon on a Thursday). And they had no customers. The guy was nice, took my order and cooked it up. Food was fine, but I won't likely go back.
