Not my favorite by far.  I've eaten inside once and had delivery through a local service. 

My friend and I first had a late Saturday lunch weeks back when weather still couldn't decide if it was was winter or spring.  For an appetizer we ordered the table side guacamole... the large portion.

Our server arrived at our table with a cart containing all the ingredients (even a convenient tip jar prominently in front) and two, yes, two small avocados.  When I asked if this was the large portion, she merely nodded as if she didn't understand or didn't know.  $9.95 for this in which we were finished in moments each having about 5 scoops.

You would expect guacamole to be served with chips.  While we were presented with an initial serving and salsa, we were out of chips in no time having none for our remaining salsa.  We did finally get some more but no salsa making them kinda pointless after just moments.  When we did ask for more while waiting for our meal, they kindly obliged not bothering to note only the first two orders were complimentary tacking around $3 to the check without note.  I did complain to the manager noting we never got but one initial serving of salsa and had to use the first serving of chips for our meager guacamole appetizer.  He did offer to remove the charge taking our word as to the situation.

I only wish there was an El Chico or Don Pablo's in the area as I've never been disappointed with those experiences.
