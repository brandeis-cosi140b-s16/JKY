This place has decent food but I am surprised by the people who gave it 4 or 5 star rave reviews. It's not bad, but it's nothing special either. 

I went in on Sunday for a late lunch with 3 other people. We all liked our food but agreed that it was pretty much the same as any other Mexican restaurant. I was a little disappointed since the menu did not have a lot of choices and what was there was pretty basic. One of the people at the table ordered the combo plate they were told that they were out of tamales so she had to sub another taco. So, the four of us got chicken rolled taquitos, beef fajitas, carne con chile, and tacos. Wow, real exciting stuff. 

The pluses for this place are the variety of salsa that come with chips before the meal and the free sopapillas. Again, nothing really wowed my taste buds, but both were a nice touch. 

The waitress was very friendly but the service was spotty. She refilled our drinks before they were even empty but failed to notice that we did not have napkins or silverware until we pointed it out to her... after our meals had been brought out. 

Overall I didn't hate it; but I will not be back again since there are other Mexican joints closer to my house that have the same boring food so it really is not worth the drive for me.
