It's 2:30pm on a Saturday and the place is not even a quarter full, so basically it's empty here and we waited a long time for someone to come to our table and take our drink order.  Then it took a long time for the waiter to come.  We ordered table side guacamole and it took forever to come.

The food was not that great which reminded us why we never go here.  We got a chicken tostada and the chicken was extremely dry and tasted nasty.  Everything else was fair.

This is a very loud place, many people come for birthday celebrations as they sing to you with a large sombrero on your head and make you take a shot, not bad.

Overall, there are a lot better Mexican places in this town if you don't mind driving.  My wife wanted something quick and she got what she came for, bad food and excess gas...

We will not go back, there are just too many other choices around.
