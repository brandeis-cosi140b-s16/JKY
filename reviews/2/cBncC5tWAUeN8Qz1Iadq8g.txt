This was my first trip in to this place and I was not impressed. The service was fine - nice, speedy, polite. It's the food I had an issue with. I have never been to a Mexican establishment that charged for green salsa when they give chips and salsa for free. It turned me off a little. Then the food came and my burrito (boracho burro) was rather bland. My dining partner got a carne asada burro and his was very dry. I just was not impressed with the food at this establishment.
