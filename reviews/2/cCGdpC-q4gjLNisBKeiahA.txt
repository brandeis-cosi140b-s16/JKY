If I had to sum up Gardunos in a word it would be bland. Bland rice, bland guacamole, bland fish tacos, even bland Shrimp Diablo. How can Shrimp Diablo be bland? Not a hint of spice, that's how. Shrimp Diblando. Gardunos is designed for people from the mid-west and east coast who aren't used to eating Mexican food, let alone spicy Mexican food: basically, a sexed-up Taco Bell with a tiny tequila selection.
