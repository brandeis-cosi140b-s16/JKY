We have been to Raul & Theresa's a few times.  Let me start by saying that my wife is hispanic and has spent alot of time in Mexico eating authentic Mexican food.  We are not impressed.  The decor is old and not very clean.  The whole place smells like cooking oil and so will your clothes when you leave.  The food is over spiced and still not very tasty.  I dont think we will be returning.
