Happy Hour.  That's the only reason I will go to Macayo's.

The food is sub par.  I have no idea how it can be called authentic. 

I do have friends who love this place and of course, to each their own.  I just can't.  

Service is dependent upon the mood of your server.  You will either get prompt service with a smile, or the slowest service with a side of attitude!  If you're lucky you'll get the ever popular "eye roll".
