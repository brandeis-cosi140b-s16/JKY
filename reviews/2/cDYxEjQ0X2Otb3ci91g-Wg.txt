I like the location and the bar area and the little patio, it's relaxing.  Service was very good.

Now for the food yikes:

Chips and salsa, chips are good and light and thin.  Salsa is watery and has no flavor, the hotter salsa was a bit thicker and tasted better.

Ordered like someone else mentioned, the carna asada chimi.  It was huge but I also got the thick chunks of meat inside, I've never seen carne asada look like that.  The worst part is the chimi was very salty.  The rice had no flavor either, so overall it was horrible, and it was expensive.

I'm hard pressed to order any food again, possibly just drinks and hang out.
