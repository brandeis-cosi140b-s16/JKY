Food:  Below average.  I tried the rib eye steak, lacked seasoning. My wife had the milanesa, it was crispy and slightly above average.  The fresh guacamole was also just average, not great.  The fried icecream was terrible. Nothing like stale soggy cornflakes to ruin good ice cream.

Service: Terrible. After sitting unattend for the first 6 minutes a server brought us chips, salsa, and their bean dip; he left before we could ask for drinks. Five minutes later someone came and took our drink order. About 20 minute in we got our drinks and ordered. They brought my steak without a steak knife and forgot my tortillas, but I didn't notice till the waiter stepped away. Since they were no were to be seen, I mushed through it with a butter knife.  Later in the meal they did refill our waters a few times.  As we were finishing up, they were very quick to clear away our plates.


Overall, the food is far from special.  The service was slow and unattentive. I would not recommend this place to a friend and I would never return.
