I wouldn't say it's terrible, but also not my first pick for Mexican food in the area. I've had the carnitas and carne platters in the past and thought they were fine. Tonight, however, we decided to take advantage of their Tuesday specials on burritos and tacos...

Chicken burrito -- decent marinade (although it may be a tad too spicy for some), and that's about it. They did not do a good job of trimming the fat and gristle, which I recalled of their other meats as well. I understand that fat is good for cooking, but I don't want big chunks of it in my burrito. 

Beef taco -- nothing particularly wrong with it other than its total lack of flavor. They must use a low grade of beef, which is fine except that it's tough and seemingly not at all marinated. It's like the opposite of the chicken, which I don't understand. Isn't beef easier to marinate?

Rice and beans -- as others have noted, they just aren't at all exciting. What a shame, since nothing else on the menu particularly stands out. 

I think I'll be avoiding Federico's in the future. There are too many other good options nearby.
