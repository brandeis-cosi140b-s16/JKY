In the middle of the Luxor hotel, is this very average pseudo-mexican place. 
We had fish tacos, tostada salad and neither tasted anything beyond 'edible' in my book. Even their chips & salsa were below average. 
Normally, the tostada salad bowl is wonderful to eat, especially as its fried (..yum) ....these guys seem to use a pre-prepared bowl that was as appetizing as cardboard. 
I agree with a prior reviewer - that the waitress is a bit of a 'wench'.  She wore a football jersey (Number 24, I think), and was curt (just a hair's  breadth away from being rude). One person I did not feel bad giving a good tip to. 
The nearby fast food court would have been a better bet.
