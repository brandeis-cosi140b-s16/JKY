The 2 previous reviews want you to believe this is the best mexican party place around.

I must have missed the party because at 12 noon it was completely DEAD-no lunch crowd.

And they failed to mention this is in the Commercial Center plaza. A very scary place to go let alone eat.

Well the place is huge seating for 100+ people and a large stage plus private boothes.

The chips are hard & flavorless and the salsa too tomatoey and no spice at all. NO BEANS either.

The prices were very moderate and the portions were fair but nothing really special.

I ordered the Carne Asada plate for $10-the carne asada was nice & tender but it was not charbroiled as the description on the menu claimed.

The pico was weak and the jalapeno had no spice at all.

MY wife had a carne asada taco which was pretty large and also a cheese enchilada which was the highlight of the entire meal.

I was disappointed with the cleanliness of the place since there was NO crowd and it was also pretty lackluster food, NOT spicy at all.

Thank goodness I had a restaurant.com coupon for $10 OFF.
