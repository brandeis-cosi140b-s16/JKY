We live in the area and have an easy walk to Mejico. I wanted to follow an earlier reviewer's advice about a great happy hour (Christine) but unfortunately we were extremely disappointed. We arrived on a Friday afternoon about 4 PM, on a night when Bink's across the street was closed for a private party. Mejico looked nice, we liked the vibe. But man, this is not a Happy Hour. This is a Sad Hour. What's so special about really, really miniature street tacos or a $3 cheese quesadilla that is so small it is literally only three small bites? Happy Hour is, for us, a time to experience a new place -- to get a feel for the ambiance, the menu items and so forth. For example, go to Happy Hour at Beckett's Table and you get a feel for their menu and their flavors. At Mejico, they take a tiny 6" flour tortilla, put a tiny amount of cheese in it and roll it over. It was a ripoff, and I don't say that lightly because anything you get for $3 has got to be small (so assume this is REALLY small). The special happy hour margarita was just a much smaller version of their real margarita, and so forth. Basically, we'll never go back and the owner lost out on the opportunity to get a new set of regulars. All you have to do is treat happy hour as if it is special -- and give a warm welcome. In this case, the smell of pot wafting into the front of the house from the kitchen and the glazed look on the two waiters faces was a bit much. When one of them asked how we enjoyed the food and we told them what a bad value it was, he simply smiled and walked away. This place is s short-timer, and thats a shame because mid-town is a potentially cool area and the owner spent some money on the inside.
