It was a busy day for them on account of the lunch hours, and they had the longest line in the food court area. They ask you what you like as you get up to the front, and I wanted a burrito however when I looked at the rice it had Cilantro on top of it, and I dislike the taste of that, so I was going to skip on that but before I can tell him that he placed it on the burrito without asking then asked what I wanted next.

I am not one to make a scene and the workers looked pissed off as hell from dealing with tourist all day so I didn't complain and just picked some other toppings. 

I found a seat thank goodness to sit down. I tried the rice and of course hated it so I ate only partly one side of my burrito. What a waste

Well I won't go here next time
