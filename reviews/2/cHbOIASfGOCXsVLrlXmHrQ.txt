Hard rice, oversalted steak and a limited menu -- what more could you ask for? :-/

I ate at the bar, and my bartender was friendly and efficient ... no bad-service reports here. 

But this is a restaurant last I checked, and I'm amazed at how they're able to get away with such bad food. Oh, yes, that's right. It's because this terminal has no other options!
