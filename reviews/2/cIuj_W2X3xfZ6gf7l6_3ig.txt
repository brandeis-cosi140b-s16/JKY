Went out for dinner tonight at garcia's.  I have been here a few times recently and it is looking a little weathered.  Tonight we arrived and waiting in the entrance I noticed that no one bothered to greet me.  When it time to be seated they took me to my booth which sad a pretty loud section. After being left at the table we waited a few minutes but noone showed up to get our drink order.  At some point someone brought us chips.  We waited,  decided on our order, chatted and ate chips.  While we waited saw other people getting served.  Eventually after about fifteen minutes and most of the chips,  we decided to leave.  On the way out someone tried to take our order but we went to  Serrano instead.
