Ok the wait to get in was only 5min to get in . Dinner was like 30 min . 
Food not to bad . However as long as I waited for the food . I got it cold and Luke warm . 
Fish tacos where good . I think much better if they came hot . The only thing that seem really hot was my wife sizzling chicken fajitas . 
Even the soup was freankin cold . How do you F up on that ??? 
Will I come back ??? Maybe ?
