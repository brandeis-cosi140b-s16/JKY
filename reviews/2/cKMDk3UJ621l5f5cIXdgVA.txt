Sometimes it's really hard to do Mexican food fast, fresh, and tasty. I wish I could at least say that they've got the fast part down, but that isn't the case. The place was practically empty and it still took 15 minutes to get two tacos. Food was bland, so I loaded up on salsa and lime juice on top of the tacos. Even Chevy's is better than this.
