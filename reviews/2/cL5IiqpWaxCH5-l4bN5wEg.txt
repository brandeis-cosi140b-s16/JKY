I cannot lie, I was exited to come here and I had high expectations. I seen this place on Man Vs Food and have been wanting that Torta ever since. I must say, I'm not impressed. I'm from Los Angeles Ca., the land where some of the best and most authentic food come from. So I always have higher expectations when it comes to Mexican food. This  was def not mi amor. I would say this isn't MexiCAN food but more like MexiCANT. No bueno
