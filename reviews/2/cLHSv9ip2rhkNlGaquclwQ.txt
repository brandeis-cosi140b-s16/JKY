Food is your average chipotle food but the service is awful. When I tried to give them a very specific order the employee started making my food before I finished and just ignored me and ended up getting it wrong but made me feel bad that it was already made that I payed for it anyways and did not enjoy it that much. Line is always long and slow very disorganized and rude crew I try to avoid this location as much as possible.
