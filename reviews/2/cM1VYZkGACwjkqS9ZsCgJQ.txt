Uhhh, I think my neighbor is on crack.  He said, "Julio G's is the best!...blah blah blah...the food is so good...blah blah blah"  When he should have said, "Dude, stay the hell away from Julio G's, their steak effing tastes like cardboard."

I'd give it 1 star, but I reserve that for restaurants that have exceptionally bad service as well as food. J.G's had decent service, awful food.

I can't think of a single good reason to go to Julios G's.
