My son and I were so excited when we saw the Pepe's was taking over the old Baja Fresh place. I was excited because I had heard from a coworker that they have an incredible carne asada burrito. My son was excited because he's a 16 y/o boy and two things excite him, food being one of them. Every time we came around the corner and saw the progress that was being made we giggled like school girls.

So it opened and we went and we were not all that impressed. I got the burrito and it was as good as advertised. My wife got the shredded beef tacos which honestly are the best we've had in Las Vegas. My son's food was only okay.

The place is just kinda dingy. And that was after being open for just one day. The people at the counter were not very friendly and never smiled. There wasn't a clean table to be found. And the unsmiling, unfriendly worker became more unsmiling and unfriendly when we asked if someone could wipe a table down for us.

I went a couple of days later to get a chorizo and eggs burrito...... I do love burritos! The girl tells me that will be $7. "For a chorizo and egg burrito?" I ask. She points to the menu and it's a full on meal with rice and beans. I ask what the price is without rice and beans and she tells me it's the same. Come on now!

The salsa cups are way too small and the red and the green sauce runs all over your fingers and drips back in to the vat. Now I keep my hands impeccably clean. Julia Childs would be so proud of me. But I don't know which person before me was picking their nose or had left the bathroom unwashed. I'm not really a germaphobe, but seriously!

I'll go back for the burrito or the shredded beef, but I'll use the red sauce I took from Fausto's

Last but not least........ what self-respecting taco stand has coke products? Really? Coke? You gotta have the Pepsi!
