So this is my regular Taco Bell because it is right by my place.. I have had good and bad experiences here, but the bad outweigh the good.. Tonight is one of many that my order was completely wrong.. Nothing is worse than not eating much all day and deciding to spring for Taco Bell and your food being made wrong.. I ordered a tostada and two spicy chicken tacos with no lettuce.. They all came with a ton of lettuce.. I absolutely hate lettuce and spent a lot of time picking every single piece off..to top it off my chicken tacos didn't even have the sauce that it comes with.. Not like anyone reads yelp reviews for a fast food place but needless to say I'm Disappointed:(((((
