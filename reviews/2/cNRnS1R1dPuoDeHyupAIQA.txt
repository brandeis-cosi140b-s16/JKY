One star for the environment very laid back and classy. Food on the other hand was not quality that we expected. Enchiladas were over powered by cheese and too soggy, and runny eggs. The tenderloin we asked medium rare definitely no taste nor quality the taste of the raw meat was not pleasing. Cocktails were not up to par either. Although service was great one more star.
