I had heard amazing things about this place. In all fairness the group I was with said the food was alright. However, they did not offer ANY chicken or vegetarian options which are more my style so I did not eat here even though I'd been dying to try it. Additionally, the lines were insanely long. For me certainly not worth it and my party agreed, there are a million other taco places where I have at least one option.
