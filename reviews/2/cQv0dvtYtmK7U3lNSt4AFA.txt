Gave Hot Taco two chances because we really wanted a go-to Mexican spot in South End. The chips are light/crispy and the Bel-Air, a "house infused jalapeno tequila," was good. 

Otherwise the food we tried -- tacos, enchiladas and quesadillas -- were bland at best. Besides the decor, they've made little effort to provide a quality or differentiated Mexican food experience. 

For good tacos, we'll continue to hit Bakersfield or Phat Burrito. For generic Mexican, you'd be better served at Azteca or any of the many Mexican joints on South Blvd.
