I was very excited to try the tacos at El Birotazo. A half hour drive from the other side of town, but no matter. Happy to drive if the tacos are great, but these were mediocre at best. Flavorless really. How can Chicharron have no taste? Barbacoa tacos, tacos dorados, and the tacos al vapor were all very bland.  Nothing distinctive, nothing special, below average flavor. Service was friendly, attentive and quick. 

Shout out to Donut Tyme next door.
