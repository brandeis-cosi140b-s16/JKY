I love this place but it is best to go here when your planning on getting trashed.  If your going here sober & staying sober you will be highly annoyed.  NEVER sit in the blonde hair'd bartenders area.  This guy is the WORST bartender I have ever encountered.  He moves at his own slow pace, he is never friendly, takes forever to help, & is just an all around terrible bartender.  One time there I stood at the bar a half hour waiting for him to ask me what i'd like, in that half hour I watched him help multiple people twice before getting around to me, even stopped & picked up his phone to text before coming over to ask what i'd like to drink.  When I confronted him about it he denied texting & I told him I was standing there watching him.  Yesterday I was there sitting at the bar when it was slow & after a half hour of waiting for him to ask what i'd like I stopped a waitress to get service.  When your sitting at a bar you should never have to get a server to help you.  Bartender should be on point.  When I asked him to close out my tab it took him 25 minutes.  

Besides this guy the place is really fun.  The chicken tacos are amazing, eat them everytime I go here & the chiros are pretty awesome as well.  Good tv's for watching football & always really hot women.  But like I said, only go there if your getting trashed & avoid that bartender!
