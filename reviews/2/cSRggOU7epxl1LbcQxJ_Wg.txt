We went here yesterday for lunch, it wasnt packed at all and the lunch prices are good. They start you off with chips and salsa. Nothing special at all, I usually love chips and salsa but this salsa was straight up pace picante or somethng similar. Do not go to this place and expect authentic mexican food. We then ordered drinks, Javier had a margarita on the rocks, he loved it and was the perfect flavor and perfect amount of alcohol. We both then got the fajita lunch special, he got chicken with the flour tortillas and I got beef with corn tortillas. It came out in a small skillet but I think it was a perfect portion, I left not feeling too full. Javier on the other hand was too full. He ate the flour tortillas, which were very thick and looked like pancakes. I preffered the corn, not as filling and doesnt leave you stuffed. Im glad I tried this place, I will go back if Javier wanted to, but I wasnt impressed. I could make the same thing at home.
