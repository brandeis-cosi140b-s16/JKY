I walked out of Ru Ru's the first time thinking the place had great potential. They definitely need to work on their service - it's slow and having all the staff linger around the bar, chit chat and eat there seemed a little weird/unprofessional? But whatever, place seems cool - I'd come back here with friends! The ambiance is beautiful and I was already envisioning spending many warm afternoons and evening on their patio enjoying a margarita or two. I came back a week later with some friends and this time we walked out just after a round of drinks and apps because the food was unimpressive and some aspects of the service were pretty bad too. My first time there we tried all the tacos and while the two chicken ones (fried & grilled) were really good, the others were mediocre. My second visit there we had the chips and guac, wings and calamari. The calamari was good, the guac was ok, but the wings were very gamey. What really drove us out though were the drinks. Aside from taking forever to get to us, they weren't even good. We also had a live bartending lesson going on behind our table at the bar, because of which they turned off the music. Really? 
we had to request it be turned back on (which they did eventually) because the place was really quiet and we could hear the step by step instructions on how our drinks were being prepared. Nothing wrong with that, but it was killing the vibe a bit. It's a great location, great set-up, perhaps it's still a diamond in the rough and needs a little more time?
