This is an overture review for Viva Mercado. We went there for my husbands birthday in March wth a large party. We ordered and ate and the food was pretty good....BUT, the server came over and insisted we pay cash! They said their credit card machine was " down" and suggested we use their fee atm on premises. This seemed very fishy given that the place was full and no mention was made as we (or anyone else) arrived that cash was required. It would have been nice if we had been advised BEFORE we ordered that cash was needed. obviously after we ate it was very inconvenient to be asked for cash, given most people do not carry hundreds of dollars unless they are strippers or drug dealers. So, perhaps this was some sort of an effort to boost their atm fee revenue. When my husband questioned the manager, the very large cook came out of the back as a show of force. Their food is pretty good...but I won't go back. An apology would have been nice or perhaps a free desert??? Oh well.
