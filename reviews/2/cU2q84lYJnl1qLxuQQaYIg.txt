This used to be a favorite of my family, but our last couple of visits not so much. After a dissatisfied service a few months ago we gave it a break and then tried again today. And again disappointing. Service was definitely lacking. Waiter didn't fully know the lunch specials, before they had a paper that came with the menus showing lunch specials but not any more. Food was satisfactory at best and from what I was told of my group. As for mine, I decided to step away from my regular enchiladas and try the shrimp burrito that was I believe $14. That definitely was nothing special especially in presentation. A burrito on a plain plate, no sour cream, no lettuce.
Roberto's and Fausto's in the area have a shrimp burrito for half the price that kills this.

 Something here has changed from what it's been in the past.
