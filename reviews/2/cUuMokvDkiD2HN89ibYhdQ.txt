Way overrated! Very limited menu,  basically all you have to choose from are appetizers & tacos. They do not serve rice or any sides with your meal. Super small portions. I can't remember the last time I left a restaurant hungry, until tonight. I've had better tacos from a street vendor. Over price sangria that tasted like I was drinking watered down grape juice. Took forever to get our check. I was with a party of 6 and not one of us would return. 
VERY disappointing!
