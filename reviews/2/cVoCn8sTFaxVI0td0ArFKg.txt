Eh, had expected a lot more out of this place after reading the reviews and craving Mexican food here in Mesa.  Didn't quite deliver.

I needed a drink so I ordered a Golden Caddy margarita on the rocks - hold the salt, please.  This thing was good.

The food?  Not so much.  

I ordered the steak fajitas ($1.25 extra for NY Strip, which I ordered).  Well, when my food arrived, I saw a thin, low-quality, NY Strip steak in its entirety.  No strips.  No flaming fajita platter.  Nothing.  

I sliced my steak into strips and went ahead and filled one of my two flour tortillas.  The tortillas were quite big.  As a result, my entire steak filled about half of my first tortilla, leaving me with an extra tortilla and no meat.  My steak came with a side of rice, refried beans, and a little bit of chopped lettuce.  My meal really sucked.  

After I left this place, I immediately went to Sonic and ate grease (popcorn chicken) because I was still hungry.

Can't wait to hit the gym when I get back to the East Coast. 

So much for having a nice last meal in Arizona.
