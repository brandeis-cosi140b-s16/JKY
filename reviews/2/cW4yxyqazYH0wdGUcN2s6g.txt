Don go here if you're looking for American Mexican food. Service is ok. We were told to seat ourselves inside and then the host acted all butt hurt when he came in and saw where we sat ourselves! 
The guacamole appetizer is $6.95 for about 3/4 of a cup, so not worth it. BTW, chips and salsa are NOT complimentary, you only get them if you purchasable appetizer. Never heard of this at a Mexican restaurant.
The drink menu is larger than the food menu. We had the carnitas, it was good. 
Overall, we wanted to walk out when we first got there and wish we had. The carnitas was good, but not worth the overall experience. We were there while on vacation with another family and they will not split the bill for you and the add gratuity over five people. No Bueno!
