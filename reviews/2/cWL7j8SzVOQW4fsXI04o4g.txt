Stopped in for lunch. Restaurant is large; it's hard to imagine there being much of a wait during prime dinner times. The staff is friendly and attentive, but the food... not so much.

Chips are fine; salsa is OK, and you also get a small bowl of warm refried beans. Prices are fair in regards to portion size. I do like that the vegetables they use are very fresh; I hate getting veggie enchiladas, etc. that use frozen, poorly cooked vegetables. The zucchini was fresh, crisp, and pretty good. The rice and beans were too salty in my opinion. Food was average at best.

Definitely not the best Mexican food I've had; I am surprised at the high rating. However, service was good (our drinks were never empty, and we didn't have to ask for a refill on chips). The server also asked about how we wanted our check split, which helped avoid a lot of hassle.

Not sure if I'll be back, but definitely not a bad experience by any means. Just not my kind of food.
