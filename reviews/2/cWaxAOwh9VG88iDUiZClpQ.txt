Lately they have really been falling apart.
My office is around the corner, so I used to order from Julio's once a week.
The food was always tasty and fresh. But now there is a new manager, he is rude, never smiles, never looks you in the eye and the food has really gone down hill.
My last lunch actually gave me the runs.
Too bad, now I have to find another place for my Mexican lunches.
