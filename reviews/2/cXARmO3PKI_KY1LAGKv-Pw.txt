I've been going to Pasqual's since I moved to Madison in 2003. My wife and I decided on the theme of our wedding at Pasqual's in Hilldale. We have many good memories there.

...but I'm pretty sure we're not coming back. We stopped by for brunch a few weeks ago and had was is arguably the most bland brunch food I have ever had. It was just plain and flavorless. It was almost like an entire ingredient was forgotten. But I was so invested in Pasqual's that I chalked it up to a freak occurrence. Perhaps a new cook or some new breakfast dishes. We went back to try dinner again at the Hilldale location.

I decided to try the chicken fajitas because I'd had a good fajita dish at another local restaurant. Their dish was sizzling, flavorful, and plentiful for the $11 I paid for it. I saw Pasqual's was more expensive, but I thought, "Ah, it's Pasqual's, it's gonna be great!" It was not. Then chicken was boring. Looked, felt, and tasted like it had been microwaved out of a frozen bag. The two lukewarm tortillas I got were similarly unimpressive. After I constructed my first fajita I had two strips of chicken for the second. I paid $13 for this?
