Decided to try this new addition to the food scene in downtown Gilbert. Pricey menu for typical food. The tacos (I ordered two) were super small....not even kid-sized, more so for an appetizer, and that's if you get three of them. You need six tacos to make one regular sized taco.  Won't be returning. Barrio Caf√© is still my favorite restaurant with the word Barrio in it!
