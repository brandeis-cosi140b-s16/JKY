Today was the second time I've experienced La Ristras. I ordered the green chili cheese burger with a fried egg. There are few better pairings than a juicy cheese burger with hatch green chilies. The burger was under seasoned and in much need of salt,  the chilies were mild at best and the egg was fried with not an ooze of yolk. Overall I found the food to be disappointing. The chips and salsa were good, the service was fine but the food left much to be desired. On my only previous visit I ordered the Green Chili Stew, it was fine but not any better than I could make at home. I have a huge place In my heart for New Mexican cuisine but this is not filling that void.
