The food is garbage... Iono who the cook that works graveyard is, but he sucks. 
No pride in his work. 
He and the tons-o'-fun lazy moo-cow that works the counter make me want to throw chairs. 

There's this one little cashier dude though, you'd know who I'm talking about, cause he's the only one that smiles... that guy is cool. Tip him every time.
