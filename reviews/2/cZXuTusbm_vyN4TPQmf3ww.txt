Naaaaaaa  Doesn't quite do it.  Sorry!  My first issue is the guacamole.  It has some sort of white cream added in it that dulls the taste.  Why do this to guac?  I ordered the taco platter.  It is served with 2 tacos, rice and beans.  I did like the rice and beans.  The tacos were good but nothing special.   I choose the shredded chicken and the grilled chicken.  Enjoyed the shredded over the grilled.....I will give a shout out for the chips and salsa- they were good!  Needs a little more spice for my taste though (salsa).

Other issues I have with this spot include the following:

1.  it's a pain to get out here on a pain of a road where turning left or right to get to and from could create major anxiety and concern of getting blasted by another car.
2.  no alcohol (the guy at the counter did say they are considering BYOB)
3.  no character to the atmosphere- very BLAH (throw on some music or put some work into a decor of some sort doesn't have to be anything fancy)

The dude behind the counter told me Reyna foods is going to put a shop in here downstairs.  That may help this place out?  

Honestly, I prefer going to the stand in front of Reyna and getting street tacos any day of the week!
