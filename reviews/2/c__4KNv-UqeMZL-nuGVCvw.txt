Ordered the jerk wings and plantains and they were BEYOND mediocre. Could've gotten better wings at wing stop honestly. The plantains were about $5 for 4.....which is crazy and they were very crispy. A friend ordered the salsa verde chicken enchilada and the chicken was really dry. Definitely felt like a waste.
