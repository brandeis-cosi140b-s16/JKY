I am a big chipotle fan and I love hawaiian food so I did expect alot.   Two of my favorite put into one but It was just ok. I was sorta disappointed.   Not alot of people there when we went but they did run out of the mango habanero sauce and the mixed veggies.  Really?   Got the bowl with seaweed rice and steak and was not impressed. I prefer chipotle over this.  And I prefer a traditional hawaiian place over this.  And I'm glad we took it to go because place was dirty.  Maybe I'll try it again but will call to make sure they have the veggies and mango sauce. ..bummer.
