Came in on a Sunday afternoon with the girlfriend. I ordered a small menudo which I ate in 4 mintues because of how small it was. That was prbly the best part. I also ordered a green chilli chicken burrito that I couldn't finish because it just didnt taste good. My waitress did her job, but only took our order and came to check on us once.. AFTER we had finished our meal. I probably won't be coming back.
