I went to this location and got the two chicken taco meal. I was very disappointed to find that the taco shells where the pre-made kind. The food over all was decent, but all I could think was that I was paying for over priced Taco Bell. I don't think I will being going back here. I'll just stick with my knock-offs for now on. They have yet to disappoint.
