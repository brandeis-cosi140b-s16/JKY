I am not proud to admit this, but I always feel nasty after eating here. Don't get me wrong the place is kept clean, the staff looks presentable,  but my food is always so greasy! It's fast 'Amerexican' (American + Mexican) food at its best. Order the carne asada burrito with guac and sour cream and you'll be set for awhile on your 'Amerexican' fix. 

Stop by their salsa bar too and pick up some red sauce - it's probably the only reason I come here once in a blue moon.
