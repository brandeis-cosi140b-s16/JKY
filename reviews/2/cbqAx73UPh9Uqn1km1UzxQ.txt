When I got there the place was empty and looked like just a bar. Their dining room was not set up (it was 5:30), and it looked sort of seedy. Then a charming young woman showed up and apologized, and set me up. Her service was great. I just wished the food was better. The salad was a little too chopped, and the main dish (Carmen asada) was tough and sort if bland. The rice and beans were also bland and we're served with dry flaky tortillas. Sorry but probably won't be back.
