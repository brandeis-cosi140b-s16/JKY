Have been coming here since they opened.  The last six months or so something has changed.

The quality of the food and service has suffered.

One time I was meeting a friend for lunch and had to call the manager out to the dining area because the music was so loud we couldn't carry on a conversation.

Another two times the rice was under cooked.

Portion size is way down.

Employees back talk you when you ask to have a kids meal made a particular way due to a finicky eating child.

I think I'll start driving out to the Chandler mall location.
