We've tried giving this place the benefit of the doubt so many times, and now we're just over it. We won't be returning.

The service is terrible, whether it's slow or busy in there.  Came around 4:30 after a movie, a few tables in the bar area but most were finishing up.  Server took about 10 mins. to come and get our drink order. Finally brought our soft drinks, but no chips/salsa. We ordered a cheese crisp (very good) and it came out about 2 mins. after the chips/salsa finally came.

We split a combo dinner, which was very tasty. We needed drinks refilled but that didn't happen until we flagged down the server.  Never checked on us to see how anything tasted or if we needed anything, just terrible.

Similar experience about 2 wks later, came again at dinner time, server took our order but didn't bring sugar for our tea. I asked her about it, never came. Then our meals came, our drinks were empty, she asked if we needed anything and I told her, "Yah, sugar for our drinks, and DRINKS!" in a nice way.  It didn't faze her, she seemed oblivious.  Never checked on us to find out if we needed anything, or how the meal was. Sucky service every single time, no wonder they keep putting the Groupon deals out but alas even that will not bring us back. Stick to Arriba's for great service and excellent food.
