This place is way overpriced. I ordered quesadillas it did not come with sour cream or guacamole, they charge extra for that. I asked for salsa for 4 people and the waitress comes back with a small cup of salsa. Food is very ordinary. We used to love the Tijuana Flats in Florida, this location is totally not worth it. Bye Bye Tijuana Flats, I am not coming back.
