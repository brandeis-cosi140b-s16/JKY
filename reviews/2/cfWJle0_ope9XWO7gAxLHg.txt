I'll start off with the good.  My server was very nice and accommodating of my group's requests.  Prices are very reasonable and the portions are huge.  The decor is fun, festive, and funky.  Kinda makes you forget you're at the Waterfront.  Things really just started to go downhill when the food came out.

The fried chips and thin salsa roja didn't have a whole lot of flavor.  I'm not usually one to pass up on a big ol' bowl of chips and salsa, but this starter was just not appealing.

I ordered option C from the "Gran Agave Vegetarian Plates" section of the menu: one quesadilla with bean burrito and a chalupa.  I was expecting the quesadilla to be the star of the show, so I was pretty disappointed when I received a flat, tasteless quesadilla filled with nothing but cheese.  Is it too much to ask for some veggies in a vegetarian quesadilla??  The accompanying bean burrito was smothered in sauce, completely drowning the taco shell of the chalupa.  All in all, kind of a mess, and definitely not what I was expecting.

My boyfriend ordered the beef flautas, which were extremely dry and tasteless.  My parents, on the other hand, both enjoyed their meals.  But it may have had something to do with the shot of Patron and Dos Equis. Who knows.  

I probably would not return to this restaurant, although I do appreciate the variety of Mexican food they offer, especially for vegetarians.  Portion sizes are extremely generous.  I'd recommend staying away from the "Americanized" offerings and maybe trying something more authentic.
