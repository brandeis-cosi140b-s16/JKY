Mi Patio is one of those restuants i really do not like. and i cannot understand why people do. the food isn't very good, and the margaritas are just as bad. i've been to Mi Patio as a kid and i remember it being a bit better, but as a kid i don't think you truely understand the different between good and bad. it is what it is and you enjoy it because it's different. as an adult. i'm paying for this shit. and it's regretful. i will not lie, i'll eat here on someone elses dime. but i'll save my shillings for something a wee bit better...like macyo's lol.
