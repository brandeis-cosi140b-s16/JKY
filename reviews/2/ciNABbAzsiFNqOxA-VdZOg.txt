I really wanted to like this place but maybe I had my hopes set too high. It was clean and the employees were friendly but the food really lacked for me. I definitely did  not feel like it was fresh and delicious. It felt like heavy smothered mexican food. It was salty and the shredded chicken was greasy to top it off. I doubt quite seriously that we will return. I would much rather have Chipotle.
