I was in the area and dropped by to grab a bite to eat.  It looks like many of the Mexican restaurants in the Phoenix area, so I was expecting it to be pretty good.  Boy was I disappointed!  Here's what I ordered:

Carne Asada Taco, $3.25

The portion size is very large, so you get your money's worth as far as quantity, but the quality was terrible.

I tried the Carnitas Taco first....took one bite and immediately didn't like it.  Why?  The Carnitas was "rubbery" and lacked flavor...it was bland.  It was so gross, I only took 2 bites hoping the 2nd would be better (it wasn't), so I didn't finish it.

Next was the Carne Asada Taco....took one bite and was underwhelmed.  The Steak had a lot of fat and was "chewy".  It also didn't taste good to me and I didn't finish that either.

Last was the Beans/Rice/Cheese Burrito.  I was hoping it would salvage my meal, but sadly it didn't.  It was very salty and the Beans tasted like they'd been sitting around for a while.  It didn't taste fresh.  The saltiness was very hard to overcome and I also didn't finish that portion.

I threw way 1/2 of my meal....that's why I gave this place 2 Stars.  It was the worst I've had since moving to the Phoenix area.
