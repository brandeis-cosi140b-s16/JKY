The salsa was too strong, did not settle well with me. The tacos are like .50 cent tacos not 1.00. They gave me corn tortilla and didn't even offer to give me flour. I was there a year ago and everything was good but now they seem to be cutting some corners. Not recommended you much better making your own tacos.
