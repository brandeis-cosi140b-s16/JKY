Not a friendly atmosphere.
The front table was our choice however we only had 5 people and we were told that the manager did not allow less than 6 to sit there.
Even the manager this morning told us that and so we were treated not so welcome
The restaurant was empty and that table was empty the entire time we were there.
Poor decision to make any customer feel unwelcome. 
The food was good but not great and the parking situation was prohibitive
As a native Charlotte guy I will not go back
Nor will I recommend to any of my friends
So many Great places to choose from in Charlotte
Good Luck Bakersfield East
