Excellent rice. Really tough tortillas, hard to chew. CC Sizzle too spicy, made my nose run! Ok beans. Ok bunuelos. Very filling. Disappointing after reading all the good reviews. Maybe I just caught them on an off day? I wanted to like it after reading their history and finding out about the homemade tortillas and chips.
