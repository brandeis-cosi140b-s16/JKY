I tried Taberna for the first time last night.  I live basically across the street and had driven by many times since it opened.  I was not that impressed.  
The major highlight was the patio.  It's large and comfortable, with plenty of heaters.  The food was good, but not great; the portions are small and certainly not worth the price.  I tried the fish tacos, steak tacos, and chicken enchilladas.  The fish tacos and steak tacos were great.  The enchilladas were soggy, mushy, and although they claimed to be chicken, I couldn't find much in the dish.  The beans and rice served with each dish were bland.  The same goes for the salsas.  A little seasoning would have gone a long way.
While waiting for our food, we tried the margaritas, which were good, but not worth $8.50 a piece.
I'll probably give Taberna another try in the future.  I like their menu and the ambience of the restaurant.  I think if they improve the food, if only with a little bit of salt, this place could be really great.
