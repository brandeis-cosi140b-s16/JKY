This place looks very cute inside, but, unfortunately, the food just wasn't that great when I went here for lunch today with a friend. The chips and salsa weren't very good, the chips were stale and the salsa wasn't very flavorful. I ordered a burro with the pork, that someone raved about, but thought it was just ok, a little dry and kind of boring in flavor. My friend got a beef burro combo and the beef was extremely dry and was super peppery, not so good. Also, the rice was bland.... Finally, the service was slow and a bit awkward... like the waitress came and asked us about drinks and then brought the drinks all without giving us a menu... kind of strange.  I probably wouldn't come back here.
