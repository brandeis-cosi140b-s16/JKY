Mehhhh.... It wasn't terrible... but soggy beans, bland carne asada and uninspired pico certainly explains why this place is empty every time I drive by. Next time I'm in the area and hungry I'll just drive the extra 2 blocks and go to Del Taco. My search for a good hole in the wall Mexican place will continue on! It's to bad because I wanted to like this place...
