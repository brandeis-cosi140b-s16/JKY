Went here today, we're on way to Rita's Mexican restaurant just down street and my husband saw Garcias and wanted to go there instead. BIG MISTAKE. Food was awful...Fatitas tasted liked boiled steak, onions and bell peppers were so overlooked they were mush, and a disgusting taste like really old oil. The retried beans were the only thing halfway tasty!  Rice was also mush and the guacamole was runny...hate to think what they add to that to increase their profit.  on the way home had horrible taste in mouth, had to brush teeth .nasty food and fear the kitchen is probably dirty....NEVER AGAIN...worst Mexican food I've ever had anywhere!
