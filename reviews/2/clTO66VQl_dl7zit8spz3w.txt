As the other reviewers have stated - this is NOT the same as the 7th St or 7th Ave location.

First time in was the taco trio (al Pastor, carne asada, pollo asado) , elote (America's corn) and a large cochata (iced coffee mixed with horchata.) 
The cochata was brilliant! My new favorite non alcoholic beverage. And the service was friendly. Those are the two stars.
The tacos were dull and bland. The corn was just plain sad. So many GOOD elote options in this town.  So many decent elote options. So bummed this was mediocre at best.

Second visit was the same taco trio and large cochata. The pork and beef were a little better this time, the chicken was still super lame. The salsa is decent at best.
At least the cochata still hit the spot.

That said...there are so many good taquerias in the area. Where tacos of a similar size and better quality cost notably less. I don't see any reason to make it back to this sad little America's franchise.
