So sad to rate Pasqual's this low...but you get two stars for proximity to our house and 1/2 priced margaritas.

While adding table service is quite nice and convenient with the kids, the service and quality have not improved as it should with a sit-down restaurant.  The food continues to be pretty inconsistent and is most noticed in your soups.  One day it's thick like stew and the next it's watered down.  Yes, I order it enough to notice.  Please stop serving "old" looking guacamole in the plastic cups!  In fact, get rid of the plastic cups for the salsa too.  Looks tacky at a sit-down place.  Also, bringing our food out on plates with hospital cafeteria covers does not whet my appetite.  I'm left wondering, how long has my food been sitting around steaming while we're chowing down on chips/salsa and ordering our second margarita.  Lastly, how can you possibly charge $1 more on kids meal for ordering fries!  You hardly give the kids any food as it is!  We never even get offered the kids drink that supposedly comes along with the meal.  Seriously, I'm starting to feel ripped off!   


Final test, does management from Pasqual's even read their reviews?!
