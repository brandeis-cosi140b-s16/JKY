The food is pretty good, but I have to give this location 2 stars because of some service issues.  I ordered a veggie burrito, only to find chunks of chicken in it halfway through eating.  Upon alerting the staff, someone in the kitchen said to me "oh yeah I accidentally put chicken in it, so I just picked it out.  It was an accident".  Everyone that works here seems to be in middle school, so I guess that explains the casual attitude.  Regardless, that's a totally unacceptable food handling habit, especially considering this place sells shellfish.  I am a vegetarian, so I was a little grossed out, but I glad that I don't have a serious food allergy.  The bathrooms are also consistently dirty. We'll be finding a different location to try out.
