I don't know how people can eat here...I guess it's an AZ thing. I had their Cali Burrito & rolled taquitos. 
-Cali burrito: I like that they put lots of guacamole in it, but the meat was bland. As if it had been sitting in water before they cooked it. I stopped eating it because it was starting to gross me out.
-Rolled taquitos: nothing special just plain old rolled taquitos. They were a $1 so I guess that was nice. A little confused as to why people like this place, But hey whatever floats your boat.
