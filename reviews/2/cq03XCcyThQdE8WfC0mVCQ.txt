I like the new Grill Master Pollo Bowls.  However everytime I have ordered the grill master bowls especially the mashed potato bowl it has been inconsistent and the portion in the bowl varies dramatically which angers me when I get home and discover this. If they get it together this place would be pretty good and I would frequent it more often. The employees obviously are not trained correctly because they put whatever they want in the bowls.  There is to much competition in this area that are more consistent and get it right all the time.
