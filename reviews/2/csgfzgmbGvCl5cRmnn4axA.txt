2 stars only because It was good.  I ordered a carne asada burrito to go.   Came home and it was egg with onions.  I went back to tell them they gave me the wrong order, and they laughed and said "we know".  Excuse me ? You know? How could you give someone the wrong order and laugh about it when confronted.  Never going back.  They did change it for me to the burrito I wanted but they basically through it my face like it was my fault.  The carne asada was good but the service and disrespect was horrible.
