Not Impressed. Located in a sketchy strip mall next to the expressway adjacent to a "we buy gold store" and a smoke shop. Ordered a Carne Asada Burrito which was way too salty and a tad on the small side. The building is a little run down and dirty, there was also a peculiar smell which  I could not pinpoint. Their menu is very confusing and has way too many choices. The prices seem a bit high for lunch, maybe not for dinner. The bathroom is disgusting.
Two stars, I probably won't return.
