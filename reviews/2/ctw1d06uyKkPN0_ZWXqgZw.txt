This place seriously reminded me of taco bell. The last thing I want to be reminded of is another fast food experience. Uuuuggghhhh, I'll give it the benefit of a doubt that it might of been what I ordered (beef burrito). But I just can't see myself eating here again knowing that there is other places to choose at this food court. What I paid for wasn't what it was worth either, I'll be quite honest here, I probably would rather eat at Taco Bell.
