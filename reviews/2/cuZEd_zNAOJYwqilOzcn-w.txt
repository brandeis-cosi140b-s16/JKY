Seriously the worst chipotle I have ever been too. The workers were so rude not even smiling. I asked if I can have all the salsas and she was about to scoop the corn when I quickly stoped her and said oh no corn please she rolled her eyes and replied oh well corn is a salsa to. Like really? Also idk but chipotle bowls are always juicy and here it was so dry and feel like it's not the same as the other chipotles.
