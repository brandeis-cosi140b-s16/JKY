Pros
Great location and patio
Friendly staff and cool vibe
Good cocktails

Cons
Low cost / low quality ingredients
Overall, food was just not that good

I hate writing a bad review of this place, I really wanted to like it. It has a cool San Felipe's meets Cooperstown/Hard rock type vibe...The staff was great the entire way through. What really threw us was the food. It just did not have good flavors and they really used the cheap ingredients....

If you want a place to have a cold one and people watch it is AWESOME. Just don't go for the food unless something changes.... 

We will give them another whirl soon and update if we find different. 

Sorry Rock Taco, next time hopefully.....
