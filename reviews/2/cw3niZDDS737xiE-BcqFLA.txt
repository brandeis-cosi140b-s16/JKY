Disappointed. I love Fuzzy's, used to go all the time when I lived in Tx. I was so excited when it came out here but lately it's been terrible. Customer service is spotty at best. Past few times the food has been made wrong and then the employees had attitude about making it right. I am bummed because l love the place but this location is ruining it, I probably won't be back.
