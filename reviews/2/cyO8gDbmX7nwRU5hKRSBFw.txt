When I first arrived in Arizona, this was the first restaurant that I went to. I was very impressed and went back many times over the following 3-4 months. Unfortunately, a few months ago, something changed about the food. I don't know why things changed, but the quality went downhill. My favorite enchiladas suizas were tasting a little bland... or every once in a while, too spicy to consume. This just got inconsistent. I tried going back a few more times over the past three months to see if it was just a rough patch, but I haven't seen any improvement.
