Just okay. I was craving Mexican good but didn't feel like getting out of car on way home, so I bought the yelp promo! Thank goodness I only paid $5! The carnitas was tough and dry, the red chile meat was the cheapest cut of meat allowable for human consumption. Not all bad though, the rice and beans were good. And the $.99 tostada was good too. IF I go back, it will be for rice, beans and tostada. Afraid to try anything else!
