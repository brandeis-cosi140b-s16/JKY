I've now been to this location 3 times.  I had previously visited the locations and really enjoyed my meals.

Unfortunately, something seems to be missing here at the "downtown" location.

The service has been haphazard each time I've gone.  The waitstaff rushes around as if they are swamped even when they're just half full.  One trip we experienced a long wait for a table, though it looked like all that was required was to bus the table of some previously departed customers.

The food is a shadow of the meals I've had a the other locations.  Not a horrible version, but nothing that stands out from the myriad of mexican restaurants available here in Phoenix.

One trip we had a pitcher of blended margaritas, which tasted watery and bland.  So the next time we ordered individual margaritas, over rocks.  Unfortunately, they too were bland.
