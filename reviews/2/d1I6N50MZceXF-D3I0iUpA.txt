The food was excellent and got delivered quickly, so their back of house staff is clearly on point. The front of house staff, however, was abysmal. I went with one friend and we were served by two people, neither of whom returned to the table more than once. We ended up being there for close to two hours, while the dining room was nearly empty, and we had to ask another server to take care of our checks. For the first hour, we had a fine experience. I won't go back.
