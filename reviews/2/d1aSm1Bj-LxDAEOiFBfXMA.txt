Food was okay. Service, however, did not impress me. I stood waiting to order as several employees passed me by and didn't even make eye contact with me, as if they were pretending not to notice me. Like what the hell? Can't they even mutter a simple "hello"? Or "someone will be with you shortly"? Food wasn't too great, I won't be going back. I don't know why Chipotle has such good reviews, it's pretty mediocre.

I'd rather go to Taco Bell.
