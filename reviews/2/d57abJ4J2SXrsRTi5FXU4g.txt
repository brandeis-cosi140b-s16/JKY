I've been here a few times and unfortunately its never been a great experience.  I think the first time it was a three star, but the last time was definitely a two--maybe even a one and a half star.  The service was terrible.  Granted, we were a large party with three kids, but it they clearly weren't busy and it was a weeknight.  It took them about 20 minutes to get a table together for us, which was fine.  But then it took them about another twenty minutes to take our orders.  We were so hungry we ended up devouring four baskets of chips before we even placed our orders.

The chips were probably the best part--but I can't say the red ketchup sauce is great.  We asked for a chunky salsa that was decent and ended up mixing that with the thick red ketchup sauce they give you.  I ordered a burrito with green sauce with a side of beans and rice.  It definitely wasn't anything to drool over.  It was edible, but not great.  Plus its not even super cheap.  

Its a pass.
