I've been to Panchero's, and I probably won't go back.  If I ever find myself in that center again, I will be at either Jersey Mike's, Starbucks or Yogurtland!  The flavor of the food was decent.....but they were so stingy on everything that it pissed me off before I even got a chance to taste the food!

Get this...they measure out the cheese in this little scoop....are you kidding me!?!?!  It was probably an ounce of cheese, which if you are like me, is not nearly enough cheese to go around.  Also, when I said that I didn't want the rice, just beans, I still got the same amount of beans that a person who ordered rice got....beans are like the cheapest food on the planet....don't be so stingy!  The carnitas was pretty tasty, but I just felt like I was being so jipped as far as the value and the portions went that in order for me to return...a mass destruction of all the Rubio's, Chipotle's and Baja Fresh's would have to occur...and even then...I would probably still pick taco bell....you just can't beat 89 cent bean burritos!
