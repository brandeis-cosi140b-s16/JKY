Crowded and not cheap at peak hours.  Had a hell of a time trying to get two spots to sit for my girlfriend and me. Paid $14 for two draft beers at about 3:00pm/weekday.  I guess happy hour time would have been cheaper but we didn't want to rack up a big bill by the time happy hour started (I think it starts at 5:00pm).  Left and went across the street to La Salsa.
