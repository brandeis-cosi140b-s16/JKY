Visit Chipotle quite often at Shea and 92nd St area in Scottsdale, but I was in Peoria for business.  Stopped in and wow, customer service skills could use some work.  Everyone behind the counter was more interested in talking to a customer who obviously was a friend of someone, past worker, or something.  Talking about subjects that should not be spoken about out loud with customers around.  Had to repeat my order, sloppy in building my burrito bowl to go, and couldn't even pay attention in placing the lid on which came off inside the bag.
