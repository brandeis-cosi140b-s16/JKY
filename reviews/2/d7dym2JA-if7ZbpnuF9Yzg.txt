It was just okay.  Hubby got the super nachos(carne asada), I got the carne asada taco meal, my son got a cheeseburger, and my daughter a cheese quesadilla.  The carne asada was bland but asa taco, it was good.  The nachos were not very good.  The shredded cheese taste like it was mostly processed.  My son only ate a few bites of his cheeseburger and my daughters quesadilla consisted of a four tortilla, shredded cheese, and butter.  It was very bland.  We brought the quesadilla and cheeseburger home for the dog.
