Ate at this place a few days back. The chicken in the fajitas was undercooked, the cook had thrown on a few partly cooked onions, green peppers and completely forgot the tomatos. My order # had not been called so when i went to see what was happening, the cook had missed the order. Trying to hurry the food he had slapped a lid over the chicken to speed up the cooking, this resulted in a tasteless steamed mess that he passed off as fajitas. This is one of the few fast food places that charge you for a soft drink refill. Needless to say, it is a cut above Taco Bell and Del Taco but then it is much more expensive, no 99c tacos or burritos here. My tab for fajitas and a soda was just under $9.  Does not compare to Carolinas especially for the tortillas, these are tasteless at Carambas.  Will NOT be going back  !!!!!
