Ordered takeout late-ish one night, combo with two chicken tacos, black beans, and rice. WTH were the tacos just placed in aluminum foil and stuck in a plastic bag that also included a container with an enchilada and the other containers of the beans, rice, salsa, and whatever else was in the order? Of course the taco shells were completely crushed.  I still ate them. Flavor-wise, they were OK. Service was fine otherwise, and the chips were good. Rice is kind of bland. I'd try them again, but I'll make sure I specify that I'd like the tacos also in an aluminum container with a lid so that they don't get smashed.  Who serves smashed tacos??? :(
