I always want to come by to have a nice taco break but talk about depressing when you walk through the doors. I understand when you work; you're tired and grumpy but you don't show it to people you work around. The employees seem depressed and not in a decent mood to work and the music around them is in a happier mood than them, I sometimes feel like I shouldn't order anything! Beyond customer service, the food is 4/5 stars. A bit salty but still nice to eat.

Maybe it's time for new employees or some fun ways to keep them happy?
