I used to really like this place... But I must say I have converted to chipotle. Cafe rio is much less healthy than chipotle and since I am allergic to gluten, there is almost nothing gluten free on the menu. Even the rice and beans have gluten in them! There is no reason for there to be gluten in rice or beans. I guess they put a lot of extra stuff in their food.
