Had not been to this place in quite a while, but decided to try it again recently, after they had reopened. Not so impressed. 
I'm not sure why, maybe because it is always pretty empty, but I always get weird vibes from this place. Feels a little ghost town-ish to me. That being said, I had quite a few other issues with Xtapa Joes. The service was not too great. The restaurant was not as all busy, but our server was nowhere to be found during most of our time there. 
Also the food is WAY overpriced. I used to get a fried bean burro type thing before they revamped the place, but whatever that was, it was not on the menu anymore. Last time I went I got a spinach salad, and it cost $10, it was something I could have made at home, very lackluster. I got a skinny pomegranate margarita that was good though, a little strong, but yummy. 
I would go back for a drink and some chips (not a fan of the salsa), but have no plans of going back for a meal.

UPDATE: As of 7/31/14, they are closed. Drove past and saw they had everything closed off.
