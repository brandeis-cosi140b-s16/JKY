I always loved eating here over the years. Lately, it seems that the service has become lax, takeouts have become notoriously incorrect. Last night, my pollo asada had a piece of metal in it. The salsa seemed watered down. Chips tasted old and mostly scraps. 
Not sure what is happening. Macayos has always been the reliable restaurant in Tempe/Ahwatuckee area that you take visitors to serve them good Mexican food. 
Kind of bummed. Please, I hope management is reading this and save this once great restaurant.
