Oh where do I start? First, I want to say the food was actually really good. I had the super chimichangas and we shared some nachos. Salsa was nice and spicy. My lovely meal was spoiled by a crappy manager and sub par service.
 My nephew wanted a salad with bacon and cheese, that's it. We receive a full taco salad instead.  We send it back to get our correct item. They bring out the salad again and it's still wrong!! My nephew decides to eat it because he's starving. When we get the bill, I'm being charged damn near $8!! When I ask for the manager, he never comes to the table and he refuses to change the amount. As a matter of fact, he tells my server he's not going to change it and I don't have to pay for my food!! It's mind boggling!! I sat there for at least 30 minutes waiting for this damn manager! He never shows up and then relays an idiotic statement!! Order takeout; don't dine in!
