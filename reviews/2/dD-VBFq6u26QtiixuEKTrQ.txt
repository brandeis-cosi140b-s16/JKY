The food was ok. Not very authentic, but tasted ok, and good if you have little kids with simple palates. Service was very poor unfortunately. We waited in the foyer of the restaurant for 5 minutes before anyone even noticed us. Two members of the wait staff were just hanging out at a booth in the bar. The bar tender saw us but did not make eye contact or greet us. I finally had to go interrupt the two servers who where chit chatting at the bar amongst themselves, to see if they could seat us. There was really no excuse for the poor service. There were only two other families eating in the whole restaurant. Sorry, don't think we will be back. When I go out to eat dinner, I expect good service.
