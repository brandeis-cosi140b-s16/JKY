Enchilada soup. Sounds weird, right? Well, that's exactly what I ate when I ordered a spinach enchilada. The sauce was so overwhelming I almost forgot I was eating an enchilada. The rice and beans on the side were fine, however. I actually really liked the rice. The others I ate with had food that was pretty mediocre. But, I just can't get over the fact that I had an enchilada that really was just weird soupy stuff. The service was pretty dissappointing, too. As vegans eating out, we don't expect everyone to bend over backwards for our diet, but asking to get some tacos and burritos without meat and literally just being told "nope" is a little ridiculous. From the outside, it looked like an awesome, authentic restaurant, but the service and my meal really brought that down. It's a gorgeous building, though, so check it out if you love bad service and enchilada soup.
