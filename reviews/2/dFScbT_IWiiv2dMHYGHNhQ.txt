We walked in for a lunch on Sunday. It happened to be the World Cup and I was surprised that there was availability, but there was. 

We were seated in the bar area and our drinks and appetizers were ordered. This was great and that is where it ended. 

Once our appetizers were ordered our waitress decided to become engrossed doing other things. When she finally did come by we ordered and then we waited for over 30 minutes (easily). When we did get our food the plate was hot but the food was cold. Go figure. 

As far as the food went, it was average. Not bad. However, coupled with that kind of service, no way will I be back.
