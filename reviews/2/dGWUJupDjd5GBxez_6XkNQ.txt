Who wants to stand around and read a menu on a wall and then stand around some more and wait for your subpar Mexican food to be cooked?  It wasn't even that busy when I went there, but I still stood there for over 5 minutes. I would never come here for lunch when it might be more crowded.  Who wants to spend their lunch hour standing around when they could have a more customer friendly system of ordering your food and then having it bring it to you?  They are going for that Subway-style watch them assemble your food vibe - but it just takes too long.

The mexican rice and black beans were the blandest I have ever tasted.  Not only did I pay the extra $1.79 for this worthless crap, but it was also included in my burrito where it totally killed any taste.  I would never go back to this place.
