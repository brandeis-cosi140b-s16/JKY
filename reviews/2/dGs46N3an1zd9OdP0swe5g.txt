The food was decent-nothing really spectacular here.The ground beef taco was a lot better than the ones I have been getting at Filibertos.  I do wish they had a salsa bar.  

When I went the other day, the place was filled with junior high school students and they all were given plastic bottles of salsa when they received their food but I was not given a bottle.  Glad to know I rate lower than some 14 year old kid.

I might stop in again if I am in the neighborhood but I'm certainly not going to go out of my way to come back here.
