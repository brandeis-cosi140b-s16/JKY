Well I ordered the street tacos & were great. Very disappointed about the shrimp nachos, we didn't like those & obviously were expecting great nachos from Nacho Daddy. What really bothered us though was the tap water that we ordered, it was disgusting so make sure you actually order a drink if you go to this place
