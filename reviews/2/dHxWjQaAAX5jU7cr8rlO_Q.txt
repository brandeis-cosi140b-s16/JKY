First off let me say I'm usually not one to give a bad review.... But this has to be said.



So I came with my family (mom,dad,sister etc.) It was our first time here. We walk in and it wasn't very busy so we were seated right away. Now the waiter was the main problem. He was maybe 23-25  and he looked like he was a meth addict. He was taking extremely fast, really jumpy, very very paranoid (he was always looking around like someone was following him) and he was always a scratching his wrist. He was nice but he made me extremely uncomfortable. The food was ok it wasn't anything special. Don't think we'll come back anytime soon.
