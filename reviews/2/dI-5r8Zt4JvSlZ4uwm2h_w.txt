While I am clearly aware that the cooking has a Taos or Northern NM influence, my desire for quality Southern NM cuisine brings me here hoping to taste a bit of the Las Cruces/Mesilla flavor. For those people who appreciate the taste of Southern New Mexico cuisine, you'll be disappointed.  There is a huge difference in how the food from Taos and Mesilla/Las Cruces is prepared.  I've been here 6 times over the past 3 months and although the chips are better than average, it's still not as good as NM.  The sopapillas are OK, not great, and the food in general hit or miss.  The only really bad dish is their chili rellano.  For some reason, they wrap this with an omlette-like cover which doesn't work.  I highly recommend the green chili stew, it's a safe play.  I would highly recommend Carolina's Mexican restaurant on Cave Creek and Thunderbird Rd.  The food there is cheap, portion sizes large, and it's home cooked and always yummy.  One thing about Gil's, their patio.  It's a quit little set-up which does make for an enjoyable retreat with friends.
