I understand price gouging at airports.
But $9.99 for a 6-8 inch burrito?
It was tasty, but it was no meal...merely a snack.

I felt robbed. I had a 1 1/2 hour lay over.
I should have walked around a little and asked if
there was a McDonald's in the airport.

SURE ENOUGH...THERE IS !!!

Don't spend your money here if you are really hungry.
