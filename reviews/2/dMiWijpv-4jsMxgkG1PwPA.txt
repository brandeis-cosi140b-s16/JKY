What confuses me is that this is not a Madison original. If it was, I would say that the lack of quality and bland taste is expected, but if I believe that this originated from Texas then I do not understand. Texas knows Mexican. This is not Mexican. It is not Baja. It is just bland and ordinary. It does an extremely poor job of coming close to being Mexican. I ordered a quesadilla and a grilled vegetable burrito. I actually threw both out. Not even worth eating. The burrito was just filled with lettuce. The cheese in the quesadilla had absolutely no flavor.

I don't know anymore. The restaurants in Madison, Wisconsin are a far cry from restaurants in other areas of the country. I know someone said to me, I haven't reviewed 43 North, Grazie, L'etoile, Lombardino's, etc. I have been to them. I will at some point review them, but they pale in comparison to places like L'espalier in Boston or Alain Ducasse in New York.
