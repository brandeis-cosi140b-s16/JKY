Came here for dinner since we were staying in the resort. Ordered the skirt steak nachos & a mojito. I did not care for the nachos but my daughter who wanted them thought they were fine. The Mexican cheeses were not good. Tasted rotten, even though it wasn't! The chips/salsa are quite good. Chips are very fresh. Tomatillo salsa is very refreshing. The mojito was fine. I prob won't eat here again.
