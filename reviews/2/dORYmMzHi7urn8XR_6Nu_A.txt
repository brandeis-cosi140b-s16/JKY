I recently ate at Patron and have to say I wasn't impressed. I went with two of my friends and we all ordered fajita dishes. I had the Shrimp Fajita, all the shrimp were small and just tasteless (most likely frozen) and the vegetables added no flavor to the dish. There were no sauces readily available at the table and the fajitas were served without cheese. 

The worst part were the prices. My Fajita was $15.99 and certainly wasn't worth anywhere near that. You're better off going to Mad Mex or even Chili's for a better and cheaper experience.
