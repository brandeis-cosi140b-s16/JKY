It consistently takes about half an hour to move twenty people through the line. Trust me, I've counted. Also, the words "only a little salsa, please" don't register with a lot of the line workers; I'm 1 for 5. Love the food and it's really not the end of the world to wait in line...just don't go here if you're in a hurry.
