We had high hopes for Three Amigos. Went on a Friday night and and after waiting a long time to be seated we were finally seated. When asked if they had draft beer, the hostess clearly had no idea what draft beer meant and said she would get back to us yet she never came back.  We sat there for a very long time watching waitresses go by ignoring us. We had to flag down a waitress to get our drinks. My husband wanted to just leave at that point but I wanted to at least try the food and drinks. The waitress we flagged down said she didnt know who was supposed to have our table but she would take our orders. The waitress was very nice but had no idea what the different draft beers were. Being from a local brewery I wanted to at least know which ones were lighter in color so I could choose accordingly but she couldnt even tell us that. The food took a very long time to come out and it wasnt even that great. We sadly will not be going back to this restaurant. Protip: Make sure your waitresses know about your local beers you are serving but if you cant educate them at least have descriptions on a menu. The waitress told us she had no idea what they were like because she "didnt drink beer" and just showed us the names of the beers she had scribbled down on a piece paper.
