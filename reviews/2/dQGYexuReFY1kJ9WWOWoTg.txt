Though we love Qdoba in general, this location specifically left me unimpressed.

The young lady who fixed our food skimped on everything. And then she managed to APPEAR to scan my Frequent Eater card without actually doing so.

The points never appeared on my card. My bad that I couldn't find my darned receipt later, to prove to corporate that we'd actually eaten there.

No worries though because this location is totally out of our radius. We were only there that day because our daughter had an activity in the area and we love Qdoba.

The free concert in the square and the ice cream from the shop close to the parking lot totally made up for it.

Mid July visit...
