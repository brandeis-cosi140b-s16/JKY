I really was not very impressed with the quality of the food. The meat was very dry and the sauce they used to disguise it in was bland and greasy. Yea, yea I know it's mexican food so I should expect some grease, but a puddle of yellow oil surrounding the plate? Yuck. The only redeeming quality was the chips and salsa bar. The tomatillo and adobo salsas were excellent. Not good enough for me to return, but made the wait bearable.
