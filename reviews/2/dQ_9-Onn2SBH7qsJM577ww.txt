Ive been to Phat Burrito several times now and I guess each time I just hope I was wrong the last...or maybe I just forget how unimpressed I am.  

The venue itself is in a great location (yay Southend!). The place itself is very low-key artsy/boho-esque...basically just what you should expect of Southend. 

The service is where things start going downhill slightly- It's never been good. The staff aren't friendly neighborhood joint workers (unlike CM across the street)- in fact they don't really even answer their phones with polite faux-enthusiasm. Ive paid extra for Guacamole - and never received it...when I politely told them this I wasn't even offered an apology-or even some free Guac the next time. Oh well.  All of this I could let go if they had kick-butt Southwestern fare but I am sorry to say they do not. 

The salsa's and Guacamole (sadly) are very bland. I worry about the freshness factor since they are basically left out all day (salsa's only). I ordered some Quesadillas- what no sour cream, lettuce, tomato, salsa, anything?! What is southwestern and/or mexican food without all the scrumptious sides? 

 I still haven't found a good take out Mexican with take-out prices....
