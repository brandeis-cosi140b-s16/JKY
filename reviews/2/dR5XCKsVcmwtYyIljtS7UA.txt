This was my first time trying Anaya's and I was quite disappointed. The staff was very friendly and helpful, but the food was mediocre and over priced. 

I got the veggie chimichanga for $9.99. The chimi was small for the amount I paid. It was soggy and not crisp like a chimi should be. I also tried the green corn tamale. It was $3 and gross. I didn't even finish it. 

I would not come back to Anaya's. Which is disappointing - it is hard to find vegan mexican food.
