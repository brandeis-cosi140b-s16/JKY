Every time i eat here i ask my self why. prices are high and the food is very average..Soggy food that is never packed rite and poor customer service. Its a whole in the wall that is hardly open . Dine in prices for Filberto type take out ..This place is closed on Monday and  closes at 7 witch is weird.
