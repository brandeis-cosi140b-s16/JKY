$1 Margaritas do not guarantee a good restaurant experience, and this one was not. Now, granted, they have only been open a week. Still, I expect more from the group that has run Manzetti's, Burro Loco, and others for years. Here is what I hope will improve: Service- There isn't much good to say. It was slow, glasses were empty. When I asked the server what he would recommend on the menu, he pointed to a chop and gave this ringing endorsement "you wont find anything like that other places". Yum, that does sound good! Food- It is hard to mess up fajitas, but the did. We got a plate of under cooked onions and peppers, topped with some lukewarm chicken. Now, I gave them another chance. When the waiter made his requisite "how was everything" check in stop, we said not good. He said. "really, huh" and walked off. I waited ten minutes for a manager to come over and get my feedback, but no one ever showed. One other note, this place is very noisy. Not, in a cool, happening, this-is-the-place-to-be noisy way. More like it is really loud in here, and in a hard- to- hear- you kinda way. Obviously, I hope things get better. In the meantime, I'll stick to the $1 margaritas at the bar before I head to someplace good for dinner
