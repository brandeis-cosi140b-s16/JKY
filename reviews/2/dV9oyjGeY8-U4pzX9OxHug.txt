This place has got to be the slowest fast food place on earth. Already waiting 20 minutes for my order and still 4 orders away from getting mine. The place isn't busy and I've seen at least 10 cars go through already. I went inside to order after seeing a long ass line of cars. On top of that they aren't even past midnight like every other Taco Bell. Food is decent though, nothing different from your regular Taco Bell, if you ever get your food to even taste it that is
