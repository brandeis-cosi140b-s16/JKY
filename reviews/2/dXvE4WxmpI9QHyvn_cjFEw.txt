The food was not worth the price it was watery and uncooked. The drinks were okay. I think this place is too expensive! The dollar amount should be like $$$$ because they are highly costly and the food they are serving shouldn't be that much. Roberto's or other places has better tasting food at a cheaper price. The only reason they get two stars is because of the waiter was nice.
