I've always LOVED Chipotle, but the experience I had today was beyond horrible! 
I placed an order online for myself and many of my coworkers for lunch. The website is set up perfect so that you can specify exactly what each order should have on it. 
My experienced turned sour when I went to pick up the order. 
Initially I walked in and per my email confirmation advised I walked to the front on the line to pick up my order. 
The cashier ignored me and did not even acknowledge my presence and continued helping others. She did this through 3 customers until I had to say "Excuse me" to get her attention. She then with an attitude got the food and I went on my way. 
When I get back to work, one of the orders was wrong. I called back to Chipotle and was hung up on twice. The third time the woman on the phone began to argue with me saying she did not mess up the order! (where is the customer service?) 
My coworkers along with myself have officially written Chipotle off and will not order from there any longer. 
The worst experience ever... I'm extremely disappointed.
