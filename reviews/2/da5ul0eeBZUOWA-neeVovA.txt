I wish I could give this place a good review. I've been twice. The first time was pretty good- not great but not terrible. However; my second visit there was just awful. It took forever for them to send a server over. And when he came he seemed very confused. And the food - when it finally arrived was just meh.  The beans and rice were cold.  The steak was over cooked and I could barely chew it. I sent it all back.  I received a very lack luster apology and the bill. I will not return.
