I'm usually always satisfied when I go to the downtown or Oakland location, but this location is just way off the charts. 

We stopped in one evening before a late movie to avoid the costly movie theater food.  (plus it was friday and everyone loves $5 burrito fridays!).

We went in at about 10 minutes before closing time-- which i didnt realize until we walked up & noticed the hours on the door. As we were walking in, all of the employees starred at us as if they were so confused why no one locked the door and how/why we came in this late. 

We go up to the ordering area and pretty much everything had been taken down. One nice worker was kind enough to go in the back and get the things we wanted on our burrito while a very rude female worker giggled at him because it was our fault he was doing extra work. The same  female worker said in a very bad tone "go lock the door so no one else comes in" The entire time she was making our burrito she was too preoccupied with the other employee to even have a quick small talk with us to earn our business in the future- it was like a sad junior high scene of flirting. It was seriously an awkward moment and I just wanted out of there!  I didn't feel welcomed and because of that the south side Q'doba will never have $1 of my hard earned money.

I can only hope that the manager sees all of the numerous terrible reviews for this location and gives them a good lesson in customer service because it is non-existent here.  I've never had an issue with downtown, oakland or shadyside/bloomfield location so we all know that it could get wayy better.
