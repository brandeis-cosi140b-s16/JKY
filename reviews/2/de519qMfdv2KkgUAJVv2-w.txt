New location in Tempe,  recommended from memory of the previous establishment on Curry. I was ready for a wow experience.  The interior is clean, nice wood furniture,  although minimal decor.  Service was average,  not a high mark for hospitality. Menu prices are affordable,  although I feel the food lacks flare and flavor.  Overall, not much atmosphere,  server enthusiasm or exciting food. I would say it's a mid range Mexican food experience.  Try for yourself,  you're opinion may vary.
