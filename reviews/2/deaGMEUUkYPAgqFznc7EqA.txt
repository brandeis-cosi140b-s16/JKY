Crap service.  I hate when I go to a Mexican joint, and they never refill your drinks or chips.  

I went on a Saturday night, and it was semi-busy.  Our food came out quickly, but the waitress never came to check on us.  I shared an chimichanga meal with the boy, and it was very small for being $10.  The menu does not have a lot of selection, either.  I finished my margarita and  the waitress dropped off the check without asking if I wanted another.  I was planning on drinking more and getting dessert, but decided to bail after the poor service.
