Wanted a quick bite so entered Chipotle and was barely greeted by the guy behind the counter - I think he made a sound like "neh"  - so I proceeded to give him my order. Asked for a chicken burrito, but they were out of both beef and chicken - at lunchtime no less. Without a smile nor a friendly smirk and after heating up my tortilla, he filled my burrito with Barbacoa and veggies (remember no beef nor chicken), and passed it on to a girl that seemed equally as miserable to be working there. She added the additional accouterments, wrapped my burro, and handed it to the cashier.

Now the cashier was friendly however not above and beyond as I have experienced in other Chipotles. She was very accommodating when I asked for a paper bowl for my burrito..

Never have I been in a restaurant location where the ENTIRE TEAM was miserable.
