Great looking place!  They start you with a bean dip, salsa and real tortilla chips.... Great!  After that it all went downhill with the corn chowder soup. I is supposed to be freshly made...NOT!!!  It was cold and the cream had a crust as if it had been seating for a while...  The Mexican chicken salad is totally bland and lacked any flavor!  Of all our choices of places to eat in Scottsdale....  This will not be be it again!   For chips and guacamole... Maybe....
