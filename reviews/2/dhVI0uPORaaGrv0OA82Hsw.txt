--lost its traditional feel through the remodel. where has the personality gone?
--bulky dark wooden chairs need cushions, the whole place needs more fabric. great potential with lots of light and high ceilings. More bright mexican ceramics please. stark wall of crosses and exposed wood and wrought iron takes me straight to Nathan Lane's Birdcage apartment. LOL.
--remodel great for small (150ppl) wedding parties with dance floor in the center of the room.

--rice dry and unflavorful, no savor. beans again with no flavor.
--table salsa is canned tomato sauce with pepper seeds and BASIL and the touch of sugar you get from Ragu! It's salsa, not marinara, people!
--guacamole has cottage cheese as a thickener! ew!
--chili colorado is just thick, no flavor.
--service is slow and unhelpful, but prices are high high.
--$9 for the cheese crisp is worth it. great crispiness and good cheese blend.
