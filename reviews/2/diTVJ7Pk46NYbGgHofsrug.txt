Service 4.5
Fundito 2.5 (it's just cheese and tasteless ground beef) you need to eat it fast or it becomes a brick of cheese that destroys your chips.
Enchiladas verdes 3 (not really that flavorful)
Tamales 4 (my GF had these)

Overall skip this place and find another restaurant to eat at.  I wish I did.
