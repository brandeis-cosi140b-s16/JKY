Let's preface this review with acknowledging the fact that I am a big Motley Crue and Vince Neil fan.

That being said... I was disappointed and quite unimpressed with my experience at Tatuado.  The hostess was confused and uncertain of her job.  A server stopped her while she was escorting us to our table and was quietly "yelling" at her while pointing and gesturing (I wanted to say "Excuse me... Can you wait until she isn't WITH a customer to do this?").  Our waiter was "ok", but also seemed a little dazed and confused.  

The food.  Well... Guacamole was all right, I suppose.  Chips were semi-stale, and the sour cream was a little too warm for my liking.  Everything seemed pretty generic from the Chicken Nacho appetizer to the Enchiladas, and Buffalo Wings.  Margaritas were pretty standard, except with Vince's tequila from his Tatuado branding.  

This is definitely somewhere I wanted to experience being a fan, but it is also a "one-and-done" for me.  I wont be returning unless some major shakeup happens and the reviews for this place become stellar over a period of time... and I will keep an eye out for that as I have seen stranger things!  

Vince:  Your music is great, your tattoo shop is damn good... why not hire a more competent management staff for your restaurant to keep up the quality?  #Disappointed.
