Stopped in for lunch today and thought they'd be packed from the looks of the parking lot.  Once inside they didn't appear to be that busy.  We were seated right away.  Chips and salsa came first and I was certainly in need of a beverage by the time they came to take the drink order.  Service from this point was very slow.  Took a good 45 minutes to get our food.  By the time we were ready for the check we really needed to hurry so I asked for it which fell on deaf ears.  I finally walked over to our server and stated we were pressed for time could we get our check and she said she was working on it.  We were extremely patient with the slow service but at this point the elderly woman waiting on us really could have cared less that we needed to hustle up.  Food was ok.  My husband asked specifically if the machaca beef was made with egg and was told it was.  Well it wasn't, basically just shredded beef.  Have lived in Phoenix for 30+ years and only been here once or twice (probably 25+ years ago).   Will certainly not go out of my way to return.
