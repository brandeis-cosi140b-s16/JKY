I've been here twice in past 2 weeks.  Food is good, probably 4 stars.  But service is VERY slow, 1 star.  I probably won't go back as a result of very slow service.  Diego Pops, you HAVE to hire better and more servers or you will not last.  There is way too much competition in Old Town -- restaurants with adequate and much faster staff.  Simple.
