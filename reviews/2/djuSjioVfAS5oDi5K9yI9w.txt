Ordered the Pork Carnitas.....advertised on the menu as slow roasted pork.  Guess the roaster was broke tonight, the pork chunks had been deep fried.  Fried pork....perfect!  Not very good but more importantly, not as advertised.  The habanero sauce was very nice as were the rice , beans fans guacamole.  Stay away from the fried fat, uh, I mean pork....
