This Roberto's is not a very good one compared to others for several reasons.  

Order the same food here, as you would at other Roberto's and you will find you do not get the same amount of meat or cheese or beans or rice.  You will get less.  The last time we went there was very little beef in my husband's chimi --it was mostly beans.  My chicken chimi was better- more meat - but still, lots of beans.

Greasy, greasy, greasy.  Yes, fried food is greasy, but here it is ridiculous.  The tacos drip forever.  We tried this location several times thinking it was just a bad day for them- but we were wrong.  This is how they prepare food there.  

Skip this Roberto's - our favorite is the one on south Las Vegas Blvd, next to the Outback.
