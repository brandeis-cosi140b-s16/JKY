My first time here and I left never wanting to come back again. Our server was nice but it seemed like she had no idea what she was doing. Maybe she was new but non the less anytime we asked her a question about the menu or drinks she had to go ask someone else. She didn't even bring out silverware for us when she brought out our food and we were always waiting on drink refills. It took forever to get drinks and order the food. I was starving by the time we ordered and i ordered the taquitos with bean and rice. The shell of the taquitos were over fried and  when you bit into the food it tasted like stale chips. My other friends got tacos and they said the same thing about the taco shells. On top of all that the credit machine was down when we were trying to pay . She came back and asked if we had cash and when we told her we didn't, she kept saying well we can only take cash so I don't know. We asked her if she could take our card numbers down and charge it when the machine was working again but she said we couldn't. She said they were trying to fix it so we waited another hour and half and by that time I was pissed. She didn't come back to see if there was anything they could do while we waited and kinda just forgot about us. After all the waiting she comes back with the credit card number on the receipt and told us to put the phone number on the back and they will call us when they are going to charge the card. Service sucked and food sucked
