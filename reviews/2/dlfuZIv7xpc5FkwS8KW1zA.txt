First time at this Chipotle but many visits to other franchises. I arrived at 11:30 and there were six full small tables and 20 in line. Not a good mix. The line move very slowly (17 minutes in line). While waiting in line, I saw one server drop her glove on the floor. She put it on anyway, so I asked her to change it. 
By the time I was thru the line, it was 45 peeps deep. 

I ordered the Barbacoa Burrito and a soft drink for $9.75. The food was up to the Chipotle standard that I have come to expect. The service was pretty bad tho. Oddly, all the guys were very pleasant and the girls weren't. Backwards from common society. 

Not sure what's happening at this Chipotle but they need to get it fixed fast or they will suffer a lot of lost business, mine included.
