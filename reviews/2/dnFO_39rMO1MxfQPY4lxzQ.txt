After an online argument with Julia T. about what constitutes Mexican food, I decided to try Rosita's Place, since she gave it such high praise. 

Upon walking in, I was actually pleasantly surprised at how clean the restaurant was. I was expecting more of a Carolina's type atmosphere. The lady who brought us our menus and sat us was very friendly. I thought the fish pond, while extremely odd, was a relaxing touch in the center of the dining room. 

We ordered a half-pitcher of margarita, some chips (since they were raved about) and it all came pretty much right away. The salsa was good, not great, but good. The red being the more flavorful, though hot, and the green being comparatively mild and bland. Margaritas were tasty, but verrrrrry weak. We went through the pitcher and wondered if they had much booze at all. I like the taste of tequila a lot, especially over margarita mix, but I could not taste any tequila in these. Then came the entrees, Chicken Enchiladas for her and Red Burro Enchilada style for me. I ate my food, as I will never leave something on my plate, but I was telling my girlfriend the whole time that it smelled like canned dog food. I didn't say this because I thought it was bad, or gross, but actually smelled identical to dog food. She agreed. I thought long and hard and today it came to me, it smelled like Pedigree brand. 

Overall it is a clean restaurant with great service, but unfortunately somewhat questionable food. I want to know what drugs people are on that makes them think this place has any type of quality. I'll probably go back and try something else, because it had a few things going for it, but the food is NOT one of them.

+1 for cleanliness
