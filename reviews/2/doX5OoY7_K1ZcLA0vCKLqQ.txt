I thought both the chili plate and beef fajitas had little flavor. Salsa and diet coke was great. Guess I expect more chili when I order a chili plate. I thoight it tasted dry. Beef fajita had a very strong beef flavor not ideal. I ate here year ago when they first opened and I remember liking it. Note to self always yelp picture so I remember what to order
