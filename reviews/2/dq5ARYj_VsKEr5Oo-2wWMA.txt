Went there last Sunday with my husband and a friend.  I was so excited to see Peruvian ceviche on the menu!  But then it arrived... :(  I've had a lot of Peruvian food, and this wasn't even close.  The fish wasn't fresh and there wasn't a trace of lime juice that I could see or taste.  The fish was covered in a sticky paste that I assume was supposed to be the aji pepper paste, but that should have been mixed in with a good helping of lime juice.  I can't remember the last time I sent something back, but I was happy to get this off the table!  Our server was really nice about it though... she removed it from the check with no problem.

We then got our entrees... I had the carnitas tacos, my husband had the beef tacos, and our friend had the corn tamales (she's veggie.)  They both enjoyed their entrees, but I found mine a bit bland.  Rice and black bean puree was good, though.

With all the amazing restaurants in Vegas, there's no point in going back to one that, to me, was really lackluster.  One BIG star for the tres leches dessert... now THAT was awesome!
