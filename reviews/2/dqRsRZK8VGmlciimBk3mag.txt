I'm giving Chipotle a 2 only to differentiate them from Qdoba, which is definitely worse, but in a just world this would be a 1.5. The food is only nominally Mexican, meat is dry and not so flavorful, prices not all that reasonable, and the salsa tasteless. There's really no reason to go to either Qdoba or Chipotle with La Bamba and (even better) Los Amigos around.
