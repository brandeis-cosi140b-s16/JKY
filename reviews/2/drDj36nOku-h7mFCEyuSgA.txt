My chicken quesadilla was not anything special. The guacamole was a weird mixture of diced lettuce and avocado (more lettuce). I'm actually not sure if there was avocado in it. I'm just assuming because they  called it guacamole.  I'm 99% sure their tortillas and salsa were from Costco. Don't get me wrong, I like Costco tortillas and salsa, but not from a resturant that should be making their own.
