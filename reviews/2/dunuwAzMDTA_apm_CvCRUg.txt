It's really not that great of a place - but once you're past security in this terminal, there really aren't any other choices.  If you come anytime during airport "rush hour", you'll be hard-pressed to find a place to sit, and your service will be slow as there's usually only one waiter/waitress working the floor.

The drinks are just fine, and the margaritas are above average (cost way above average), but the food sucks.  I've had their burrito, tacos, and their mexican pizza before.  Not great.  

I'd recommend hitting the Wendy's across the walkway first, then bring it into TdT and order a beer.
