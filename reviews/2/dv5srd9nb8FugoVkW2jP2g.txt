I feel horrible writing a bad review, but this is really gross.  I forgot what my parents ordered but they hated it. My order wasnt too bad, but then again, I got chicken wings, you cant really mess up on chicken wings.  The service was good they were really nice, but they were really slow.  If I stay at Fiesta again I will not be coming back.
