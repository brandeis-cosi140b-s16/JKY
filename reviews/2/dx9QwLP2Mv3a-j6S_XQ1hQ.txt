I've gone to The Commissary a few times, and I've always ordered their burritos. The burritos are always a win-win. 

I tried being adventures today, so I ordered the Pepito torta (mexican sandwich). Totally disappointing. There wasn't a lot of carne asada on it, and the sandwich well flat in flavor and taste. I ordered the sandwich with a side of dipping sauce, which I believe was supposed to be like an enchilada sauce, but it was bland and tasted more like tomato paste. Also, the sauce cost an extra $2. 

The two star is because I didn't get a flavorful or fulfilling meal, and I paid $15.31. The prices are a bit steep, but again, the burritos are worth it. Guess I'll stick with that next time:)
