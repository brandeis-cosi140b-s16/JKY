Went to this place on a Wednesday evening. Not to busy....which is always my first concern..but I gave it the benefit of the doubt since growing up this place had great food and service. Well that was shut down real quick. 

The service was really good our waitress Ria was super accommodating and agreed with us when we had issues with the food. She really made sure we were getting what we paid for and that our experience was good. However, the issue came along when we ordered the pick two fajitas. Steak and chicken was our choice. 

When it came out the server boy or whatever you call him...kept yelling our order like we were incompetent humans and if we didn't answer right away he would get super frustrated and just push our plate in front of someone. He also cussed in front of a table full of children. Mind you there were 8 of us..so patients is the key with big parties everyone knows that. ON top of that the steak was four of the thinnest pieces of steak I have ever seen...it looked like bird food. Here to find out they weigh their food and cheat you out of it...so that's disappointing. I mean this place is no where I will be going back to especially with a person who cusses in front children OVER FOOD!!!! Come on people!  The only reason I would go back is for Ria's service but nothing else.
