A debate between 2 and 3 stars.

Food was actually okay.  Not great, but not bad.  Nachos with chunks of seasoned meat, sour cream, fresh guac, slice jalepenos, etc... pretty generously sized for like $8.   We enjoyed it, and it was very filling. 

Salsa was top notch.  Fresh, spicy, good.  

My wife and I each had fajitas, and shared with kids.  Very family friendly place.  

8pm Saturday, only about 15 people in the whole restaurant.

Chicken fajitas were better than shrimp, nicely cooked and sliced.  Lots of shrimp, but smaller shrimp than I would have liked for a $15 entree.  My wife thought it would have been better if there were more veggies... it was about 2/3 meat.

Service was good and courteous.

This used to be a chain restaurant for a decade, and then it shut down due to lack of business.  The general manager of the restaurant under the chain took over the lease and is running a very similar restaurant under his own management.

The inside is fairly standard, if a bit dated. 

Bottom line, the food was okay.  I wouldn't hate eating there again, but in a city full of amazing "hole in the wall" cheap Mexican restaurants and really fun upscale "new" Mexican fare, it just doesn't do enough to distinguish.  And for the prices, it needs to distinguish, because I think it is at the high end for the food quality and the setting.

I do wish the new owner the best though.
