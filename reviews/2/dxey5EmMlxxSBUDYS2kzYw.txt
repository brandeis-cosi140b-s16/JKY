Disappointed! I was craving a chicken salad so I tried their Carambas sal picon chicken salad. All the ingredients were chopped up into small bits, including the lettuce. I had a hard time finding the chicken. They slapped on a huge spoon full of sour cream and guacamole on top. Don't get me wrong! I love guacamole, but not a ton of it. The salad didn't have much flavor so I returned it and got the Chile Relleno combo instead. So now I'm having a hard time finding the chili. They drowned it in their sauce, the beans had a slight burnt taste to them, and the rice was cold. I think the only thing they did right was the chips and salsa. I would not recommend this place if you're looking for "Real Mexican Food".
