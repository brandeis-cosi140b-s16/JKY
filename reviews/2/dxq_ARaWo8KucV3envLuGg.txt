Ordered 2 chili rellenos from this place with a side of rice and got this instead. I specifically  stated i wanted NO bean.  Im vegetarian and can't eat them.  I wanted rice.  And got double beans and no rice instead. I get its Mexican food , but English is still the national language.  If you don't know it you shouldn't be working on a job that requires you to speak the native tongue. I paid money for this bean covered mess. 10$ to be exact.
