We ordered the nachos grande and they came out with burned chips all the way around the plate. They were piled high so we ate around the burned sections. Orders the n√∫mero siete with shredded beef and chicken enchiladas, Mexican rice, and fiedo. The beef one wasn't bad, the chicken one was a solid piece of chicken so kinda hard to eat compared to the usual shredded chicken most places have. The staff was kinda rude and barely came around to check on drinks or how things were.
