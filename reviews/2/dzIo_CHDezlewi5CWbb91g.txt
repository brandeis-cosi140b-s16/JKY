Just tried cafe rio after seeing that it just opened and reviews seemed to be pretty good so far. I ordered the grilled chicken burrito. .. rice was over cooked and bland, the meat and salsas were also very bland. I had them load up the hot salsa and it was milder than the mild from Chipotle. Yes, I'm going there. .. I'd drive the extra 3 miles to get a Chipotle burrito over the cafe rio one that is right down the street from me. 
The place is spacious and set up well and the staff is friendly. However, I go to restaurants mostly for the quality of food.
