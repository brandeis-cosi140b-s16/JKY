I can confidently say that I will never go here again.

To be fair, I went to La Paz for dinner with a group of 30.  Nonetheless, this was an event planned well in advance that the restaurant was aware of.  So one would think that they would be prepared with the proper waitstaff to handle this size of a party.  But they clearly were not.

Dinner took at least 45-60 minutes to come out.  The food runners and waiters were not able to distinguish between entrees, so figuring out who ordered what and what each plate even had on it delayed the meal even further.  Our waitress repeatedly came by asking, "Can I get you anything?"  when every water glass at the table was empty.

I will say that their chips are very good.  But this is the only Mexican restaurant I have ever been to that refilled the chip basket once then let the empty basket sit there for over an hour.

The blended margarita was passable.

The taco salad with grilled chicken was underwhelming.  Where the heck were the beans and rice?

My boyfriend's Street Pork Tacos tasted like what dog food smells like.
