The food was great I had a chimichunga and ordered the carnitas! the chimichunga was the only thing that was served warm and  The service was bad...unfortunately, the steak nachos were cold and one of my guests was charged 3.00$ for sour cream and she ordered nachos! E yi yiiii ...newy the food was medium n service is rude... only eat here if u really want some Mexican food and really starving..our waitress was unprofessional and rude.Honestly the best thing was the chips and salsa...thats what the two stars are for OmG! yikes.....
