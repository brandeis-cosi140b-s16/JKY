Grew up in the area eating Popos, Zamoras, Raul and Teresas...I know Mexican food!  

I have eaten here at least 20 times!

Compared to Filibertos and the other whatever-abertos, this one is OK.  Fair price for ok food. The service sucks, drive though is horribly slow, indoors is not much better.  Last time I ordered the cooks were messing around in the stock room for 10 minutes before dropping my rolled tacos in the deep frier and no one else was there...WTF?

I'd say the food is average, the guac is really good, salsa bar is always stocked and clean.  Filibertos in Avondale 4 miles south is better!  Maybe less white people down south at Filibertos makes the cashiers give the white people there better service...maybe???!  Maybe I order completely in spanish next time and see if they speed up?  Rapido por favor!!!!

Overall for the price and convenient location, its better than nothing but the food again is just ok and the service sucks.
