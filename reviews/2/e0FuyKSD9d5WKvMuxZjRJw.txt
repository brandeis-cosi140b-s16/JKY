I am not a fan of Chipotle.  My sister loves them and I tried with her in Washington state but never liked.  I moved to Chandler at the end of March and because I was super hungry but didn't know where anything was decided to give Chipotle a second chance.  The steak burrito I had tasted just like the others I had before and I will never be back again.  The steak was dry and didn't taste very good.  I have since found several good places to grab a burrito in a hurry, my favorite so far is Filibertos.
