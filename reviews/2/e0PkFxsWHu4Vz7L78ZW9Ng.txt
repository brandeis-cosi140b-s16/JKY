Okay, let's atart with the salsa bar. This was my first time going into Robertos and I have to say I was a little disappointed with the selections of salsas. There were only two to choose from. There was a red and a green. I looked for Pico de Gallo but there wasn't any. I have to say both salsas were very good. The red one was much spicier than the green but both had a nice kick. 

On to the bean and cheese burrito. This burrito sounds very basic but I wanted to taste their beans without a buch of other added ingredients. The burrito was very good. It was hot, freshly made and rolled to perfection. I loaded it with the red and green salsa and it was perfect.

The beef taco de lengua and the carne asada tacos were also a good choice. The meat was tender and seansoned well. Each taco cost $2.75. Honestly I thought  they were priced a little high. Especially when they are right across the street from UNLV.

My last review is the fish taco. It was very basic. I swear it tasted like a taco with two (tiny) Van De Kamp fishsticks inserted. That taco cost $2.75 but should have been closer to $.99. I was dissapointed with this choice.

I was also a bit dissapointed that they did not give out a small side of chips and salsa while we were waiting for our meal. When I inquired about getting chips I was told that a side would cost me $3. 

To sum it up, the food was pretty good but priced a little high. I wished I had passed on the fish taco. I don't think I will be revisiting.
