My boyfriend and I were looking for some good Mexican food near house. Seeing the previous Yelp reviews we thought we'd give it a try. Since it was early on a Monday afternoon, the place was dead! We had to call out for somebody to help us after waiting for a few minutes. In hindsight, we should have taken this as our cue to leave. Our server was friendly and attentive to our needs. However, our food was bland and left a lot to be desired. Also, the margaritas were very weak and tasted watered down.
