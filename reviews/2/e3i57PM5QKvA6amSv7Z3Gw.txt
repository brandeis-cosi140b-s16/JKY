We've eaten at this restaurant a few times and this past experience was very disappointing.  The service was delayed and the food was horrible.  We were served the chips and salsa right away when we were seated and our waiter captured our beverage orders in a timely fashion.  I ordered the veggie fajitas and bf asked if he could order a burrito with veggies, black beans and cheese.  No problem, order was submitted and beverages were being consumed.  

Our food arrives...my fajitas were sizzling but the flavor and seasoning was lacking and the vegetables were really raw, like they might have made contact with the grill top for a minute or two before being transferred to the cast iron plate.  There were corn kernels in the mix and they were stale and chewy like they had been sitting out awhile.  Bf's burrito was a disaster.  Inside he found an obscene amount of cheese and a couple traces of vegetables.  The beans were served on the side rather than as requested.  When the cheese congealed together he wasn't able to eat any more because of the texture.   This is when we dissected it looking for the morsels of vegetables.  By now, our drinks were empty but we couldn't see our waiter so we just waited so we could pay and leave.

We also noticed the other tables in our area were not being attended too.  One table had to sit and look at their food sitting on the server's tray wondering if they should just get up and put it on the table themselves.  A large group behind us commented about their lack of beverages after they had been seated for quite a while.  It seemed odd to me because the restaurant was full of staff and maybe only 60% full of customers.  

If management reads this, please consider making your bean dip and rice without lard and chicken stock. For those of us that are vegetarian/vegans we would really appreciate it.
