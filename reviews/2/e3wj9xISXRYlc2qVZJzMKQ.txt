Since my last review 3 years ago, I'm sad to report that along with the name change to Papa Chevo's, the quality here has declined as well.  While the fare from the days of yore had an appealing freshness and the flavorings for the meat were always good, it's all just buried in salt now; disappointing as we were happy regulars for many years.
