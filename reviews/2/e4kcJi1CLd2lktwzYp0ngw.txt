I drove by this place several times hoping to get a chance to check it out.  I guess sometimes you have to be careful what you wish for because it might come true. 

The service was OK, all 4 of the ladies standing in the tiny kitchen behind the oddly oriented ordering wall just seemed indifferent about the whole process.  

The food was...teetering between tasteless and wishing it was more tasteless.  I could make a better taco and burrito at home with a bag of co-jack and an Old El Paso box kit.  My daughter and I left without finishing our food.

One bonus star for not getting sick from anything.
