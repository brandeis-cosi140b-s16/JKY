I would love to give them a higher rating. For the most part I like their food. Had an excellent burrito , best ever Chile relleno,  good menudo which I go for on the weekends.  But last night I had a cheese enchilada with my chile relleno and they forgot to cook it. Yes, cheese was not melted and it was cold. I couldn't  get to my microwave to heat it because we are remodeling - which is why I went out for food.  Then I realized I couldn't even complain nor call. Going back next time and asking them to please make sure they cook my food properly is not possible. No one there speaks English. So in the past when I got corn tortillas instead of flower I ate them. You see, no speak English.  My feeling is that if one has an eating establishment in America please respect your clients and be able to serve them properly. I also like to go out for sushi but I don't need to speak Japanese. I like Italian food but I'm normally served in English and if I have a complaint I am able to voice it. Is that too much to ask for?
