Can I give two separate ratings?  The two is an average of my two stops, for which I'd give it a 5 and a 0.  Obviously the 5 visit came first or I wouldn't have been back.

The first trip was great!  My plane landed and I yelped for taqueria's (after 3 months in NJ following a year in SoCal I was dying for good mexican) this place was close to the airport with good reviews so I figured I'd give it a try.  Fantastic, simple, cheap and delicious.  The hot sauce was great, so tasty.  

This was therefore our logical dinner stop on our way back to the airport after a week and a half traveling around arizona and utah.  

I tried to order the "grande burro" with beans instead of the meat.  I am a vegetarian, but I wanted the lettuce, tomato, and guacamole instead of just beans and cheese.  After 5 minutes of discussion, trying to explain this (the girl at the counter spoke perfect english, I don't know why no meat was so confusing) she convinced me to just get a bean and cheese burrito.  Fine whatever, so I got a bean and cheese burrito.  Or so I thought.  I cut into it (sitting in my car in the parking lot b/c they had closed the seating area for the night) and found a chunk of meat.

So I brought it back, and told her that I didn't want meat.  She was incredibly nice and very apologetic and had the cook re-make it "without" meat.  At this point I'm looking at my watch wondering if we're making our plane.  My boyfriend finished his food before I got back to the car.  So I come back with a new burrito (and no new salsa since I'd dumped the salsa they'd given me onto the first burrito before seeing the meat :( ), dig into it and not seeing any meat, we drive off.  Munching along while driving, I came across the meat.  The rest of my burrito went into the trash at the car rental return place and I went home hungry and disappointed.
