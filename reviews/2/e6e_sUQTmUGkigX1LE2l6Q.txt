I stumbled upon Joyride during their soft open and was graciously invited in for dinner and drinks. Ate almost everything and drank a lot and it was free. Amazing ambience and great people and music and servers. The food was amazing, we were blown out the water. Especially the Veggie Taco's, Im a meat guy, but the Veggie Taco was out of this world. Oh man we loved it. My BF and I decided we were definitely going back.

We went back a second time. The ambience was still amazing and lively and we sat down,and ordered drinks and food and were so excited bc we talked it up. And the waitress was so awesome. The food came, and there was something off. The food went from a 10/10 to an 8/10.

3rd time i went with some new friends who were excited to go bc of how much we talked it up. The ambience and people were lively, great staff and ordered the food and drinks and the food came and it was like "what the heck is happening", it was a 7/10. Friends looked at me like "Youre at culinary school and you eat at a lot of places around the world and this is what you like?"

4th time Again the ambience and staff is great and lively, but the food wasnt great. I didnt enjoy it at all. No one did. it was a 6/10

Finally the 5th time, same, great ambience but the trio salsa was gross, and the food, i wanted to just scarf it down to leave. I wanted to ask for the Chef, but the food has been consistently gross. We decided to stop going.
