A group of friends and I visited Tapacubo over the weekend.  We wanted to grab drinks and a bite to eat before heading over to see a show at Gammage.  The drinks were all right, although the rooftop does not have a full bar.  The view was really nice, especially at sunset.  However, the food was a total letdown.  I had a chicken and a short rib taco and both were flavorless and greasy.  I was hungry and I didn't even want to finish them.  My boyfriend had the fundido sliders which were also lacking flavor.  Everyone else said their meal was mediocre at best.  The churros were pretty good for dessert, but that was the only thing I tried that was worth eating.  This place is ok to have a beer or two and enjoy the view, but eat somewhere else.
