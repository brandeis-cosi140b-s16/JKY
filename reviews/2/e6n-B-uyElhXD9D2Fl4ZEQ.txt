I was not impressed at all with this place. To be completely honest, I went to Robertos right after to get more food. To start the meal was overpriced. The portion size was much smaller than Cafe Rio or Roberto's and the quality was not even close. The pork was dry and the tortillas were not very good. They also did not have dessert when I was there. Why have it on the menu? Just a tease! I will not be returning!
