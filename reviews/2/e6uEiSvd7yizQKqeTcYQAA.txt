Full disclosure - we lived in SoCal for the past 17 years so we haven't found really good Mex yet in the burgh. You have to pay for chips & salsa, the chips weren't salted after they were fried & no salt shaker on bar. Salsa was good, hot but not scorching. Drinks were WAY overpriced. 7.50 for a regular margarita -no mention of the tequila brand. They were tasty (but for the drab atmosphere (which is perfectly okay for a Mexican restaurant) too spendy. Beer was no better at $5 a bottle. My beef tacos were tasty but the cooked onion was wrong for the dish. Should have been raw onion with the cilantro for a street taco feel. The hub ordered the least Mexican dish, the chimichanga, and he swears it wasn't deep fried and had only steak inside. The saddest complaint was when we ordered guacamole, it was so so so obviously packaged & not even as good as Calavo. This place has potential, but I fear it will be gone in 6 months.
