The Food was good.. However, they were very shady at the end. The check came, I looked at it and it was right. I gave them my card and the manager (not the waiter) brought me back the check having been authorized for a different amount (about $10 more). He claimed "things were missing" from the original check. I asked for the detail and he left.. the Waiter came back in 10 minutes looking for the signed check. I told him the manager was bringing me the details, he left... 10 minutes later after asking 2 more times I decided $10 wasn't worth it and I signed it and left.
