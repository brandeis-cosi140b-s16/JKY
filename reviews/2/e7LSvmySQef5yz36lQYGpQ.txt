I will not recommend this place...  I ended up here because a friend chose to have her B-Day get-together here, and after reading the other reviews, I decided to stick with drinks only.

I had the red Sangria and loved it.  In fact, I went the very next day with another friend to order that  drink again, but this time the drink was flavorless and did not taste the same.  When I questioned the bartender, he was kind of un- gracious and mumbled something like I probably got the end of a batch or something..... I usually don't notice bad service but this time I did (even before I tasted the bad Sangria).
