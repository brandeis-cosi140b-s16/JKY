Well friendly service is about the only positive I can give for this location. I waited too long at the window for my food. No one was in the drive-thru, but service was slow enough for the guy to tell me "sorry for the wait." I had a hunch to check my order (something I do not practice routinely) and noticed they forgot my tacos. I got home about 7 min later to eat my food as soon as I arrived home, only to experience soggy food! Yuck! Boo hoo! I'll stick to home made tacos with a bag of Doritos on the side!
