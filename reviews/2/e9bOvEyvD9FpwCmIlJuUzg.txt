The food is like every other Chipotle. The staff is fast at making food, which is necessary since the line at lunch is usually out the door. This location gets so crowded it is hard to get a seat even if you can find an empty one. And they always make it so the tortilla doesn't close. I have had to get a bowl and fork the last 3x. Best to go between meals like at 2-3pm takes way too long and too chaotic otherwise.
