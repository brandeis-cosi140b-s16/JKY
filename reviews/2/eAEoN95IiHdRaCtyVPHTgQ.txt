I went here after reading quite a few good reviews and I was disappointed. Yelp, you lead me astray this time! 

I pulled up and the building was so empty I couldn't even tell if it was open and had to tug on the handle to find out. I know I went after the lunch hour on a weekday but I wasn't expecting it to be THIS empty. 

Anyway, I ordered carne asada tacos and chips and salsa and there was some confusion in regards to my order. I was asked if I wanted only carne asada or if I wanted the tacos.

The tacos were regrettable. When I order carne asada tacos, I don't expect anything other than meat, white onions, cilantro or an optional sprinkling of green cabbage to be involved. These tacos arrived and were massive and had some sort of green, gelatinous smear hidden underneath the meat. I'm guessing this was some sort of processed guacamole, but the uniform color of it all just made me uncomfortable. There was no variation like one sees in an actual avocado or homemade guacamole. Also, I've never seen cheddar cheese served melted atop beans in a Mexican restaurant. Just ugh. I never did get the chips and salsa I ordered but I had given up long before then.

The only other person in the restaurant with me was some guy in a suit who was loudly making a pitch of some sort. I couldn't tell if he was trying to sell the employees a product or if he was somehow involved in the restaurant. 

There are better places in the area. I'd leave this one alone.
