Incorrectly labeled as Mexican food. It's not. This is American food with Mexican flavors.  I feel sorry for Dormont/South Hills people that don't know any better and think this is Mexican food.  I don't think they claim to be proper Mexican food but, I don't like that they even use the 'Mexi' in the name .  Have been here 3 times and it's just kind of 'meh' every time .
