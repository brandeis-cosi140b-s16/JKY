Standard Mexican Fare.  A lot of people say it's better that Roberto's, but it's exactly the same.  If you didn't see a name on the store front, you wouldn't be able to tell the difference.

Got the ham & egg breakfast burrito.  It was 80% potato, 10% egg, 10% ham.  I skipped on the cheese.  It's fine if you're starving and need something fast, but don't go out of your way to go here.
