Love all the beans and veggies.  The food type in general is healthy. It is delicious.  But it's not the highest quality.  The service is a little lower than average.  We ordered a meal and it came out to be significantly less than we expected.  When we asked them why it was so sub par they just said that was the price.  We were just surprised they weren't accommodating or at least embarrassed to serve something with only 2 ingredients.  So we sent it back.  The saving grace is the dips.  Best bean dip,  best salsa.  So definitely start the meal with the free chips and dip.
