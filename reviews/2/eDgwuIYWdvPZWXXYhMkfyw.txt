I must say that I really liked the Macayo's in Phoenix--I gave that place a good review.  This place though?

The food was good and filling.  I had shredded beef tacos with beans and rice.  The tacos were really dense and good-tasting.  I finished off the meal with sopapillas that were really tasty.  The problem came later.  Both my wife and I began to get gas and emit foul-smelling belches for hours after.  Neither one of us felt very good for the rest of the night.  It wasn't food poisoning, but there was lasting indigestion.  That was not good.  

I would say the food is good, but the malaise that I experienced on my flight back to San Francisco would persuade me to steer clear of this place again.
