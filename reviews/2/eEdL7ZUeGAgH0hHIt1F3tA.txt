Dined here on 5/17...average at best...food ok, margaritas eh...service ok...ambience eh...there's two other similar restaurants that I can think of in Las Vegas that offer more authenticity, tastier cuisine and much better margaritas. Try Viva Zapatas on E. Craig Rd. if you're in North Las Vegas or Lindo Mihoacan on Flamingo Rd. in East Las Vegas. You'll get more bang for your $$.
