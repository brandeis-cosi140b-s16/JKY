Upon entering, the first thing I noticed was no air conditioning. Its 106 outside and NO AC???? Sat down and the waitress brought over chips, salsa, and some yellow/greenish kind of dip. The chips were stale. The salsa was OK. The greenish/yellowish stuff was crappish. I got an Iced tea. Although there was some ice in it, it wasn't cold. Then I ordered a burrito, which came with rice and beans. The burrito was ok, as were the rice and beans. My iced tea was never refilled. Not sure I would have wanted any more though. The iced tea just wasn't very good.

The whole time, there was a soccer game on all the TV's in the place. The same game was on all the TV's but the audio was several seconds off on each TV. Very annoying.

Summary: just OK. I shan't go back.
