First the good: The food is good and the service is attentive. Our server made sure our drinks were always full and one of the bussers also asked us if we had everything we needed. Another reviewer said they were charged for chips and salsa. We were not. 

Now the bad, which unfortunately completely outweighs the good. The atmosphere is terrible. First, if you go at night, bring a flashlight because it is too dark to see anything. Second problem is the seating. It is cast iron mesh with the back of the chair being too far back to offer any back support. In about 5 minutes, you'll feel as though you are sitting on a solid block of iron, that's how uncomfortable they are. It escapes me why anyone would select the most uncomfortable seating imaginable for a restaurant. The third problem is the music. It is a constant, incessant barrage of Spanish accordion music. I suppose it's intent is to conjure up images of a quaint Spanish cantina on some backroad of Mexico, but because it is non-stop, it quickly grates on your nerves. And fourth, there is a large refrigeration unit in the dining area that emits a loud, unceasing drone. 

It's a shame too, because if it wasn't for the atmosphere and seating, we would go back. However, there are simply too many other restaurants in general and too many Mexican restaurants in particular to visit for us to return to a place with such a disagreeable atmosphere and awful seating.
