My niece got the chicken nachos, which I watched them make:  chips, chicken, beans & chez was placed on a styrofoam plate and then microwaved.  The outcome is a soggy, chewy, mildly flavored slop.  My nephew got 2 beef enchiladas, which were actually ok. Their red sauce was good.  I got the Pepe sampler, which was pretty dull.  The beef and chicken just didn't have a good flavor, although their guac was pretty good.  total with 2 soft drinks and a beer was $32, so not *that* cheap.  I would rather go somewhere that uses real plates and metal silverware and pay an extra $10.
