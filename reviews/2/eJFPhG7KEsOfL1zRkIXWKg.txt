Came here for pizza hut pizza. This taco bell doesn't not sell pizza. Some-how due to not being able to use the bathroom, I decide to order some fast food. I order the nachos grande or whatever you call it. Boy I haven't being here in years and I guessed it showed. These nachos only had cheese, sour cream, chicken, and beans. So I had to add extra toppings. Yelp 20 mins later- taco bell did it's job-I am now sitting on the toilet  writing this review and boy I am happy that I am to use the restroom.
