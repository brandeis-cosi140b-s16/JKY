I used to love going to this restaurant when I moved here a year ago. The atmosphere is unique and the happy hour drink specials are great. 

However, the less I drink there, the more I notice how bad the service is. It takes forever to get someone to come to your table when you first get there. Then after that, it takes quite a while for them to come back Also, our servers were not nice. You could tell they didn't want to be there. And that happens about every time I go. 

Besides the service, the food is mediocre.

I will be looking for a new place with cheap drinks and better service.
