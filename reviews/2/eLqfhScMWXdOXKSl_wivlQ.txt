I usually stop here from time to time, hoping that the food has gotten better.. but it still hasn't.  Roberto's used to be my go to late night eats b/c it's right down the street from my house and the price wasn't too bad for a huevos rancheros plate.  But, the quality has dipped a bit a couple of months ago but, somehow, I keep coming back hoping that maybe they would magically improve like in the beginning.  But, it's the same everytime.  The only thing I like about this Roberto's is that they usually get my order right and the workers are nice, but it still pushing me over to Rivas for some better eat and the refillable fountain drink machine.
