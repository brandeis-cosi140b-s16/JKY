There is truly a lack of good Mexican food in Pittsburgh and Agave doesn't really give itself anything to rave about. The service was good, the place is a good size and there was no wait on a Saturday night. These are all good things about this place. Bad thing, and the most important: The food just didn't cut it. I left, unsatisfied and craving better Mexican food. 

The fi on the other hand loved it. Maybe I'm just too picky.
