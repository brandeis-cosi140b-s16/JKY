Unfortunately the food is just OK. not great.

My child ordered the kids plate and we had to wrestle the counter staff to get each of the "extras" that come with tho kid's plate, like salsa and a tiny cinnamon donut. The staff did not apologize for forgetting these items and just gruffly handed them over.

I wish I could support this Charlotte chain restaurant, but this location is not worth a return visit. The uptown Salsaritas in the Bank of America is clean, friendly, and tasty. In South Charlotte, better to go to Chipotle.
