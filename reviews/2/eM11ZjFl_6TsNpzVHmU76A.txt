I came here on a Wednesday for dinner around 5pm. There wasn't really anyone there but also the place is huge so I'm sure you can come anytime without having to wait. 

I got the Enchiladas Mexicanas which comes with 3 enchiladas with your choice of chicken, beef, cheese only, or beans on the inside and either the green or red sauce (you can get both too).

 I got 2 chicken and 1 beef with both the red and green sauce. It wasn't all that great the red sauce was better than green and the protein was 'whatever.' 

Also their menu was a little bit confusing. It was ridden with typos and errors so some of the items on the menu didn't make any sense and had to be clarified by the waiter. 

I wouldn't come again...I would probably go to Las Palmas for some yummy tacos.
