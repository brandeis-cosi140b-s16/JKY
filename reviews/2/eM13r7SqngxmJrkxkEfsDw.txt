I have never eaten here before, and I will NOT do it again. I ordered veggie fajitas. It came with zucchini, onions, corn and some kind of spicy red pepper. It was utterly flavorless aside from heat from the pepper. I don't think they even added salt/pepper. These were seriously the worst fajitas I have ever had. It comes with corn or flour tortillas. I had flour and they were good. It came with tomatillo salsa which was meh. The only thing I enjoyed aside from the tortillas were the refried beans. 

Talk about a waste of 12.75. I would have been better off at Chipotle.
