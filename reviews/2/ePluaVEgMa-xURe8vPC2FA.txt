The food here is decent and pretty reasonably priced given it's location inside the Palms, but the service is not great in my experience.  The hostess seemed more annoyed than welcoming.  Also, the past few time's I've been here, once plates hit the table, the waitress becomes scarce.  I had to walk into the dining room to get someone's attention so our water glasses could be refilled and so I could get another beer.  I like to sit outside on the patio, so that might explain it.  If so, that's no excuse.  If you don't want to service patio diners properly, don't seat people on the patio.
