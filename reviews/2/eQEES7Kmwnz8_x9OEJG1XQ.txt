Not sure what all the fuss is about. I did not enjoy this place. This is a typical "authentic" Mexican style restaurant named after a person (you know, Roberto's, Laurita's, Pepe's, Beto's) with "authentic" meaning the flour tortillas are semi transparent due to being grilled in lard. I ordered a Machaca Torta, but they gave me a Jamon y Huevo Torta. The torta bread was blackened in places which did not add to the flavor - but detracted from it. The egg was too brown too. Basically, not a good sandwich at all. My wife ordered the #8 (2 Tacos) but got a #9 (Burrito and enchilada). So, it would have been nice to get what we ordered. The cheese in the enchilada was very odd, like thin spaghetti. It retained that shape even after heating. The enchilada sauce tasted like it came out of a can. The fries were plentiful and good however. Overall, I will not go there again. I think every one of this type of Mexican restaurant get the pictures of their combination plates from the same place.
