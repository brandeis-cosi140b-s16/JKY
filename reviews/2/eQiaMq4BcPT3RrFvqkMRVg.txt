I haven't been to this place in years because my first experience was underwhelming. Tonight I gave it another shot and was very disappointed again. First they ran out of the homemade tortilla chips and replaced them with stale crumbs. This was especially unfortunate since it took over an hour for us to get the burrito and shrimp tacos that we ordered. Once the food came it tasted good but it came out at different times and looked like one of the plates had been ready and waiting for a while. The whole time we were waiting for our food the waiter never came by to address the long ticket time.
