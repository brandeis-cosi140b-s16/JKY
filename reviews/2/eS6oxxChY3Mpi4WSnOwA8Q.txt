Why do we keep going to Ketzal Mexican Grill? 

Is it because of their location? Nope, just hop onto to the I17 and you can be at several restaurants in less then 10 mins.

Is it because of their prices? Nope

Is it because of their decor and ambiance? Big time NOPE

Is it because of their service? PA-LEAZE.... You can get better service at a taco bell!  I mean it too, just read through these Yelp reviews.  This place just doesn't get it. Your customers are telling you time and time again to treat us better.  Bar girl, please put down that cell phone and wait on your customers! Oh yeah, and stop waiting on us while your talking on that cell phone.  (it was almost comical!) Server dude, please be more attentive so I don't have to come looking for you to fill our drinks, chips or anything else. We need more interaction with you other than giving us our menus, taking our orders and then 1 hour later show back up to give us our bill.  Mr Manager/Owner, you seem like a nice guy every time we walk in but then you disappear behind the wall on your cell phone.... 

Is it because of their food?  May be.  My bride loves their Tacos Light ~ chicken in lettuce tacos. She orders this every time we go.  My son likes their burger and fries of course.  I do like their steak and chicken Fajitas and their chicken or carne asada enchiladas with their green or red chili sauces. Their salsa platter and chips are good and used to be complimentary but now they will cost ya!
