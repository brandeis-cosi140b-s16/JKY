The view and the service was nice, but the food, well...  Not so much.  I have to say, I was really disappointed.  I had the chicken taco.  It was very bland, to say the least.  I "encountered" chicken bones, not just once, but twice.  I had a taste of my husband's carne asada, and must say, a taste was about all I could handle.  No flavor and the meat was on the tough side.  I commented that we would have been much better off with the food at Taco Bell. Sorry, but just being totally honest here.  Won't plan on ever coming back here again.  A nice view and service just won' t cut it for us.
