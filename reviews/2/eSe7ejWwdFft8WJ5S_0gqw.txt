I was not impressed at all.  I expect Mexican food, whose flavor foundation includes garlic, chiles, onion, and lime to be vibrant, but my cheese enchiladas were completely bland.  My peach margarita tasted like sugar water. 
This restaurant proclaims itself to be "Mexico City Food", but the menu seemed to be comprised of boring Mexican chain restaurant standards.  I was left wondering what was supposed to differentiate this cuisine from other Mexican restaurants (I presume La Parilla Suiza was simply trying to state that it's not a TexMex restaurant).
Will not be returning.
