Its hit or miss whenever i come here. The staff is rude and some look stoned. The portions depend on whos making your food. So you could go there and get your moneys worth or you could go there and get ripped off with small portions. 
The punch card is a joke the staff will try often restamp the same spot making it look like one stamp. They're not very engaging with the customers most of the time they are having their own conversations or texting.
