Wasnt really feeling it. If your in the neighborhood I guess it's worth it but don't make the drive. The food was just okay the service was really good but couldn't redeem my  tummies disappointment. I was super excited about their bottled fanta too but sadly it was flat. Just sad and flat :( Not worth the gas to go back. Everything was just ok I really thought the yelpers had my back on this one but I guess you get led astray every once in awhile.
