For the price and quality. I've had better.

When I go to a Mexican Restaurant, I like to try their lengua (tongue) because it's how I can tell if they put thought and effort into their cooking. 

The Lengua at Roberto's is flavorless and greasy. I've had better in Los Angeles. 

The positive note with Robertos is their burrito contents. They will give you a burrito filled with meat. So filling... but flavor, it's lacking.
