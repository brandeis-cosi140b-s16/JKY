The owner is nice, very talkative, and a crazy lunatic for wearing a Seattle Seahawks hat in this town.  Honestly, his personality boosted my overall opinion of the place because at best,  the food is just okay.  Given that he's parked his truck/stand/food cubicle literally 20 feet away from Salsarita's, I expected a bit more from his offering.

The problem is that the tacos are standard and boring.  Lettuce, Tomato, salsa, sour cream?  I mean really?  I guess if I were a taco stand guy trying to compete with a major taco brand chain restaurant 20 feet away, I'd try some sort of spin or special edition tacos or something.  Some sort of mango chutney salsa with the pork, or some kind of creative chicken taco.  Maybe Wednesdays are fish taco days where you can get extra cilantro on your fried cod taco.  There is literally nothing differentiating his food from his competitor except he lags behind the chain restaurant in his variety of ingredients and offerings.  Want to keep the standard tacos mom used to make on a school night on the menu?  Fine, but at least flank them daily with some sort of show-stopper taco for those of us whose taste buds graduated the 4th grade.  

It's a neat concept, I will give him that, and with some creative offerings, he's got a shot at making it.  I'm just not optimistic given his current menu, average quality and completely unnecessary free-water giveaways.
