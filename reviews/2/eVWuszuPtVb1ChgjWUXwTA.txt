HATE  Nothing.

DISLIKE  My server's forgetfulness (took away menu after I told her I wasn't done looking at it and also gave me refried beans when I asked for black). The other server who was missing for 15 minutes (who was supposed to get chips and salsa to each table as they were sat). The chicken carbon taco. The seat cushion almost fell over when I sat on it (and I don't weigh very much).

LIKE  The cheerful hostess. My server's personality (very nurturing and was apologetic for the above). The many salsa dips the chips came with. The steak carbon taco.

LOVE  Nothing.
