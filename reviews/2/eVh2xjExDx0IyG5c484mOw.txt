The food was decent, but the staff was not very pleasant to deal with. I've been here twice, (only because I loved their tortilla soup) but each time I've gone, my waitress has been very snotty and rude. And as a couple of other people have mentioned, the staff in general is slightly lazy. I would recommend the food to other people, but not the atmosphere. I can't see this establishment staying open for very much longer.
