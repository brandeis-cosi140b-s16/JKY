This wasn't my first time here, but it's been over a year since my last visit. I don't prefer dining at Roberto's locations, but this one is open 24 hours and I wanted tacos after midnight. They were pretty busy for a Thursday night, but then again it's summer and no school. I ordered two Adobada tacos from the less-than-enthusiastic cashier (I mean, seriously, no one EVER seems happy at the counter of these joints). 

Anyway, we get our food plus the usual condiments (salsa, pickled jalape√±o, radish, carrots). The corn tortillas were hard on the edges and dry. The pork was also not very tasty. I've had their Adobada before (at another location) and enjoy the marinated, juicy meat. It was nothing like that. Cooked much too long and crisped until there was almost nothing left. It was disappointing. I don't know if it was an off night, but if I do return to a Roberto's, which will be rare, it won't be this location.
