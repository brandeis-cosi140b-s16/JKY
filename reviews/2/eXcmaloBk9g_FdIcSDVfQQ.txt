So looking forward to trying this place and was sorely disappointed. Entering the courtyard on a chilly December evening and the lights were twinkling and fire stoked in the corner fireplace. Artistically designed booth backs with old suits in a quilt pattern were intriguing, but that's where the ambience stopped. We were greeted and seated with a lack of emotion or warmth. Menus were placed in front of us and they were ... dirty. No specials mentioned, no happy hour mentioned (we were there at the start of HH), and a general lackluster vibe ensued. When questioned, our waiter knew nothing of the drink concoctions (shame on him) and told us the sign on the wall with specials was outdated because they didn't have chalk-skills. We finally decided on a few items - Pablo Honey cocktail was TOO spicy to even drink, but the fresh pineapple juice helped a lot. Chips and salsa were requested and dropped on the table. Delicious salsa - greasy but hot tortilla chips. Free on the Happy Hour Menu, but $5 otherwise. Shared the short rib dinner (pretty good), the vegetarian squash option (soggy with a very spicy avocado mixture), the duck taquitos (YUMMMY) and the green pork chile stew (decent flavor and good consistency.) Nothing special here - sorry. Oh, and we were charged for the FREE Happy Hour Chips & Salsa. Embarrassingly slow service, but the guy filling our water glasses - on it!! Won't be back.
