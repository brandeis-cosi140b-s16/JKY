Doesn't even come close to Chipotle. Funny thing is, I LOVED Q'doba so much when I lived in California! The service was always excellent and the food tasted fresh. Here in Vegas, my Q'doba experiences have never impressed me...this Rainbow location in particular.

They're never that busy when I've been but their service always seems impatient and sub-par. I ordered the naked vegetarian burrito which includes guacamole. Sadly, the veggies aren't included (lame...especially since it's a VEGETARIAN entre) so beware because they'll sometimes offer you the vegetables without telling you about the extra cost.

They also have quite a lot of trouble processing coupons or certificates. One lady went so far as to have my husband email her his certificate from his phone because she insisted on her need to have a paper copy in hand (other locations don't seem to have this problem).

Whether we make it through smoothly or not, they never really seem all that nice and while I don't need to be catered to and coddled, it is nice if someone at least acknowledges you when you're addressing them or completing your transaction.
