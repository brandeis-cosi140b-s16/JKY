This place was BLAH. From our blah waiter to our blah food.  Had the taco combo, came on a single thin street style tortilla, they seriously need to double the tortillas because it gave out midway through.  The pork was dry, the chicken was dry, the beef was ok.  Our waiter was nice, just a little awkward and lacking personality.
