Food was ok, after being asked if we wanted drinks three different times we were allowed to order. Nachos and a taco salad. Place was not busy but took way too long to get the food. Noticed that chips and salsa is 5 dollars.....good luck with that one. Guy filled water glasses regularly so that is something good. Oh yeah, a table that rocks a bit is one thing but our table was horrible. Must have a good two inch movement up and down.
