I really it the first time we ate there but on our last visit I had such a terrible service and shrimp dish wasn't good. I almost inclined to rate this one star based on my last experience. We came with a big party of 16 people and I get it that it not the easiest task for a server to help a big party like that when you are busy. They split us in two tables by outside patio. This is where it got bad. Somehow my friends sitting on the other table, which actually is basically next to mine, got their food 45 minutes after we started eating. Only thing we got from them was a lot of sorries eventhough the bill came out to $700 with tip. And my shrimp dish some lemon shrimp dish was mediocre at best. I will pass on this place from now on.
