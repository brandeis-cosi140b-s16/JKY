I would hate to see this place packed with people. When we came, there were maybe 5 tables full, if that. The service was extremely slow, we waited forever to give our drink order, then forever to order, then forever for the food. It's pricey for the quality of food that they are serving.

The waitress however was super nice. I wouldn't waste your money here, there are to many other options here in Vegas to eat at a place like this.
