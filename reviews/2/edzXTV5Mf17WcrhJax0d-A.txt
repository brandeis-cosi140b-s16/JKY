NOT impressed.  My order took forever because they basically lost it.  Won't go into the details, but it was poorly handled on several levels.  Not a good start.  They just opened, so I'd give them a pass, if the food had made up for it.  But, sadly, it fell short.

My 2 carne asada tacos?  Meh.  Poor value - very small tacos, generic store-like tiny tortillas, very thin, that probably should have been doubled up.  Small-to-moderate quantity of meat, which wasn't so lean and seemed of lower quality.  Nice seasoning helped, but meat was still lacking.  Lousy value - the tacos were something like $2.79 each, vs $1.29 for street tacos at Los Taquitos, which are FAR superior.  This was more of a snack than a meal.  Not bad, but not all that good, especially for the price.  Probably won't be back, too many better options in the area.
