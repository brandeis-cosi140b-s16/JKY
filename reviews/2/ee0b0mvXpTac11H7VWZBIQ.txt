What is it with "upscale" Mexican burrito places skimping on every ingredient? I just don't get it. Visited on 5/24/14 at around 12:30pm.

+ Plenty of parking
+ Clean interior
+ Well lit; very comfortable 
+ A few outdoor seats on their small front patio

+ Prompt service
+ Decent quality ingredients
+ Average taste/flavor; very light on seasonings - very "conservative"
- When ordering a $8 burrito, I'd hope they would put more than half-a-scoop of chicken in it... they didn't have any problem slopping 2 full scoops of rice into the burrito, despite my asking for "light rice", yet when I asked for "more chicken, please" the guy literally put one (1) single chunk of chicken in, and then slid the burrito down for more crap (salsa, pico, etc). 

- Not a good value
- Water glasses are too flimsy to fill from the self-serve tap without collapsing the glass

I would rather visit La Bamba, where they stuff the burritos with high quality meat and sell them for 1/3 less. And, they're local. 

We've had Qdoba catering dozens of times at my workplace, and I've always enjoyed it. I had no idea that an in-person visit would yield such a mediocre experience.
