This was my first time at salsaritas. I figured I would try something new for lunch. It didn't necessarily taste bad, it was more of the end result that bothered me. I ordered a chicken quesadilla, and they didn't put hardly any cheese, so went I went to eat it all the chicken fell out of the tortilla. I must have asked for sour cream 4 times before I paid, did I get it? No. How do you make a quesadilla with basically no cheese? I know it was during the lunch rush, but they need to pay attention to the quality. Most likely won't be back to this location.
