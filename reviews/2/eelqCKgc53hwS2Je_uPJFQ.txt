The amazing part about Terminal 4 in Sky Harbor is you get a great sample of the local PHX flavor instead of your everyday McDonald's, Jamba Juice, etc. commonplace in US airports. 

I'm a card carrying, verified Los Taquitos addict, and know they've been here for a while. Decided to grab a bite on my way out to Albuquerque this afternoon to see how it compared to their Ahwatukee and Phoenix locations. 

If you're going to take anything way from my review, let it be this: This location is absolutely NOTHING like the flagship (if you don't count the food truck) locations.

Sure, the menu looks almost identical: Breakfast Burritos and Tortas, the infamous Street Tacos and Quesadillas. 

The food even looks the same. 

Yes, I realize this is airport food, but the only thing from a quality control standpoint that tastes the same are the roja y verde salsas. 

I went with the 3 Street Tacos Combo and a Large Water Bottle for a total of $12.13. 

The tortillas were sad and cold. 

The beans were playdoh-esque, cold and the rice had way way WAY too much seasoning. 

All of the meats were lukewarm. The Pollo was dry and crumbly, the Carne Asada lacked that vibrant spice we all know LT by, and the Carnitas were also missing that unique spice. 

I will say though, the Carnitas was the most moist of the three. 

Sad, wilted cilantro and onions were scattered on haphazardly. 

What a disappointment. This is one of my favorite taco places in town, and it's a shame they're misrepresenting their product here. 

This would have been a one star review if we're going off food quality only; however, the team was really hustling, the gal was taking orders was cheery, and the manager took time to chat with me. 

Come on, Los Taquitos family - Take a look at quality control, I know y'all are worlds better than this.
