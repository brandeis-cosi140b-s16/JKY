Yikes.  The only reason this place gets 2 stars instead of 1 is because I think their Baja chicken burrito is super tasty &  their Mango Salsa.

Cons:
The place is dirty (dont take my word, read the other reviews)
The employees are always bullshitting until they rudely ask you what you want to order.
The employees never offer suggestions, which may be an English Language barrier.
The front door handle was broken my last time I went in here. Unreal.
The burritos are likley to squirt and get extremely messy on the last few bites....sick.  Dont eat in the car unless you have a blanket in your lap, gross. 

If Im craving a burrito, I will likely just go to the Chipotle across the street and wait in line for 15 mins VS this place....I think the only way Ill come back to this location is strait up steal their salsa and limes from their salsa bar.

This place would be better if they got friendlier harder working employees that actually cleaned the place up a bit.
