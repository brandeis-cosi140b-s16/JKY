We were encouraged by the heft of the rating and by how many people had eaten here, but we showed up to a mostly empty restaurant. We finished what I would describe as incredibly average, small street tacos (6 for around $30, LOL) and average guacamole.

When the waiter (who was great), offered us dessert, he let us in on the game, "check in at Yelp and get a free flan," ahh, now it makes sense. 

Overall I would recommend avoiding this place, the price is not justified by the food, and the atmosphere is like if a taqueria took over an Applebee's. Service is pretty good though.
