Visited this restaurant on a Tuesday evening about 5:15pm.  Happy hour here is 2 to 5...different than other restaurants.  The restaurant was not crowded and service was slow at best.  We had a party of 5 adults and one child.  They put 2 tables together and gave us 2 bowls of chips but only 1 bowl of salsa.  Our guest at the end could not reach the salsa.  We asked for another bowl and were given a very small container of salsa.  Finally, the hostess gave us a larger bowl of salsa.  Food was marginal.  I had the ribeye steak and shrimp.  Steak was very bland and the shrimp had some kind of seasoning to give it flavor but it wasn't really shrimp flavor.  Our other guests food was "OK" in their words.  In comparison to other Mexican restaurants, Casa De Mina is on the high side as far as prices.  We'd been there before and it was much better.  After this meal, I will be looking for another Mexican restaurant for dinner.  I think the guy that waited on us couldn't have been less interested in our experience.
