I went through the drive-thru expecting a similar experience to other "berto" establishments and was extremely disappointed with my experience here. The girl kept cutting me off, asking if that was all. You would think after my second "no" she would quit telling me to drive to the window. 

When I got my food inside my home 15 minutes later, the guacamole had already turned black and the retried beans looked like they'd been scraped off the bottom of the pan. The lettuce was wilted and the grated cheese inside the enchiladas was still cool and had never melted. 

Yuck If this is what I *could* see, I fear what I could not see. I will not be going back.
