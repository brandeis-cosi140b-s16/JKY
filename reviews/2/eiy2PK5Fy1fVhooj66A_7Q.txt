Awful. The baked cheese tasted like Spaghetti O's. The food was over spiced or bland and nothing in between. The only thing at our table that tasted okay was the Mango Salad with the dressing on the side. Dressing on side was key, because otherwise it comes drenched. First and last time I go to Maria Maria.
