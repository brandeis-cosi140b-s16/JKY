OK So we went here for lunch today and we were so looking forward to the food!  But alas, the food was not so hot.  We had a flight of salsa, all of which began to taste the same.  They all had this creamy mayo like base to them, lending the flavors to be very similar.  We did not try the pico or the corn salsa which I'm sure and hope were not creamy based as well.

I had the Pork Verde bowl, which had such an odd flavor that I actually couldn't finish it.  The same flavor was in the Mexican rice so perhaps it was the rice but where ever this seasoning was it didn't work and made both the pork and rice uneatable.

Joe had three street tacos; one being the pork which tasted crummy just like mine, a chicken taco, which was dry and the last taco was the Costilla, this one was flavorless.  He ordered the taco plate that came with re-fried black beans which were actually delicious and more of that crappy rice.

I completely agree with reviewer Raquel R.  If you're going to pass yourself off as a modern authentic taco place, make your own tortillas and chips and you might want to reconsider how you are seasoning foods and where seasoning might be lacking.

The service was fine and the decorum was very cute.  But overall the food is overpriced and tries too hard.  There are so many gourmet taco places springing up, many being a lot like this place.  Overpriced food, flavors that miss the mark and little attention to cooking basics such as not serving dry chicken!
