Met the girls here for lunch this last weekend. It was.... meh... well just chainy. The chips were really crisp, but sort of bland and tasted like they came out of a box that had been sitting on a dusty Food City shelf since 1999. The salsa was okay, but sort of blah and tasted like it was straight out of a jar. The rice was a little too on the al dente side and tasted like it came out of an air zip bag vacuum packed for the Russian space station. And the the beans, well they were barely beanish and tasted like they came out of those old white generic cans with the bar codes that were the only differentiation between products. All in all the food was rather disappointing, even by chain standards. I mean for God's sake, we're in AZ people! I get that you are part of a chain, but have some pride and at least put out a product that resembles it's Mexican origins.

I will say that the wait staff was relatively attentive. Not easy when you consider that we were an intimidating sort of group... and got more so with each drink.

The highlight of the meal was when I looked up and eyed a HUGE chandelier thing made out of empty miscellaneous beer bottles. Sort of sad when the lighting is the highlight of your meal...

If you are looking for decent Mexican food, mueva su coche pequeo someplace else mi amigo!
