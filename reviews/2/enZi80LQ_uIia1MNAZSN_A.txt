I'm from San Diego, CA, so I pretty much grew up with Mexican food. Taco shops were ubiquitous in my 'hood. Taco Bell and Tex-Mex? Flour tortillas and ground beef? No thank you, sir. So Chronic Taco reminds me of those taco shops that weren't that good, but you went because you were desperate and broke. And they always left you with belly full of grease. That's what Chronic reminds me of. 

Behind the faux-cool interior decor that includes graffiti tagged walls, Chronic cannot serve decent food consistently. I work nearby, so I know what's up. I think. At times, the food is good. But the next day can be downright gross. Their chicken tacos left me nauseated. I like their vegetarian and potato taco the best. The potato taco is probably the most interesting item in my opinion, it's like a mashed potato taco that is deep fried. Blasphemy right? It's actually tasty (in moderation, of course!) . But their veggie and potato tacos aren't good enough to visit every week. Next time, I'm sticking to Los Tacos.
