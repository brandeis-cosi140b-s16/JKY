Not too sure how to think about this place yet. But i'll tell you about the 3 things I got.

Cabeza Taco - AMAZING. rich, smooth, and with the cut of the salsa from the salsa bar, really how you want one of these bad boys to taste!

Chorizo Taco - sorta dry, which despite how rich i'm sure the meat was is a bit shocking.

Al Pastor Torta - really quite terrible. The whole thing was dry and the pastor was bland. There wasn't any mayo or cheese in there to moisten it up and as a restaurant, that based on it's various graphics bills itself as a pastor joint you'd think they'd be able to do better.

I guess maybe the should advertise with pictures of cabeza? probably not because cabeza looks sorta gnarly but lawwwd its' good
