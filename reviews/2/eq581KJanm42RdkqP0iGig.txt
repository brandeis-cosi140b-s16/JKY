I love chipotle, but I have to give this particular location a poor rating. My husband and I are here often because we live down the street and have been increasingly disappointed by the service we've received. As any chipotle lover knows, the line can get pretty ridiculous sometimes, but most locations do a great job of moving it along quickly. This location can't handle the line. They move at a ridiculously slow pace and are not the nicest of people. Usually seem to be in a bad mood about something and often seem to be out of key ingredients. Id recommend a different location if you want your chipotle fix.
