Maybe this was a case of higher expectations after being told this was the greatest Tex-Mex in Pittsburgh, but it's not Tex-Mex - more like central Mexico than the border area.   I went off menu, because I love pork carnitas.  They were stewed.  I didn't expect that.  Plus they tasted like canned tuna drenched in lime.  Very odd.
