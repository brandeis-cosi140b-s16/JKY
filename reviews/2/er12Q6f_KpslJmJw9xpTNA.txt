I don't get this place.  Had great service from Summer in the bar but the food is just OK,  $15 for a chimichanga really $15? yes $15 I still am shaking my head over that. I can go to chipolte and get a burrito twice the size with better organic ingredients for less than half that. everytime we go I ask why why but hubby is addicted to the chips and salsa,  whatever it's again OK but I've had way better elsewhere.  Still half of Phoenix thinks this is the best Mexican food around. I just don't get it.
