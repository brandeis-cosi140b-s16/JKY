Coming into the restaurant it had a great view. Nice outdoor bar with cooling and twinkling lights.  Anytime I go out to eat I read yelp reviews and every single one was bad. But we had already sit down so we decided to stay and eat. The chimi was recommended by the waiter so we ordered. Very heavy. Lots of onions. Expensive and drinks are basically water. Welcome to Vegas
