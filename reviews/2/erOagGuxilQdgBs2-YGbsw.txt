Located in The Venetian Food Court, and right by the full fledged Taqueria Canonita is this little splash of Food Court splash.  After doing a quick wander around, I settled on Canonita Express for their relatively inexpensive Mexican dishes.  It was a tough call, because the miscellaneous Asian restaurant was handing out free Chicken Teriyaki samples - and I am a huge sucker for both free stuff, and food on sticks.

But Canonita Express won me over, and I ordered myself a chicken enchilada in particular.  The staff behind the counter was friendly, but the food was only mediocre at best.  The red rice tasted kinda funky and there weren't nearly enough beans.  

It wasn't bad by any means, but what bumped this place down to two stars instead of three is that nagging feeling at the end of my meal that I would have been better off at the misc. Asian spot.  And if that's not a damning realization, I don't know what is.
