We use to love the Barrio Cafe--not sure if it was an off night or if they have slipped but both of our meals were terrible and we left after just taking a few bites--the guacamole as always was wonderful--the service and the margaritas were both as always wonderful--We did not make a big deal out of the fact our meals were inedible but my husband did mention to our waiter that his dinner consisted of only a couple of little chicken strips and the waiter said yes another customer had complained and the manager was aware--and it was obvious mine was going back after a few tastes--that was enough--both meals from their specials--it was disappointing we were not offered an apology--we didn't need a free meal--just a--sorry you didn't like your meal--expensive to be such poor quality--and again disappointing because it was so good---
