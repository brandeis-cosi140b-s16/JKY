This is my first time at LaPaz. I never went to the old location and if it's anything like the new one I'm not impressed. We had a party of 8 and our server Samara was decent. The food wasn't great. The rice and refried beans were bland. The queso and salsa weren't  bad, but the guacamole wasn't the best, too much lime and not enough salt.  My homemade version is better. Probably won't be back anytime soon.
