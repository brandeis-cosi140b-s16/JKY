About a year ago I used to go here practically every weekend.  However about a year ago something changed the food not as good as it used to be. One of my favorites used to be sizzling fajitas however now the quality is just not good they used to bring it to your table smoking and sizzling, they don't do that any more. Also the quality of the food is just not good any more either, for example the shrimp do not smell fresh and are now very tiny. If you chose to grande your fajitas which means upsize the meat portion they don't give you much more meat like they used to. Overall it used to be great food now it's just blah.
