This location is close to my home which is the only reason I still bother with it. Walked in tonight, seven employees working and every single one of them ignored my fianc√© and I until a line formed behind us. Not even a "Be right with you!" was attempted. It's a fast food restaurant, but it's supposed to be higher quality so I guess I expect a higher level of service.
