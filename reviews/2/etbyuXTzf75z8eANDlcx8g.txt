You know that random Chipotle craving you get sometimes? Well I was having one of those at work and decided to stop at this location since it was on my way home. It's a pretty big location in the plaza of Premium Outlets South, so it's easy to spot. 

Ok, so I walk in and it's not too busy, like 3 people ahead of me. So the guy in front of me orders a bowl with no beans. So the employee gives him 2 scoops of rice instead without the customer asking for it. So when I go to order my steak bowl with no beans, the employee only gives me one scoop. Wtf? I just saw you pouring 2 scoops for the dude before me. Is it because I'm a small person? Anyway, I asked for more rice. He put the steak on and it was time for the veggie part. So off I move along the line to the female employee putting the salsa. I ask for salsa, corn, lettuce and a small amount of sour cream since I know they always put a huge dollop of it. When I go to pay, I ask the cashier for a side of guacamole and a side of sour cream as well. When the cashier asked the female employee for my sides, she looked at me and went "ugh." Jeez, I'm sorry I want sour cream on the side instead of all over my food. It's not like it's coming out of your check. Give me my damn sour cream and shut up and do your job. 

I love Chipotle and the food is always delicious. I think next time I'll drive to the one in Anthem instead.
