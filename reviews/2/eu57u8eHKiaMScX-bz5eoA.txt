Wow, I was sadly disappointed with this place.  Some work buddies and I chose to try this place on for lunch based on the great reviews.  All three of us left there confused.  I had the street fish tacos and street carne asada tacos.  $2 a piece for thinly sliced over-cooked fish and the carne asada had the consistency of rubber.  One of my co-workers also had the street tacos and was in complete agreement.  My other co-worker got the carne asada and he felt it was very bland.  The tamales were overly dry as well.  We love Mexican food, but unfortunately this place left us wanting.
