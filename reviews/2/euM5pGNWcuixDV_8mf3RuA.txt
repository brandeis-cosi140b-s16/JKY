I normally really enjoy eating here but this last experience bothered me. I went for lunch with my sister and son. My sister and I got an app to share and were going to split a lunch entree. My son only wanted a cheese crisp and the kids combo (which isn't much of a combo only one side and no drink included) was 4.75 and when I asked the price for just a Kids cheese crisp the waiter said it was going to 5.95. He said that there is no option to have the kids crisp by itself, they give you the adult size app crisp instead and charge full price. It's only a dollar difference but still, less food for more money.
