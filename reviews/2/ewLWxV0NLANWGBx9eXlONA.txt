We've been here before and liked it. But this time, I was disappointed. All four of our meals were wrong in some way, but we only brought my meal to the waiter's attention. My burrito was steak, but should have been chicken. When I told the waiter, he didn't apologize or offer to bring me a new dish, and didn't even comp it off our check. Disappointing.
