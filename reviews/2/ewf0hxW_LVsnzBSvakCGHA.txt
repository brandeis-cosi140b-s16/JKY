A huge disappointment? Why? Their prices are very high considering the place is just "ordinary" and no different than a neighborhood mexican restaurant.
Their roasted chilis are "passable". They werent as HOT as i hoped they would be. I could get better quality at Food City.

Since they advertise on TV, i expected more..............not knowing that we will end up feeling like we just ate our usual mexican food at our usual mexican diner.

A lot of marketing hype.................so maybe that is why the prices are high...........to cover the huge costs of TV commercials. Not worth it.
A HUGE disappointment. Dont wanna go back. If i want to spend good money i would rather spend it on food that isnt just bordering on ORDINARY,
