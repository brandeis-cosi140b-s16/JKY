Coming from Texas where we have glorious, amazing gas station tacos, I was a bit underwhelmed. It probably had something to do with the fact that the tacos were covered by guac and pico, two things I generally don't put on a taco. A true gas station taco - as prescriped by www.gasstationtacos.com - should be meat, corn tortilla, onions, cilantro and possibly some crazy hot salsa. These seemed much more California, trying to be fancy. 

The pork torta was good, short of the massive amount of fat and connective tissue I got halfway through. Other than that, solid choice.
