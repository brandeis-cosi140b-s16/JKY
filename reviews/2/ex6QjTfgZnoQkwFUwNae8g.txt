Only because the salsa and chips where great. Not fresh!!!! Meat tasted old! I ordered 3 sopes. Carne asada, green chile ( beef ) and barbacoa. The actual sopes on point! The meat however,  not so good. Imagine when you put meat in the fridge to thaw out over night. But the next day you forgot all about it. The weekend rolls around and you open your fridge and you get brutally attacked by the stench of what was. Once a red juicy steak, now dried shriveled brown rotting protein mass. I'm not saying Irma cooked old meat but im pretty sure their lame excuse of carne asada had been cooked and reheated more times then I care to imagine. On a good note my wife liked their hard shredded beef taco. And for that my dearest Irma you get 2 stars. 

Ps the sound of the microwave door opening and closing never a good sign. Ill wait the extra 10 min to have pan warmed rice and beans.
