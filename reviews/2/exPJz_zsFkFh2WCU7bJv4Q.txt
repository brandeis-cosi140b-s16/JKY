I'm really not a huge fan of this place. The food is decent but a little overpriced. They charge for extra sour cream and guacamole. Most places charge for guacamole, but here you get less than a tablespoon. And sour cream? Lame. Fresh made tortillas are amazing, but that's about it as far as anything standing out. You're better off walking through the parking lot to Chipotle. Also, they only have one trash can. it would be really nice if they would empty the thing when it gets full.
