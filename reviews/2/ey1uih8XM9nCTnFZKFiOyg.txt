So my friend that invited me here said it was like Chipotle but only better.  Eh...I can't say I completely agree with that if I'm honest.  It was actually a bit bland although I only had veggie soft tacos.

Overall, I was not that impressed with what I had but I may return if I'm on that side of town.
