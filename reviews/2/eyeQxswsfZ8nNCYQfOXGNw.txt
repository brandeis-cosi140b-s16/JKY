Used to go here once a week for lunch and loved the food.  But last week I ordered a green chili chimi and it was dry and not the same, not as good as before.  Prior to that I thought they had the best green chili burros I had found in town.  As an AZ native---I know Mexican food.  I noticed new faces in the kitchen area and thought well the others might be on vacation.  I went back today and ordered the Pollo Fundido Chimi (which I had before and it was yummy).  They gave my Chimi to someone else who didnt bother to say-hey thats not what i ordered.....I waited about 25 minutes for another Chimi.  I dive in thinking it would be like before---wrong!  Baja sauce on top of Chimi was ice cold-----WTF.  Chicken tasted different as well.  Looked behind the front counter and yep if was the same new faces that were there last week.  Im done!!
