Their white sands is amazing...if you can deal with the worst service of your life. I've stopped eating in house and just call my order in now. However tonight not only was my order wrong (no apology when I told them it was wrong) I also got to witness the hostess complaining about who ever took her phone. He took her phone because she was texting while I was waiting to be helped.
