My family and I come here quite a bit.  Love the beef tacos...love the tortilla.  Until today I've never had a problem. 

Met here for lunch today.  Cashier was great. I was ordering flautas...I wanted beef and chicken.  He recommended the combo and confirmed I would be able to have mixed...2 chicken and 1 beef.  

It takes awhile for the food....not too long.  Well. Mine had only chicken.  No beef.  I let the girl at the counter know.  This is where it gets ridiculous.

She offered to take my entire meal and remake it.  No...I didn't want to wait for an entire new meal. My sister had her food and we were ready to sit down and eat.  
I asked if she could just make me one  beef.  
She said I would have to pay for it.
(I considered it...but it would be too much food for me)
I said.  Just take one of the chicken and give me one beef.
No.  She would not do that. 
I asked was she going to throw mine away.
She said...yes. She would toss my meal and make an entire new one.

So. I had 2 choices.  Buy a beef flautas OR wait for a brand new meal. 

I opted to just eat what I had.

The food was great.  But....the customer service was absolutely horrible. 

Why not just frigging make me ONE darn beef flauta.  You can toss ONE of my chicken...but why toss my entire meal and make me have to wait.  How hard is THAT????   YOU MESSED UP MY ORDER.....be a little accommodating. 

Hopefully someone from Carolinas actually reads these yelp reviews.  If you do. Talk to the chick that was there today about 130 or 2 pm

OH.. it was not busy and most of your tables were dirty.
