First, this restaurant is in a fabulous location and the decor is amazing. I wish the service was as good as the food though. My partner and I were basically ignored while checking in. People that came in after us were treated better and seated before us which was irritating. They had more hostesses and bussers than they did waiters and cooks. Our waitress was super cool and very accommodating so +++ for her. Food was good, but they need some better management and more staff.
