This place has great flavors but, I question the freshness of the food plus every time I have eaten here by the time I get to sit down after going thru the lines and paying for everything my food is cold. It would get 4 stars if they could figure out a quicker way to get the food to you and check you out quicker. Terrible layout. It was originally a bar layout not a restaurant. It's definitely not laid out to be a grab and go food service.
