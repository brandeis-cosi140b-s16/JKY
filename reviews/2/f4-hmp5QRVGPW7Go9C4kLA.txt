This place is the opposite of fast food drive thru restaurant. The food is good thought but everything else EVERYTHING ELSE! sucks here, including the furniture and lousy employees. Are they even food handler certified?
This place manager or owner needs to take note of how slow they are to serve you the food. 
They have no idea of what a fast food restaurant is. None!
2 stars because if the good food.
