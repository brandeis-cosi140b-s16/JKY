This isn't even where I started out to go for lunch today.  I was driving down the road and it caught my eye.  I have eaten from here several times but this is the first time I have been in one of their restaurants.  Even though I like their chicken it seems like the order gets screwed up about half the time and I don't go back for a while.  Like many fast food places the order seems to be correct most of the time when eating in.  I had a breast with macaroni and cheese and cole slaw.  It comes with a couple of tortillas (flour or corn).  I tried the salsa and spicy avocado from their salsa bar, neither was great but both edible.  I have had better Horchata but again it was ok.   For $8.20 total with drink I was happy.

The restaurant inside was clean and the staff friendly.  Being a beautiful day outside I would liked to have sat on the patio.  Here is where they lost a star, the tables looked liked they had not been cleaned in several days and the patio trash bin was way too full.

I am sure I will eat here again.
