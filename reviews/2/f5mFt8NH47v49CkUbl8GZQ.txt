meh, exactly.  bar was gross and sticky.  waitstaff could not even care less that we were there.  magaritas were so-so and served in a plastic small cup.

burritos were just OK but nacho cheese on top of it wasnt exactly pleasant.   chips and guac were pretty good

i got two sets of silverware that had food crusted on it.  made me really wonder how clean the kitchen food prep was

my buddy wanted to go make himself sick afterwards to get rid of the burrito.

not being from Charlotte I have to think this is the bottom of the barrel when it comes to Mexican food choices??
