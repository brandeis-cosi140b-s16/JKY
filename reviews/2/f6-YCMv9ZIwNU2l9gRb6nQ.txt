This location has very poor customer service.  They rarely get orders correct, so double check before you drive away.  Also, although their drive thru menu clearly states they serve regular menu at 9:00 am they say they do not serve it until 11:00 am.  Do not question this!  If you do you will be treated rudely by the person taking orders!!  Just back away slowly and don't make eye contact.
