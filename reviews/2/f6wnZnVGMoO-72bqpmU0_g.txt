I want to like this place so much! But I just don't. Here's why:

Although the beans & salsa served before the meal are awesome (could make a whole meal out of them!), I end up disappointed in my entree, no matter what I get. I couldn't put my finger on the reason for the disappointment until I read some other reviews: the food is just bland. It's not an under-salting issue; the sauces and meats, as well as the rice and beans (whyyyy can't they just put the appetizer beans with the entrees?). It's just blah. Also, considerably less spicy than I like, with no salsa at the table to heat things up. For the record, I can barely handle a jalepeno. 

All I want from Lindo's is to have a flavor jump out at me. Currently, what I get is a mass of bland that needs to be washed down with a drink. 

Also, if you find EXTREMELY LOUD mariachi music as obnoxious as I do (it has got to be more than just me!), skip this place or ask to be seated in the room with the view.
