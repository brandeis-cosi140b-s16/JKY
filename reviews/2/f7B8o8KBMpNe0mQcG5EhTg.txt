Based on most previous reviews, we went here thinking it would be pretty good. The large majority of the food (rice, beans, tamal, and enchilada) was bland, even the chile relleno was pretty unappealing. The fajita chimichanga tasted like Chinese food. I smothered everything in salsa and jalape√±o cheese dip, which helped, but it should be delicious enough on its own. I've had much better at the same price.
