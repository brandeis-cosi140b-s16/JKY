This place would be getting one star if it wasn't for the kind gentleman with red hair who took my order and carried my food out to the car for me. The chips here are also awesome! Besides for that there is too much to be desired and they didn't put the entire order together which made me have to drive back after returning home and everyone's food was cold. They also didn't put tomatoes on anything-not in the tacos or on the tostadas. It didn't make any sense to me. The guacamole lacked flavor and the salsa was so spicy!! My brother-in-law said that there wasn't bad Mexican food here and I would disagree. The enchiladas tasted like the box seasoning I use at home and the asada meat was dry. The wait for the food was over 30 min...for take out! All in all, with the plethora of other Mexican restaurants in the area this will not be one I am returning to.
