In a pinch the food is edible, but it's far from good. The chicken fajita bowl had plain rice, a few onions & peppers, and some very boring chicken. Also, the "Express" side is anything but. As I waited 15 minutes for my to-go order - it would've been longer if I hadn't asked and they realized my ticket got lost - a fellow customer said they had been on the restaurant side and had to cancel their order after waiting 30 minutes and being told it would not be done anytime soon. Why they couldn't just package up their order instead of making them wait again on the Express side is beyond me. 15 and 30 minutes may not seem like much, but in an airport restaurant that is WAY too long.
