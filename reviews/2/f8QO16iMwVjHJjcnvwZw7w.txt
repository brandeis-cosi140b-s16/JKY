This restaurant is okay; it's just not great. Regarding the decor, I like the TVs in the bar area. But overall, the place doesn't seem as warm and welcoming as I like. Maybe it's the high ceilings. Even with the big furniture, the place still feels a little empty. Maybe it needs more pictures on the wall or a different color scheme? 

The food was good, but not great. The chips and salsa were pretty standard. My friend requested salsa verde, which looked more like guacamole than salsa. It didn't taste bad, but the consistency was unexpected. We asked the waiter about it and he acknowledged that sometimes it's prepared differently depending on who's working in the kitchen. 

I ordered a fajita combo; I chose the portobello with spinach and the shrimp. I also ordered a traditional margarita on the rocks with a salt rim.  The drink was average. I finished it, but I wouldn't order it again.  My fajita was good. But I'm not sure it was worth the price.  My bill was $30 for a fajita and margarita. 

I would give this place 2 and a half stars if I could. Its in a good location (I love the metropolitan).  The food was good, but it's not a good value. I wasn't impressed with the decor. I doubt that I'll return. There are so many other Mexican restaurants in CLT that are better.
