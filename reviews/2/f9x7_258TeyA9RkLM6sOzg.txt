We didn't really want to go to La Salsa, but we didn't want to eat any more white people food, and the Asian food on the Strip is pretty much inedible, so we ended up here.  It's basically a really expensive, sit-down, not-as-good version of Real La Salsa.  However, the decor is nice.

I had a chicken quesadilla, which had a ridiculous amount of cheese inside, and the tortilla part was browned and slightly crunchy.  Very odd.  We also had to pay $5 for chips and 4 types of salsa (the "Salsa Flight").  Very lame.

Service was terrible.  Perhaps I should've ordered a yard-long margarita.

Also, it's located inside the Forum Shops at Caesars Palace, and it's really hard to find.  Just look for the Anthropologie on the directory/map, and then take the spiral escalator down to the first floor.  Otherwise, you'll never find it.
