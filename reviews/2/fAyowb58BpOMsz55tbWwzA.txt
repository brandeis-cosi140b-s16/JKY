With all the good Mexican food in the area, I am surprised this place stays in business. I mean seriously, I can't think of Mexican place that is worse than Some burros. The salsa taste like watered down ketchup with salt pepper and a little spice. My sons cheese quesadilla was scant on the cheese  my carne asada burro was dry and not flavorful at all. 

I am usually not this harsh, but I have been here and twice and have been underwhelmed both times.
