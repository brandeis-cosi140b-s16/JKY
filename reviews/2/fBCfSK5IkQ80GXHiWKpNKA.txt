Once again I go to a new place based off of someone's else's review  and it was underwhelming. The customer service was great but they nickel and dime you on the kids meal. Almost everywhere I have gone they don't charge you for drink with a kids meal. They charge you for a drink. I ordered a simple cheese crisp for my daughter and it comes out basically burnt and they walk away saying enjoy. It's was so crispy it was dark brown. The cheese was stiff. My pollo fandido was ok. I would definitely not pay almost $8 for a kids meal for something that is so so and they mess up over a tortilla and cheese item
