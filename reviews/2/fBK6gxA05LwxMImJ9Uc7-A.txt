Ive only been to this place a handful of times, and I think tonight will be my last. The first few times we ate there I thought it was pretty good, but more recently I cant say the same. The food is fairly tasteless, the beans taste like they are out of a Rosarita can, and the rice could pass for TV dinner. Im not sure if this place is going down hill or what, but it was a little pricey for what we got. We ordered a chicken quesadilla, a shredded beef chimichanga that came with beans and rice and a small soda, it came to $22 and some change. Chips and salsa are complimentary. Call me cheap but I can think of many other places where I could spend that $22 that wouldnt leave me walking away feeling like I overpaid for not so great food. 

I will say the staff was extremely helpful and friendly. I wish for that reason I could give a better review but the food just doesnt quite cut it.
