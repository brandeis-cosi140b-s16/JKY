We always enjoy el Pollo Loco, so we were disappointed with this place. Upon walking in, the place looked great. Chicken was cooking, and everyone was busy getting ready for the day...it was 10 am. 
Sat down and waited for our order. Looking around we discovered that this place is poorly managed. The chair legs were filthy from where a mop had been up against them, there was crud of some kind...food probably...on the window sills, glass doors had hand prints all over them, and there was standing water with some warning signs around it. Little things really, but it all added up.
That being said, the tacos carbon and the salsa bar were really good. We had a side of tortilla chips that were stale. They were cold and stale. Blah. My guess is that we will never come back here again. They need better management.
