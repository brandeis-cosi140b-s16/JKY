There are times where you want tacos that don't come from Taco Bell or Del Taco, so you find the next best thing -- Roberto's.

There are actually quite a few Roberto's Taco Shop locations throughout Las Vegas, however this one is convenient for me because it's right near UNLV. Everyone knows that the area around UNLV is sketchy, especially at night. So if you go here in the late PM/early AM hours of the day, you're bound to be accosted by the drunk customers or the sketchy people outside asking for money.

The inside of this place is disgusting. It's dirty, repugnant, unappealing -- basically any word that has a similar negative connotation, would describe this Roberto's. The floors weren't maintained and were sticky with black residue from who-knows-what everywhere, the tables weren't clean or wiped down, and the salsa bar (where you can get your condiments and veggies) was dirty and you could tell people were dropping whatever they were getting into the salsas. I don't even think the sneeze guard was clean, either. VOMITROCIOUS. 

The food was pretty decent. They have 99Â¢ tacos on Wednesdays, which we went for and grabbed a few chicken tacos. The tortillas may be a bit hard, but they have a good amount of chicken in there as well as lettuce, parmesan, and cheddar cheese. It's good for the price, I admit. If you don't know what you want to order and want to spare yourself from staring at the menu, then I suggest ordering the carne asada fries. It's pretty good and does the job of filling you up.

If they just step up their game customer service and appearance-wise, then they should be up there with the other Roberto's locations.

If you're brave/near the area and have late night munchies or need to satisfy your Mexican food cravings at weird hours of the day, then you should try this place out (if you can survive the ratchetness, to be honest).
