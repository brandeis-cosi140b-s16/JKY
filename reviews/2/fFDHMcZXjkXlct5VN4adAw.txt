"Upscale fast food"? Seriously? And these other reviews...am I the only person hating on Chipotle? Today I went to Chipotle for the first time - I actually thought it was a restaurant until now. 6.50 for a vegetarian burrito (which has no vegetables in it) is just ridiculous, and...and I don't even know. Chipotle Mexican Grill?! Seriously? I am dumbfounded that this place exists and that people eat here. I mean, there was nothing "wrong" with it, it is just the epitome of our generic fast food culturally void society.  

wow. I seriously hate me some chipotle.
