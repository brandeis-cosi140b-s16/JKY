A "build a taco" style place tha i s always full of a larger than average number of sports-obsessed folks and only an average (or less than average) number of extremely high people.  This is counter to my expectations, given the "Chronic" portion of the name.  However, they so reliably live up to the "Taco" portion of the moniker.  Bsed on my, primarily lunch time experiences, I have made the following conclusions:  They offer a drink special during ASU games.  The fish taco is okay, as is the potato taco.  Is this the best place on Mill Avenue?  No.  Is it better than Taco Bell?  Yes.  Is it a pretty good deal?  Also a yes.
