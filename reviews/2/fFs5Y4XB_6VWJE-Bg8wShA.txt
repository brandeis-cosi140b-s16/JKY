Got a shrimp taco from here to go, it tasted alright.. Well I figured it could be an alternative to chipotle which is why I went here and I was a bit disappointed. The service was ok, seemed like it could have been quicker but honestly the taco I got was tiny and it was like $4-5? Kind of skimping on ingredients and overcharging. I also got the quesadilla which was pretty good but still I would recommend chipotle over this place.
