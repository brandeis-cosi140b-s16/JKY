Always disappointed here! I must have horrible timing because when I get there they are always out of what I eat! No chicken, or fajita veggies or chips! All of which seem to be staples, but are never well stocked. 
Each time I have to wait 15 or 20 min, they comp me chips or salsa for the wait. That and the proximity to my house keeps me coming back... But I always pause before getting in the car when I get a tex/mex craving because I know it won't go smoothly! 

Staff is ok, so t does have its high points, but being a little more proactive with the continuous prep of core items would help immensely!
