I'm updating my review!  How times have changed... 

I feel skimped for the past three visits & I won't be coming back.  It's kind of a running joke on how stingey Chipotle is on giving out meat.  But seriously... if I'm paying for double meat, please load me up.  It's seriously all I get.  I don't get rice... I don't get beans... I don't even want a tortilla... I want veggies & MEAT.  I've given up on ordering guacamole also because it's been this sad little dollop of avocado paste.  What happened to the glorious days of fair portions??

I used to love this Chipotle... but the workers seem so out of touch with their customers.  Please get it together so I can give you my money.
