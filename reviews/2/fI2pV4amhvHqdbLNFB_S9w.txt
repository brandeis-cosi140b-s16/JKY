The service was friendly but the food was not very good. For what I thought would be my entree I had three tiny chicken tacos - no cheese, lettuce, rice or beans came with them. The diced chicken pieces each had fat attached. It was as if they gave me the fat pieces they cut off someone else's chicken. I ended up scraping off the chicken and eating the tiny tortillas as my dinner. My husband liked his chicken burrito. Oh yeah, and these three little tacos cost $12. My husband's burrito was $14.
