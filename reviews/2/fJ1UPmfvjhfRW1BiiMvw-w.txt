Really for a Mexican fast food chain you can't go wrong with their cheap food. Delish and it will give you instant food baby. I adore their fresh salsa bar. The only down side is the front cashier. I watched her open up someone's food poke around a little bit on their burrito trying to figure out which kind it was and then wrap it back up. She wiped the food from her finger nail on her pants. My burrito was good and unscathed from her dirty appendage. My suggestion is watch your food from order to pickup.
