The space is stylish and the location is convenient, but as others have said the vegetarian options are sorely lacking.  I had the veggie tacos, which were more like a wrap from a sandwich shop than Mexican food.  The tortillas that everyone raves about did not shine when served cold.  I'll be back if they learn to throw the beans and rice in a burrito with some grilled vegetables.
