Suggested this place today to my foodie friend. 1st time for the both of us....n unfortunately, probably the last. The chips(fresh n hot) n spicy salsa(in the squeezy bottle)...off to a good start. Service was typical. The beans and rice were nothing special.  Atmosphere was cute, tiny thou. Overall... food was rather overpriced.
