I added a star because of the thoughtful touch of actual veggies in the veggie burrito.

Other than that: I ordered delivery. $11 for guacamole? Uhg, I've had two glasses of wine already and I'm hungry. Ok, ORDER. What arrives? Two puny tiny little plastic cups of guac, and about 15 tortilla chips in a small paper bag. The cups were about the size of the sour cream side that came with my burrito. And, nothing to write home about either. Pretty bland food all around. My husband got the enchiladas with mole, which sounded pretty kick-ass from the description (pumpkin seeds! cinnamon! five different peppers! omg yum!) but it turned out to taste kind of like it looked: brown and runny. He was also feeling pretty sick about half an hour later....

Way overpriced. I've had much better Mexican food for much less money elsewhere. If this is what passes for good Mexican food in Madison, boy are we in trouble.
