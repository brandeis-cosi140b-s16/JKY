The food leaves a lot to be desired. It's pretty bland. The atmosphere in the bar is cool but the restaurant, not so great. Hopefully you don't have to talk to the manager he was really rude. We got fajitas which came with no condiments and I asked him can get get some shredded cheese, salsa, guacamole, sour cream, anything? And he explained that "traditional" fajitas don't come with that so theirs don't. And proceeded to charge a dollar each for those add ons. I'd pass. Serranos is better if youre looking for mexican
