Normally I LOVE CHIPOTLE! Alas tonight was a total let down!

So I havent had Chipotle in a very long time, and after getting my brows done by Glenn at Sumita, and rocking out in Forever 21 my little and I were hungry. Now I have been trying soooo hard not to eat here bc of the calorie factor but I broke down and got a chicken burrito.

I walk in and its like 30 mins to closing time so its pretty dead and theyre cleaning up. So I go and order, chicken burrito with pintos, hot salsa, cheese, crema, and lettuce. Pretty easy yea? Well She rang me up, I grabbed some salt and took my burrito to go. When I was in line I didnt like the way the chicken or beans looked, I shouldve taken that as a sign! 

I get into my car, and normally I dont do this but I got my burrito our and salted it and mixed it. I took a bite and was totally sad. The beans were a weird texture, the chicken was tasteless and dry, and the guacamole tasted like only avocados and no seasoning. I was super sad! I mean, Ive gone to many Chipotles and haven had a bad burrito or bowl! This one was a sad excuse!! Im gonna chalk it up to it was almost closing and the ingredients had probably been sitting there a little.

Anywho, the customer service was amazing, you can tell they were super ready to blow that Popsicle joint. 

Will I go back? Probs not to that Chipotle, its a lil more expensive bc of location and I have had better burritos at the one on Lake Mead, sorry for cheating on you by going to a diff location.
