I hate wet burritos. It totally defeats the point of a burrito. They insisted on running my unfinished burrito through an oven and then informed me they couldn't add anything else to it unless they put it on top. Forget that, I almost just walked away. I regretted not doing so once I found out my crappy chicken, rice and cheese only burrito was going to cost me $12.
