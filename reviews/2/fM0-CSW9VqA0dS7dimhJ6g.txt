My husband a light house collector spotted the only light house on the Las Vegas Stip...we finally made it to  Cabo Waboc. yea us ..we stood waiting several mins for a "hostess" to greet and seat us while stood near by folding tee shirts..not even acknowledging our preasents I ask her if we needed to seat ourselves or would some one be with us...the hostess did finally appear and asked us if we like patio or inside seating....Port and I have been on an patio seating kick of late so we chose patio...thehostess the directed us to the just out side the mall doors there was some one there to seat us..we found a 2nd hostess who asked us again patio or inside ....we took the patio...and were led to a small table ..with no room betweem patrons I bumped the lady behind me 2 times..way over crowded..I be willing to wait to have my space..
the waitress was Very attentive and helpfull in ordering...forgeting to metion substutions are extra and add up fast..
Porter ordered a 2meat fajitas and substituted ries for rice and beans ..I got carni asada wet..we had chpis and salsa and guacamole ...
Porters meal cam with only 3 tortillas wraped together and stick together..but lots of meat .
my burrito had rice it it ..lots and lots of rice..hmmmm..the flaver was good and the meat i found was tender...the salsa was more a chhili sause and the chips we stale for the price of the guacamole I expexted it made at my table .well room was limited as was the space on out table ..
on the way out we noted theinside was empty ..just about...well with every one crowd ed on the patio thats why...
