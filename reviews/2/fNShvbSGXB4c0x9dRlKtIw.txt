I wanted to give this place a try do to good reviews. But to be honest I was not impressed at all.  Food portions were good.  Not ur average Mexican huge meal portions. But enough to fill u up.  Tamales were small and not very flavorful. I order a corn quesadilla and masa was raw. I ended up opening the quesadilla and eating just the cheese.  I also order some tacos al pastor and they were ok.  I believe Mexican food should have a bold taste to it and what we order lack that. 

Only good thing I have to say is place was clean and service was good. But I'm not sure if I'll be back.
