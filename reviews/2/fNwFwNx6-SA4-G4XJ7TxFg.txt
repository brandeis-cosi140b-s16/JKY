The food is okay. The staff used to be really nice then they hired a ghetto cashier with gauges in her ears. Unsanitary, if you ask me. I took my food back after they gave me a chicken enchilada plate when I ordered a cheese enchilada plate. I may have let it go if the enchiladas weren't so dry. They barely had a few tablespoons of sauce. After I asked for my order to be corrected, the cashier told the cook that I was a crazy b*tch in Spanish. Umm, excuse me? Did you forget I speak Spanish? Especially since I ordered everything IN SPANISH? geez. Bring the old cashier back. Then I'll give this place a good review.
