House Margarita well lets just say I am glad I had a cocktail before  my hubby drove us there, chips and salsa ummm OK I guess, we both had the taco enchilada combo, taco was Ok I liked the shell and the shredded beef was pretty good, enchilada not so good bland week sauce with literally a 1/2 cup of melted cheep cheese inside, just left it on my plate. guac was decent but nothing was worth coming back for.  The service was good.
