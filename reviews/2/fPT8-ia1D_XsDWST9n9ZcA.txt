First of all the atmosphere is fun and so cute! We had visited the place previously as Tia Rosas and had anxiously awaited the reopening . We, my boyfriend and I ,  visited on a Saturday early evening and it was fairly busy.    The complimentary chips and salsa were very good and we liked the giant glasses they had for water , less waiting for refills!  We also had a friendly waiter.  But those were the high points.  We had a simple order. One chicken chimichanga , ala carte, no guac and no sour cream and a pork burrito plate , enchilada style with green sauce.  We waited quite awhile and when they brought the order, both were wrong. The chimi was piled high with guac and sour cream and the burrito plate was covered with red sauce.  They took it away and apologized and we waited quite awhile longer. They did eventually bring the correct order and the food was ok but overpriced for what it was.  We have been out to eat a lot and usually if there is an error that big, there is an attempt to make up for it.  Maybe comp one of the meals, an offer of free soda or drinks of some sort or dessert or something.  Nothing here.  It was overall a disappointing experience.
