I got a guy that was as welcoming as a mortician  I remember his name but not going to embarrass him further.  He knows who he is.  The food was good but small amount.  AAAAAND, while I watched him give chips and salsa to 3 other customers, I was not one of them!!!.  I wrote him a "thank you" note on the receipt and wanted to be sure he enjoyed his tip that was electronically asked for BEFORE service.......and for counter service, no less.  I agree with Gabriel G. ....dark, dingy.  Nope I will never be back.
