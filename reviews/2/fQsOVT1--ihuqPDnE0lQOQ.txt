My primary complaint is that the plates are served warm, not hot.  There is nothing worse than tepid enchiladas, except cold tortillas.  Why serve tortillas in a basket? They get cold so quickly. 

I'd heard great things about this restaurant, but it is a disappointment.  The chips are thick and over-fried and the salsa is weird, not fresh. Skip the shrimp cocktail--the shrimp are swimming in cold juice, like a gazpacho, but not as good.  The Cadillac margaritas are tasty, but how hard it is to make a good margarita in this town? 

The guacamole is bland.  I had to add hot sauce and squeeze lemon juice on it.

Chili's has better steak fajitas at a fraction of the cost.
