The cashier was very confused with our order  she was trying to tell us that the prices we were looking at on the menu were not the prices and on Yelp the prices are way lower than the prices in the actual restaurant. We came here a couple months ago and the service was way better and the cashier was not so confused. For example bean tostada is $2.50 and the french fries are $2.50. And I'm not sure why they have a B from the health department.
