A Mexican restaurant that doubles as a bakery. I walked in and was completely clueless of where I was, there was no food menu or anything in sight just a cashier with freshly baked breads and pastries. Basically, we had to ask for a menu. 

Order consisted of 1 steak taco, steak burrito, and a horchata. 

Food 
Taco - I specifically requested no cilantro and no onions on my steak taco, in other words plain; the taco came out with cilantro. They corrected my order and brought a plain steak taco out. Steak tacos were alright, steak was a bit dry little to no fatty pieces, very little flavor. Burrito - Burrito, I requested no pico de gallo in my burrito and it came with pico, I didn't bother to have them correct my order because I was too hungry. Burrito was filled with beans, very little steak. Although I do have to give it to them, the burrito was a good size. Horchata - Horchata was good, just overloaded with ice. So if you order a Horchata tell them to be easy on the ice. 

Pricing 

Great price for the portions of the food, Horchata was a bit on the expensive side $4 for a large horchata filled with ice. 

Service 

We were checked up on regularly, server did offer us drinks, staff was very friendly. 

Decor 

- Nothing special on the decor, plenty of seating, reminded me of a Popeye's restaurant. 

Parking 

- Easy accessible parking, full parking lot. 

Overall
Food was mediocre, I think they can do way better with the quality of their food. The portions were great, but other then that nothing too special.
