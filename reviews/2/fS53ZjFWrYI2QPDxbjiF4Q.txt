Pretty nice atmosphere.  Very nice waiting staff.  Food was ok.  We waited 40 minutes to get waters and chips and salsa.  Another 25 to have our order taken.  A family sitting next to us had received drinks but had waited 45 minutes and had not had order taken so they left.  We were pretty determined to eat there.  After we ate I had to track down a waiter so we could pay.  Maybe it was an off night but nobody who worked there seemed to know what was going on or how to get their job done.  I won't be returning.
