Overall the experience was a bust. When we first moved to AZ 30 years ago Garcia's was all the rage. Moving back here recently, I decided to take my family there. Starting off, service was slow, but hey it was 7pm on a Friday. 

The staff was pleasant, the cheese crisp was excellent...it better be ;p. After that it went down hill. The food was unseasoned...just bland. The Grande Burro I had was half tortilla...just a mouthful of dough. Half way through I found a big, nasty strand of chicken skin and fat. 

I informed the waitress and she said she would inform the chef and left the check behind. No offer to send over the manager or deduct it from the bill. She ended up brining a new one to go. The new burro came so quickly it's completely obvious it was pre-made and chucked in the microwave. I brought it home but I'm scared to touch it. 

I won't be bringing anyone back. Sorry Garcia's.....adios amigo.
