I would rate Moreno' s  five stars for their food and  two stars  for the atmosphere.  Music was way too loud, don't get me wrong  I enjoy music while dining  ,but it was ridiculously too loud.  Other diners were having to practically shout for regular conversation. The food was really good though, I won't be going back. This place is a take out only place for me.
