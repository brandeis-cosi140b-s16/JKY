I was excited to eat here after reading the reviews. Then I ate there and I was less excited. 

I was prepped for some hot spicy New Mexican food. That did not arrive on my plate. It was tasty for sure but I was lead to believe that I would experience the food I grew up with in New Mexico. I didn't. 

It is possible that my expectations were too much for this restaurant to handle.
