The food was good, the service sucked.  Our waiter Rene was gone more then he was at our table checking drinks.  We asked for napkins and he went up and started talking to the other waiters.  His attention span is, what was I saying???

We finished our meal and sat for a good 10 minutes watching the other waiters taking care of their tables because our waiter was, wait what was I talking about?

I guess you get the point as 5 tables came and went while we sat and stared out the window, thankful for a good view.

When you are more interested in socializing with the other staff members versus waiting in your tables it's time to find a new job.
