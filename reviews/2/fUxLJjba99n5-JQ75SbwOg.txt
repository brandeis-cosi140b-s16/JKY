Boy has this place gone downhill. It's now the Carls Jr of Mexican Food.  Not quite the Mcdonalds as that would be of course reserved for Taco Bell. 

Pretty much all their salsas are boring and bland. Hot salsa tastes like marinara sauce.

High school cashier employee forgot our chips and drinks. Then told me to wait while she proceeded to greet and help another customer. Had to get the bus boy to get them for us.

Carls Jr actually has better street tacos than this. Though not by much, they are about equal. Rubio's puts guacamole on theirs  by default. Who puts guacamole on a taco?

Fish tacos were okay as usual. Nothing to write home about.
