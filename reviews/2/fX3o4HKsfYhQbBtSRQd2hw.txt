Penny Blevins, General Manager of this establishment needs to do some serious retraining for her employees on customer service. Thomas and the short Hispanic girl without a name tag on were extremely impatient, snippy, and out right rude. We felt like we were a complete bother to them. We were so excited to visit Rubios while vacationing in Phoenix, but to be treated so rudely was very disheartening!  Thankfully the food was as good as we remember. That's what warrants the two stars.
