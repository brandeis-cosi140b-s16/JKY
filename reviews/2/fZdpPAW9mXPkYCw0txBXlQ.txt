Months ago, When we arrived at our local and trusted Chandler location to find the doors locked and a permanently closed sign on the door, my family and I went into silent mourning. Yesterday, after indulging a craving and driving the 30+ miles to try the Phoenix location, we revisited that grief. Smaller portions, far lower quality, and 3 out of 4 of our orders were wrong. How can you get an order wrong when you're literally filling out your own check? Not to mention, although the counter person was apologetic, the server was argumentative - and even continued to insist the orders were NOT wrong as he delivered our corrected meals. Coming from Mesa, this was a long hike for a meal we thought we could trust and were hugely let down. Please come back to the East side, Chino. I don't know how you're staying in business out there but we sure miss you out here.
