I think this location is starting to go downhill. Lately im less happy with what I order. Tonight I ordered chicken chimichanga, carne asada nachos, and a chicken burrito. The chicken was barely shredded there were huge chunks that made it hard to bite into and gave it a dry feeling. The chips were burnt and the burrito size is much smaller. Also im pretty sure they left out a couple ingredients in all the dishes I ordered. Good for a quick late night meal if youve been drinking though.
