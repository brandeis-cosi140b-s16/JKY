After eating some of the worst Mexican food ever at F-berto's nearby, I decided to try Poliberto's after work....While it was overall better than my traumatic experience, I can't say this was that much better. 

I made a huge mistake ordering the Carne Asada Torta...everything fell apart and the meat tasted really bad.  I'm used to a good, fulfilling, crunchy big torta like they make them in SF for the same exact price.  Unfortunately, this torta failed miserably in comparison.  I seriously have no clue where to get good Mexican food in Phoenix/Tempe/Scottsdale, but I won't give up without a fight.
