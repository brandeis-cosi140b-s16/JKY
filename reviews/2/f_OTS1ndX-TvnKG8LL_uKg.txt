I've grabbed dinner to go here a couple times in the past few months. I was excited to find another inexpensive mexican restaurant close to where I live. Most of their food seems pretty salty...I could live with about half the salt and I like a lot of salt But the spicy beef (#9) lived up to it's name. If you like spicy food I'd highly recommend trying the #9. Considering that Amados is just a couple minutes away, I probably won't try this place again.
