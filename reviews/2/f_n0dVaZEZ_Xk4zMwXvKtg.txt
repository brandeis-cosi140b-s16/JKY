Food is what you expect but drive thru wait times are consistently the longest of any El Pollo Loco I've ever been to.  Today there were no cars in front of me and it still took over five minutes for a rather simple #2.  I was handed the wrong order and then had to wait another few minutes.  I have been handed the wrong order and not the requested salsa multiple times.
