Eh.  If you like gummy, soggy flour tortillas that can't be picked up, then you would love it here. 

I was totally enchanted by the hot coals and cooking meat, but it should have been seasoned before hitting the fire and the add ons could be more exciting. 

The tortillas were a disaster though. Since there are no seats, I ended up sitting in the car picking the meat, etc with my fingers and leaving the gum wads behind. 

Sorry. They could step up the game a bit.
