Overpriced average mexican american food.

I already had my reservations about coming here but we wanted some easy mexican food and were too hungry to venture far.  Since this is a la salsa cantina they have a nice setup and drinks but we were only here to eat.  Nothing that really stands out on the menu so most of us ended up with our choice of meat on fajitas.  You only get 2 tortillas with your fajitas which I know is the norm for them but I think is pretty dumb.  Might as well make me two tacos and call it a day.

Fajita Steak - very weak thin slices of beef not sure how you can pass that off as steak.

Fajita Chicken - decently tender and juicy not dried out 

Fajita Pork - shredded pork with pretty good flavor, best out of the meats we had.

Food was average and pretty much what I expected from here.  I am picky about mexican food and prefer a taco street vendor or socal taqueria over the fluffed up american joints.  Overpriced in general and with so much great food around the area really just not worth it.
