If you get here when the line isn't long its not that bad.  But if the line is long it can take a long time to get your food.  My last visit was the worst so far.  The line was to the door and they did not have enough employees at the counter to help.  When I finally made it to the front to make my order they finally got another employee to help out... But then they start to fill a call in order and I have to wait even longer before placing my order.  I turn around and think maybe I should just go next door to Dillys Deli because the service is better and so is the food.  My wife really wanted to stay,  however.  Then I noticed the line was out the door.  I voiced my concerns about the long wait but the two employees didn't care.  I didn't bother asking to talk to a manager because next time I will just go next door to eat if this happens again.  Next time you go here and the line is long try the deli next door instead.
