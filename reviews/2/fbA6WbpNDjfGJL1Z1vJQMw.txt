Being from California I have been spoiled when it comes to Mexican food. Here, I ordered a steak burrito and a horchata. The burrito was small for the price but the horchata was nice; I don't know anywhere else where you could get it. The burrito was bland and not filling. There aren't many chips given and they too were flavorless. Pitt students do get 10% off with ID but sadly I'd recommend Chipotle or Qdoba over Veracruz.
