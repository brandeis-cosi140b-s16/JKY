This location is not very good. The food is OK but had little flavor and not proportional. The chips are baked and have little flavor, they taste like you opened a giant bag of Mexican style chips and heated them in the microwave. The salsa is like a tomato paste and again, had no flavor. I got a frozen margarita that was just kind of mushy, not well mixed and what little was frozen melted away quickly. 

The lights are a little too bright for a restaurant and the music was bizarre. Music alternated between holiday and traditional Mexican. 

Overall the food was really bland and the restaurant was awkward. I won't try this place again.
