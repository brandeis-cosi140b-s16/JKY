Great price on a bucket of Corona's.....other than that there is no reason to come here.
This place is a dump!  The bathrooms were disgusting and OUR waitress was not the sharpest tool in the shed.  She could barely get an order straight so we finally had to go inside to order our drinks.   The patio is here is spacious but it's right on top of Scottsdale Rd. so it's busy and loud with all the traffic.  I didn't read if they had food but OMG...I can only imagine.  This place was filthy all around.  Not a fan...
