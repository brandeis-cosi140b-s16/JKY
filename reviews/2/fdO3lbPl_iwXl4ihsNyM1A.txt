I couldn't resist stopping in again today after my trip to the library.  It's just a few doors down and this is the kind of place I don't mind going to when I'm by myself.  Hope that makes sense.

I'm chalking this up to an isolated ''meh' experience, but the food was just off today.  I still loved the soft tortillas of the street tacos but it was the filling that wasn't quite right. 

Today, I got what I paid for - cheap tasting food.  Maybe I should lower my expectations for El Burro just a little and it will seem better again.
