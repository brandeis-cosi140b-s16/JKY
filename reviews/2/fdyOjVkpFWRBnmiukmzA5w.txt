This place has steadily gone down hill the past couple of years.  It seems as if they let a couple of high school kids run this place now... I like Cafe Rio because the food used to be fresh and simple, but now I don't even bother going to this location.

The past few times I was there they seemed to be out of items, for example they were out of chicken once.  The last time I was there I was eating the chicken burrito enchilada style and the chicken wasn't even shredded like it should be.  It was huge pieces of chicken instead of shredded chicken.

Also, if your going to have a open kitchen keep it clean.
