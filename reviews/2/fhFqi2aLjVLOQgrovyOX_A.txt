I decided to try this place while in Tempe, based mostly on reviews on Yelp and another media.  I was greeted by a surly young man who may have awakened on the wrong side of the universe.  I asked for a well-lit area, and he seated me near a window.  Daylight was fast fading, as I was quickly served homemade chips and salsa.  The salsa was uninspired and bland.  The server, Samuel, was prompt and made a couple of recommendations.  I tried the pork fajitas.  By now the sun was down, and when the food arrived, it was so dark at the table, I could barely distinguish the pork from the veggies.  It was good, but I like to be able to see my food.  The candles at the table were sorely inadequate.  I asked Samuel about the lighting, and he said only the manager can change it and he/she had gone home already.  I was the sole diner in that dining room, BTW.  There were others in another part of the restaurant that I could hear, but couldn't see.  I left over half of my meal there, just because I couldn't see any longer what it looked like.  Very disappointing.

I wouldn't return to this restaurant.
