When I came to Rubios today I ordered the Baja especial steak burrito. I paid .99 to add sour cream. When I began to eat my burrito, I found it had no sour cream in it, and they added lettuce. Ewe. Hot soggy lettuce. I brought it back, and instead of making me a new burrito, they added sour cream to my already bitten one and chose to leave the lettuce in it. My chips were chewy, and my family spent $33. We could've gone out somewhere with fresher food! It is expensive, and they did nothing to fix their mistake. I still leave 2 stars because I have been there before and ordered the same burrito that was pretty good. I'd rather not roll the dice when my wallet is at stake.
