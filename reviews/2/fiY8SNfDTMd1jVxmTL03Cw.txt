I never thought finding a good hole in the wall place for Mexican food in Vegas would be so hard. I trusted my Yelp app, and this is where we ended up. Unfortunately only after driving by several other Yelp recommended places that quickly were crossed off the list for reasons like no air conditioning and dirty places.

Overall, this place ended up being less an authentic Mexican restaurant and more a bland whitewashed Mexican style eatery. The food was tasteless and they didn't even offer a good hot sauce. It was really an unremarkable restaurant. Easily forgettable. I can't say anything tasted really good or really bad. It was all just blah.
