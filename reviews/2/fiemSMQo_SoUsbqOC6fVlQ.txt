I hate to leave a two star review for this restaurant, but I believe in being honest.  First a couple of positives:

--The atmosphere is great.  Really nice decoration and ambiance; a pleasant place to sit and enjoy a meal.

--Wait staff was very attentive.

So why the two stars?  The food was simply not Mexican.  Not to say it was bad (well, it wasn't great either), but it was most definitely not the Mexican cuisine of which my wife and I are so fond.  We just moved down from Seattle, WA where I have had much better Mexican.  Being so close to the border, I expected more from our first Mexican food experience here in Arizona.

I think what should have tipped me off is that I didn't see a single Hispanic person on the staff.  So, really, this is more like a white-person's take on Mexican-inspired cuisine.  Maybe it could be re-classified as "Vaguely-Mexican Food".

I WILL go back though and will update this review if anything changes.
