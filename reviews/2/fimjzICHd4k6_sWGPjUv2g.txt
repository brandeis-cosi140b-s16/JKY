In short, one of the most boring meals I have ever eaten.

Las Cazuelas is about a block from our apartment, so my boyfriend and I decided to try it on Thursday night when we were both tired and the streets were still nigh-impassable from Wednesday's snowstorm.  We were seated quickly by pleasant waitstaff at a table near the fire, which both of us appreciated.

After that, however, service was relatively slow and lackluster, despite the near emptiness of the restaurant.  My boyfriend got one refill on his iced tea throughout the meal.  After clearing the plates, our waitress returned with the check without even asking if we were interested in dessert (despite a display of various cheesecakes and whatnot just inside the front door), or if I wanted another glass of wine.

The food itself was incredibly bland.  I had the chicken enchiladas, which tasted like unflavored grits with (overly dry) protein strips and a thin topping of, possibly, diced tomato.  It was as if the cook had never heard of spices, including salt and pepper.  The beans and rice were not objectionable, but were also completely lacking in any spice or flavor.

This seems like the perfect place to take an extremely picky 5-year-old.  If you actually like Mexican food, go somewhere else.
