give the choice between this Taco Bell... I'd take Taco Bell any day of the week. 
The food was Hot, but that's really it. 
and I don't mean spicy, I mean tempture wise. 

The chips were about a day shy of stale, and the carne asada was so tough I could hardly bit all the way through it. 

For Las Vegas being known for their quality cusine, this is a BAD example. 

I don't think my husband and I will be staying at Circus Circus ever again, so hopefully we won't be forced to eat here again.
