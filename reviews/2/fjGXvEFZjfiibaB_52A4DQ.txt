Food is pretty good. Its kind of a late night teen hang out spot. 

This one chick that works there is really rude. She never smiles, never even says hello when you walk in, and I kind of think shes a bit racist? I am white.. never once is has she been nice to me. But my bff is of Mexican decent.. and shes always supper sweet to her. if you come in often, you know exactly who I'm talking. She should not be working in a place where you have to be face to face with people. Rude person.
