Both food and service have suffered since the last time me and my buddies visited.  I think the staff is working too hard at socializing with the patrons.  And by patrons I mean the group of college guys in the next booth over.  OK, look - we were not jealous...all of us in my group are happily married and don't need the attention from "Barbie" the waitress...(not here real name but now you know what I mean right?)

We really just wanted food & beer but apparently this place "turns into a club" at 10pm which makes me feel like "you need to leave now"....  

A well deserved two star review.  Enjoy your party at da club.
