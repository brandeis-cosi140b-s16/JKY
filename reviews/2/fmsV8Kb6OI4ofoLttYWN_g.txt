Went to Chuy's for the first time today. Was sat promptly and was given chips/salsa & my ice water quickly as well. Our server then started waiting on a large party and we were completely ignored. The service never really quite picked up. 

Our appetizer came out the same time as our entrees (major pet peeve of mine!) and the food was nothing special. The rice was dry and flavorless. The refried beans looked like they'd sat on my plate for awhile in the kitchen and hardened up. I ordered the fish tacos and there was hardly anything on them. My daughter ordered a cheese quesadilla, and it looked beyond gross. 

It was also quite expensive, which I guess should have been expected being in Southpark. 

I am really bummed out as it's a great location with a great patio, and got a lot of rave when it opened - but it's not worth going to again.
