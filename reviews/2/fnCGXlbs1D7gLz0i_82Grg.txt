Moved from San Diego to Vegas and was happy to see a familiar name.  Roberto's is  favorite of ours in San Diego.  New city + familiar name = let's try it

This food is boring and has no depth of flavor that Mexican food is famous for, even the salsa is sleepy.

This is like middle American Mexican food with no heat and no cilantro.  If a person likes Mexican food but their stomach does not, this is a good place to go.

If a person likes Mexican food and is familiar with it, not a good pick.

This is a walk up, walk away store front, with some outdoor seating nearby.  It is enough space if someone wants to eat there.
