Tasty enchiladas, great salsa and flavorful beans but it ended up being a bit pricey for Mex fast food.  I ordered the 2 enchilada combo plate listed at $5.85, then added a soft drink and the bill ended up costing $9.50.  

Looking at the receipt I see they charged $1.00 extra for having chicken - didn't see that listed on the menu and the cashier didn't tell me about it which was a bit of a surprise.
