I dunno... I don't really get the rave reviews.  I got a chicken taco which was completely soggy by the time I got home (only about 5 minutes after I ordered it because I live down the road) and a cheese enchilada combo with rice and beans.  The beans do taste fresh.  The rice is decent.  The enchilada is ok but lukewarm and the cheese isn't even melted... it's still all shredded up inside.

The salsa at the bar is good though.
