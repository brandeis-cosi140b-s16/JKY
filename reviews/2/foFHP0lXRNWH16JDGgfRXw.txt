I'd been to the other location farther downtown and had been into this building when it was still Rubio's, so I thought I'd pop in and see the differences.
While the cashier was super nice and attentive, the food was way overpriced and they seemed to be out of a lot of menu items even though it was early evening on a work day. It's basically still a Rubio's with a different name and didn't seem as homey or "local" as the other location on 7th Ave. 
Wasn't impressed and won't be back.
