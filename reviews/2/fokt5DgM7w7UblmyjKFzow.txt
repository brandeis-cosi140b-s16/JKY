DH and I were excited to try El Rico's having passed by it a few times on our way to the Post Office. The parking lot always seemed busy during meal times. Well, we finally made it there, and I must say it was a bit of a let down. The exterior is nice, cute little courtyard. The service was good and attentive. 

I agree w/ the other reviewers who mentioned the salsa was good. It was good and had a good mix of flavors. The chips, though, were a bit too thick for my liking. We ordered the hard tacos  w/ shredded beef and that was excellent. We also ordered the burrito w/ carne asada and it was nearly inedible. Way over salted, meat tough. Very disappointing indeed.

We may give El Rico's a try again someday since they do have good shredded beef tacos. Or I may just check out the Mexican "deli" joint that's in the Mexican market that houses the post office. Sure smells good everytime I go in to ship my stuff!
