Another annoying Scottsdale establishment. 

I gave it 2 stars because the food was tasty, not great--but good. 
The service on the other hand was horrible at best. The restaurant was freezing!! We requested they shut the back door to prevent the draft of cold air pouring in and was ignored. It was lunch time on a Monday and we were only the 2nd table to be seated, I wasn't sure why our request went ignored. 

Shortly after taking our drink order our server vanished for almost 15 minutes. After which did not bring any of us water. We then placed our 2nd, 3rd and 4th request for water and finally receiving it the same time as our entrees. Would you like extra salsa? Too bad, the waitress never was to be seen again till my friend got up and approached the bar to have her soda refilled. It took her this long to realized we were annoyed. The food could have been the most amazing thing ever, but due to the lack of service I will NEVER go back.
