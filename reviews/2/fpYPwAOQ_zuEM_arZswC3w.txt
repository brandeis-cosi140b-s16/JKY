I haven't been to Rubio's in years, but after overhearing some coworkers talking about fish tacos, I had a hankering that I finally have in to. I stopped in at this location on a Tuesday thinking they had discounted fish tacos, but much to my chagrin, it was only after 2:30. Darn, but I decided to order a fish taco combination plate anyway since I was already.

The fish was ok, but the tortillas were stale and chewy and the sauce was just so bland. Nostalgia is a crazy thing, as I remember loving these tacos, but I don't think I'll be stopping by again any time soon.
