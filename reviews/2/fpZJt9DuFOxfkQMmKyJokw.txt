The food is what you would expect from a little burrito shop with a drive through.  Filling, somewhat greasy and cheap!  One warning and what made me stop going here was when my boyfriend handed them his debit card to pay and they handed him a slip of paper and said, write your pin number down please.

no thanks, I took my business to Fiesta Burrito.
