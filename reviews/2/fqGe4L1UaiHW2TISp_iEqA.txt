Defintely not great food. The tastiest thing on the menu is the salsa. It clearly tastes homemade. It's so good, I'm ok with seeing it in a tiny plastic cup on the side. Prices are inflated and do not reflect the small, lacking in ingredients options, that are all served with plastic utensils and in plastic baskets. After 10 the place pretty much turns into a bar, with a very limited food selection and the dining area closed off. And it doesn't morph into a very good one either; it becomes a small, crowded room lacking music or anything resembling entertainment, for that matter. I gave it 2 stars because my hip server was efficient and friendly, and because their Margarita selection is unique and enticing.
