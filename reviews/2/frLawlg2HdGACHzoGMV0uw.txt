I should have known from the sourpussed faced hostess that sorta greeted us, that I'd be underwhelmed.  

The place is cavernous.  No wonder at 6 on a Sat it didn' t feel busy/energetic.  Requisite chips and salsa on the table were just that.  Server was polite but not particularly knowledgeable.  He had to look back several times to the daily special board to confirm my order.  He had to return to the table to ask what sides I wanted with it.  Pollo adobado al carbon SOUNDS tasty, evokes the thought of bold flavors.  No.  It was not. There was nothing grilled or charcoaled like about it.  It had been reheated.  Warm on the outside tepid inside. I had black beans and mac and cheese with it.  Beans were the best thing at the table.  The mac and cheese was disastrous not because of the color, if you make something green it should have taste, but because it like most everything else was void of salt.  We added salt and salsa to the guacamole and it dramactically improved.  
Portions were generous and pricing was fair.  Service was unimpressive.  I can only imagine how bad it was for the tables of the server that stood across from us watching soccer for 15 minutes.  People don't go out for Mexican food to be bored.  I doubt a return is in the cards.  I'll take my chances on local food trucks for more authentic bold tastes.
