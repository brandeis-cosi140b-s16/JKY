After reading so many reviews on how great and authentic this place was,  we were very disappointed.  The salsa was not Bueno and neither was the food.  We were highly disappointed,  as everything from the guacamole  to the flautas tasted like onions.  The service was great and if the food had been decent,  we would be back often!
