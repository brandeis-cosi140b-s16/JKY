The traditional look and feel of the Tradiciones brought back many good memories of Mexican restaurants in SoCal in the early 60's.  I even - as a little girl - had an outfit almost exactly like the over the shoulder dresses the waitress were wearing while providing us with great service. Nostalgia aside, the food was disappointing.  Not bad,  just not what i was looking for after hearing good reviews in the AZ Republic and Phoenix New Times.  Should have read the Yelp reviews as well.
