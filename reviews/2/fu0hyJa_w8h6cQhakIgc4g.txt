Bad customer service, half my order was wrong or messed up, then the lady behind the counter argued with me about it being wrong.

Once we finally got it all situated the food was blah....Not even close to authentic, borderline cold, chips were stale, cheese hardly melted.  

For as expensive as this place was it was not even close to being worth it.  Wont go back
