When we want some Mexican grub we think of El Jeffes but sadly it's looks as if they have closed down. There's still a little hope left that maybe they changed their hours and that's why they were closed...
Anyhow, we decided to try the new Lindo Michoacan because it is near my house and I have eaten at the Green Valley location and thought it was o.k. so it's time for a second visit.
It's nice in the inside-very spacious and of course the view is awsome!!! The whole strip is always in your view.
Their chips , salsa and bean dip all needed seasoning. So right away I'm not happy. Not to mention the prices are too high-my chicken dish was $16.95.
The kids meals were sad...3 mini quesadilla triangles are all they get on this huge plate coverded in beans and rice that the kids did not want to eat-what a waste!!!
My chicken dish consisted of a pounded chicken breast covered in a chili and mayonaise mixture. That was very tasty but when everything else lacks taste it doesn't matter to me that one piece of a dish did have taste.
We decided as a family that we didn't care to go back - there are so many other good Mexican restraunts in Las Vegas that I would save money on and not have to put salt in the salsa.
