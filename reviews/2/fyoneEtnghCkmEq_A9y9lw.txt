Stopped in last Friday for dinner.  My husband and I always drove by this place and had seen cars packed in the parking lot near this restaurant and thought it might be a good stop to eat at.  We walked in and noticed a nice decor.  We weren't expecting to much walking in but the atmosphere was pretty nice.  They had a huge wait staff waiting for diners to come in.  The place for being prime time dinner time on a Friday night was pretty empty.  I liked it cause we got sat right away.  The booths are really comfortable, very soft and relaxing.  Our waiter came right over to take our order.  We felt like a margarita or two, or three so we ordered a pitcher to start.  Looking over the menu it looked as if they would have some pretty good food so I thought we stumbled on to a nice place.  We ordered the fish taquitto for an app.  The margarita came out and it was perfect, exactly how I make mine at home so I was happy.  The app was served and I was like, What????  It was one taquitto sliced in three pieces, not even enough for one person to enjoy, way to small for a $9 app.  I was very disappointed.  We tried it and it wasn't good either.  The fish I swore said salmon on the menu, and we got some sort of white fish I can't even figure out with no flavor.  bummer....   We both ordered some sort of combo they had.  I got the beef taco's, and enchilada.  My taco's really reminded me of the authentic Mexican taco's I've gotten down in Mexico, you know the smaller ones.  It came with a side of pinto beans, and rice.  My enchilada wasn't anything special, the taco's were a little bland.  My opion would be you can go through any drive through Mexican taco shop and get the same quality food for 1/2 the price of this place.  If it weren't for the margarita lifting my spirits I would have been very bummed about the price we paid for our dinner.
