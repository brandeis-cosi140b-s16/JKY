I order the number two combo which is the combination burrito fries and a coke. The French fries at Del Taco are always good. the combination burrito was very small and bland. the first half of the burrito was all beans and the second half of the burrito was all meat. The place looked fairly clean and the workers seemed nice. I'm here for the food please lets get it right.
