With many Chipotle locations throughout Las Vegas, don't choose this one. The customer service is lacking at this location and their portion control rates about a D- in my book. I've been to this location a handful of times and every visit seems to get worse. If I were to compare the amount of food I get at this location with any of the other 3 I have been to in Las Vegas, it would be roughly 35-40% less. 

When restaurants run low on product and are waiting for a fresh batch from the kitchen, you should be asking your customers if they would mind waiting a few extra minutes. At this location however, when they run low on chicken, steak etc., they take what should be a portion for one person and divide it between two. Even when there's plenty of meat available, the portions are small but during a rush it's almost embarrassing. Either the employees are not trained on how to handle these types of situations or the owner is more concerned about their bottom line instead of customer service. I will not be returning to this location and wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
