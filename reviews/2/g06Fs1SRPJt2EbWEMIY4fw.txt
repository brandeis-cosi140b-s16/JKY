If you want a burrito that tastes like it's from a crock pot this is your place! I don't even know where to begin its just that bad. My Hispanic friends would go crazy if they had to eat this or a taco from this place. Conversely the girl at the front was super nice and the chips were the best part of the meal. I don't expect a lot but if I want to eat a frozen burrito with no taste I can go to grocery store. Multiple shots without question must happen before you order eats from here. Good luck people.
