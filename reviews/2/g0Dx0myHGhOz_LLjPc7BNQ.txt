The quality of your meal will depend on who is running the deep fryer.  Tacos are usually overcooked..  Salsa bar is usually messy.  Burritos are average but no green chile at this place.  Stay away from the carnitas.  They recook them on the flat top and the look like overcooked corned beef hash.  The only thing authentic about this place is the language barrier.
