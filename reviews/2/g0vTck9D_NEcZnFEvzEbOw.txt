taco bell is my go-to for middle of the night hunger.  but no matter what time i go to this taco bell, i have learned to wait and wait and wait in the drive through.  i don't know what the problem is, but for the three years i've been going there, the wait is horrible.  if there was another taco bell closer, i'd go to it.  management really needs to do something about the wait time.
