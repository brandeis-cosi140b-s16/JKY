I don't think I would come back to this one.  The service was mediocre, there was little to no air circulation in the booth area.  The seafood enchiladas I ordered were quite good as well as the margarita.  The restaurant was not very busy though around lunch so I don't hold out as that being a good sign.  The manager also barked alot at the staff in front of the customers.  This restaurant needs an intevervention.
