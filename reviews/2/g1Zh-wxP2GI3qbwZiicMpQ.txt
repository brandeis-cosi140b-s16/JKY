Bland standard Mexican food at too high of a price. The chips and salsa were completely bland....I had two chips, when at Mexican restaurants I normally devour an entire basket and convince myself not to let them bring me another. I ordered the margarita special which was made with Blue Curacao and an upside-down Coronita....not very good. On top of it, the glass was so big and heavy that I literally had to push it around the table with both hands. I ordered two enchiladas, one with ground beef, the other with shredded, which were ok. I was shocked that the lunch bill, plus tip was over $70 for 2 meals, one margarita, one beer, and 2 shots of Patron.
