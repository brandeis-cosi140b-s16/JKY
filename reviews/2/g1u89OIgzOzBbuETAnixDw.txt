I read the other views, maybe I caught them on an off day... but this was my first experience.

My food was extremely tasteless, beans were runny, rice had no flavor at all. I had to souse everything in the salsa and sour cream provided to make it have any flavor. It's pretty hard to mess up rolled tacos, but all they also lacked flavor, meat was so dry some was not chewable. 

If you like the local quick Mexican food places stick with Filiberto's or Espinosas.
