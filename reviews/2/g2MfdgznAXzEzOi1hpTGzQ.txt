The lady taking our orders was pretty rude, but that's whatever she could have bad a bad day.
But the guacamole was almost this reddish brown all the way through, and the rice was in balls and the meat was pretty much uncooked.
We got it to go so we didn't know until we were home, but it was pretty disappointing haha.
There was a worker with a nice hair cut so that made the eh food okay :)
