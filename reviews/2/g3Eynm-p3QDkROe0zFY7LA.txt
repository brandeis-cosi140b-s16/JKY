Wow. Buzzkill. I use to live in Scottsdale and was a hard core regular of the Z Tejas in  Scottsdale. Use to be an event to go to Z Tejas. This location not so much. The chipotle salsa use to be heavenly. No more. Bland and boring. Stuffed pork tenderloin - use to be incredible! Flavorful! Now - not so much. The night I went I felt like I was at a Chili's or TGIF's on a Friday night... major buzzkill all the way around....  
Go somewhere else.
