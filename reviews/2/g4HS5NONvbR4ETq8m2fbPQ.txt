Short story: Very "Americanized" Mexican food at higher than necessary prices. Watery so so salsa, but the chips were fresh and good. We made the mistake of parking on the side by the dumpsters: Avoid that mistake, they smell terrible! And is it just me but when the employees use the general bathroom in the front of the restaurant is that kind of weird? Going in to use the bathroom I was passed by a cook on the way in and waiter on the way out. Maybe it's just me. For the food: The fish taco is not recommended, fishy and bland. The beef taco, I did think was good. Sorry I didn't find more to like!
