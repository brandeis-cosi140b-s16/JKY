I used to Love this place...but when I went recently, it really changed. They seem to be taking shortcuts on the food. My daughter asked for a bean and cheese burrito. Plain...they put some kind of sauce in it and seemed bothered when she went up to get it corrected. The girl pushed the burrito back at her and said, well...you might as well keep it because we are just going to throw it away. We sat there and waited for a little while. As we waited...2 more people's orders were wrong. Wish they would get it right again. I used to love their food
