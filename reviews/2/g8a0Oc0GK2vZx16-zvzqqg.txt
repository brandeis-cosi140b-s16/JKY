We like to go to Cuco's because we live down the street from it. The food is GREAT but the service is terrible. 8 out of 10 times my food is incorrect when it comes out or the server asks questions that don't pertain to what I'm ordering. Besides strange service their drinks are never made correctly and the manager or owner is very strange and follows the workers around. The food is good but the rest is just BLAH.
