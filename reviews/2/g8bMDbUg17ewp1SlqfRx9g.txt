Not impressed, very disappointed.  The waiter was rude, rushing me to order food after I had just ordered drinks and an appetizer.   When I told him we were not ready to order yet and if we could get some more chips, he scuffed and grabbed the basket and said I will get you chips, then brings back a basket full of broken up little pieces of chips not one solid chip.  Then I get the nachos and it's 4 chips with beans, cheese, gauc. And chicken($14).  My daughters ordered the Mexican burger and it was so salty my kids wouldn't even finish it.  I ordered the chicken enchiladas they were very good and the guacamole was fresh.  I enjoyed the atmosphere and the decorations, but turned off by the waiters attitude from the get go.  Prices were also high for the portion of food.
