It is never a good sign when all the surrounding restaurants have a 30-45 min wait and immediate sitting is available at Blanco.... This was my husband and my first time eating here. We enjoy all the other Fox Restaurants and were unfortunately very disappointed with the food and experience. The immediate seating on their beautiful patio was pretty much the only good part of our meal. Street tacos were decent but very overpriced for what you get. The black beans had a very funny after taste and the rice was covered in a cream like sauce. It was almost like a risotto, but lacking a lot of flavor. My husband's burrito was okay...but surprisingly small, really small. We also had to wait 25 minutes to get our appetizer Shrimp and Crab Ceviche which was pretty good but a very loose interpretation on a ceviche.

The waitress and hostess made a big deal about pointing out how Blanco is a "modern" take on Mexican cuisine. We are always up for trying a new approach to classic favorites, but if you are going to depart that far off you need make sure you execute the flavors. Fox Restaurants hasn't figured this out yet. at Blanco...
