Loved the Gilbert Road location, but it closed. Today I ordered the number one combo. The beans had a burnt taste, the taco was in a pool of grease, and the enchilada was ice cold as I watched it sit on the counter for a few minutes waiting for the other food. No gloves on the cooks and the staff seemed overall unfriendly.  The two stars are for the salsa, it's yummy!
