Came out with the wife and mom to watch the Iowa-Ball State game, and if you are an Iowa fan, this is a good place to catch a game. Lots of regulars and former Iowans.

Pros:
Many TVs. Good salsa, very smoky flavor. 

Cons: 
Many TVs lead to few conversations on any meaningful topic other than "the TVs are too loud" and "I can't hear you." Maybe this explains the roughly 30 minutes we did not see a waitress. It can't be though, as she was busy talking to her friends. You know the type. Early 20s, ASU student, lots of tats and a few piercings. I may be getting old (late 30s), and have some piercings myself, but get over yourself and do your job. Most of us old farts don't really care about what happened at the awesome party you were at the night before; in a month, she probably won't either.

The chips soaked up every last ounce of oil. If you took a match to one, it would burst into flame. If you rubbed one on a piece of paper, you could see through the paper in roughly 2.4 seconds.
