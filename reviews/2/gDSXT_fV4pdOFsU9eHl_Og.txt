was not pleased with my visit tonight. waited 8+ minutes for two tostada salads (that's it). then, asked for salsa with cilantro dressing. did not receive a receipt, or the salsa. went back through the drive thru, and, who looked like the manager, heard my complaint but definitely did not satisfy. she handed me the salsa and receipt, no apology or recognition of my problem. probably not going back, and have been coming here for a long time.
