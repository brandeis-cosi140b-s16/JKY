FOOD is incredble!!  BUT  i am a regular but the fact that you have to pay for chips prior to 10:00AM for breakfast is making me not want to continue to go... I asked for ships this morning and payed and got maybe 12 chips under a large burrito so they were crushed basically.. plus 2 small tiny containers of salsa.... I payed for this mind you, I was very disappointed to say the least....  plus only one size of Posole... not everyone wants a quart of it when they order it!!!
