Menu was incorrect, they didn't have some of the items advertised on there in store menu anymore. Food was definitely sub par. My tortilla soup was edible but it didn't taste like tortilla soup. The chicken meat in my taco had no flavor. My husband said his Baka taco was good. And my sister in laws quesadilla tasted like a quesadilla. On an up note, the salsa bar salsas were pretty good.
