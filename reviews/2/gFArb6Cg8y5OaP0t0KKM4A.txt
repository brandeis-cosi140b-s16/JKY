Food is just average. Nothing special. I would skip and go somewhere else. I had the pastor(pork), asada(steak), and cabeza(shredded head/cheek). The winner was definitely the cabeza. But everything else was just blande. The pastor was extremely dried. The owner asked me how it was and i told him my honest opinion; "the pastor was extremely dried." His response "you should know the pastor was going to be dried, next time put more lemon to soften it." Rude and just arrogant. Pastor is not supposed to be dried. Anyways... i live close by but it wont me my go to Mexican. Will rather got to El Pastorcito or Salsitas on 43rd and Indian School.
