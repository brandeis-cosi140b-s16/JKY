I was really disappointed.   The Carne Asado burrito was full of beef that was waayyyy too salty and hardly any guac or pico in it.   I kept trying to tone down the salt by piling sour cream and extra guac (I ordered an extra side) but it was just so bad.   I gave up and threw the burrito away.  The side of refried beans was watery and gross - the kind you can get out of a can is better.   I ended up layering the beans, guac, sour cream and salsa and eating it as a dip with chips.  Mixed together it wasn't terrible, but it wasn't very good.   With all the great reviews on here, I'm really surprised that this is the worst Mexican food I've ever eaten (Sorry :-( but it's true)  If you want good Mexican, go to Patron, Emiliano's, Cuzamil, Mad Mex, El Burro, pretty much anywhere else.
