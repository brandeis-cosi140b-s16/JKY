I have to give Aunt Chilada's credit - we stayed for a quite a while at an outside table drinking our margaritas until we realized that at 10:30pm we were the very last people there and that the restaurant had pretty much closed down around us. They had already picked up the check and never pushed us out so we had a relaxing evening.

Unfortunately I was unimpressed with the food. The chips were light and crispy but the salsa tasted pretty generic. A spinach enchilada was very bland and a chile releno was mostly breading with a small chile and cheese but not much flavor. The two people who were with me agreed that their food was mediocre as well. We went with the frozen margarita only because we wanted a pitcher and the margarita on the rocks pitcher was much more expensive. The margarita was also unimpressive - perhaps the more expensive one would have been better but the regular on one the menu just tasted like frozen sour mix. 

We had a good time, but if I were to ever go here again I would probably just go for chips, drinks and appetizers which I could get somewhere else anyway.
