Read the reviews so thought we would give it a try. Had the cheese enchilada platter. Lacked flavor and spice. The refried beans looked and tasted like they came out of a can. My wife had the shrimp burrito, with cheese enchilada,  the burrito came  out after we had finished the enchiladas.  It was a good sized portion but lacked flavor.  I was hoping to like this place but was disappointed and will not be back.
