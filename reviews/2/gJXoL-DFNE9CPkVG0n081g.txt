Stopped in for a quick bite on a late Saturday afternoon.  Place was pretty empty.  We asked the waitress what the, "signature" dish was, since this place was promoted as a, "family" restaurant, grandma's recipe had to be attached to something right?  The waitress said she had only been there a short while and she didn't eat the food there anyway, so she had nothing to recommend.  She didn't seem like she really cared about being there or taking our order.  Not a good for business for sure!  So we just ordered a combo platter and a burrito. The chips and salsa that were delivered to us were sad at best,  the chips were GREASY, super greasy with a hint of rancid, like they over used the oil or did a poor job cleaning the fryer.  The salsa had good flavor, but was severely watered down.  The food came and the portions were generous, but all very flavorless.  The sauces were again, watered down, and all the meat tasted the same.  My taco was dripping in grease.  I honesty don't know how they are still open.  This place was ok,  I wouldn't go back.  Maybe if the waitress had some kind of personality, we could have overlooked some of the flaws and given the place a second chance.
