Walked in on a sat- the place was cute and colorful and probably kid friendly had it not looked dingy and grubby. There was chips and salsa which looked slightly old and greasy.  When we got the menus I saw my menu was splattered with some old (I hope) food on it. When we sat at the booth there was crumbs all over and food under table from previous diners.  We ordered burritos- mine was shrimp except had maybe 2 shrimps and a whole lot of cream sauce inside with no flavor. Didn't even eat 1/4.  My dining partner was also unimpressed.  Won't be back
