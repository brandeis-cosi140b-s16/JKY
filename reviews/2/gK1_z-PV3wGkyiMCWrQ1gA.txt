Came here because a few coworkers said it was similar to Chipotle. I was personally not impressed. While when I first walked in, the layout and menu definitely screamed Chipotle. I got a steak bowl and it was "okay". The veggies tasted fresh but the rice was extremely bland in my opinion. Also, the steak was extremely seasoned well but wasn't as tender as I was hoping. While eating my steak bowl all I could think about was Chipotle's brown rice and the tenderness of the steak at Chipotle. 


Even though they are located close to the office, I would not be eating here again. The food wasn't bad by any means but when I can get the exact same thing at another place for the same price, I might as well just go to the competitor and be 100% satisfied.
