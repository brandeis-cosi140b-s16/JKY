Went here for a last minute dinner with my husband and son. I was surpised at how similar it looked to the old baja fresh. I was expecting more of the original decor from the other locations. I ordered the grilled chicken vampiro. I wasn't sure how big it was so i asked the cashier if I should order 1 or 2. She said a lot of people just order 1 but if you're really hungry order 2. I was very hungry so I got that and a carne asada taco. At about $3.50 each I was shocked at how small they were and even more shocked that the cashier actually said one could fill me up! They were both good but not worth the price. My husband got the carne asada burrito which he thought was good and a better portion for the price. 

Over all the place seems like a more expensive knock off of baja fresh. Plus all the table were dirty.
