I will start by stating that I love the spicy pork nachos. They are delicious. I have eaten at the restaurant and gotten take out a few times, with nothing particularly notable (although my husband says his food it's always cold, I guess I'm less picky about that). Then, tonight, things took a turn for the worse...
I picked up my take out and got home to unpack it, only to realize that they didn't give me the queso and put the wrong kind of meat on my nachos. Since I only live about five minutes away I called and informed the employee who answered that I did not get my queso and that there was the wrong kind of meat on my nachos. She asks me to bring it in so I can show her.  So I tell her sure, but I'd like to get an order for the correct nachos started, to which she hesitantly agreed. 
When I arrive, I get no apology, but an accusation that I didn't understand that the queso comes in a separate bowl and questioning about the kind of meat. Then she proceedes to show the cook, just to make sure I'm not wrong about the meat, which is irrelevant, because I am not taking soggy chips with cold meat home just because they didn't give me the queso and I had to drive back to get the food that I'd already paid for. 
I don't even mind that they forgot the queso because mistakes happen, but to forget the queso, put the wrong meat on my nachos AND be completely unapologetic about it after I had to drive back is completely infuriating. 
So if you like cold food to go, please check your food before you leave the establishment so that you, too, will not suffer the lack of customer service.
