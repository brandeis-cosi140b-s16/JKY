Awkward uncomfortable seating, bad ambience and lighting, salsa tasted like ketchup. This was not authentic mexican food but watered down american-friendly whitewashed "mexican food." Soup was bland, Mole was not a good flavor. I should've just gone across the street. Wanted to try something new but was disappointed.
