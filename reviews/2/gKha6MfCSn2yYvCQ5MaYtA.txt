Food's not that great. The staff was extremely friendly & service was fast. I had the Caramba chicken nachos. The chicken had an odd taste to it, like it had been boiled too long & didn't even have any seasoning. The chips tasted stale. Nacho cheese sauce from a can....very bland. Unfortunately we wont be repeat customers.
