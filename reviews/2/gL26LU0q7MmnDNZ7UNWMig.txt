I hate writing bad reviews, but this has been the second time I have left less than satisfied...

First time: I repeated myself numerous times letting them know I was HIGHLY allergic to any dairy and couldnt have the cheese or cream on the dish... she acknowledged and when I picked up my order, I double checked with the people making the food and they also confirmed there was no dairy.  So much to my suprise, I get back to my office and the bowl up to find cream sauce under the avocados.  :-(  I called in, and they did offer to replace my bowl, but my work is quite far and I was already back at work unable to leave again for a "second lunch" since I was the only one in the office.  Which meant no lunch for me that day...

So I thought I would give them another try... this time I got food for myself and someone else at the office.  Everyone was very nice, just as before, but I had to wait a while for my partners food since they had run out of chicken... okay, no big deal.  Well I get back to the office and my food was cold- they clearly had just let mine sit there the entire time as opposed to making his and mine at the same time.  Sad day Rubios, but I will not be back.

On the bright side- my coworker loved his meal!
