We recently tried Cocina Mendoza, mostly because it was close and I had a hankering for fake Mexican.  (Hello, Pittsburgh -- these places are NOT authentic... Mexicans don't use flour tortillas for starters nor do they cheese the hell out of everything.  I'm guessing the people who would call these sorts of places authentic also think Olive Garden and Benihana are authentic.... But I digress.)

Anyhow, I was expecting an el camps level experience.  But it wasn't even that good.  (Side note: why is the el camp's on McKnight so vastly superior to the other locations?) It was just bland as heck and the service, while pleasant, was really slow.  Despite the place being empty.  Prices were what you'd expect.  On the upside, portions were huge if you're into that type of thing.  Of the three of us who went together, the best thing had was a chicken quesadilla... not a good sign.

For this type of a joint, I definitely prefer El Paso over in Bridgeville.  If you want something resembling real Tex Mex/Mexican, it's worth the drive to Los Chiludos (which wins hands down).  Honestly, I'd pick a Moe's over this one.... We won't be back.
