Okay, so I am a little biased because I prefer Chinaco 100x over however, since we were in Vegas and were wanting something a little different than buffet, we opted for salvadorean/mexican. 
This place is kinda big, casual - super casual seating. The service is not so good, but the food is just ok. 
I ordered two pupusas, revuelta (pork, cheese and beans) and a calabasa (squash and cheese). I highly reccomend the calabasa as it has a lot of tiny little cubed pieces of squash, seasoning and cheese. 
I didn't like the fact that the salsas were a light pink super transparent watery mess. They tasted like boiled, watered down tomato juice and a hint of oregano.
