No thank you! 

This was a disappointing experience.  If it wasn't terrible service place potential because the food was decent. Unfortunately we had to ask for water four times... and My husband never got any. 


We stopped in for happy hour on Saturday, because of the sign on the street advertising it. We waited forever to be greeted at the table and then we're never actually assigned a server. So not only did we receive terrible service , the bill came and no happy hour pricing... When we asked about it, they said it was just Mon-Fri ... Then we let them know that the sign didn't say that, so they did look at the sign and honor it. 
 

We might give them another shot if they are still around in a couple months.
