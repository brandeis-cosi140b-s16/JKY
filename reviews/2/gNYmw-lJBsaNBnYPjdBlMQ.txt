Your typical local Mexican themed neighborhood bar. Don't expect anything fancy or even on the level of a bar on the strip. I came here with a group of friends and a local who highly recommended Paradise Cantina, but I was left pretty disappointed.

They have margarita specials, and a good variety to choose from. However, these "specials" are still pretty costly. A normal sized margarita ended up being around $12 (+/- $2, can't really remember). They're served in a plastic cup, which just makes this place even more tacky. Come on guys, this isn't a frat party. The margarita was all juice and barely any alcohol. Way too sweet, not sour at all, and just ended up being something I had to deal with and chug down. Not impressed at all.

Their beer selection is highly minimal, with Pacifico being the most extravagant beer they offer -_-. Service is surprisingly good and our waitress always checked up on us with a smile. 

If you're a local, this might be an ok place to just come and hang out if you're willing to sacrifice quality. If you're from out of town, don't even bother.
