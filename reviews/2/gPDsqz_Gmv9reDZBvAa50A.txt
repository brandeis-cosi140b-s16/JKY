After a rough experience here right after they opened, we decided to give it another shot this past weekend. Unfortunately, things were even more disorganized than the last time. The host was very friendly and attentive, letting us know he would be able to seat us soon and that we can hang out at the bar until the table was ready. The fact that we were greeted by a host was a great improvement for me because last time, I felt the confusion with seating and lack of a seating host/hostess was a major problem. When we approached the bar, the bartender brought one of us a drink right away while the rest of us needed some time to look at the drink menu. This is when the chaos ensued. A bunch of servers needed drinks for their tables and pretty soon, the lone bartender was caught up mixing margarita after margarita which all must be made to order. Then, large groups of people decided to also hang out at the bar while they waited for seating. At this point, a kind bus boy took pity on us and decided to put our drink orders in but he was unable to use the register, leading to a long line of customers who received drinks but hadn't paid. Our table actually became ready before we could pay for our drinks! We had to wait to pay before being seated. I was glad, once being seated to be out of the chaos of the bar. However, our server was just as disorganized when he forgot to bring us water after my boyfriend asked for it on 3 occasions. We didn't get water until we were almost done with our entrees! After all that, the food was pretty good. I had a chili relleno taco which was crazy! and surprisingly delicious! But unfortunately a lot of it was a little bland. Maybe the disorganized service put a bad taste in my mouth.
