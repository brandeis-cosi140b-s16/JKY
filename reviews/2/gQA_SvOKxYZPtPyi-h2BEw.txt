Never again! Burrito was too salty and just absolutely disgusting. And the nacho cheese on top did not add anything to help. However, the queso appetizer with nacho chips was off the hook. Our waitress was a total gem and really understanding of our issues with the food. Thank you for that! But I doubt I'll return to this place.
