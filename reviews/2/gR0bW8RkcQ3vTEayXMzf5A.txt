I'm shocked at myself that I ate here, but it was a last resort due to me needing to take Adam to the airport.  I've been to Chuys in Tucson for dinner, which is always have had a good experience with it being that it is a total hole in the wall.  But did anyone know that they had breakfast?!  Well they do.  So we went in and weren't expecting the world knowing what the place was.  We sat ourselves because there was no staff in sight and just 2 older people at the bar, at 8am lol.  So we sat for a few minutes and then a girl came to us.  She got our drinks and then we told her we were ready to order and she said that they don't do table service and she would meet us at the register.  My mind was boggled because there were only 2 other customers in there who were done eating.  How could she not think that she should just take our order with ALL the time she had instead of making us walk ALL the way across the restaurant to place an order for a whole 2 burritos.  So I give her zero stars!  I give the burritos 3 stars because they weren't the best I've ever had but they were good enough and they didn't give me a tummy ache!  So I give a total of 2 stars because of the servers one star.

Chuys is always going to be a good choice for mesquite when you need a quick bite!
