Been wanting to try this for a long time.  I'm a HUGE mexican fan but this fell short of landing on a top favorite list.  Chips and salsa were fantastic and our waiter was very courteous and attentive. I ordered the beef tacos-price was extremely high for what you get and there was no flavor to the meat.  The corn tortilla was drenched in greasy oil and just a big snooze of what was inside.  Rice and beans were descent but thats not hard to get right.  No plans to go back.
The price to park at the epicenter is redonkulous and they do not validate at this restaurant.
