Visited Moe's for the first time in about a year for their birthday promo (Free Burrito w/ purchase of a large drink), and I have to say I was let down relative to my relatively mild expectations.

On a positive side, Moe's definitely has their lunch process nailed down to an efficient machine.  They pump people quick enough through the line that there's often a bottleneck and a battlefield at the open salsa station and drink stand.

Relative to the food, as many others have referenced, Moe's offers your typical Qdoba, Chipotle, etc. style build-your-own Mexican bar.  Being similarly priced to those options, the quality of Moe's ingredients simply doesn't compare and can best be described as bland at best.

The "free" chips with every meal (I hate these type of sales gimmicks) are honestly outgunned by your standard grocery store Tostidos fare.  I haven't tried the queso, so that may act as a saving grace.

With an abundance of great establishments downtown to grab lunch, Moe's just doesn't make a meaningful price/benefit argument.
