I was extremely leery about stepping in here especially after a brief look at the photos on their website, but it turned out to be alright. Of course everything appears pink under the shade of light in here, but I have to admit that my pink corn tortilla shell was inexplicably pink as were the red onions that were ensconced within. I was here relatively early on a weekday night, so the place wasn't too crowded, the few people that were in there were "interesting" to say the least! Bonding with a new found group of girl friends over beers and margarita was more enjoyable than sampling the food here, though I did like their chips n salsa. In the end, what I liked most was the locale - in the heart of the Fashionsquare district, that makes for a very pleasant walk around. For me, neither the food nor the pink themed memorabilia is reason enough to remember this restaurant, so my opinion - skip it.
