This place looked promising from the reviews. We got the carnitas tacos and they were terrible. The meat was cold, tough and chewy. The tortillas were soggy. We also got the carne asada borrito. It also was cold and the meat chewy and bland. The green and red salsa was runny and flavorless. I think I would rather eat at Taco Bell.
