We went on a Sunday when they had some specials going on. $6 wings and $6 chilli fries. They also had all taps for $2. The place was not to busy and we were greeted promptly and sat at the bar. 

I ordered wings and a Diego Burrito. The wings were good. They were large and crispy but not a lot of flavor. I had the garlic chorizo sauce, I guess I was just expecting more of a kick from either of those two ingredients,. The burrito fell apart as soon as my fork dug into it. Again, not a lot of flavor. Actually, the burrito was just bland. The special price on the wings was worth it but the burrito was not sadly. I will go back to try some different things and update this when I do. 

The saving grace of this establishment was the bartender. Very friendly and super upbeat. That being said check out their daily specials. They have some good drink ones and it would be worth it to go. Also a large selection of tequila and margaritas.
