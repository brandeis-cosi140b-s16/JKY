I ordered a steak burrito.  Turned out that there was hardly a scoop of steak left.  Kid behind the counter asked if that would be good enough.  No.  So they had to make more steak, because of course they didn't think anyone else at 6 o'clock would order steak, and saw no need to make more upon running low.  

Also, the rice wasn't cooked all the way.

2 stars only because they were friendly.
