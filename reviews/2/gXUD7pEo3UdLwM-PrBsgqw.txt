I had family visiting me, but they preferred hotel accommodations. 
I recommended they stay at the Suncoast because it is the most upscale hotel/casino near my house.
 A long time ago, I ate at this place, but I don't remember anything outstanding or horrible.
If anything, I remember thinking it was pretty good.
Well...The service and the atmosphere are very good, but sadly, the food is not.
The rice was dry, my taco shell was stale, and I tried my cousin's chicken dish, and it was tasteless. 
And, considering that it's a hotel restaurant, the food is overpriced. 
It just doesn't cut the mustard (or salsa).
