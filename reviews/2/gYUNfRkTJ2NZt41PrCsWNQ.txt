Some of their food tastes like it's been in the refrigerator all week or a couple days since they tried giving me carne asada fries that tasted like they were warmed up for a few minutes then given to me. Also, another time the chicken inside of the red chile chicken burrito I got looked old when I opened up the burrito to see why it had a weird taste and texture after biting into the burrito. I have better luck at Filiberto's since when I go there my food actually tastes and looks fresh.
