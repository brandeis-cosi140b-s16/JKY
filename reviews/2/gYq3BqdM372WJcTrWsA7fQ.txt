I had high hopes as a Coloradan in Arizona after I read all the other reviews on Yelp. My husband and I ordered the tamale, taco combo plate with green chili. It was the blandest food I've ever eaten, and it was swimming in cheese. There was no flavor at all in anything on the plate. Even Chipotle is better.

My husband had avoided this place because its name is so stupid. Well, now we know the food is on the same level. We went because they offer a drive-through window if you call ahead. I think that's the best thing I can say about it.
