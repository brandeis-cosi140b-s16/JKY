So normally I'm a huge fan of Chipotle so it's with a heavy heart that I write this review.  This review is more about the service though than the food.  I typically go to this Chipotle after my workouts because I feel it is a very healthy alternative when I am to tired to cook.  Tonight though, I usually order a veggie bowl which normally gets guacamole on top, they ran out on the person right in front of me.  Instead of discounting the veggie bowl or offering me free chips, which I asked about, they told me no basically and have me some excuse about a point system.  I can't imagine those chips are anywhere in the same price range as the guacamole and they probably go stale if they don't sell them out that day, so why not make a customers day a little happier when you can.   This will probably, in  no way, affect me going back but as a new vegetarian I look forward to the guacamole on my veggie bowl.
