I know I am picky about my Mexican tastebuds, and I just cannot find much food I love here. I am Southwest Spoiled.

I am sure this is a great place for those who adore tequila more than me but it really is more of a fancy booze place then a great restaurant. 

The prices seem great until you see your smaller portions then at that rate you need to order more food. We tried the double guac app which came with a little pork belly. The pork belly was great but one of the guacs was swapped in over salty queso cheese and honestly it was borderline gross. Way too much salt packed into a little punch not enough fresh garlic or lime or cilantro flavors in their guac. 

I ordered the chicken enchiladas they were new American style meaning not baked they used corn tortillas (not a great choice if you love soft enchiladas. Their was some odd white sauce with the chicken which was nicely cooked, very tender. The rice was overly bland and beans were just ok. In short I doused the thing in Cholula and longed for my own mole pulled pork enchiladas. 

The drinks: we had mojitos the first ones were good the second had way too much lime juice. I guess as the night wore on less care was taken. I could say the same for our waiter he was very attentive until after our appetizer came then we barely saw him. 

The positives its a very nice space to eat in, we were able to be seated on a feb sat night within a half hour. But next year I'll be sticking to my first choice for a birthday dinner. If you're wanting authentic flavors you won't find them here more new american mexican. I think with a little help this place could be great but it is just isn't.
