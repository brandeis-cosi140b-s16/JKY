First off, Chipotle is my ultimate favorite! Everyone jokes I should own stock or my own store. Anyway, this location never has the food up to par. The flavor is bland, the chips are burnt and stale and the rice is always really chewy. The location at the San Tan Mall has no competition for my loyalty. I just wish they were closer.
