I came here expecting to eat at Gallo Blanco and instead found that Gallo Blanco has been replaced. There was no cocktail drink menu. We were told it is still being developed. We had the guacamole as an appetizer, and it was good. It comes with pomegranate seeds. The chilaquiles were ok. They seemed more like nachos with tomato sauce on top. The pork belly taco was very good, although I was not impressed with the tortillas. Overall, this dining experience was disappointing, but I will probably come back later when the restaurant has more of it's menu put together.
