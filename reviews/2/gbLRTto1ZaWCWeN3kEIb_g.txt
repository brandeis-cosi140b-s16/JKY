My friend and I came here for the lunch with a groupon and as we were walking in we were handed a coupon for a free appetizer. The place wasn't busy at all but the service said otherwise! We waited sooooo long for our food. We ordered the chicken burrito ($18) and the fish tacos ($18) and a side of fries ($3). We chose the nachos for the free appetizer. My friend enjoyed her fish tacos but my chicken burrito was very bland and hardly any guacamole. The appetizer took the longest to come out and was terrible. The meals came out about 15 min after the appetizers came out and they forgot the side of fries. The side of fries came out once we were finished with our meals. The food was extremely overpriced especially for the taste. The drinks are even more overpriced but this is on the strip so no surprise. Wouldn't come back here, not worth the price or wait at all. Our server on the other hand was extremely sweet.
