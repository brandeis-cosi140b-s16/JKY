I'm disappointed. It's been a while since my last visit, but with its continued popularity, I expected the same experience. We arrived around 9:30PM on a Friday night and it wasn't too busy. We ordered four Pastor (with pineapple), two Cabeza, and two Lengua tacos. Prices are still the same at $2/each (Lengua is $2.25), however, meat portions are noticeably smaller. That was my first disappointment. Pastor is my favorite meat and I was looking forward to these tacos, but the meat was so dry and lacking a lot of flavor. Completely the opposite from what I had here before. Plus, the pineapple was practically non-existent. I thought they had forgotten to put pineapple on my order at first glance! The Cabeza and Lengua were fine. I'm not sure if it was an "off" night, but I was not happy with my tacos and Ruben was not impressed (it being his first time). We won't be returning.
