My wife and I were excited to see an new restaurant pop up where the old Teakwoods once was and were hopeful that it would really be a competitor to Penascos.  My overall review of Plaza Bonita is that it is painfully average and incredibly underwhelming.  This is nothing more than an standard run of the mill Mexican restaurant. That would not be a bad thing if they really nailed the food; which they didn't.

The first thing I noticed was that the chips and salsa that came out were sub par.  The chips were very thick and oily and the Salsa was completely liquid, no chunk of any kind save a few pieces of onion floating inside.  Mind you this was supposed to be garden salsa, which should be very chunky, not a chipotle that one would expect to be without chunk.  

I ordered the Enchiladas Deluxe and when I asked if they could put Carne Asada inside instead of shredded beef.  I was told they had no Carne Asada, so I went with chicken...   Good thing I didn't go with my initial thought which was Carne Asada tacos.  When the plate arrived immediately I noticed that the refried beans were like puree so they were runny and I am fairly sure they were out of a can.  The rice was bland and again tasted like something seasoned with a pre-packaged seasoning mix.  The enchiladas were... enchiladas... but the tortillas were thick and spongy so they also didn't earn high marks.  

Everyone else I was with had about the same impression with their meals.  The food wasn't terrible but it was just something you can get at any Mexican restaurant, both sit down and drive thru, and was not executed well.  I can go anywhere and get Mexican food so why would I choose to spend money at just another Mexican restaurant when I can choose Penascos, On the Border, Macayos, Blue Adobe Grill, etc?  All said in hindsight I would have rather taken my money to Federicos and spent about 1/5 the price... Hell at least at Federicos I know they are going to have Carne Asada.
