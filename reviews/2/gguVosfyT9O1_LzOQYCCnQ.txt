OOOOOOOHHHHHHHH...........now I see where the bad reviews come from. 
I was here on Wed with my kids and had great service.........instead of BBQ on Labor day weekend we decided to come back here.......should of went with the BBQ

Sat in the bar..........took 15 min for someone to acknowledge us. We ordered.......Medelo Especial, Dos XX lager and a shot of Cabo Wabo tequila. We got.......get this........house margarita, Negro Medelo and a shot of some type of tequila (wasn't Cabo Wabo).
We seriously had 5 different people serve us food, drinks, and check on us. My guess is it isn't the staff, they do not have a proper manager in this place. All the servers don't have a direction or structure. In my 2 times here this week, I have looked my servers in the eye and told them to make my food AS SPICY AS THEY CAN. What ever you have to make my mouth on fire, do it.....both times BLAH. My wife and daughter both had the tortilla soup this time, nothing to write home about. 
Again I don't blame Alicia Silverstone our waitress, the entire bar seemed disorganized and clueless. We sat in the bar area and the bartender was behind the bar maybe 3-4 in the night.  If this place is here at Xmas time, I will be greatly surprised. Adios Arriba.
