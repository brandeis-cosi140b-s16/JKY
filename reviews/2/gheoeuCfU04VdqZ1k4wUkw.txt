Are you serious with this? I understand you're trying to take over whatever qubobo was doing, but can't you have some flair or personality of your own? The food sucks. I ordered the nachos. The chips were stale, the chicken had no flavor, and the nacho cheese was seriously watered down. They have no logo, the place is dark and dank, and the menu is confusing. I hate this place, I'm never going back.
