Huh.  So this was the first time I have ever seen a server quit right there on the spot.  Not because anyone was being noticeably rude or demanding, but probably because for some reason he was the only waiter/busboy/host working on a FIRST FRIDAY.  I'd be stressed out too. But I'm glad that happened at the end of our meal, even though he apparently took our cash payment (no change given) with him. 

At least the food was tasty enough!  I very much enjoyed the No Whey Jose Nachos - the spice level was excellent and hot.  The tacos (as I read somewhere else) do taste quite similar to the Jack in The Box tacos but are about 8x the price. I probably would have enjoyed the food a little more if I could see it.   

This restaurant needs to find its identity - it has way too many cheap club elements (neon lights, overly loud music, dry ice bowls), mixed with some Indian-esque art, vintage mirrors, and then serves up pricey vegan Mexican street food. 

Basically, for the price - I expect more.  I would like good atmosphere, good service, computer programs that can calculate tax, and the ability see/hear my dining partner.
