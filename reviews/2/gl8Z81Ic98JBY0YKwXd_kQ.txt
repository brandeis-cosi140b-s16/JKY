I have been going to Popos for years and tonight was the first time that I would say that I did not have a good experience. I am very use to the long wait but when we got our food the waiter acted like the food was just prepared and how hot the plates are. Yes the plates were  hot but the food was cold. I give it 2 stars because the service used to be good but the service that I got tonight deserved -5 stars.
