We decided tonight to explore Mesa and find a good Mexican. Our selection for tonight was Rosita's. The atmosphere was a tad old but some holes in the walls are often unpolished gems. But this gem was in need of some updating. The service was decent, a few times we were left waiting for a bit and the dining room wasn't crowded at all. 

The food was ok, the fresh salsa had the right amount of heat. The first round of chips were freshly made but the following baskets tasted as it from the bottom of an over cooked basket. The pricing for most of the menu very over priced. My pork carnitas chimi's were delicious and very moist though. The retried beans were not very creamy and lacked flavor. The queso dip was quite small for the large price and not very fresh as I am accustomed to. The soda was served in a very large glass and my bf beers were good lol as he had two. Overall not a bad selection but a bit overpriced for the quality of service and food.
