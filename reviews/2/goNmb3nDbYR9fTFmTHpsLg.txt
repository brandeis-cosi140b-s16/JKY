Never have I ever been so disappointed at a Qdoba. I live right behind this location and I've come many times before. It's never been the fastest and I've never seen more than two people in the front, but today is just ridiculous. It's never been that busy that I've had to wait that long for my food anyways, and I've never been in a hurry so I never minded that it's not the fastest. I am standing in line and I haven't even ordered my food yet, which I only came for chips and Queso - As soon as I walked in I was surprised to see the line so long it curved around, 14 people in line - one person at the front making the food and ringing up the order. What the hell? It's noon, why do you only have one person at the front counter? There is a gentleman coming back and forth to put the steak and chicken on the grill, but that's it. Three people have left in the time I've taken to write this review. Im giving two stars because the food has always been the fantastic Qdoba I love, and I am one of the few Qdoba advocates I know down here - I hate Chipotle. But there is NO excuse for only having one person at the front over the noon hour.
