I really hate to give this place two stars, but our to-go order had so many mistakes and poor execution that I had to post. Pluses included tamale, flautas and sides. The server who helped us was great, but then I opened the food at home. Fajitas were wrong order( ordered double beef and got single beef/ chicken )and had lots of gristle/connective tissue. Most dishes were mushy due to lettuce next to/ under them and grease/ fat. Shrimp with chipotle was overwhelmingly spicy and strong with lots of grease. Ordered sopapillas which were missing. Perhaps things are better when you order in restaurant, but they really need to improve to-go quality and execution.
