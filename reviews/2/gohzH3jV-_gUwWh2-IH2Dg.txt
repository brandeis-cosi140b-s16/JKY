Pretty cool place very busy and cramped when I went for breakfast. I sat at the bar and watched the cook touch for no reason pretty much every thing he made. He would pick it up with a spoon or tong then touch it with his dirty disgusting bare hand as if he was blessing it. GROSS

Update: the food was just ok and there was a ridiculous $5 share fee because we couldn't both eat a troth of food
