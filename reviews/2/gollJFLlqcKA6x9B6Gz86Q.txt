Red salsa had a nice flavor but zero spice. Green salsa was a bit bland. Asked for the hot salsa, which is definitely spicy, but not a lot of flavor. 

Meals were average. (1) The bolillo (bread for the torta) was a tad try and just not up to par and that spoiled the torta. (2) The chile rellenos were good but the red sauce a bit bland. (3) The taco salad was very good and the chicken inside was great but it was way too small and person left quite hungry after. (4) The spinach enchiladas were bland and lacked flavor. 

Service was erratic. Tortilla chips were brought quickly but we had to ask for salsa  five minutes later because it had yet to come. Then we had to ask for napkins and silverware. Only the silverware came and we again had to ask for napkins. 

Not going back too soon. Other family members have had a good experience so we'll eventually try it again. There was a very large party there on the night we dined but no excuses allowed.
