Taco Bell aka "Taco Hell" brings back amazing memories from my high school days.  There was a Taco Bell located right across the street from BHS (my high school), and if memory serves, the drive-thru was open pretty damn late; maybe even 24 hours?!  At the time, my friends and I made many a "run for the border," and I remember the food being great!

Either I was really drunk back then or Taco Bell has gone down hill or my taste buds have matured quite a bit since then, because after eating Taco Bell for dinner last night, I no longer "quiero Taco Bell."  Or maybe I ordered wrong?

I'm quite nauseous thinking about what I ordered (and ate) last night:
-1 Mexican Pizza (540 calories / 30 grams of fat)
-1 Chicken Soft Taco (180 calories / 6 grams of fat)
-1 Pintos and Cheese (170 calories / 6 grams of fat)

I didn't know there was a "Drive-Thru DietÂ® Menu" until looking at their website just now either... oh well, I'm eating for two right now!

I also didn't realize the slogan changed to "think outside the bun" until actually listening to the radio commercials as I drove home with my food in my lap last night.    I will say that the drive-thru was super quick and my order was right and all for under $6.  What a bargain!

I'm sure Taco Bell is still a great option when you're out late, have had a few too many, and/or are eating on a budget.  But I don't recommend it when you're completely sober and it's a normal hour.  Probably not the healthiest option for the baby in my belly either... 

Bottom line: I don't plan on returning for many years to come, although I do have a pretty big high school reunion coming up next year, so I may just have to give it one more shot!
