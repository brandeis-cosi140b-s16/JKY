I went here with a gf who RAVED about it.  I have to say, I didn't feel the same way.  It was really, really bland.  I didn't think Mexican food could ever be described in such a way, but such is the case.  

The service was slow but it was lunch time and only one person working, so I will take that into accout.

The prices were fair to moderate for the lunch special.  

The food, when finally served was lukewarm and just had no taste.
