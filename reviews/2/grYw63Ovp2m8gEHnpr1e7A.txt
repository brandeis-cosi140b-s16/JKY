Went here with my girlfriend the other day. My food was fine. My girlfriend ordered ACP chicken, and it came out with very little chicken or cheese. It was more vegetables and red sauce, which I think is just ketchup and barbecue sauce. We got a margarita pitcher, and it tasted like there was not much alcohol in it. I can't shake the feeling this restaurant cheats its customers, and I'll be looking at other Mexican restaurants in the area before considering here again.
