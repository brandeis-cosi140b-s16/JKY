I don't get all the Five Star Reviews... Yes the chips, salsa and guacamole was very good... However my entree was not to my liking... Is that enough for a two Star review... No... But when you have to chase down  waiter several times for the simplest of things, the loud Music, and the prices... Yes... This dining room can't be more then 1000 sq feet... Not to mention only 4 tables were full... So why the bad Service... The waiter never came to check on us... Had to chase him down for our check... Again this restaurant is a thousand square feet... He couldn't hear it excuse me.... The music was so loud...

They have live music that was so loud it was insane... If you want upscale Mexican restaurant... That's about the same price and much, much better food... Go to the El Dorado... Not to mention it has a wonderful atmosphere... Phenomenal service... The chef comes out and meets everybody... That's a pleasurable dining experience... 

How can anybody give this restaurant five stars?
