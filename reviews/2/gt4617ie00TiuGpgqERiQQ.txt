I was very happy when I arrived at Filibertos. I have not had a great tasting carne asada burrito for quite awhile. I could not eat inside so I ordered to go instead for it smelled like a nasty locker room. I only live a minute away and was so eager to eat my burrito, but it turned out to be cold and though I might get food poisoning or diarrhea.
