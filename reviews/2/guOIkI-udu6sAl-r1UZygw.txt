I've been here several times at it is always the same experience,  SUPER SLOW and less than good service. I try to eat by the Paleo plan, therefore I get no rice or beans here.  When you don't  order rice or beans (the huge filler ingredients) they look at you crazy here. I asked for a bunch of veggies and my steak. I received a pinch of veggies and  barely 1 scoop of meat. When I asked the lady for a little more of each I was told I'd have to pay extra. Stingy. I wasn't asking for extra, just a fair amount.  Not going back to this location.
