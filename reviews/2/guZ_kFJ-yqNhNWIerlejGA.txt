Don Pedro is a stop that does the job. Portions are huge and prices are reasonable. I've tried a few entrees here and and all have been ok. My husband liked his mixed grill entree and I must admit it was pretty dang good. Drinks are good, service is prompt and an on the house dessert at the end didn't hurt. Overall Don Pedro is OK to me. I'll go back for the heck of it and try some other items on the menu.  A lot of ppl like this place, so maybe I'm not ordering from the right side of the menu. It's close to home and convenient, priced well and lots of food - so another shot it is :)
