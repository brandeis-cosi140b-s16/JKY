I dined here once on a date. Needless to say, the date that evening went south. Anyhow, I found the service here average and the time to receive our meal was unusually long -like 20 minutes. The food was fairly bland and not very flavorful and the chips and tortillas seemed to not be very fresh. However, the one redeeming factor is their quesadillas are huge and they don't skimp on the cheese. 

This place is fairly average and you won't impress any dates here. But if you need some Mexican food near Arizona Mills, it's alright.
