I should say up front that this review is based on chips, salsa, and a strawberry frozen margarita.  But you know, I feel like chips/salsa/margz are the fundamental building blocks of any Mexican restaurant, and if they fail at those, they might fail at other things.

When my friend and I drove down for homecoming, we arrived a little early and couldn't check into the hotel yet.  Chevys was just down the street, so we decided kick off our weekend of constant food and alcohol consumption by getting some drinks at the bar.  At 5 pm on a Friday night, the place was amusingly empty, with the occasional random quiet man alone at the bar drinking margaritas (awkward) and a couple other tables of folks in Illini gear (and Steelers gear, for some odd reason.  They followed me here?)

We saw that on Fridays they have a $4 frozen strawberry margarita special.  That deal was calling our name, so we each got one.  They were all right - good texture, decent taste, we got a little buzzed, but nothing special.  The chips and salsa, however, were totally blargh!  Watery salsa, weirdly textured chips - like, the chips were really weak and flimsy, not the good sturdy tortilla chips that can hold up to good salsa.  They weren't even worth eating.  Also, the bartender was visibly perturbed when we asked for the check.  Sorry, but we had dinner plans at Papa Del's, and didn't want to spoil our appetite!

....why go here when you could drive a mile and go to Dos Reales?
