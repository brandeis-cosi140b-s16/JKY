Frida's is mediocre, at best.

The tacos are generally dry as the desert and the beans are like eating sand; and I've had their steak tacos twice (I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt and assume it was a fluke--not the case.) Their cheese quesadillas are just as lifeless and lacking in flavor.

I've never had bad service here, but I can safely say that there's only two reasons to come to Frida's:  one, their margaritas are excellent--especially if you're stupid like me and don't mind trying to down a 28 oz. one (they have larger ones as well) in about an hour and a half time frame or more. Two, their desserts. The Tres Leches is to die for: it is rich and decadent with sweetness that makes you sit back in your chair and get a food coma.

If there is one reason I will return to Frida's, it's for the margarita and Tres Leches.
