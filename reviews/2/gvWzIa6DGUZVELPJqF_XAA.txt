I do NOT recommend this location, the food is great but the place smells horrible as soon as you walk in. The customer service is horrible as well, there were no customers and the cashier saw me waiting and she did not approach me. I stood there for quite a while and the food took so long when I only ordered one burrito. I recommend any location BUT this one.
