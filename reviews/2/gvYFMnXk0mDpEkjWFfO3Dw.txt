Good food. Staff seems to be fairly incompetent. I've been to this location at least two dozen time and I would say 85 percent of the time they've made my families meals wrong. 

They use good quality foods but it frustrating when you never get what you order. I've received salads no meat or the wrong meat. Burritos with the wrong tortilla- you name it and it's gone wrong. 

Wish I could actually go to this place since the taste is there just lacking proper management.
