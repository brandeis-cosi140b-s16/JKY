Religious murals, a candle-laden Catholic altar and arcade games coexisting in the dining room, and tacos. This place is... well, all over the place.

THE GOOD NEWS: they're no longer cash only and accept credit with a 50-cent processing fee. There's also an ATM in the dining room. There's a panaderia next door and a paleteria further down the strip center to continue your Mexicano dining adventure!

THE NOT-SO-GOOD NEWS: Apparently prices have gone up from most of the ones posted on these reviews. Tacos are $1.25-$1.50 each, my two-taco take-out order was basically $3. But when I opened the bag at home, there was a foil packet roughly the size of a slice of cheese. I wondered how they could have given me the wrong order, given that I was one of only two orders at the time.

THE REALITY: My two tacos were both mini-tacos, and the condiment container of grilled onions I'd grabbed at the salsa bar seemed to dwarf the actual tacos. I know street tacos are on corn tortillas and run a smidge smaller at traditional places than, say, Taco Bell or Del Taco, but these were absurdly small.
Similarly-priced tacos at Tacos Gil or the guys on Decatur are all easily twice the size of what I received here. Key words: similarly-priced. 

That being said, the lengua taco is fairly good and I liked the mild salsa verde, but the asada was lacking and overpowered by the ranchero-style sauce included when you ask for "everything on it". 

THE VERDICT: Disappointing. For tacos, anyway. Maybe I'll go Jade's route and try the soup next time.

Side note: also watch out for the guy in the parking lot with a bottle of Windex. He'll spray down your vehicle while you're inside, unprompted, then expect payment afterward.
