The service is bad and it always takes a while for them to acknowledge you  even when it's not busy. On my last visit I ordered the chicken burrito and it didn't taste fresh and I could barely eat it because it was soaked in enchilada sauce, my fianc√© agreed that it tastes like the stuff you buy from a can. I've given this place way too many chances and I only write this review because I got sick right after eating there and the next day I am still sick..
