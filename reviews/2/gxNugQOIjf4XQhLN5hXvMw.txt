First off... their Horchata is phenomenal - and would be the only reason I'd probably step foot back into Robertos.  Also, I was told that the margarita was fairly decent.  Other than that... everything else that we had was pretty "meh".  My mom was in town, and craving Mexican, so we decided to try Roberto's out from the Yelp reviews - I kind of wish we wouldn't have.  For starters, we were told we'd be brought chips and salsa... but they never came.  We waited a good 45 minutes to get any food, which seems crazy to me to make people wait for 45 minutes for some food served on disposable plates with plastic silverware in an environment that looks like there are serving up fast food.  And then to make people wait that long and not even bring them chips and salsa.  Not great on the service standpoint.  As far as the food goes, my husband ordered the Al Pastor burrito - he said it was bland and greasy, definitely not anything close to what he is used to (and he said that the Al Pastor could have benefited greatly from some pineapple, which I believe it is traditionally served with).  My dad ordered the rellano combo plate, which he said was good, but definitely not the best he has ever had... maybe typical middle road.  My mom ordered the enchilada and taco combo - she didn't like the enchilada at all and only ate some of the chicken out of the inside of the taco - definitely didn't satisfy her mexican food craving.  I ordered the chicken chimi combo, which was really bland and typical - nothing special or that I'd want to eat again.  We all discussed that the beans were pretty good, but that does not a meal make.  So to have to wait that long and then be completely underwhelmed by bland mexican food... not likely that we'll be returning, unless of course in the area and craving some horchata.
