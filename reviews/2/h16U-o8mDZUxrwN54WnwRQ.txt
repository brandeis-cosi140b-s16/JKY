tonight is saturday and we were the ONLY 3 people in there? yet, our server was below average...way below. had to ask twice for water and for beer refills. and salsa...had to ask twice for that as well. 

my dish was ok. standard mex but very salty. i won't count our dinner companion because she is too picky (everything was wrong with her dish according to her). however, my girlfriend loved her fish with lettuce wrap dish...said it was "the bomb", a phrase she has rarely used since entering her mid 30's! our prickly pear margaritas were quite tasty though, so a grand 4 stars for that.

but what made me give it only 2 stars was the service...we never, ever expect much because we know how hard it is to be a server...however, with us as the only customers, the service tonight was way off. overall, 50 bucks for 3 entrees, 2 margaritas and 2 beers.
