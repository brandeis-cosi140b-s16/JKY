This is right across the street from where i live,  so we basically just go here for convenience.  I'm a vegetarian,  and they offer decent - tasting fajita veggies. However,  they are not at all generous with their portions. The boyfriend is a big meat eater and he always gets double steak and chicken in his burrito, which they are happy to charge for. He always has to ask them to add more,  to which they always seem super annoyed. I get their queso (which is very yummy) in my burrito, which they are also happy to charge for. The last time i ordered it they barely put any on there,  and i asked for a little more, which was granted with a scowl, and barely added more.  At the end she charged  me twice for the barely - there queso. All together with a veggie burrito,  a double meat burrito,  one large drink,  and chips and queso the bill was nearly $40. Ridiculously overpriced.  Q'doba is much better and they give better portion sizes.
