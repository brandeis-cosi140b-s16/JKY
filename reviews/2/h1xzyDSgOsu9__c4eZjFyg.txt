I'll start by saying I've been a huge fan of Emiliano's (across the street) for years, so when this place opened across the street while I was living in South Side last year, I had to check out the competition.

And, sadly, its not competition at all. The food was supbar at best. I ordered a 'salad' for $6 and got a few random vegetables in a very, very small bowl. All the things I subsequently ordered were cold, bland and had very little flavor.

The two stars are for the staff, who was very friendly and accommodating. Maybe I just had a bad experience food-wise since the place was new, but I don't think I'll be returning on any future visits to find out.
