I joined a few coworkers for lunch here today... I've not been a huge fan of Mi Cocina, so I hoped the new location and fresh look would've improved the experience.

It's still just barely passable as Mexican food.  Most entrees appear to be drowning in sauces, cheese, and other gooey/greasy stuff.  The salsas are extremely watery and lacking in flavor.  The guacamole (not the tableside-made) is bland and pasty.

I ordered a pollo ensalada (chicken salad), which arrived as a bowl of super watery iceburg lettuce, a slab of seared chicken breast, 4 small slices of cucumber, a spoonful of pico de gallo, and a huge glob of guacamole (which I scraped off and set aside).

The salad was ok, but as I neared the end, I literally had what looked like a small soup bowl's worth of water resting in the bottom.  

My coworker's entrees were drenched in various cheese sauces/red sauces; the taco combo was blanketed in cheese.  They loved it, but my guts would've been complaining for days... 

So, enjoy the new location and ambiance - just don't expect better food.  Those who've had real Mexican food will not enjoy this place...
