Honestly I really wanted to like this place. I think the retro building looks great from outside. Inside is another story. The both times I've been here everything feels dirty and greasy, which makes me wonder how clean their food prep area is. On top of that, the people always seem annoyed behind the counter. It's a bit of a hostile environment. They also have never really gotten my order right and really don't seem to care too much about it. 

The food in actuality, honestly, isn't that bad, but not worth putting up with all the other stuff. I've seen other people walk out since they weren't getting the time of day there....

I think this place with a new, better management could be a success. Especially since this place is 24hrs, which is a big plus for me.
