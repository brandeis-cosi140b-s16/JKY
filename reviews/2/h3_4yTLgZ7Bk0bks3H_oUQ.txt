I have been a fan of El Pollo Loco, the meal I ordered today was a disappointment. The Mango Chicken Bowl, it was my first and last. The problem, I live four miles away from the location, when I arrived home and opened the lid I did not see mangoes. I was disappointed but I know this can happen, it gets left out. The clincher, the 1/2 TBSP of micro mango was at the bottom of the bowl. When I say micro, the pieces were so small I thought it was corn. Don't even bother calling it a mango bowl if this is the amount one will get The second disappointment was the amount of chicken, if there was a 1/2 cup I would be surprised. I was hungry one hour later, and the $6 bowl did not do it for me

The good, they use a spring salad mix, and there was a generous amount of salad. The drive thru was efficient and I received my food within minutes. This  franchise does not have the long lines that I have seen at the Craig location. When I return, I will stay with the grilled chicken, it is what the do best!
