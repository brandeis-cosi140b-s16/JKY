We really like their burritos and typically get them to take out......because the restaurant is VERY noisy! And the rather odd parents that let their little ones carry on like animals! 
Tonight I chose to go into the restaurant and order; what a mistake. The couple next to me left without food. The noise is nothing short of numbing. After 50 minutes no burritos, no update. You would think that they would put out chips. I think this is the last time........
