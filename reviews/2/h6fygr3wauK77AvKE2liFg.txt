I've been here 3 times now. It was good the first time, ok the 2nd time on Cinco de mayo(very busy), and just awful the 3rd time(last week). 

The good:
-Cheap prices on beer!
-Booths are cool looking.

The Bad:
-The waitstaff. Took your order and then disappeared.
-DIRTY! Walls, floors, windows. Missing light bulbs. Enter the bathroom at your own risk. Sink barely worked and was covered in short black hairs. Scary.
-My chicken torta came on store bought hamburger buns. Ummm... wha?
-Food was very bland.

Not sure if I will give La Tolteca another try which is disappointing, I wanted this place to be awesome but it seems that they have lost interest.
