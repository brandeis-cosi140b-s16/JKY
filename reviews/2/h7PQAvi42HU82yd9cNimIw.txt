When I was younger and first moved to Arizona, Serrano's on Rural Road became a family tradition to get mexican food. It was basically all I knew till adulthood. If I would have reviewed this place 10 years ago, it would have been 5 stars but now the blinders are off and I have money to try better places. One by one they all seem to dwarf Serrano's in most every way. I feel kinda guilty writing this and hope my family does not read this :) But it has to be said. I would still eat at Serrano's but it doesn't have the same feeling anymore. The Chimichangas are good and their bean dip is awesome. Nothing I have had is gross or anything but its just   basic greasy mexican food. There are better places out there. Once again to any family reading this....I'm sorry :)
