First off I LOVE Mötley Crüe so was hoping Vince's Bar was good.

Stopped in for early dinner and really wish we hadn't.  Had the fish taco appetizer and was pleasantly surprised how big the portion was.  Taste was just ok.  You can't really mess it up.  But later my stomach was paying the price.  

My friend had the taquitos and had the runs all night.  Another friend had the Fried Eggroll appetizer (can't remember what it was called) and it looked good and was told it was decent.

We were pretty much the only ones in there and one of the servers insisted on sweeping up the carpet right next to and under our table.  Wtf? You can't wait until AFTER we leave??

Save your money or ONLY vist during their Happy Hour when Appetizers are 1/2 off.  
Sorry Vince, I still love you though!
