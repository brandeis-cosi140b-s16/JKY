What a disappointment.  We started off with fresh, yet strange tasting guac.  They make it at your table - avocado, lime (not enough), onions, cilantro and dried cranberries.  Yes, dried cranberries.  Sound funny?  Well, let me tell you, it tastes just as funny as it sounds.  Its a very weird sensation to be eating guacamole with chips and chewing on cranberries.   I wanted it to work out, but it just didn't.
I ordered the seafood enchiladas for my entree.  They were so banal that I didn't even go for dessert.  I do have to mention that I tried my husband's duck entree and it was pretty darn good.  But still, that means this place is batting .33 which is not a good record for a moderate-high priced Mexican restaurant.    Also, I would rate this a $$$ and not a $$.
