For a name like camarones (shrimp in Spanish) you would think that the ceviche would be served with some cojones (explertive for strong or brave in Spanish) but instead the katsup flavored pansey shrimp dish fell short at best. I had a three item combo that was slathered with microwaved melted cheese. The chicken taco a chicken filled sopopillo and the adobada beef all tasted of chafer water. The taco and sopopillo chicken were identical and flavorless. The adobado was so broken down that it resembled ground beef. The only salvation to the dish was the delicious tortilla and the table salsa left over from the chips. No wonder this huge beautiful building is empty. The positive was that the wait staff was friendly And very attentive. I wont be wasting another cent in camarones until they get out of the catering business.
