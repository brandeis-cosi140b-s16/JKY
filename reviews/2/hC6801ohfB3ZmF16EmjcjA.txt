This pains me to leave a 2 star review. I was so excited Dan had opened up a new spot and once we heard about it, we placed it on the top of the list for the next time we were in the area. 

We stopped in on a Saturday afternoon after the Melrose neighborhood street fair. The parking lot was full but it looked as though everyone was at the french place next door. Upon entering we were promptly greeted with a very friendly and easy going lady. After scanning the menu I ordered a carne asada burrito and the Mr ordered the shrimp tacos. We sat down and she brought us chips and mentioned the salsa bar. I don't recall if the salsa was good so I won't comment on it. There were maybe 3 or 4 different ones to chose from. The atmosphere was clean, and it had some great local art on the walls. It was dead for a Saturday I thought but ok by me.

Our food came and it wasn't very exciting looking. My burrito was packed with watery bland pico and flavorless mushy carne. The bottom of my tortilla was so soggy I needed to use a fork to eat it. I had to douse it with lime juice and salsa to make it only slightly edible. Mr's shrimp tacos were bland as well. Maybe it was on off day but we were so disappointed. :( I think we'll wait a while before we come back. I do want to give MMT another shot but it won't be for a while.
