Should've read yelp reviews before venturing here. Like one yelper mentioned the place smells funny. Was thinking of walking out but we didn't. My friend ordered the burrito. There was nothing special about it. It was pretty big though. I ordered the carne verde too much verde sauce ~ my pork was swimming in it. It tasted like the bottled verde sauce. Accompanied with Spanish rice and refried beans. Nothing really stood out. I wasn't looking for fine dining. Place is dingy and dirty. Our food came out about 5 seconds after ordering it, ok, I'm exaggerating it was more like 5 mins which made me believe their food was pre-made and probably nuked. Really not worth it and a waste of stomach space.
