It's a love-hate relationship with this place, especially for those who understand how non-existent the late night scene is in northern Phoenix. Our choices are limited so I'm usually stuck with here or Salty's in Glendale, which is just a blast from my high school past that I'd like to ignore. Believe me, the choice makes me want to gauge my eyes out too.

It was packed because of the UFC game when I went and you could hardly get around the sausage fest with everyone awkwardly standing and roaring, let alone try to wave down a bartender to get you a drink. When you did though, I will say that the girls are extremely nice, attentive, and quick. Does it overcome the horror when I see how much it costs for just a couple of drinks? Unfortunately not. Definitely a place where you'll have to get a little skeezy if you want something other than H20. Friends were telling me that it gets better when the music turns because everyone actually starts moving around, but the UFC fight had just barely started and I was dreading standing around in heels in the cold with the outdoor heaters not doing any favors for me. 

As if on cue though, someone from above felt the pain in my calves and SIlva's career died in front of my very eyes. The UFC crowd left and music began. Crowd consists mostly of MILFS and ordinary looking guys who come alone dancing by themselves hoping for something, if anything. Definitely an extremely milder version of Mill with a male to female ratio of 3:1. Good dance music though, played a lot of 2000's hip hop. 

Can't judge on food as I didn't get any, but I'd say that it's worth the extra money and time to go somewhere else or end up awkwardly standing next to a Mexican statue trying to get a drink for the next 15 minutes.
