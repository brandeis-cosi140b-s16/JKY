This was such a terrible restaurant. We walked in and immediately didn't know where we were supposed to sit. When finally someone told us where to sit, we sat down and barely could see our menus. It was so dark in the restaurant. 

The food was not very good. It was definitely over priced. We will not be going back. 

The waitress was very, very nice.
We had no problems with her.
