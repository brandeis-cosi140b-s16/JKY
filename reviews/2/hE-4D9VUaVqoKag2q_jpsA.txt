The food is terrible here. The only good part of our visit was the waitress. Left her a nice tip. When the restaurant ran the charge thru my bank they rounded up and claimed it was an error because my writing was hard to read.  I'll admit the up charge was only .72 cents but It's my money not yours,  the manager didn't seem to get that.  After a week manager finally called back but you could tell she was bothered by the whole issue.  2 stars for the waitress.
