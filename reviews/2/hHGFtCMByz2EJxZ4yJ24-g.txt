This review is a bit late, however still important as I want my disappointed voice heard. 

I was left stunned and in shock when we rolled into the parking lot and noticed it was no longer SuperMex in which we had eaten at religiously over the last 7 years.  We decided to go in and see what the hell had happened. Ok so the staff informed us that Jalisco still has the same Owner and that they only changed the name. They also stated that there were only "minor" "simple" changes made. As Maury stated "THAT WAS A LIE" 

Yeah this was a big let down, I knew there was more than just a name change that had taken place. The d√©cor was different, the menu was different and the complimentary chips and dip was different. This was getting more disappointing by the minute as we dined.

The plates are smaller, the prices have increased, the items that we had enjoyed over the last 7 years were no longer existent. I am disappointed in so many ways that I don't know where to begin. The only thing I know is that I will not be back :(
