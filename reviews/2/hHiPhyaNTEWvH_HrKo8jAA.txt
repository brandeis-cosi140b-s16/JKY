Food is decent but not fantastic. A bit pricey for what you get. They have the worst drive through ever. SO SLOW!!! waited for 10 minutes with only one car in front of me. ridiculous! will not return to this location. There is a filibertos half a block south and  across the street and while it doesn't offer drive through, the service is actually faster and the food is better!
