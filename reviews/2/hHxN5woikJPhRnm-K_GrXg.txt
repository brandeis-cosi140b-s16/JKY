They call themselves "fine dining".  I'm not sure I agree with that.  The atmosphere is dull at best.  We went during lunch and had to wait for a table to be cleared (but the restaurant was not even half occupied).  The guacamole was the best thing we ate, though under seasoned.  In fact, all of the food was extremely under seasoned.  Because it was "fine dining" there was no salt or pepper on the tables.  It was very much needed.The house margarita tasted similar to pine sol.  All in all, not a good experience.  I do not think I will be going back to this place.
