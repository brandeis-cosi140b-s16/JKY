Chorizo and eggs is one of my favorite dishes to order.  At Barrio the eggs were rubbery, the chorizo was overcooked, and lacked any kind of flavor.  This is a hard feat considering that chorizo is usually packed with spices and flavor.  When I eat my chorizo and eggs I like to have the option of tortillas not a piece of burnt toast with "gourmet" spread on it.

The one positive aspect of this establishment is the yummy mango mimosa.  The drink was a perfect balance of mango and champagne.  The mimosa is the reason why this review has two stars.  

Gourmet Mexican food does not mean serving tasteless chorizo and eggs.  Gourmet Mexican food does not mean charging an average of $20 a plate.  This is certainly not the best gourmet Mexican food.  One of the best places to have "gourmet" Mexican food would be in Chicago.  Enough said.
