I think this is where the ASU sorority b!tches go for employment when Christie's Cabaret isn't hiring. 

The service isn't the worst I've had, but they aren't over-the-top friendly either.  The decor and atmosphere is very cool and I loved the vibe but the food tastes like taco bell.  Actually make that Filiberto's (Filisquirtos) because Taco Bell tastes pretty damn good after too many drinks. 

I liked the house margarita a lot and a friend talked me into a watermelon margarita which was pretty good too but it wasn't blended too well (we were a group of 14 on a saturday so maybe they got busy and couldn't blend the margaritas...I don't know).  

I'd go back for the house margaritas and an appetizer (chips and guacamole) but I don't think I'll eat dinner here again. 

Try Barrio Cafe...that place freaking ROCKS!
