I am a huge fan of Chipotle and visit them often. Although I read the reviews on this one I figured it can't be that bad. Well they almost came close to a 1 star review. They greeted me at the line, rushed me to tell them what I wanted (I know what I want to order) let me tell you. black or pinto, what kind of meat, what kind of meat what kind of meat, Hold on let me finish with this part of my bowl first. Then when I get to the meat, it was the smallest portion i have ever had, i told them to double the meat, that gave me a normal serving at a normal chipotle. I want a lot of cheese, i had to tell the young kid 7 times to keep adding. Normally I say it once and it is done. Unlike other chipotle's i have ordered from they didn't tell me the double meat and guac was extra. I knew this but it could be a upset moment for someone who does not know. I am glad I live in CA and have other options. I will not go back to this place again. Food was ok, but steak and rice a little under cooked. I would highly recommend this place gets with the program or new managment. They are doing too much to try and save on food cost.
