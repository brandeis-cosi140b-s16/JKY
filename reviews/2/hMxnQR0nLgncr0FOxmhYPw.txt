So the last time I ate here (albeit the old location on Main Street) was in the late 70s.

I had the green pork chimi today.  Overall it wasn't bad but everything, and I mean everything, lacked seasoning.  As such everything was slightly bland in taste.  Also this is one of those places that puts a quarter head of lettuce on the plate.  Not sure why that happens since I expect few people ever eat it.

As I said above its been more than 35 years since I've been here.  I expect it will be some time before I return.
