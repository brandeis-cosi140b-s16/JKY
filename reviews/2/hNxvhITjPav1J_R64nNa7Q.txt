First time to this restaurant. Not terribly impressed. 

Start with cleanliness. There were flies in the restaurant. The bathroom had not been cleaned. The rest of it looked okay for a small taco shop. There is only fast food restaurant type seating.

Service was good. The woman behind the counter was very good at explaining the food and give me some recommendations. She was courteous and nice.

The food is okay. Price to quantity was pretty good. But I would rather have less quantity and more quality. It was relatively bland food. The salsas were okay but they all kind of taste the same. I spent $13 on chips and two large flower tacos with beans and rice. 

This restaurant was just under okay.
