The beer was cold, that is about the only good thing I could say about this place.  Even just sitting down I was barked at by the bartender and told not to move the stool our from the bar so I could even get in and sit!  I am only 5'5" and the stools are about 4 and a half feet tall, if 3 are pushed together how the #$%@ am I supposed to sit if I don't move one out? Bossing around your customers before they even have their A$$ in the seat is not a good way to start out the relationship.  The encounter ended with the other bartender, who was taking care of us and seemed a little nicer, trying to pass off someone else's check to us.  It was no accident either as he freely told us that he gave our check to the guy who had been next to me and that this one was basically the same thing (we had 4 beers and this was a couple of drinks and some food).  Having worked in bars and restaurants for some time I knew this was totally shady and instead he give me one for what I had had.  Lo and behold when he did as asked the check was $3-$4 cheaper than the one he was trying to get me to cover.  I can guarantee you this money would have been more likely to end up in the bartenders pockets and not the till had I just complied and paid it.  And for the record, 4 Sam Adams drafts should not total $38 before the tip unless your in an NYC club or something of the like!  Overall a very underwhelming experience!
