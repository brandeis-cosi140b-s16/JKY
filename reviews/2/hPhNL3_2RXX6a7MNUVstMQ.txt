I've eaten at the 19th and Greenway (original) location for years. Loved their Pollo Diablo and jerk-fried rice. However, several months ago I ordered a half dozen of their snickerdoodle cookies and both my wife and I got severe food poisoning from them which knocked us out for the entire weekend. I give them two stars because of the fact that they're unique and I enjoyed their food for a long time with no problems, but places like this only get one chance with me and I will never eat there again. In addition, they raised their prices to over $10 per combo plate when you get a drink, and that's on the pricey side for what you get. Not worth any more than about $6. Summary - this place is off the table for me, but if you're willing to risk food poisoning and you like swiftly-prepared spicy food, give it a shot. Guy Fieri seemed to like it (it was reviewed on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives not too long ago). Definitely a dive IMO - and I second a previous reviewer's comment - "are we in a cafeteria?"
