The service has great... the food, not so much! The menu is conceptually well written and the dishes are executed okay but there is no finish to them! My party of 15 all felt that the final seasoning was lacking. Honestly the food was bland. Our server was awesome and did a great job of selling the menu to us but it was no where near the quality of food one comes to expect in Las Vegas. I felt the food was dumbed down for the masses. It was honestly disappointing. Being from southern California one can find better fair at albertos!
