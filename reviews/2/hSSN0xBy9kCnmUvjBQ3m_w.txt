I remember being completely underwhelmed by this place.  You're taking two cuisines that should be tasty,  and what I ended up with in my plate lacked any flavor. The  tacos were bland and overpriced, the jerk chicken was spicy without any flavor, and the side of mango it came with was a joke,  as it was tiny and looked like the garnish of a cocktail.  The coconut rice was even bland. 

Service was also bad. Not returning.
