Not a fan.  I prefer ground beef versus shredded beef tacos, but when I asked if that was possible, the waiter told me there would be a $4 upcharge.  Really?  My date ordered a margarita which was watered down, and the waiter didn't really seem too enthusiastic about making us feel welcome.  I will say that the portions were quite large (I couldn't finish mine) but the food was just "ok".
