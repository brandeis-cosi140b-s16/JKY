overpriced.
paying for the experience and the nice wait staff.

$28/lb of shrimp fajitas. nice but more than we would like to spend.
extra tortillas. lots of grilled onions. mild sauce.

we saw lots of little kids, surprised families could afford it, suspect it is a very special outing for most people so economy is not the issue.

good smells 
comfortable surroundings
very attentive staff.
probably desires a 3 star but $20+ per person bugs me.
