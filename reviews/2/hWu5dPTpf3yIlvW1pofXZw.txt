Sat down, asked for the cheese dip for our chips, got the dip and waited for the chips.  By the time they got to our table, the cheese developed a skin.  We pushed the skin around and ate the cheese and chips.  Then we ordered our food, one ask for corn tortilla and one wanted flour.  We got our food but no tortillas.  We flagged a waitress and asked for them.  They came out about five minutes after our food.  In the middle of eating the waitress asked if we needed anything, we asked for more sweet tea, well you guessed it.  She came by with the bill and said she would get us more tea, we declined.  We left her a $1.00 tip with a note stating that the service was poor.  I don't know about other servers but the one we had should find another job cause she doesn't know how to do this one.  We will go to another Mexican restaurant from now on, even though this one is closest to our home.
Service IS just as important as the quality of the food!
