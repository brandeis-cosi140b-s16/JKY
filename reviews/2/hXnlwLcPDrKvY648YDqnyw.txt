I was really excited to try this place considering all the great reviews I read on Yelp.  I did find that my order was good enough to eat on an empty stomach, however, it was quite disappointing.
I ordered the machaca burrito and the traditional fry bread with honey and powdered sugar-to go.  I had not realized that my 'packed to go meal'  was missing plastic-ware, napkins, and hot sauce/salsa until I sat down to actually eat it.  
That was the first bummer.
I started with the burrito and it was like eating a cheese and onion burrito, I could not taste any machaca until I reached the middle of the burrito! It was horrible. 
I gave up at the point, because I was already full from all of the tortilla, cheese, and onion...it came with beans, but no salsa.  
I then ate one quarter of the fry bread, which was great to see that they actually prepare it for you, makes it so much easier to eat in quarters.  The fry bread was  good, it was very thick so I couldn't taste much of the honey or the sugar.  I guess I am used to fry bread being more airy, light, and fluffy vs this dense.
Also, I guess I prefer my machaca burrito to actually have some machaca entirely throughout the burro. 
I would eat here again if I were hungry for something different, but I would stick with the fry bread.

The service was great, the man who helped me was very communicative and appeared to be genuinely jovial, which is always great to work with these types of owners/employees.
