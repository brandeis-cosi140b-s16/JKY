It hurts me to have to give Pancho's a mere 2 stars, because I used to go here almost every weekend back in 94 as a kid. Many memories. I can't say I remember much about the food, I ate it with no complains because I was just a kid and didn't know any better, but I've been back there a few times since then including a couple months ago. This time the food was less than palatable. Some of the food, like the chimichanga and the flautas, kinda tasted like they had been fried in rancid oil, and I am prone to believe so because I developed a bit of a stomach ache toward the end of the meal. Also, the width of the tamales were straight up laughable: the width of an index finger. On the plus side, the place is like a time machine; walk in and you'll think O.J. is on the run in his white Ford Bronco again, hurry and turn on the news, because its 1994 all over again! Not a thing has changed; same decor, including the paintings of sombrero totting men on the walls as you walk in, except for the fact that these paintings now have a protective plastic or glass cover. I like the fact that it hasn't changed. Brings back more vivid memories; going here on the weekend with my mom and her then Cuban boyfriend, and getting scolded by her to not eat so many darn churros, walking out with a Pancho's balloon in one hand and an ice cream cone for the road in the other hand, standing in front of one of the statues against the wall in the parking lot and looking up and snickering because someone stuck gum in one of his nostrils and it looks like snot. I would return here believe it or not, just for the memories it brings back, but I wouldn't return for a couple of years when maybe the food has changed for the better. Hopefully.
