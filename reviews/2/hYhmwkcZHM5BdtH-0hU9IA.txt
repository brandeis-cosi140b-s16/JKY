This place is so nicely decorated. If you're going for old Mexican style decor and not for taste in food you're in the right place. 
Chips and salsa were okay. Not the greatest! And so goes for the rest of their food. I found it to be bland and the only other taste was overly salty meat. 
It's a shame, cute atmosphere terribly expensive food! 
They need to hire people that can cook. Hopefully they will get it together. 
Won't be returning for now until I hear more reviews on food improvement. 
Sorry Panchos, you gave us nothing but a punch in the stomach.
