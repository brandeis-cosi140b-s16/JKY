Let down, especially when compared to another Mexican restaurant real close by.  

Started with a shrimp cocktail.  It was very boring, shrimp with tomato juice, a scant amount of cucumbers and one small piece of avocado.  There was very little flavor to it.  The steak fajitas tasted ok.  The steak was tender, a little on the sweet side, but it was swimming in grease.  They were served with 2 small tortillas, we had to ask for more. 

The preperadas were a major disappointment, I drove across town to get a good preperada.  It just tasted like a little tomato juice with beer.  It did not even have a lime with it.  

The service was ok.  I was super irritated when a lady singing and playing the guitar on the other side of the restaurant  came over and demanded a tip.  At first I thought she was asking if we wanted her to play for us, so I said "no thanks."  Then she put her hand out and demanded a tip.  She repeated herself 10 times.  I didn't come here to hear her play an out of tune guitar, I simply came here to have a nice lunch. 

Too many other options for good Mexican food around.
