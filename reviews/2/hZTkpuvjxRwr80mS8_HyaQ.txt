Bookmarked this place after seeing their PAMAZO TORTA listed in an issue of LV Weekly, as one of the Top 10 Mexican Meals of the city. I don't remember the ranking, but the description was enough to motivate me to seek this place out.

I ordered the torta and a mushroom quesadilla, based on another review.
The quesadilla is damn delicious when you actually get something in your bite that isn't just cheese. Wish the mushrooms were more plentiful, or more evenly distributed, because once you get that perfect bite, there's no going back.

But back to the torta that originally brought me in. To say I was underwhelmed is an understatement. Even digging in right after I received my order, the bread was soggy with grease to the point that it was difficult to eat. I know better than to expect something healthy when I eat Mexican, but this was overkill. What was most disappointing was the flavor: there really wasn't any. I could tell I was eating potatoes, and in addition to the grease, I stumbled upon some crumbles that let me know my meal contained chorizo, but nothing had flavor.  I added salt, I added salsa, but there was no perking up this dish. 

I don't know how this torta made anyone's list of great foods, or if I simply received something other than what they usually serve- but this is not something I'd care to eat again.
