Overrated!! Carne asada is weak, they forgot to put their so called charred tomato salsa on our carne asada tacos?..Shrimp tacos are good, only one shrimp under all the toppings..Loud environment in the dining room and very uncomfortable chairs. The servers seemed nervous and one did crash a plate of food onto a table of people sitting a few feet away from us..Too much hype from locals who have not experienced real authentic eats in larger cities across the US and outside..
