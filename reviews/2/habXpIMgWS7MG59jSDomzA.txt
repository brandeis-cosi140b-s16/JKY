Ok let me try this again. This is no longer the same Roberto's that was featured on Food Network. It is def under new management and/or ownership. If you go to robertosaz.com it only has the Anthem location listed and that actually explains everything to me. The staff here is not friendly and there is no one from the old crew here anymore its been like this for awhile now maybe almost a year. I kept coming back thinking that maybe with the changes eventually stuff would work itself out and get back to normal. That didnt happen here and I gave the place many many chances. It really makes me sad after going here for like a decade knowing it wasn't the same I still kept coming back here. You know what they say old habits die hard!?! They really do I was like a kid that kept going back to that mean dog and pulling its tail over and over again while ending up bit every damn time! 

This was the last straw for me last night. I always order the same thing here...again creature of habit. They have tried this before but they usually work with me this time the cashier tried to nickel and dime me where I ended up with a $10 burrito!! Are you fucking kidding me here!?!?! The cashier had no care what so ever on what I had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced. I'm looking for a new place now I learned my lesson and wont waste any more time on this place getting mediocre food!
