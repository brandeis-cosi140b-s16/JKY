Stopped by today and picked up a fish and chicken taco. The fish taco was good, but the chicken taco was really sloppy. Upon unwrapping the foil, I noticed the avocado slices were all halfway inside the taco and the other halves were squished in the foil. The guy that helped me was really nice and friendly and very helpful. I've been to other Rubio's in Chandler and Ahwatukee and the food presentation/condition has always been consistently good and never that messy. Could have been a bad service day and might stop again if in the area.
