Blah. I did not have high hopes going into the meal, and I still was disappointed with my food. But let's start with what's good. Everyone at my table thought the black beans were tasty, and my mom loved her blue corn bread and jerk chicken taco. We also thought the carnitas weren't too bad, but it was more like dried out pulled pork. My dad thought his fajitas were pretty good. My husband thought his fajita burrito was decent but it could have used some more texture. Now for the bad. The rice was god awful. I swear it's from and box, and it was sooooo dry. No one ate the rice at our table. Why would someone make that rice, and think, "yes, this is what I want to serve in my restaurant." Secondly, my "garden vegetable" enchilada was a joke and just terrible. The vegetables were olives (garden???) and diced raw bell peppers. There was nothing else in the enchilada; the veggies weren't even seasoned or cooked. I think they are garnish vegetables. Also, the verde sauce on both the enchilada and my husband's burrito disappeared. And my husband paid $1.50 to have that sauce on his burrito, and you wouldn't even have known it was there. Everything, except the rice, majorly lacked seasoning. This is Tex Mex! It should be flavorful! $4 for chips and salsa?!?!? What the what?! The salsa wasn't even that good, and they didn't even have any hot salsa option. We all liked the chips and the guac though.  The decor was nice, but the bar area where we sat was really loud. Finally, when I pay $8.50 for a margarita, I want it in a margarita glass. Not a pint glass! We will not be back.
