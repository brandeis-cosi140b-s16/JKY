The first thing that comes to my mind when writing this review is unmemorable.

After walking in, I was skeptical about eating here because it smelled of grease and many of the tables were unclean. 

I ordered the guacamole with chips to start and the carne tacos with rice and beans. The guacamole was bland and chips slightly greasy. I was not impressed with the corn tortillas because they were store bought and cold. Carne asada meat was tough and flavor was average. The rice did not taste better than a Mexican rice mix from the store. Beans tasted freshly made and were piping hot. 

The service was also slow because there was one waitress taking orders, bringing out the food, and busing tables. 

I don't see any need to go back to Desnudo because the tortillas are not home made and the restaurant felt unclean.
