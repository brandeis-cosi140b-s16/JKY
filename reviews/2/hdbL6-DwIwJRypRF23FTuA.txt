Well, when I went into this place I did not know what to expect... I walked in and holy cow this place was so not mexican food. I should have expected not authentic duh... But nope. This place is like a fast food version of taco bell hahaha, or a fast food version of Baja Fresh. I ordered a burrito the meat was the only real good part of it. The rice and beans were dull to say the most. Plenty of parking, but the place inside is clean, clean bathroom, but boring colors inside. Weird because it has a lot more of these little stands everywhere here. I would recommend this place to anyone who wants to break into Mexican food and then go to little mexican places after this then to the big boys.
