For being in the nicer part of town this place was kind of dumpy. I happened to spot it while on the look out for a decent place to grab a quick bite to eat during my lunch hour. It's actually located in the Albertson's shopping center.

When I went in the place looked disheveled. The salsa bar had not been wiped down, there was drippings everywhere. It looked as though the dining area had not been wiped down either. 

Next, I wanted to keep on their "value menu" so I ordered a taco al carbon, which they are pretty good. I also ordered the value menu side salad. I specifically said "side salad", which to me would indicate the fact I want a SIDE SALAD. Well, I didn't get a side salad, the cashier charged me for the salad that is $3.49. I didn't realize it until I sat down and looked at my receipt. But by this time I was just like, "Eff it, I'll eat a bigger salad". Nothing wrong with more veggies in my opinion.

Food - eeehhh. The salad was not cold like a salad should be. It was kind of strange temperature-wise, like maybe the salad had been siting out and someone forgot to put it back into cool-storage. Or maybe they're running their temps for the salad prep station too high. Either way, it was not good.

I'd say be wary of the salad items here... something fishy is going on...
