I guess you'd like this place, if you have been eating here since you were a child or have never had legitimate mexican food... We have both eaten in once and ordered take out food. Both times the food was "eh okay", service has been fine and price point is appropriate. Really not a fan of the salsa, but it seems to be an "Arizona" thing. We moved here from Texas so maybe its just preference. 

My biggest complaint is the place is SOOO DIRTY! I really think that the carpets, booths, pictures on the walls, everything, has been in place since the late 70's. I understand the economy and that shutting down the place for a week or two to replace everything would have a tremendous financial impact on the staff, but come on! An overnight deep clean that included the walls and carpets would seriously do this place some good! I can't even imagine, nor do I want to, what the kitchen must look like. Take the 1977 little league boy's team pictures down, scrub it all, and if you must, put it back up. Its so dimly lit in there, I imagine it looks ten times worse in the light...
