My son and I went in tonight for dinner. Worst service ever. The first two girls pushed us along, my son was trying to ask her a question she just blew him off. He is eight years old. Not like he is a toddler running amuck. He order a kids # 4 which is a build your own tacos. We under stand that it only came with two sides. When he asked if he could have some lettuce she told him NO. That it would be an extra charge for for that. Are you kidding me for lettuce on a kids taco. I couldn't believe it. Especially after I just paid 2.00 for a skimpy side of guacamole for his taco. something restaurants should make a point of to their employees is that customers only go out maybe once a month or twice now, not like 5 years ago when it was 3 times so when it comes to making a choice where to go before they leave the house they think hmm..well last time I went there this or that happened, something as simple as they didn't even say goodbye or thank us as we were leaving and we tipped. Just some lettuce for thought chipotle.
