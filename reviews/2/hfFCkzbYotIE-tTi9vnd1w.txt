So the first time we came here, service was spot on. Now today our second time to be here... service was just horrible! Server just flat out forgot our table, we have to ask for refills, food came out ten years after we got full with the nachos and salsa, ask for lime 3 times and forgot the 4th time, he even forgot what we ordered and he had to come to our table to ask what we had?! Seriously?! Food was OK not great although their garlic parmesan fries was unexpectedly good. I probably would come back but not for a long time.
