* sigh*

I don't understand how it's possible for service to be this bad!? Every time. It never fails. When coming to this location you have to be prepared for either A. Waiting a ridiculous amount of time for your food or for drive-thru line to move or B. expect your order to be incorrect. These people have selective hearing or they just don't care. Very annoying!
