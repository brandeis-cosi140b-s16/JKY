I came in today purely because of location and proximity to other errands I had to run. When I walked in I was immediately and warmly greeted by a hostess who's name tag read April. I said hello back and let her know that I was just killing time while new tires were being put on my vehicle next door. She said great come on in and let's get you seated. She sat me, handed me my menu with a smile and said enjoy your meal. A++ for her, she was terrific. Moments later my server came and warmly greeted me too. The receipt says her name is Kelsey. I explained to her that I just wanted something small to pass the time. She was very knowledgeable about the menu and very helpful in helping me narrow my decision. Although I didn't voice my dissatisfaction with my meal she was very attentive to my needs throughout my dining experience. A++ for her too. What wasn't so good was the actual food itself. I ordered the beef taquitos. The shells were stale and chewy, not crispy and crunchy. Just awful. The beef wasn't any better as it was dry and lacked flavor. On the bright side the guacamole was decent. Actually it was the only thing that kept me from sending the dish back. So I asked for a side of sour cream and drizzled on some salsa from the complimentary chips & salsa. I made it work, but I was not really happy at all. So a bit later I get the call saying my truck is ready, I get my bill and I was shocked to see that the tiny ramakin of sour cream cost $2.00. Now it's as if they are trying to upset me on purpose. $2.00 for that little thing is ridiculous. 
Overall my service and hospitality was great - it's the only reason I'm giving two stars, but the food and certain price points leave a lot to be desired. I may or may not be back but I certainly won't be making it a destination place or referring friends.
