This review is on the overall experience at the restaurant.

Hole in the wall, strip mall location. This not necessarily bad, I've had some good food in these type of locations.

I had a chili relleno, it was medium size for a relleno, the sauce wasn't bad, beans and rice average, all in all, average, I've had worse, I've had better.

If was it based just on the food, I may have given 3 stars, but they had one customer in there, I assume a tweeker, from the way she was acting. Making noise, trying to draw attention to herself, obvious not enough attention as a child. The guy she was with was playing a game on his phone, he was quiet, she was screeching every time he played. The other people in the place were also tired of her dramatics. I reached the point where I went back up to the counter and changed my order to togo and explained to the lady working there why. While I was waiting, the noisy girl finally left, everyone was happy, when she left, we even discussed it. I changed my order back to dine-in. When you have someone in your business causing this much of a disturbance, you ask them to quiet down or leave, they didn't.

So the rating is 3 for food, 1 for atmosphere, 2 overall seems about right. I won't be back, because I like to eat in peaceful atmosphere, without druggies, you never know what they're going to do.
