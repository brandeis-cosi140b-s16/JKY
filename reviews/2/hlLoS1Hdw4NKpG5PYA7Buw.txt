To set the record straight, the service here was great.  The food...not so much.

Started off with some chips and salsa...pretty standard.  Had two different types of salsas...one hot and one mild.  Had two carnitas tacos, which came with rices and beans.  The rice and beans were good...beans were pretty rich.  The carnitas were pretty dry, but the worst part was the tacos were topped with this even more dry cabbage, onion, cilantro mixture.  I had to add a lot of salsa to make the tacos interesting.  I also tried the shrimp burro...aka a big shrimp burrito.  This actually wasnt that bad...pretty simple with some nice grilled shrimp and fajita-esque veggies.  The last thing I tried was the beef enchiladas.  The beef seemed to be machaca and it was tender.  The problem with the dish was that the enchilada sauce was extremely rich...it tasted like a mixture between velveeta cheese and hormel chili, which is one of my favorite tailgating foods...not my favorite enchilada topping.  

With the number of mexican restaurants in scottsdale and phoenix...there is no need for me to come back here.
