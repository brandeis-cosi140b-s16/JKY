Yesterday was the third time I've eaten here. It was also the third time we have had miserable service experience here.

The food was good. The server was nice and terrible at serving. A member of our party was sampling the beers in order to select one to compliment her meal. Once our friend had decided which she wanted it was too late as the server never came back to our table. I had to track her down to pay for our bill. The server forgot other items we requested as well.

Ironically we received a survey ticket with our bill and the survey website states that they are no longer taking surveys. 

The food was good. With so many great places to get tacos Taco Guild is not worth the frustration of dealing with the poor service.
