Good value for fresh food fast and cheap however poor customer service is why I will only give this restaurant 2 stars. Line staff was extremely rude and rushed order. I eat at other locations and knew exactly what I wanted and I still felt rushed!!! Also staff tried to give me a dime size portion of meat on a taco order. When I asked for a more adequate serving I received a serving of attitude instead!
