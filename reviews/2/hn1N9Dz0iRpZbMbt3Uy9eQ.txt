Seeing the word "hippies" in the restaurant name had me stoked, as them tree-huggin hippie types got to have some vegetarian food, right? Yep.

I walked up to the lil window and asked about the veggie options, the guy behind the counter informed me that they have a cactus burrito and that it was one of his favorites. Score! Or so I thought...

Upon receiving the large, heavily stuffed burrito, I bit in with high hopes. Those hopes quickly dissipated as I found that the innards of the burrito were primarly COLD. The cactus pieces were cold, the cheese wasn't melted at all. The only thing that had a bit of warmth were the beans, which weren't even hot, they were luke warm.

Sorry guys, but a cold burrito isn't going to cut it. Make that cactus, beans and rice HOT in your burritos if you want some customers. Melt the friggin cheese in there, don't leave it ice cold.
