It's one of those places that can either be amazing or "Meh. I've experienced better" They didn't understand that I didn't want corn in my rice (no big deal) the chips were hard and dry like they were from Costco (you could still eat them, and we did) the food was "ok" and inexpensive. Service was adequate.
