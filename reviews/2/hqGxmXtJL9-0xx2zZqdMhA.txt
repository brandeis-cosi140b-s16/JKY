I've been to Don Pedro several times for lunch and dinner.  
I've never been too impressed by their food.  
The chips and salsa are not great.  Just watery salsa without much flavor.  To me, the salsa is an indication of how much effort the place puts into their food.  Not much effort at Don Pedro.  
As someone who loves mexican food and has experienced the real thing in Mexico several times, this place does not even compare.  
If you want watered down salsa and so-so burritos and tacos, then this is your place.  
If you want some real, authentic, delicious mexican food, then keep looking.
