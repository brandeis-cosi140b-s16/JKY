This place has the weirdest fish tacos I've ever had... they were good.

The grilled cod was ground up and mixed with cilantro and green onions (kind of like taco meat). It was well spiced and pretty good.

Other than that, the most remarkable thing about this place is how long it has survived downtown. It's fine in a pinch, but definitely not a destination.
