I don't know what happened, this place was good, but this last visit was horrible!!
We did come here late in the evening, but if a facility is open until a certain time, don't get upset when paying customers come later. 

Our waitress, Danielle E (what was on the receipt) was CLEARLY unhappy to help us. 
First: we waited for quite some time to even be seated and when we found our booth-she never even introduced herself. 
Second: as soon as we sat down, she wanted our orders, and seemed annoyed that we didn't know what we wanted. There was no mistaking her horrible attitude! 

Pair food being bland, bare, and not what we have had before with another male employee walking around with a cigarette behind his ear, and we probably won't be stopping here again. 

I gave it two stars for being open until 11, but if you plan on eating here, be sure you aren't too late!
