Really slow at the bar for happy hour.  Salsa and chips is great but I hate to say the only thing I liked. Quest dip had weird after taste not terrible. The mini tacos soggy broke when I picked them up. The chicken had a terrible flavor as did the beef. Almost one hour for appetizers now that is what I call slow service
