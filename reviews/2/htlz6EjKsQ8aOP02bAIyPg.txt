Well, this place went downhill prettttttty fast. Extracting the information out of our waitress made me feel like a CIA agent ready to water board somebody if they don't disclose what flippin flavors of margarita they offer, but don't print on the regular menu, and no longer have a drink menu....  After a long process of slowly piecing information from her I ordered the Cadillac margarita on the rocks which should be renamed salt water. Beyond that the chips were stale and flavorless, the salsa was watery and gross, the mini sampler appetizer featured an array of frozen mexican food from your local Costco microwaved especially for you. The enchiladas did not justify the clogged artery so I only ate about half of the first one. The server was nice and the guy refilling the water and chips was on the ball...except when he refilled friends root beer with pepsi.
