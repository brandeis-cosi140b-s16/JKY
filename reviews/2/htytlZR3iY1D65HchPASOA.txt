WHY does Anthem have such a terrible food scene?! I've been here twice. The first time was alright. Our food took forever. The servers are a  "little rough" around the edges, but friendly. The food is overpriced, but the thing I found the most disturbing, was while we're in family friendly Anthem, this place plays rock music which is fine, but it is not censored. I'm sitting there listening to f***k over and over again during multiple songs.
