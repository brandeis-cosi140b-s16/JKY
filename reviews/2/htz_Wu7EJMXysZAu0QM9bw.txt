I'll be honest and say that I went b/c I was on the hunt for a good margarita. I've had margaritas at all the nearby mexican food places (Manuel's, Chili's, Chipotle) and I wanted to give the Raul & Theresa's new location a try. The only one I saw on the menu was only $5 so I didn't have high hopes for it. It was a mix - which I think is LAME for a mexican restaurant - and not a very good mix at that.  Maybe there is a better one (top shelf?) available, I don't know but I couldn't even finish it. I had a burro and the meat inside was good but it wasn't anything special. It's called a restaurant, but I felt like it was only slightly better than any of the other fast food mexican options around. I'll go back to Chipotle next time. Their margaritas are excellent and less than five bucks.
