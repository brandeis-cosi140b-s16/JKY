I love Chipotle. I always order the same thing (carnitas burrito, extra rice, corn salsa, sour cream, etc) and I always expect the quality to be the same wherever I go. So, I find myself strapped for cash my last day in Vegas after taking some big losses at the blackjack tables, and lo and behold, the neon flashing sign catches my eye so I dash right in!

Wow, this place was HOT. No AC on whatsoever, and it did not make for a pleasant dining experience in 105 degree heat.  Let me say that eating a burrito with hot salsa is probably not the best thing to eat in these conditions, and that was one of the reasons I did not enjoy my burrito. The tortilla fell apart right in my hands, causing me to dump out my contents and making my own burrito bowl.  The rice was also mushy, and the meat was tasteless. 

This is probably the worst Chipotle I've ever been to. If I find myself starving on the Strip again, I will probably not come here.
