I really enjoy the food here, isn't the best but pretty good. I ordered the shredded beef tacos and they were not greasy like most places. The rice needs a little more flavor, but beans were good. The only thing that shocked me was they charged for the chips and salsa, I mean isn't that a law to always provide chips and salsa at a Mexican restaurant?!! Either way the salsa is good, not to hot and full of flavor!! 

It's a cute establishment and have friendly servers. I did notice the service was a little slow though, it wasn't busy at all so no excuse.
