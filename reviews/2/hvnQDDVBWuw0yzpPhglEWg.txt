I have been eating at On The Border for many years.  Although they keep trying to change up the menu, I liked the food 15 years ago (although the salsa and chips are still some of the best).  On our visit, our poor server had been on duty for about 10 hours and was taking care of one half of the restaurant.  I felt so badly for him I left a good tip despite s**t service.  Probably won't return anytime soon.  Prices too high, service too low.
