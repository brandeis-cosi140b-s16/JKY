Guacamole: Avocado was diced rather than mashed. I could understand if this was a California fusion type of restaurant but it's MEXICAN, can I get some authentic guac? 

Service was OK. Nothing to rave about. 

My son and I shared the Flautas & Chimichangas. I wish there was more meat than wrap on the Chimichangas. The wrap was so thick that it didn't cook all the way through and became uber chewy and to top it off it was GREASY. I don't really know anyone that likes to have to tilt their plate so to gather the grease on one side so not to make my food soggy... Anyone out there? 

My husband enjoyed his Fajitas and even mentioned that the price was pretty good considering what the norm for the dish is. 

Going to Roberto's is much more satisfying to me if i want some real Mexican Food... I'm from SoCal and I've been to Mexico so I pretty much have a standard and they didn't really meet them.
