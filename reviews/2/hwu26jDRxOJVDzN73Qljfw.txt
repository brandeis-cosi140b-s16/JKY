As promised, I came back for those delicious tacos!!!! And this time it was disappointing. I went for lunch. We must be the only customers to begin with. 2 people came when we were about to leave. So they were slow. The taco came looking the same sumptuous kind!! But the corn tortillas were hard and stale. That made the taco quite tasteless. I had pick apart so I can eat it with a fork. Not so good experience. Hope the owners realize, customers won't return if they serve this kinda food
