Only giving this two-stars because of the service.  Everyone from the bartenders to the food runners were very nice.  

But... Oh my this place sucks.  Short Story: The food is terrible. 

Longer Story:
The music makes you think they fancy themselves a nightclub, at 2:00am, on a Saturday.  Even though it's a Tuesday.  And empty.  And 10:00pm.

The margaritas were 2-for-1 (cool) and had so much 'sour' in the mix that I had heartburn until the next morning (super not cool).  I've never had that happen, and I've had a lot of margaritas in my life.

The tacos were 1/2 off (cool) and tasted so terrible I couldn't finish one (not cool).  The meat was slow cooked in something that I suppose someone likes as it made it to the menu, after a major/costly restaurant build.  But the thought of having another one already makes me ill.  The Caesar salad that I ordered as a replacement was just as bad, which I don't know how it's possible.  Except too much anchovy in the dressing?  The dressing was even on the side and I couldn't eat half of the salad.  And they insist on making their chips "fancy" by putting WAY too much seasoned salt/whatever.  Oh, and the guacamole was garnished with pomegranate seeds.  Fancy.

Bottom line, no reason to go here.  Unless you have the need to ride a mechanical bull?

I really hope those nice bartenders get good jobs.  Can't imagine Chayo can employ them too much longer.
