This restaurant keeps you loaded with good chips & salsa. Guacamole is also good. The rest of the restaurant experience is horrible. Took a while for us to be noticed just to be seated, then took almost 30 minutes to place our order. The restaurant wasn't even full. Only 2 other tables when we walked in. Service was not attentive in the least. The food was below average. Soft drinks were flat. If we lived in the area, we wouldn't go back.
