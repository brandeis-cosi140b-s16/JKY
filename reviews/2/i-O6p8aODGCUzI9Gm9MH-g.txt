This location consistently has the LONGEST lines of all time. One night my husband and I stopped in just for a carmel apple empenada after 8pm and we waited over 20 minutes! The staff came out and offered us a free drink, but this hasn't been the only time we've had to wait. I also don't like that you can only order taco bell items from their drive thru. The drive through is consistently long and frequently blocks parking in the area as well. Overall, if you have to get something fast, try Subway or McDonalds in the same area. The chances of you getting in and out of her in less than 15+ minutes is highly unlikely.
