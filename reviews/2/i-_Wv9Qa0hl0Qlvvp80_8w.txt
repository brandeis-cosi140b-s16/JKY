Why do I even bother with this place?  The guacamole fresco.  It's awesome.  A whole avocado mashed with cilantro, onion and jalapeno before your very eyes.  Unfortunately there's nothing really worth putting it on.  They're stingy with the chips, and I prefer thinner; I've already had bad experiences with both their pork and their black-and-gold enchiladas; and now I have experienced their undercooked quesadilla with a sliver (2 millimeters?) of cheese between the layers.  Maybe a nice margarita on the rocks would help?  Not unless you like Triple Sec and Kool Aid.  Next time I'll just bring a bag of Tostitos.
