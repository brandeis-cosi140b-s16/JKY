We only stopped in for a drink but the margaritas had to be the worst I've ever had. I honestly don't think there was any alcohol in it at all it or it was completely watered down. The chips and salsa were very good. The bartenders weren't the mist friendly but they weren't the worst. I probably wouldn't ever go here again.
