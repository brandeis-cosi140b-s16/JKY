Was not impressed with the food. Got the combo platter with a chile rellano (good but tough), pork tamale (dry and super doughy, tasted like it has sat on the back of a semi for a month) and a shredded beef enchilada which was par at best. Refried beans had a weird film over them, possibly been sitting in the pot all day. Friend ordered the Shrimp Fajitas and had to return it. The shrimps were burnt beyond recognition and the whole skillet platter had about an inch of oil floating on the bottom. The best part of the meal was the free chips & salsa. Service from our waitress was poor but the soda & chip guy kept our beverages & chips full and they never went empty, saving this from a 1 star rating. Ya!!! for the low man on the totem pole, the chip & drink guy.
