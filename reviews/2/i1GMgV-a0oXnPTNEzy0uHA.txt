This is a branded as Central American restaurant, and not even a good one at that. If you are looking for a Mexican Restaurant and come here, you will not leave happy.

I have visited a few Central American countries, but lived in Honduras. So with my Honduran adapted taste buds, I was not impressed. Perhaps it is more Nicaraguan? I couldn't figure it out, the menu is sectioned out by country, with a bit of overlap. Best advise? If you are looking for pupusas, head to an El Salvadoran restaurant. Baleada? Head to a Honduran- and so on. This might be your restaurant if you are looking for Nicaraguan food, but I am not 100% on that.
