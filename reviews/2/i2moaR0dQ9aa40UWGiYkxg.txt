The restaurant itself was pretty empty, which isn't  a good sign. 

We ask the server about getting some guac. No guacamole. Wait, what?! How is that possible? We asked our server and he said that they just got a truck in. Um, okay. Not sure what that means, but if you guys just got a "truck in" wouldn't avocados but on said truck? So the server said they did have avocados but no guac, again, how is that possible? How long does it take to make guacamole? In the past, I've had it made fresh, table-side (at a different restaurant) and it took all of 2-3 minutes. 

Just skip this place, not worth it.
