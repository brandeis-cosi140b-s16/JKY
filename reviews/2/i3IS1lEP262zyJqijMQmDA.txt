Frijoles and Frescas is around the corner from my place, and I've been wanting to try it for a while now. 

The other day, my husband and I decided to head over for lunch.

The restaurant itself, is open, and clean.  It has a kind of fast-ish food feel (like Fatburger.  Technically fast food, but not like McDonald's fast.), and a decent menu.

We ordered:  veggie nachos, a chicken burrito, and a shrimp taco.

The nachos were ok.  The toppings were put on in sections...sour cream on one side, salsa/veg on the other, so that was weird...I had to mix my own nachos.  They tasted ok, but I can get better nachos at Del Taco, and they're cheaper. 

My fella had the burrito and shrimp taco, and while he said they were ok...he said they both were WAY too spicy.  This is saying something, coming from him, because he loves spicy food.  

I'm glad we tried it, but we probably won't be back.
