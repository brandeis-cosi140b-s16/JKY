i just went here for drinks and salsa and chips... so i can only comment on that.  

maybe the food is wonderful.  i can't say.

the drinks were... okay.  weak, but okay.  they tasted alright, but i felt like the margarita choices were slim.... and kinda strange.  red pepper?  pumpkin?  maybe they were trying too hard to be out of the box.  a little too hard.  it's okay to be different, but maybe try to be something i'd still like to ingest.  jalepeno and pineapple is not something that sounds appetizing in a margarita.  ever.

i got a pumpkin margarita.  thought i'd swing for the fences and try something different.  it didn't taste bad, but i'd never order it again.  

the chips and salsa do not come to your table standard either.  you have to order it.  the salsa is warm.  like heated up.  not spicy, but actually hot, temperature wise.  this was the first time i've encountered hot salsa.  i didn't prefer it this way.  

the dining area is small, but the atmosphere is nice.  it's super dark in there, though.  the bar is nice looking and there is a hell of a lot of tequila, so if that's your jam.   you'll have a lot to pick from.  it's trying to be upscale.  it's bordering on pretentious.  

will i be back?  probably not.  i prefer to drink my tequila in less refined establishments where i can get drunk, possibly eat a worm.  this will not be that place.  i'm absolutely sure of it.
