They use to be very delicious. Back when they were Casa de Enchiladas and then a chef that used to work at Hawthorne pizza bought it out. It change to Thee Amigos and I believe they kept the same cook. There have been on a few occasions when I would eat their Enchiladas Verde and asada tacos. It was amazinggg. This was when they use to include a grilled mexican onion with it. On a few ocassions the rice was a little hard however I overlooked it because their salsa verde was amazing. However,  the past few occasions their steak meat just tasted so bland. And I am reallyyyyyyyy hoping the owners of this establishment is reading this so they can improve . Which is for them to please cook their meat how it was before in beef fat or whatever they use to cook it in. The steak just tasted extraordinarily bland.. Their rolled up tacos that they fry tastes great with chicken. But in summary the truth is they use to be good and now with competition around them...l think they need to step it up. I determine if a restaurant is good if the restaurants own ethnicity eats there. For example Chinese at Chinese restaurants...Mexican at Mexican restaurants. Anyhow the majority of my friends no longer eat there. We now eat at Pulgarcito (which serves Mexican, Honduran, and salvadoran food)... Given they dont speak hardly any English at Pulgarcito. There food is so much better. Last time my friend ordered plaintains Three Amigos..They burnt it to a crisp. Who does that? Frying plaintains is not hrd. If you know its burnt... It's going to taste like crap. Then don't send it out to the consumer! However, their red salsa and salsa verde is worth trying the restaurant. And I appreciate the fact the owner took the time to reply back. Hopefully our next visits will be better.
