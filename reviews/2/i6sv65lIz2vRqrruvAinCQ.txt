Definitely a 2 to 3 star place . I'm Mexican and know good food when it comes to it and even though we live near Mexico  it's still hard to find good Mexican food . This place was a baby step above Filabertos.. The menudo was super salty and very greasy  the salsa is mild and don't expect chips and salsa in your to go order . The chicken tacos did have quality meat, seemed to be all white chicken, but don't expect it to be a stuffed taco and the rice is bland and mushy.
