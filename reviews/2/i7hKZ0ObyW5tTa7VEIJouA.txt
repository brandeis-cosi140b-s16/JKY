Music way too loud. 

Ran out of water. Waiter never showed back up until we were done. Little late to ask how things are. Also, it always bothers me when the waiter isn't the one bringing out the food. They lose the connection with the customer.

Mexican restaurant with no chips? What's up with that?

Food quality mediocre at best.
