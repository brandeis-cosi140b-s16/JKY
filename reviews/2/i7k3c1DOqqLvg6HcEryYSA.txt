The salsa and the fact it's a neat old building (on the outside) is the only reason it gets 2 stars. Tamales' were drenched in a red sauce and tortilla soup was luke warm and mediocre at best. Chips were cold and hard not warm and crispy. Overpriced for the quality of meal. Real disappointment when there's better Mexican food in Indianapolis!
