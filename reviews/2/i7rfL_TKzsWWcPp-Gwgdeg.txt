As I've stated before in a previous review I used to come here all the time back in the day.  Zapatas has completely gone downhill and has now reached the classification of all the other # 14 Mexican type restaurants.  This is not sustainable in this area.

There wasn't a wait tonight, Saturday which you used to have to wait at least 15 minutes especially is Ballantyne.  This tells me that other people have noticed the issues also.  the chips to start were much thicker and overcooked than they should be, the salsa was completely lacking in flavor and the entire "chips and salsa" experience kind of sucked.  

I ordered the pork carnita tacos.  They now serve the tacos in this metal stand up thingy which is cool, in theory so the tacos don't tip over and dump out all of the stuff inside.  The problem is that the stand up thing is metal and they heat the plate up and besides the plate being piping hot when they serve it the metal stand up thing is like 400 degrees so you can't get to your taco until it cools off about 20 minutes after they set the plate down.  the tacos themselves also were lacking in flavor and were so greasy that I had to let them drip free of that orange color pizza type grease before I could eat them.  Beans and rice were, well, beans and rice. All in all it wasn't a good meal.
I would prefer to have them raise their prices and beef up their quality to the level that they had years ago.  Right now it's pretty similar to going to every other Mexican joint and we already have plenty of those.
