I don't know, if you want tacos then go to a Mexican place, if you want American go to an American restaurant. This place does have beer and margaritas, but that doesn't make a good restuarant. Cute, not clean, busy, and crowded. But the food frankly lacks any inspiration. Most boring bean burrito I've had, reminded me of a supermarket microwave burrito. Machaca tostado was OK, the tacos al Pastor were totally lacking in flavor. Salsas were a huge disappointment. Go to a Mexican restaurant for better Mexican food.
