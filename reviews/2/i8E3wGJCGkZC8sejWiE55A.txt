A friend of mine works across the street from this place and he gets food here all the time.  He once took me there and this is what I've concluded:  (+ positive, - negative, -/+ neutral)

+ TVs for games.  I'm a football girl and I like big flatscreens to watch games on.

+I'm not 21 yet, but this place has a nice feel as far as bars go.

- Food is gross.  Plain and simple.  Yes, I am a vegetarian, but the only thing I didn't eat was the meat... and it still wasn't good.  A burrito should be good with or without meat.

- Open seating.  It's a garage-turned-restaurant (or it least it looks like it) and so the place is WIDE open.  There tall bar stools and tables everywhere and the only nice place to sit is on couch-benches that don't have tables.

-/+  I guess if you're drunk and need a little something-something to eat, this would be a good place to go.  But it's not a good place to get a good meal.

- Prices suck.  If you're going to do it Chipotle style, at least be cheaper than the chain.
