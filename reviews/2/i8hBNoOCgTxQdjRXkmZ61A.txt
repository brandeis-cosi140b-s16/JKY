We had not been to this Lindo location in about a year.  I remember why.  The service is crazy slow and the food is just average (and a little overpriced).  I ordered the tacos (2 shredded beef, one chicken).  The chicken was so dry I didn't eat much of it and the shredded beef tacos dripped grease.  The beef itself was very flavorful though.  The rice was also very dry.  I know people love this place, but the original on DI seems to have a better kitchen.

The upside to this location is the mass amounts of flat screen TV's and yummy margaritas.  We were able to watch the AFC Championship game just as well as we could have in any bar or sports book.
