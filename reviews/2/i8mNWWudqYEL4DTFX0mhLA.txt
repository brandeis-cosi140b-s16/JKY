I'm super jealous as I sit inside Tequileria....

I'm jealous of the patrons behind me that got a better waitress,
I'm jealous of all the people that got breakfast before they made it to the airport,
I'm even jealous of the peeps eating Burger King for breakfast.

Bottom line, take your money elsewhere is you are deciding what to eat when you're in Gate C. First of all, the service was not good at all. No smiles, no hello's, and I even witnessed the more timid customers wait forever for their checks.  When you finally get service, make sure to order everything at once. I'm talking about your refills, extra sides, extra napkins, etc. This is a must since it's almost impossible to get your server's attention here. Eye contact, the finger wave, and "excuse me" just doesn't fly here.  I also think the servers have their invisible ear plugs and blinders on.  Or, i just have my invisible cloak on.  Whatever the reason, the service is just not what they preach here. However, service does improve when your check arrives.  My thoughts, it must be tip time. 

As for the food, it's just okay. The food looks better than it tasted. I got their Chicken Chipotle Torta with Chips.  This chicken sandwich was fine, but I decided to eat it bland with nothing on it. No taste, just your average chicken breast for about $10. I also finished all 5 pieces of their tortilla chips that they gave me as a side.  Overall, just okay food with poor services equals 2 Stars in my book.
