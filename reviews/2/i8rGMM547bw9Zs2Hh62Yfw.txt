Let me preface this by saying that I've never been a big fan of chain Mexican restaurants. My sister loves Macayo's for some mysterious reason, and I decided to play along since we had relatives visiting from out of state.

The decor is nauseating. It feels like they took the most obnoxious colors they could find and ratcheted it up on the scale of tacky. However, we came to eat, so who cares what color the walls are?

The salsa is thin, but tolerable. Nothing special, but I'm always a fan of bottomless chips, so I'll take it.

Everyone else seemed to like their food. I ordered tamales with green sauce. Unfortunately, the first time it came with their "Baja sauce," which our waitress informed us is cream cheese, heavy whipping cream and jalape√±o juice. She quickly took it back and brought out my correct order. Much to my surprise, green sauce is just red sauce with green chiles in it. At this point, I had fallen behind enough that I scraped most of the sauce to the side and ate my lunch. The tamales had a nice fluffy texture, but the sauce was not what I had in mind.

Our waitress did handle my sending back the order without any fuss. She was gracious and attentive, so for that I'm adding in an extra star.
