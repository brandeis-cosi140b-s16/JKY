My wife and I have enjoyed T Y T before and looked forward to a great lunch.  And everything seemed like it would be good as usual....except everything came out cold.  cold tortillas, luke warm meat and room temperature corn.  Food came from 3 different stations and all failed.

When we arrived no one was ready for our order and the food looked old.

The only good thing was the foods (at least on initial bites), had good flavored...

We should have returned the food or walked out..,,
