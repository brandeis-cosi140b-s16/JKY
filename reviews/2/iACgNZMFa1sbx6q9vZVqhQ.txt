Sadly, due to numerous occasions of having rude service my husband and I will never return. Every time we went we had the same rude and unfriendly bartender-Bri (with the shaved head). 

It makes me so angry to think about how rude she was on each occasion. Clearly there is lack of management. It's too bad because we live down the street. But now we will go to Native New Yorker. 

The only reason for two stars instead of one is because they have really good salsa.
