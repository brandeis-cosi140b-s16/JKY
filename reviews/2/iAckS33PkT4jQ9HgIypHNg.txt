So once again, I ordered the wrong thing. I must have. Everyone loves this place, so it must be me. Most Yelp reviews are great (which is why we met there), the people I was with loved their food (a burro & a chimichanga), the various police officers who swiftly came in and out seemed to enjoy their food, but I thought mine sucked! This smarts, particularly because I was so looking forward to eating "good Mexican in a sketchy neighborhood," as I had told my cousin weeks ago was high on the to-do list for our trip to Phoenix. 

The barbed wire behind the building, the rugged neighborhood, and the jammed paper towel dispenser in the restroom sure made it seem sketchy enough to be good, but the food disappointed me. So what gives?

Does it serve me right for not ordering off the giant menu on the wall? 

I asked if they could make enchiladas verdes and they said yes, so I went for it. The chicken, by the by, was fantastic--very white and tender and it looked great, especially in my cousin's burro, but the sauce on my enchiladas was not green, it was more of a MRSA-discharge yellow. In addition, the sauce was so creamy that it was goopy, it was flavorless, and it was not hot. (Er, it was not hot temperature-wise, nor was it spicy).

My cousin ordered chips and salsa with her burro (an enormous bag), so after I finished picking the chicken out of the enchiladas, I ate some of her chips using my refried beans as a dip. The salsa was good, though, and the kind of spicy that accumulates and sneaks up on you. Also, their pop machine dispenses horchata.  Still, I would not go to Carolina's again.
