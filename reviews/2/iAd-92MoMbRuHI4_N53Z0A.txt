The food was good.  Not the best and I certainly expected more than three shrimp in something called 'Ultimate', but good enough to go back again if that were the only consideration.

The service was some of the worst I've ever seen.  After waiting outside on the patio with three kids for fifteen minutes, I was forced to go inside and find two menus.  After another ten minutes I went in again and asked the bartender, who'd been outside several times, if I needed to order through her.  She said that she would let our server know someone was outside. (like it was possible to hide three kids and two adults).  

Our server was nice enough but no where near attentive.  We (4/5 of us) sat for some time with empty drinks.  We had to flag him down only to wait another twenty minutes for a box and the check.  

To be fair, they were busy, but that's no excuse to attend to the tables around us and not at least check in.  

I probably won't go again.   (He's lucky my wife left the tip)
