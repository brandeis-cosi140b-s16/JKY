We paid $67 for 2 dinners, 1 lemonade, and chips and guacamole.

I had the fish tacos and my fianc√© had the short rib enchiladas and a lemonade.

Lemonade was really over sweet and wasn't very good.

Everything was really salty (coming from someone who likes salt)

The fish tacos were dry and flavorless and what didn't taste that great.  The corn tortillas were also flavorless.

The shortrib enchiladas were just ok, but nothing to write home about for almost $30.

The guac was $9.50 and was about 1/4 cup of over salty guac that was also nothing special.  The chips were pretty good.

I would have given it 3 stars but the price of the food for the quality of the food made me take it down a notch.  It's not right to charge such high prices for 

However the waitstaff was on point and the hostess was really sweet.

I wouldn't recommend this restaurant for the price you can choose so many other great places.
