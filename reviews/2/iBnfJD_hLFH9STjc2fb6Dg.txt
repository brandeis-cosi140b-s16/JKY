I am a noob not only to Arizona but also to the myriad wonders of Mexican cuisine (Taco Bell was about all we had in my Southern hometown). So maybe when I walk into a Mexican eatery in AZ, my expectations are just too unrealistically high. I read the mixed Yelp reviews, weighed my options, and then walked the block to Vitamin T to grab some dinner. 

First off, the cardboard cutout of the Mexican beer guy (the most interesting man in the world, I believe they call him) scared the crap out of me, lounging in a corner like he was people. But I am forgiving. I laughed it off, maneuvered awkwardly around the tequila barrels, and made my taco selection.

I ordered the veggie taco, the beef, and the pulled pork.  When I got them, my excitement quickly ebbed, because they are so gosh-darn tiny. For $7, I expected at least a standard tortilla-sized taco. I went out on the patio to eat, because, well, that's the only place they have for you to eat unless you want to hover uncomfortably over the aforementioned barrels of tequila littered throughout their claustrophobic interior. 

My veggie taco was interesting, flavorful and full of variety, but dry. I am not one for salsa, but I would have enjoyed some sour cream. The beef was basic. Really basic. It was also dry, and a tad too salty.The pork I enjoyed. It was sweet, moist, and full of flavor. But like I mentioned, the tacos were so small that the pork was just a pleasant memory after about 25 seconds. 
 
Vitamin T left me severely underwhelmed. I wanted to like it. I wanted to be wowed by the wonders of of the "T" food group that the restaurant tries to convince me actually exists. But I left still kinda hungry, wondering where the nearest Chipotle might be.
