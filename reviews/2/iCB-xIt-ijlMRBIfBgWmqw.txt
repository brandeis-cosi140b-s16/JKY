I was very excited to see what the new La Fonda location was like and what the food quality and the menu was going to be like, after the La fonda move from the Scottsdale location.  I used to go to the old location for many, many years, and loved it.   The new Baseline building location has been completely remodled and redecorated inside and out.  It looks great.  Right away, however,  I noticed a menu problem.  I used to order a burrito, alacarte and a taco or two.  The new menu has only burrito combination plates.  You cannot order a burrito ala carte.  A green chili burro will cost you $8.95, and come with beans and rice.  No other option is available.  I was told by our waiter that "They are trying to get away from the ala carte thing."  I was very disappointed.  When my "Build Your Own Combo" Lunch Menu order (burros are not offered with this option) came out, I was disappointed.  The shreadded beef taco meat was dry, tough and flavorless.  I could not even bite through it.  A server did offer to replace it with something else, but, I was starting to just want to get out of there, and count my losses.  The ground beef taco had no flavor, and the cheese portion put on both tacos was skimpy, at best.  The cheese enchilada was thin and skimpy.  The plate was very hot, and the beans and rice were OK.  It just is not the La Fonda I used to crave, and I doubt I will be back.  I might give it another chance, down the road a bit, to see if they improve.  This might be another case of a place that used to be good when they were small, but lose it when they expand to a huge new building.
