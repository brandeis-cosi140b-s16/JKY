I tried one calabasa/cheese pupusa and one  bean/cheese pupusa.  The calabasa pupusas was pretty good, the beans had no flavor, nor did the curtido and salsa.  Nothing had any spice to it and the curtido tasted like it did not have any vinegar in it at all, and there was not any evidence of crushed rep peppers or sliced jalapenos, both necessary for authentic and tasty curtido.

I am now in the mid-west and was looking forward to some good pupusas.  Sigh!
