I was with a group of 4 on a Monday night. The place was pretty crowded--which is a good sign. The drinks ordered by my group were apparently quite good. The bean dip was ok, the red salsa was marginal, and the green salsa tasted like grass. I ordered the Tampiquena--made from top sirloin which sounded interesting. When I attempted to order it medium rare, the waiter tried to explain to me that it could not be cooked to order because it was pre-cooked ( I assume he meant marinated) in lime juice, but he assured me that it was very good. I was presented with a very thin, tough and poorly seasoned piece of beef with some cold, clumpy queso on top of it. Not at all impressed. The enchilada that came with it was ok--but certainly nothing special. Judging from the other reviews here, I either came on the wrong night or ordered the wrong thing. If I happen to be this far north in LV again, I might give it another shot.
