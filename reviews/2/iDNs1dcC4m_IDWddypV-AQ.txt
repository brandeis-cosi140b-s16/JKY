Bad food, worse service.

Waitress took our drink orders, and then twenty minutes later the manager came by to tell us our waitress got busy with another table and he would take our drink orders. Ten minutes later the original waitress came back to get our drink orders. Ummmm.... hello? Finally got our magaritas, which were weak as hell and way too sweet and sour.

And everything was slimy. I'm not OCD or anything but I felt the need to get up and wash my hands after flipping through the menu. And after touching the salt and pepper shakers. And after moving the itty bitty little chip basket from one side of the table to the other.

Ordered an appetizer - the Farmer's Market Quesadilla. Plate was hot but the cheese was cold. Vegetables were slimy. Tortilla was burnt. And they didn't bring us any napkins or silverware. We waited what we thought was an acceptable amount of time for someone to stop by and when nobody did I actually got up, walked across the restaurant to the hostess stand where there was a box and got them myself.
