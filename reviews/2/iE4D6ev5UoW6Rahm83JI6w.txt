We got the Wanna Iguana burrito and an order of shrimp tacos, 2 cups of chicken tortilla soup, a Margarita and an American Mule.  The shrimp tacos were okay, but the taco shells were stale.  They came with a cup of black bean and corn salad which I just ended up mixing with the slaw and shrimp and ate it like a salad.  My husbands burrito was okay.  It gets soggy so be careful cutting into it as you'll end up eating the paper at the bottom of the plastic basket they serve it in.  The drinks.....for $8 where was the alcohol?  Seriously they should be ashamed to serve $8 drinks with no alcohol in them.  I mean, I don't need a flammable level of booze, but the booze in a mixed drink is part of the flavor.  My Mule tasted weird, like a sweet flat something on ice.  It took me a awhile to figure out it tasted like flat ginger ale. A mule contains ginger beer, not ginger ale!  It definitely makes a difference.  On a positive, the servers and staff were nice, and they play a good mix of music from the bar on the other side.  The chicken soup and jalape√±o cornbread were excellent!   Unfortunately, this meal was $46 before tip.   We won't head back as I'm not cool with paying tourist level prices for food this mediocre.
