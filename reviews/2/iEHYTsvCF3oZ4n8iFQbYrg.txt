This place was very clean, service was good, and the food was good.  I went in at 1:30 on a Monday, and I was the only one in there.  I ordered nachos with ground beef, and got nachos with chicken.  They were good, just not what I ordered, and I chalked it up to a language barrier.  The health department rating was 86, but I'm pretty sure that after an inspection like that, changes get made.  No refills on soda, you get a can and a glass of ice.  I may try them again at some point, but I'm in no hurry.
