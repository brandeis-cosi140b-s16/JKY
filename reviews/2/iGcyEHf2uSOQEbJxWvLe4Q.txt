I was attracted to this place because of the cheap menu for drinks and appetizers and being in Bally's I wasn't expecting too much. The staff here are friendly but the service here is just average and it can be hard to find a table during happy hour but there is always the bar area where you can stand and just drink right there. 

I ordered the nachos and it was huge and not for the health conscious. After eating it for 20 minutes, my stomach started gurgle and I felt sick from the meat and cheese, I stopped eating because i didn't want it to ruin the rest of my trip and just took some tums and went away. Like I said, don't expect too much from this place even for the cheap deals, the restaurant is not as hip looking as the others on the strip but it gets the job done and you do get what you pay for.
