Something here has really changed. I have always liked Dona Marias. But I have been here twice in the past few weeks and the food is different. I used to love the Shrimp and Octopus cocktail but my last two visits it has not been what it used to be. I had a chili rellano and taco today and both had what seemed to be more of a catsup based sauce than before. The taco was in a hard  "taco bell" type shell. Very disappointed.
