My second try at a Chipotle grill.  My first was in San Diego.

I guess I'm just not a fan of the restaurant in general.  This one was no different the San Diego location.  Sort of a Subway "Mexican Style" only with 1/2 the topping selection.

On this occasion I was really in the mood for a good, spicy burrito.  But I don't like chicken, pork or shredded beef.  I really wanted ground beef with the mexican spicing.  I ended up choosing steak.

I didn't want Rice on my burrito nor did I want beans (they have two choices for each).  That leaves a choice of about 5 other toppings.  I added lettuce, cheese, and sour cream.  I asked for guacamole and had to pay extra for it.

Since we had kids with us we added the bag of "chips" and asked for mild salsa.  To Chipotle, Mild Salsa means a cup of diced tomatoes and onions.  NO sauce.  WTF??

It was a frightening mess to eat the burrito.  I need dozens of napkins.  The taste was ok.  Not bad.  But not what I wanted either.

If you've never been to one, and are wanting Mexican food, go find a restaurant.  This place won't do it for you.
