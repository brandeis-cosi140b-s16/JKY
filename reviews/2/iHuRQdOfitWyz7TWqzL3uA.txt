I still don't know why I keep going back here... perhaps it's because Cafe Carumba seems like one of the only legit breakfast/brunch spots where a large group can meet to have mimosas on a Saturday morning. It's not the food that is the problem, it is the wait for your food. Recently I went here with a group of 8, we were seated on the patio for at least 10-15 minutes before the server made it to our table. He took our drink orders (even though we were ready to order food since we had enough time to read the menu 3 times front and back) and again we didn't see him for 10-15 minutes. Our drinks came and went yet our food and server were no where to be found. It was an hour before we finally ate. After the server put all our plates down he went to the table next to us who had been seated for about 10 minutes and said they would have to wait an hour for their food and he recommended they go somewhere else! I couldn't believe the waiter pretty much told them to leave! It was busy, but not out of the ordinary for a beautiful Saturday morning in Scottsdale. Unfortunately I don't think my opinion will persuade my group of friends to find a better brunch spot, so I will see you next Saturday.
