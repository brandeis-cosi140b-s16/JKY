Pretty standard fast Mexican food. Had the shredded beef quesadilla, was a bit dry and definitely needed the side of sour cream (0.75). They threw some lettuce and tomato in the box, but it looked a bit wilted so it stayed in the box. I was a bit scared to try it, as everyone seemed to be going to the pizza place next door. It was ok, but nothing to rave over.
