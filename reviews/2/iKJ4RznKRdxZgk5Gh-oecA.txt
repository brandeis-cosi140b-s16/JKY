If you're out looking for a bite to eat and want good authentic tacos, this is not the place to go. We ordered the shredded beef (crunchy) tacos, chips and salsa & a mango beergarita. The tacos came out and the shells are store bought shells, the beef was ICE cold & the frozen margarita tasted like pure syrup with no tequila hint or flavor what so ever (thank goodness we got the beer!). The chips and salsa were very good though! I think this place is more hip to the college kids. The atmosphere was cool and relaxed, but the food was just gross. Save yourself time and a few bucks and just hit up taco bell or a Rubios.
