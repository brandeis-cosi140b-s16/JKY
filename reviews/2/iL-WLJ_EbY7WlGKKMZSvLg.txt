Loved going there was a regular...... But id thought i was supporting Armando as a local business owner. Sunday i was told by him he's not the owner just a minor owner. Ive never met any other owners. So was confused by that. They'd changed their prices from just the week before and said it was the other owners choice!?? Which makes it not worth it. My family don't eat there because it gives them heartburn with too much spices added. Also, If you like hot food its not the place to go..... For drink offers I recommend red embers at the bowling area next door, much more fun & lively. Mexican food i truly recommend Arribas in the arrowhead area but if too far Rio Mirage down the road. For wings and bar food, Bootys on Bell & Reems is awesome the ambiance is lively and has great food and drink specials.
