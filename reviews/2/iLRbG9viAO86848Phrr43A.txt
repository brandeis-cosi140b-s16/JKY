When I say no tomatoes, that means NO tomatoes on ANYTHING!

I come here with el boyfriendo when neither of us wants to cook, but he wants to indulge his taco heritage. 

I love the super nachos, especially when they don't put tomatoes in it. Insert EXTREME food allergy. 

I don't think I've ever left the drive thru in under 15 min, or drove away with my food order correct. Sadness.

So because the special guy in my life has never had an ordering problem, and because once I pick all traces out of my meal, I award two stars.
