We were very excited to try Mundo after reading the reviews but was very disappointed in our experience. We got to the near empty place on Sat at 3:05 and were disappointed in missing lunch and didn't fuss since it was our fault we were 5 minutes late.  Location was very odd and out of the way.  Decor was nice, only 3 other groups eating which should have been a sign of things to come.

I had a beer while wife had a sangria which was pretty good.  Soon after sitting down store bought chips and 1 type of salsa arrived. Yes they were that bad. Next we had queso flameado and it was the highlight of the meal except for the store bought tortillas that came with it.

For entrees wife ordered vegetable chile relleno, I was on the fence and asked waiter what he thought of the filet mignon chile relleno.  He said it was one of his favorites and "challenged" me to try it. I accepted the challenge.

What was delivered left us feeling ripped off.  The sauce on the veg chilli relleno was ok but the filling was just mush.  Mine had a different sauce which was very odd but the kicker was the meat.  There is no way that was filet mignon, it was cubed chuck or similiar and tough.  My wife said the consistency reminded her of dog food and I hate to say it but I agree with her. We paid $26 for 1 small chilli relleno stuffed with tough meat and mushy vegetables. Service was ok until after we were done eating. Waiter asked if we were done and if we wanted dessert. I said no dessert and we are done. Took another 10 minutes to come back to table and asked if we wanted check. I said we are done just like before.  I guess he was too busy with the 3 other tables.

Our feelings are if you are going to charge gourmet prices then you better deliver the goods and they missed the mark for us.
