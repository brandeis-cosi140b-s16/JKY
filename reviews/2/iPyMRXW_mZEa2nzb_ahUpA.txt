I was not impressed by this place. The reviews looked good but it didn't live up to what I read. The service was great. We had a tall handsome young man serving us and he was on top of it. However the food was not up to par. The chimichanga was a soggy mess and the burger tasted like it's been in the freezer for a while.

And DO NOT order the "lettuce wraps". They are not what you think. They sent out chunks of iceberg lettuce, quartered along with piles of lettuce, tomatoes, salsa, sour cream and chicken slices. It was REALLY LAME. The gentleman who brought it out to us even seemed to serve it with a hint of pity in his eyes.

I wanted this place to be good and be able to write a great review. I love supporting local when I can but I just can't do it with the Blue Adobe. But maybe I just caught them on a bad day.
