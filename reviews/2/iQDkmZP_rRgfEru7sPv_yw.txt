EDIT: Taco Tio is closed, it has been replaced with Don Tortaco.  The following review is from when it was Taco Tio.  Don Tortaco is much better than Taco Tio.

carne asada burrito had rice in it AND had no guacamole.  fail.  guacamole always goes with carne asada. always.  Rice never goes in a burrito.  never.  tortilla was pretty good; didn't taste rubbery and was a little flakey.

Quesadilla was dry.  I want my quesadilla smothered in butter.  Cheese tastes like rubber.
