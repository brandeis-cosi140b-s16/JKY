I normally get my breakfast burrito from Salsitas on Central, but decided to give this place a shot as I've read some fantastic reviews... Unfortunately, their ham, cheese, and egg burrito left much to be desired. I love drenching my burrito in salsa and their salsa had little flavor, taste, or spice. The burrito was large, but 90% of it was ham with little egg or cheese.. and about halfway through I bit into an eggshell. Save yourself a $1 and drive a mile down the road for better taste all-around if you're looking for a bomb breakfast burrito.
