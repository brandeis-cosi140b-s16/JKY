I stopped by this Filibertos after a massage at SWIHA starved to near death (not really, but it felt like it) to get a burrito to eat on my way to hi-lites. I chose an Arizona burrito filled with chicken, rice, sour cream and something else (not beans though which I forgot to add). 

At first it had a nice citrusy flavor but pretty quickly it got old and I was tired of eating a lemon burrito. To make matters worse it was full of what we call "funny chicken". You know. those weird pieces that are so chunky and chewy and grisly they're like bits of plastic. I'm used to the Ahwatukee Filiberto's where's there's no "funny chicken" in sight. Once I got to the salon I threw most of it away. I should have stuck with the vegetarian burrito. What was I thinking?
