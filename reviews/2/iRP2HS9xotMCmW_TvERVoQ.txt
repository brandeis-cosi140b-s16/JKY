I liked what I saw as I walked in. Clean quiet not crowded.  Staff was friendly.  I was given plenty of time to go over the menu.  I ordered a seafood burrito and a bowl of chicken tortilla soup. While waiting I enjoyed the chips. They had good flavor even without the very tasty salsa.  When the burrito arrived, I asked where is the soup. I  push the burrito aside and waited. The soup finally came.  I was not disappointed. Then the down fall.  The burrito should have been called a Onion burrito with Shrimp.  More than half was onion and peppers with just a little seafood. When I was finished 1/4 of the plate was onions I had  pulled out.
