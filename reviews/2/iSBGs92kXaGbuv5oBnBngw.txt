We have visited this place many times and we tend to keep our money in the area. 

Overall: Meh, the food was just bland if you got tacos- nothing really special about this place. It could be so much more, I think some flavor to the food would be a good start. My husband and I have gotten so many types of variety of food here and we are just not impressed but we try to give it another try.

The service is NOT the best in the world. There would be times we would wait for over 10 minutes for someone for the love of God just to bring us our check. That is one of my key things with restaurant. They are here to make sure we enjoy the food and they are on top of things.  They did not deliver and two weeks ago was the last time we go there. 

Just be prepared to wait for everything. You are on their time.
