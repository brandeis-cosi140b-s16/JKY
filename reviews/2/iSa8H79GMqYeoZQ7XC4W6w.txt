I've been to the Roberto's on Fort Apache near West Tropicana and it was great...this one however, needs some improvement. The dining area is clean, the drive thru is great, but the communication gap when ordering is aggravating. Everything seems perfect, until you open your food and find out that the chicken you ordered is actually steak which you don't eat. Or your sausage, egg, and cheese breakfast burrito is actually carne asada, which you don't eat. Every single time I have gone to this one, if I order anything besides cheese enchiladas, the order is messed up. My bf orders carne asada fries every time, no pico de gallo, no guac...every time it has one of the two or both, or it's missing something else that he actually did want. It's the strangest thing. It sucks that the place is so damn convenient for us, but we now utilize the one on Pecos and Sunset, or Sunset Road in the Smith's plaza.
