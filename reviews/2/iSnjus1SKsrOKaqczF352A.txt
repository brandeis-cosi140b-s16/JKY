Happy hour!!!!

Ok so not the greatest but still good guacamole pretty good quesadilla was ok margs nothing to write home about.... Jus sayin

Time for fish tacos....... So I visited on Tuesday and I have to say the grilled fish and shrimp tacos are nothing to rave about, very dry chunk of fish with a little mango (i think) pico sauce.
