I know these guys have a strong, dedicated following.  But I've tried it a few times and I strongly feel that their food is tasteless and makes you feel endlessly bloated.  Service and atmosphere are equally mundane.  The best thing about this place is the salsa bar.  But it is often messy and depleted.
