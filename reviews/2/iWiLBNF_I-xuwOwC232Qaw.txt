Hands down one of the worst Chipotle restaurants I've ever been to. They have 7 people working... no line, and I've waited for 15 minutes already for a side of fruit for a kid's meal. Really? The employees need to stop having their little side conversations and take care of business. I'm by no means against having fun while you work, but this is insane.
