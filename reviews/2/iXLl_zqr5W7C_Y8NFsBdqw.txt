The fish tacos + flavored lemonades are AWESOME.  The fish tacos are grilled + creamy, not fried or crunchy.  The list of flavors for the lemonade are ENDLESS (think beyond your basic berries, they've got prickly pear, mango, even blood orange!)  I've also had the chicken burrito and i wasn't really feeling it.  Both the rice + beans in the burro were undercooked and ended up just being hard little rocks.  I'd rec this place if you're looking for bombass lemonade, not chicken burritos. :P
