Not impressed. So many good reviews too I feel a little guilty but im being totaly honest. Maybe im biased(Ive been cooking for just under two decades and am Mexican American). First of all everything was Bland, everything. The spanish rice, the  "chivo", the "carbon". I mean its primarily about the food is it not? Basicaly they get a thumbs down. Im a little insulted that they think they can just cook "Mexican" food with theyre little twist and half ass it. I dont mean to offend anyone but if you want solid flavor and good traditional Mexican food I would stear clear of this place.
