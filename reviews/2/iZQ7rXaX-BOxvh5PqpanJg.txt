Generally speaking, the food is good here, especially the Caramelo. I decided to get a side of chips and guacamole this time around. Chips were ok, but had old, crunchy French fries mixed in with them. And the guacamole was obviously a few days old and had waaay too much salt in it!  I'll stay away from those items... If I come back.
