How about some meat with your cilantro stem tacos? jaysus, the green herb is seriously inexpensive; just the leaves will do.

In a 5 tiered rating system, and with hundreds of Mexican food choices in the valley, the stars begin to get blurry. The trouble is, certain dishes at Elmer's are just okay compared to others.

Rice? Great. Beans? Like El Sol down the street, several whole beans strewn about the refried puree for posterity; no thank you.
Tacos al pastor? Pass. Gristly pork and cardboard corn tortillas.
