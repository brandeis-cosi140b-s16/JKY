it's summer and tomatoes are at their prime, but canned are used in the salsa here. Guac has such a bizarrely smooth texture there's got to be something else in it beside avocados...cream cheese? Queso is of the canned variety and while bizarely addictive (because who else serves queso in Vegas and let's face it, any is better than none at all..) is kind of sour.  Then there are lunch specials.  Order the tostada and beware!  bring an army of hungry folks - it's not one, it's 2 loaded up and served with a generous side of vegetables. Look - is getting lots of food a bad thing? No, but who wants mexican food the day after - it's soggy, drippy, awful. Particularly if you're packaging up leftovers in foam clamshells (who still does that???!!). Wouldn't it be easier to actually offer portion sizes tailored towards lunch and not the ultimate food coma?  

Don't want tequila or a beer? Yes, it's possible - and one decent white wine isn't too much to ask - but apparently here it is. Gack. 

I should have brought my entire office to eat the meal I purchased -- they'd have left completely full - but I wanted some quiet time after a stressful morning of back to back meetings.  Now I know why I've not been in before and why I probably won't be back.

Oh yeah...folks that work there have grown accustomed to it and probably don't notice it - but the restaurant smells bad. I should have left before entering completely  - but I was just worn out and thought surely it couldn't be that bad. It was 12:30 - only 2 other tables straggled in before I left at 1:30 -- and it's near campus.  I think folks have already figured out that this is not the best choice.  

Sorry guys.  I really wanted to like you.
