The food here is great. I love the steak and egg burritos and any of the breakfast burritos. They are a good size that can fill you up. 

The other food has good portions and is tasty as well.

The thing that concerns me is the prices have gone up a least a dollar for each item since a few months ago. I won't be coming back to this location in the future. 

If the other locations have raised prices I will find other Mexican food to eat.

I ordered a steak burrito and got chorizo. K.
