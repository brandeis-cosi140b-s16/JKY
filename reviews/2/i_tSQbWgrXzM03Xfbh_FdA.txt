I can tell by the mixed reviews that I am not the only one who is befuddled by the glowing reviews for the food here.  This reminds me of bland cafeteria Mexican food and the salsa fails to add any sort of flavor.  Are people dedicated to this place simply because of tradition?  This is yet another tiny Mexican mom-and-pop restaurant in the East Valley that has disappointed me.  I didn't know how good I had it before, when I lived northern California.  There you could find the family Mexican restaurants that were inexpensive, delicious, and offered generous portion sizes.

Elmer's fails in the following ways:

1) Not inexpensive. My meal plus drink came to roughly $10 and consisted of a small crunchy taco, a mini chimi, and a mini tostada (meatless). 

2) Not delicious. The chimi was the best thing on the plate and it was just "meh". The salsa was watery, lacked any discernible heat, and tasted canned.

3) Not generous portons.  I was still hungry after the meal. I would've done better to have gone to Taco Bell.

Sorry Elmer's.  The folks taking my orders out the counter were certainly nice (hence the two stars instead of one). But I just can't eat here again.
