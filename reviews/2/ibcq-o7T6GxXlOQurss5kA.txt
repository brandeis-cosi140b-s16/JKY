Friendly staff and fast service, but if you are looking for Baja Fresh.,.......this is not it.  I had their signature combo with 3 different types of tacos and all the items were dry.  I guess the flavor is a little bland too but I did not notice it as I was trying to figure out how this place could be so crowded even when the meats are dry.  

well the salsa and chips are decent, good spicy salsa.  Otherwise for 7-8 bucks for 3 subpar tacos, no thank you.  I have had better at a lot of places and also, if your tacos are leaking and falling apart, why don't you use 2 shells ?  I mean, it can't be that much.  I had 5 dollar plates at el rancho ranch market and they serve them that way and their meat was not dry.  

Anyway, I guess the bright light, clean eating area, friendly staff makes up for subpar food for folks who want a quick lunch.  it is indeed america's taco shop if you are looking for an american taco, but heck I had better tacos at Dos Gringos and I'm pretty sure the chef was drinking too :)  Pls bring back Baja Fresh.
