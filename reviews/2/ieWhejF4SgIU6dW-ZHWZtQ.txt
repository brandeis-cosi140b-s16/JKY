Came by one day after work to check it out. They did a lot of work on the decor - doors and tables and chairs are very ornate. To sum up my experience of this place - they seem to favor quantity over quality. Huge bowl of chips and salsa - which was just unnecessary for two people. Huge plate portions and everything seemed to come out a little "too fast" - as in everything pre-made and re-warmed before serving and then topped with copious amounts of sauce and cheese to compensate. I noticed that the neighboring tables turned very quickly. Almost like at a fast food joint. People didn't seem to be there for spending quality time with each other - just eat and go. 

I must say - the food didn't taste bad. It just seemed very over-crowded and impersonal and not very noteworthy. 

I haven't been back since because it just wasn't a great experience and there are other restaurants in the same shopping plaza that do a better job overall.
