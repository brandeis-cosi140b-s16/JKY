Placed a phone order to go for 2 grilled chicken salads Saturday night. I was quoted 20 minutes but salads weren't ready for 33 minutes. Because I was waiting I got see our salads literally thrown together before being packaged up. When you dine in the salads look like a work of art. Not so much when you get it to go. Our salads were weak and missing components. Mine had everything but was lacking in quantity. It didn't even clear the lip of the foil pan. My husbands was missing his guacamole and only had a few crumbled remnants of tortilla strips on it.  And was also lacking in quantity of everything else. The girl preparing also put the pico on top of the strips so they were soggy when we got home. When I dine in I can't finish a salad by myself.... I ate all of this one and was still left wanting.  Disappointing experience when you spend $22 bucks for salad.
