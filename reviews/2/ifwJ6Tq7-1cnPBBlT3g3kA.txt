I am a proponent of : If you do not have something nice to say - Say nothing at all. 

However - This boat is sinking and someone SOMEONE (an Owner preferably) .. America please read my review!! It is a cry for help. 

Please fix this place. I REALLY want this to work out but - they NEVER have things gone well since they opened. Cold tacos - wrong orders - too long --- awkward service. 

I KNOW you can do better... because you are! The original location rocks. Is this some ploy to increase business at your original? OR has this been franchised out and the franchisee used to be in some other industry and thought one day "Im going to own a restaurant!" ... 

Whatever the origin of the problem. Just fix it. So that I dont have to pass this restaurant and drive to the 7th street location for a hot taco. 

Here is a to do list:

Staff needs to smile. 
Staff needs training on how to answer the phone - guide the conversation and not sound surprised you'd like to make an order for pick up. 
Sense of urgency. 
Hot food Hot - Cold food Cold.  If the taco tortilla looks pasty white still - just let it cook a little longer - .... HOT .. 
Dont give vegetarians chicken quesadillas. Its just wrong. 

I can come in as your consultant. Let me know ;) 

Thanks.
