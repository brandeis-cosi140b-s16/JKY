This truck came to my work (Premier Inc.) today and I got 2 teriyaki tacos, 1 spicy chicken taco and a Dr.Pepper.

Service was fast(ish), dr.pepper was only 1$ and the tacos were ~3$ a piece.

The tacos were really messy, and did not have a lot of chicken on them.  They were basically inflated with cabbage.  The taste wasn't extraordinary on the spicy or the teriyaki.  The spicy taco wasn't really spicy, I think they just poured some sriracha on them.

Some people said the hibachi chicken was good though, maybe if I'm stuck at work without a lunch again I'll give that a shot.
