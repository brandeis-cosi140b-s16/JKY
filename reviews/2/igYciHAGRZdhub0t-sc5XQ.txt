Just returned from dinner at this restaurant.   The restaurant is beautiful, we were seated promptly, the vocalist was great and our bus boy was terrific!   However this is a restaurant and we expected a good meal experience.   Our waiter was not pleasant and didn't even speak to us other than to ask if we were ready to order.  I ordered cheese enchiladas and was served beef enchiladas so I had to send it back.  The cheese enchilada they brought back to me had so much cheese you could not find the tortilla.   The food was not good and flavor was boring.   I was extremely disappointed especially since this restaurant had received best of Las Vegas 2012.   My guest felt the same way about his dinner.   If you want a nice bar and  want to listen to good music, then I recommend this place.  If you want good Mexican Food, I recommend going somewhere else.
