Pros: Nice, large outdoor seating area.

Cons: Weak drinks, looooong wait on drinks and food. Service was lacking for a weekday night.

Neither me nor my fiancee was very impressed by the service or drinks here. My food was good enough but probably because it just had so much cheese. My fiancee wasn't a real fan of his entree. I highly doubt we will be back unless we both get amnesia.
