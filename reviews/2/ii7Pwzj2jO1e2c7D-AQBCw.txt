My gf and I recently went there for a friends birthday.  We showed up a little late after most had already sat down.Drinks took close to 15min for a coke and margarita.  While waiting for drinks we tried some of the hottest salsa we've ever had. The salsa was so spicy was so spicy most of the table left it alone after a few bits.

When we were about to finaly able to order it took close to 40 minutes for our dishes to come out.  I had a chicken chimi and she had a chili relleno.  Both were  very plain and pretty boring.

Overall the food is a average and the service is terrible.  Los Dos Molinos in Ahwatukee is living on the name of the other locations.
