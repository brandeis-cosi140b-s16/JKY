Good food but the service is what makes it a 2 star. So slow. I've got my food almost cold before. I'm left hanging on my drink refill all dinner. They used to have good servers but I don't know where they all went. Good food horrible service.

Also... stay far away from the fish taco. It was horrible to me. Super dry and didn't really taste too much like fish.
