I guess I just don't get it.

It's advertised as a Madison favorite.  I hear people talking about going there all the time.  But the food just didn't leave me with a great impression.

The chips and salsa are great.  I suppose that's one thing that's pretty tough to get wrong.  But my burrito came out rather bland, as did my daughter's quesadilla.  Unless there was a kitchen mixup, my "hot" salsa sure did taste like mild.  

The service was good, the bar selection is solid, and the atmosphere is a neat one.  The food, however, just doesn't do anything for me.
