Went there once before had margaritas and chips and salsa, I was so impressed. It was great the day bartender who is very nice made fresh delicious margaritas with fresh squeezed lime juice. This last time not so much. Drinks made with really bad pre made sweet and sour mix. Chips and salsa still good, we decided to try the guacamole, it was old and watery and flavorless. Service was less than decent but I don't blame the sever who didn't seem to have been properly trained. We ordered the chile relleno the sauce it had was so extremely salty. I had to get my own silver ware roll up to try it. I had the soup,nice big bowl, and it was tasty. I might've tried a different drink to see if it was better than the original one, but one was never offered. The server was pleasant and very nice, however, it's obvious this establishment is very badly managed. I live in Phoenix and made a very long treck to get there and try the food and it was disappointing to say the least. We will not be returning. Oh well, I wish the owners luck in getting this place in order, really it's just a few changes they could make and they would have a little gem. It's a cute place, but not for me.
