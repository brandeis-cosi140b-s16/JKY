I had rated this at three stars for the food and then I remembered my drink which was absolutely awful so I dropped it down to two.  So, the good, GREAT chips and decent three salsas to dip them in.  I really liked the chips.  Also the atmosphere was wonderful, we sat outside and it wasn't really hot so it was perfect.  Also our waitress, Chelsi was very sweet.  However, the main dishes were not great.  Two had the chicken quesedillas which looked good and with the lime had some flavor.  I had the fish tacos, there were three to the plate, I had two grilled and one deep fried.  The amount of fish was miniscule and there were big strips of lettuce on the tortilla.  Cabbage, yes, but lettuce?  I've had much better fish tacos at the farmer's market near my house.  As for the drinks, one pina colada, didn't try it but heard it was good, and my horrible mojito.  I mean it was unbearably sweet and the mint leaves in the glass were old and brownish.  Yuck.  Plus price tag for that mean was over $80.  That is ridiculous for the quality of what we had.  Good chips!
