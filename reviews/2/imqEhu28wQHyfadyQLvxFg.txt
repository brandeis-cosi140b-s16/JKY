A beautiful decor doesn't save a restaurant from a bad review. I have to apologize as I ate there a few weeks ago and some details are fuzzy, like exactly what I ordered for the entree.

It's amazing how much money was invested in the outer structure, I only wish the same attention was given to the training of the servers, or at least ours.

I wish I could describe her as friendly but it seemed that making any kind of request was inconvenient for her, as I was able to pick up on her body language and facial expression.

The food is average with above-average pricing. Drinks also very expensive.

Wife & I couldn't believe how much we paid for an ok experience.

I only hope that the owner will take a look at these reviews and adjust the model accordingly, as I would love to come back in the future.
