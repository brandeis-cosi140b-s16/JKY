Meh.

Pros: Nice atmosphere; bar is gorgeous. Good music playing. Great drinks (I had the red wine sangria and a sample of the Maria Maria marg).

Cons: Very overpriced. 

I had the chili rellanos with shrimp and crab. For the price, I expected the chilies to be exploding with shrimp and crab stuffing. I'm pretty sure I only saw two shrimp in both chilies. Stuffing flavor seemed to be ok, but it was so spicy I couldn't really taste the flavor after the fifth bite or so. I'm all for spicy food, but when you can't taste anything, what's the point? The husband got the crab and shrimp enchiladas; out came three very small corn tortillas with the same stuffing issue that I had. There was hardly anything in there.  

Very few menu items come with a side, so if you want more to eat, you'll have to order it at another $4-5 per side.  My father got the skirt steak with (cactus) salad. His steak looked fine, but he got barely two tablespoons of salad. That was it.

Guacamole was decent (not the best I've had); chips were decent but salsas were all pathetic. Chocolate mousse was pretty good, but in the end, it's just mousse.

Good concept but they need to either rethink their pricing strategy or really make it worth your time to go down there. We're Arizonans; we're used to killer Mexican food.
