Update...went here again and I left disappointed. I got the chips and salsa to start. The salsa is fine, but I didn't get the impression it was made in house. I ordered the salad again, but this time I asked to have my salad fixed after it arrived at the table. Most of the bowl was just lettuce and there were just a few black beans scattered throughout. Even the server was surprised that it was mainly lettuce. When it returned, they spruced it up by piling a couple extra ingredients on top of my lettuce. It didn't taste like fresh veggies, but something you'd get from cans (e.g., canned corn, pickled cactus). Highly disappointing especially when I could do better at a salad bar. 

After going twice, it's unlikely I'll be back a third time. I need flavor and quality when it comes to my food, which neither was found during my visits here.
