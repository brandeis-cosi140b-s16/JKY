working in north scottsdale now, i thought i would explore some bars i havent been to and take in some happy hours.

brennans is a mexican sports bar. but they show more than just soccer. a decent bar area and setup of tvs all around. 

20oz football shaped glasses for 3.25 domestic was a little less than a preferred deal, but i do like that glass. 

free chips and salsa is a plus, and pretty good. went with the hot buffalo wings. i consider them average above. not above average, but good for average wings. under 5 bucks. (im on a never ending quest to find a better hh deal/taste than zipps, not that i want to succeed at that)

im debating whether to go back again to try out the other menu items since it is a mexican place and i only got wings. maybe probably someday. 

i think the off-track betting room scares the girls away cause i didnt see one in the entire place.

this place is okay to try if youre bored with everywhere else.
