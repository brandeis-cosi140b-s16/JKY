my friend and i decided to go here since it was close to trader joe's and it had an outside patio area. they were doing some sort of road construction (with a crane, putting up store signs) right beside us throughout our entire meal which was really loud and annoying. this, of course, was not the restaurant's fault but it really affected the ambiance. also, it is right next door to a dog grooming business so there were people and their dogs coming in and out. 

we were the only people eating outside since it was pretty hot out (we wanted to smoke) and the fan they had on the patio made it feel pretty comfortable. the patio area is also covered which is nice but it is right in front of the parking lot so there is not a lot to look at. i had a quick look at the inside and it seemed small and dark but cozy. 

this place is not cheap. we joked that putting the word "cantina" in the restaurant's name allowed them to raise prices (as if it were somehow fancier than your run-of-the-mill mexican place). the chips were decent; the salsa was excellent. the taco salad had WAY to many beans in it and it was overpriced. my friend had the fajitas and it was a tremendous amount of food. there was not enough room for her to really prepare each fajita at the tiny outside table. 

my coronas were 4 bucks each and her margaritas (standard size) were each 8 bucks. the peach margarita was boring and had no real peach flavor. the coconut margarita was an interesting flavor but still not worth the price.

the service was ok, nothing great.

the lunch menu looked cheaper and i might try this place again. i will update the review if it is significantly better or worse.

overall, charlotte has better options for mexican food that are cheaper and have better atmospheres.
