Ughhhh...average quality with a high cost. The food was not bad by any means but for how much you have to pay, it is a little ridiculous. The fish tacos were actually pretty good. If you are looking for a quick fix and do not mind a high price it is a pretty easy place to go. I guess you pay for the convenience of it being in your hotel.
