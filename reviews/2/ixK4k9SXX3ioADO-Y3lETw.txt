To be fair, the first time that I went to The Mission a couple of months ago, it was a 3-star experience.  The food was well prepared and nicely presented.  It could have been 4-stars, but the tacos were sadly small for the price.

Last week's experience was a real let down.  I took my family for a Latin dining experience and was sadly disappointed.  Being an arepa lover, I was excited to partake in the experience with my loved ones.  When we arrived, we were told that arepas were no longer part of the menu, although they were still on the menu :-(  They are now serving the sandwiches that were served on arepas, on the torta bread.  The server was apologetic, but frankly, after driving 40 miles to get this specific menu item and checking the on-line menu before making the trip, I was not happy.

The pabellon filling was very good, but again, a let down without the arepa.  To add insult to injury, when the sandwiches were served, they did not bring Mission fries on the plate, because according to the bus boy, the menu changed when the sandwich was no longer served on the arepa, and it no longer was served with the fries.  The server quickly righted this issue and offered us fries on the house.

There are some high points to the experience: the setting is very pretty and the service is attentive.  The chorizo and papas appetizer is delicious and something worth ordering when you go.
