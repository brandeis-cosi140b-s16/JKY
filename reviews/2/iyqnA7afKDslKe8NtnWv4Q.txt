This was generally my last stop of the night when I would go out and I really was not impressed.  This could easily be due to the time that I would come here - fresh food can be elusive after midnight.  The bar staff seems generally disgruntled.  They are more that willing to discuss the owner's (ineffective) marketing strategies, generally unsolicited.  The food is edible and prices are manageable, but it is not the type of quality that would bring me back.  Maybe a little staff turn over and a visit earlier in the day would increase my review, but based on my experiences 2-stars is very fair.
