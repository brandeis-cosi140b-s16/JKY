I went to Macayo's with my brother in law and nephew.  The restaurant was selected by my bother-in-law.  We arrived at about 2:00, after the lunch rush, and the restaurant was mostly empty.  But that didn't mean we got our choice of tables.  All the booths were empty and un-bussed, so we ended up sitting at a table.  The waitress came by quickly to get our drink orders, but it took longer than expected to get the drinks to our table.  Chips and salsa was delivered.  Two salsas; one somewhat chunky, but rather mild, and the second one spicier, but very runny.  The chips were good though.  

I ordered the red chili burro, enchilada style.  The burrito was one of the worst burritos I've had.  It was salty, and without any sense of seasoning.  I guess this is what I should expect when I allow my brother-in-law select a restaurant.  He dislikes any sense of spice.  Service was a bit slow for drinks, but the food did arrive quickly.

Overall, I would never recommend this Macayo's.  Too bland and tasteless like too many chain restaurants.
