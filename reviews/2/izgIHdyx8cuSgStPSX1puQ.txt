Food and salsa were all let downs.

The place echos with loud noise 

It's a tiny place with harsh lighting.

Go to Taco Bell and be happier

We brought our own tequila and bought their sour mixer . We didn't care for it, too much sugar and not enough limes ..then after bringing our own liquor and paying for mediocre sours mix, they were charging us $6 for a glass fee for 2 of us.

This is not a swanky place, they don't even have a liquor license ! After a bad and loud meal, this $6 was ridiculous.

The waitress stands over you to finalize the bill with an iPad . They have the tip percentages spelled out for you . A bit awkward.
