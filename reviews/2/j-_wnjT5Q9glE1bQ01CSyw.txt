I love Chipotle and lived in a town without one for a couple years. I was really excited to move to Champaign and finally be able to have Chipotle once a week for lunch again but this location just sucks. The employees are rude and move so slow. They give really skimpy portion sizes. The guac, rice, and tea taste different than all the others I've eaten at. This location goes against everything Chipotle stands for. It's such a shame.
