This place sucks! Wtf is this?! A fish Taco that is solely just fish and a tortilla. This place is pathetic, and they wanted $8.99 FOR TWO?!?!

I went back in after eating one of the tacos, and the manager was kind enough to refund me for the two I didn't eat. I bumped up to 3 stars for service.

Tortilla fish should revisit the recipe because the fish, and the presentation of the fish (with obscene large chunks, as a result of no effort in cutting these, that have no choice to fall out or punch through the tortilla), were soggy and flavorless. The tortilla shells were mushy and when I put the salsa on they immediately soaked in the salsa and broke apart at the first bite. I believe that both the fish and tortilla are frozen and packaged because fresh made don't do that.

I understand that they do have a topping bar, but it doesn't matter when the toppings can't fit on the Fish Taco because of the large chunks. The toppings also appear to be canned products based on their taste, and my experience with LA Taco trucks having the same toppings (and nothing is fresh on a Taco truck). I would be shocked if these were prepared fresh.

Because commentors inspired me to elaborate on my experience - In retrospect, I don't think 3 stars is deserving. I would rate 1, but the service was okay.
