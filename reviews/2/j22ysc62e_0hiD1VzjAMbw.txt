Where in the world are all of the stars coming from??? This place is not that great. The food is very Americanized and bland. I'm not from the Vegas area, and I thought I'd check out Yelp to find some good Mexican food, and what a disappointment. 

Pros:
- friendly and fast service 
- very inexpensive

Cons:
- mole enchiladas were not "earthy" and spicy. Too much of a sweet chocolate flavor for my taste
- Chlie rellenos were greasy and bland

I will not be going back. Two stars for friendly service and cheap prices.
