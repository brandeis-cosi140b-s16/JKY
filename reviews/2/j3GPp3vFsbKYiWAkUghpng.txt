I heard the hype about this place.  What a disappointment.  Totally over rated!

The food is good, but I've had just as good or better at Filiberto's for less money.  The portions are pretty small in comparison, too.  

The order counter is efficient but lacking in personal touch.  The people who take your order can take you or leave you, and seem to never have even heard of the concept of customer service.  As soon as the line for ordering disappears, the staff disappear to the back, so you have to fend for yourself if you need anything once you have ordered or have your food, until they come back 2 years later.  

The building looks exactly like what it is: a whole in the wall.  That in of itself is not a bad thing really, and probably part of the charm, but its painted gray and looks depressing.  Inside dining is adequate and utilitarian, but I felt like I was eating at the county jail canteen.  The tables were slightly dirty, like they cleaned off the last customer's food tray and forgot to wipe down the table.

I can't say that I would recommend them, but the food was decent, aside from these issues.  If you got the food to go, and set your expectations low, you won't be too badly disappointed.
