I have had it with Macayo's. I don't know if ownership changed or what, but the food and the portions are just a joke now. They have been remodeling the restaurants and they look great, but the food portions and the service just suck now. So many better places to get Mex in the Valley..just go elswhere. This place is a joke now.
