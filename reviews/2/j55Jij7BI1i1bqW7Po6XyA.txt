The place has a nice patio and not much more. Service was slow, meal prep even slower, chips were bland, tasteless, salsa so-so. The to the meal. The rice tasted like Uncle Ben's white rice, I could not find any seasoning, the enchiladas weak with little meat and I guess you can't mess up refried beans. 

Will not return to this "authentic Mexican food" place, they have never been to Mexico..
