yuck. be afraid, be very afraid. to be fair, they had lots of cool toppings stocked at the bar and my chicken quesadilla was good and had quality cheese, but it was also a freakin quesadilla. 

my poor friend, who was visiting from france, lol, tried the menudo--it was literally topped with a 1 inch layer of water and looked as tough as a bull's asscheek. the decor is diner-meets-out of business motel(equipped with deceiving signs about its rich historical legacy, blablabla). You can't just screw up menudo at a mexican place. 

I highly recommend El Sombrero Cafe on south main street(if you haven't been there and feel a drift of mexican fever, get in the your car ASAP).
