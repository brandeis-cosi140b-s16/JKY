I am officially bummed. I have been eating at Elviras since the early 70's. Their hot sauce was unique and always brought me back. Today I was served something that bears no resemblance to the original hot sauce and instead tasted like ketchup with red Chile mixed in. It was inedible. Where, in the world, is Carmen? We need her back making salsa and if Elviras wants to survive, so do they.  Service was great,(thanks Barbara B) but the magic is gone.
