Honestly, never heard of Filiberto's until I moved here to Phoenix. Filiberto's is a Mexican chain restaurant that serves from rice plates, burritos, quesadillas and the like. It's also open 24 hours. I took advantage of their drive through, since I had a hankering for Carne Asada fries and needed something quick.

Carne Asada Fries & Horchata

TBH, the Carne Asada fries is indeed large in portion and comes with fast food, thin cut fries. Topped with a large amount of carne asada, guacamole, sour cream, shredded cheddar cheese and a side of sauce (red or green). The fries were okay, the meat was a tad bit tough and you get enough meat to cover the entirety of the fries. The sour creme seems a bit diluted, doesn't have a tang just adds a creaminess to the dish. The red sauce was nothing memorable, just a plain red sauce.

Typically, when I've had Carne Asada Fries they come with everything that usually comes in a burrito besides the tortilla. No signature kind of sauce? Guys, you're really making me miss La Victoria and Iguana's in San Jose, California.

Horchata, tastes diluted as well, probably came from the fountain and not made fresh- though it was not expected. Slight cinnamon flavor. Tastes more watery than rice- like.

Paid about $9 for Carne Asada Fries (that will probably last me as 4 meals) and a drink. Very bare bones kind of fast food Mexican, would only go here as a last resort or because of it's convenience. Other than that, wouldn't consciously choose Fili-B's for Mexican food- hankering and all.
