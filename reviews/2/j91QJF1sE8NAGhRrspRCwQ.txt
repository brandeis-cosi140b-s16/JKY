:( A million sad faces for me.  My husband was out of town, so that was an opportunity for me to stop by on a whim.  I was convinced I would love it, and maybe  I would have had Los Favoritos had a working stove, or hell, even a microwave.  Everything was cold, except the beans oddly enough.  Maybe they had a little campfire going to keep those warm.

The taco shell was saturated in enchilada sauce because they failed to employ the necessary lettuce barrier between the two.  And it was chewy, like it had been fried some time ago.  The taco meat was cold.  The cheese enchilada was cold.  It had the consistency of once having been melted, but since re-solidified.  And the rice, well, I don't even remember.

I don't get it.  It was off hours, and there was only one other table in there.  The only thing I can think of was that the food had been made earlier and never served.  Maybe they were waiting for a take-out order to pass it off.  Only giving a second star because...I don't even know why.  I just don't want to relive the disappointment any longer.
