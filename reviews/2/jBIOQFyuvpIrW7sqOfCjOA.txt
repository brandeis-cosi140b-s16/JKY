Food was ok. Customer Service was ok. Me and my girlfriend both bought something and our cards were both declined. Strange because our accounts are not anywhere near zero. I ended up using my credit card, and that was finally accepted. Later on in the week, I notice both my cards were charged. It was under $10, so I did not call anybody to make a fuss, but it was still really annoying.
