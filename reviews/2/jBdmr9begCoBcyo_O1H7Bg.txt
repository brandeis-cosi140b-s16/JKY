Should have known by the empty restaurant on a Friday night that this wasn't the best. 
Pros: portions good, good refried beans and rice
Cons: salsa is terrible, the burros are boring. Enchiladas not so great, needed more sauce.  We heard all sorts of hype on the Clare and it's just avocado and beans. This place is just okay in my opinion. Wouldn't recommend.
