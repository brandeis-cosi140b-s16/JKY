This Robertos is not the nicest looking. It could use some major up keep. But the food is the best out of the robertos I have visited. I the meat always tastes fresh and juicy.

There sause bar is always empty. I have been here 6-7 times in the last month ( the burritos are that good) each time it is a different time of day. The carrots have been empty every time. The sause are generally half full. And the radishes have been empty half of the visited. Also there are two candy machines for the kids that are empty. 

If it gets a nice touch up and can stalk there stuff I will update my rating.
