Let me start off by saying that I wanted to love this place. I walked by this restaurant when I was downtown for a Henderson street festival and car show a few months ago. 

First off, there is a serious lack of air conditioning with two small ceiling fans to cool down the restaurant. Immediately, I was put off knowing I was about to sweat through dinner. The extra firm chips showed up with a tasty red salsa that gave me hope that dinner may be in fact -OK. On the other hand, the guacamole/green chile mush was not as delicious.

I ordered the chile verde that came with a small scoop of rice, watered down beans, and store bought tortillas.

The pork was not as tender as I had hoped, and there appeared to be a mysterious red liquid under my beans. Red wine? Blood from raw meat? Kool -Aid? I really don't know-but it ruined my appetite. I did not mention it to either the lady who took our order, or the cook who prepared my dinner. Instead, I am trying hard to ignore what I just witnessed and chalk it up as a bad experience.

I am giving this place 2 stars for the red salsa, and polite people working there.

Otherwise, it would be 1 star for the food alone.
