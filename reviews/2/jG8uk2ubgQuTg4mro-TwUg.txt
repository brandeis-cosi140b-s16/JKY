I don't usually write reviews unless I'm extremely impressed or unsatisfied with my experience. This so happens to be one of those times.

I have been here one other time before today - in that particular instance the food was great and the service was just ok. No issues and I never thought about not returning. Today however was absolutely unacceptable. I had family visiting from out of town and figured we'd have a nice meal. Right off the bat our server (who I assume was HIGH as a kite) spilled all of our waters all over the table - honest mistake, but it didn't end there. He also forgot my guacamole so we had to tell another server to remind him to bring it out. In addition to that my order was all jacked up. I ordered Carne Asada De Tampico and got something entirely different. He also wasn't cognizant of that fact our plates were just accumulating on the table and didn't offer to take them away. A few of us had a decent amount of leftovers and asked for some boxes - he brought out just 2 of the smallest ones possible because he didn't possess enough common sense to gauge if the leftovers would fit in said boxes. We sent him back to get larger ones.

In summary this place has great food but the service is lacking hardcore. The servers are all high and in slow motion and can't seem to get anything right. He did knock off 10% from the bill but really it should have been more. The server was #41 Robert - if you get this guy do yourself a favor and ask for someone else, and even then it probably won't make much of a difference.

Might not ever return. Do not recommend.
