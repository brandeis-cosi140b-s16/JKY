The carnitas was tasteless except for a red sauce that ... Was so-so at best. The carnitas was also over cooked and tough, and way over priced at $14 for what they served. My husband said the tamale wasn't very good . But the most questionable item was the tortilla chips . We luv fresh warm tortilla chips and salsa... These chips were cold and frankly reminded me of the cheap chips you get at a bowling alley ... Straight out of some bag bought from a restaurant supply... 
The service was good and staff friendly... That's why I am posting it as 2 stars instead of one.  Skip this place.
