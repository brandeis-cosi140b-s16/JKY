i always give every restaurant a second chance, but after last night's second chance with dos reales, i have to say i agree on so many points with the rest of the posters--why the eff do people rave about this place?

the food is seriously bland, and it's almost like everything on the menu is just a version of something else on the menu. so there's really not many options, even though the menu looks huge. 

good points are that it's cheap, and that the first time i went, the margarita was strong as hell (not so the second time--i had two and wasn't even buzzed). the cheese dip is good, and the staff is always friendly. 

even so, though, none of these make up for the quality of the food. sorry. i really wanted to like you, dos reales, but it jut ain't happenin'.
