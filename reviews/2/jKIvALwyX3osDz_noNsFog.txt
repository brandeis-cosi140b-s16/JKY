Filiberto's in disguise!

Alright, slightly more generic than Filibertos. The shrimp tostada was too sweet (yeah...sweet!?) for me, like some sort of cheap ceviche loaded on to a corn tortilla. Silly me wasn't expecting it to be a cold meal, but whatever, that's my mistake. Also, the carne asada fries are made with crinkle fries that are salted before everything else gets thrown on. It's gross, and their asada tastes like day-old steak soaked in brine.

I've gotta learn how to starve before going on these drunk Mexican food binges. Or just give my leftovers to Cornell.
