Rating is for the food.  I love the space, decor, the outdoor grill/tortilla cooks, etc.  However the food is simply blah.  I was there when it opened and have been back about 8 times now and it seems the food is progressively more ho hum, which is odd since they aren't serving blue hair seniors from Iowa.

I just returned from a meal with east coasters unfamiliar with good Mexican and they even thought it was bland.  They also loved the whole look and feel... just not the food.  It's a shame, since this really could be a regional gem where you take visitors (and locals who rarely leave their burbs) and really wow them.  I keep going back because the next door market is also one of those unique-to-PHX experiences.  However Tradiciones is not delivering on the food.  The menu sounds good.  It looks good.  It tastes like buffet fare - dumbed down for the masses.   If only they brought in some recipes and/or cooks from any number of divey but great tasting places nearby, it could be so much better... and that's the shame.
