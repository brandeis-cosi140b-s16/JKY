I ordered delivery today for lunch, as I wasn't getting out of the office before quitting time. 

I ordered the Asada fries. $9 isn't too shabby for a messy pile of yumminess so I went with it. Plus a $3 delivery charge. Plus a tip. I gave specific instructions on how to get into the building, and where to meet me. I paid before my food was delivered with a card - first mistake. 

The delivery man called me - as requested - stating he was at my location. I looked for him on my floor. Nothing. Then he told me "oh, I'm in the lobby - I won't come up to your floor - I'm too busy." Ummmm... Ok? I gave a hefty tip for you to BRING ME the food I ordered. Nearly 100% of my tab! 

So I go to the lobby to pick up my own food. The delivery man said he was busy, and didn't want to go through the scanners. Ok. At least TELL someone that beforehand. Customer service. You know, making sure the customer is happy? Apparently customer service must be dead... Right along with chivalry.

Get back to my office, and my order is wrong - I received nachos, not Asada fries. *sigh* 

On the plus side, the food was decent. So 1 star for shoddy service, and a +1 for good food. That's all I can give, here.
