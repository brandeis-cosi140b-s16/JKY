I don't get the hype for this place. The food is fine, usually consistent in quality. The staff is usually very friendly and helpful. But that's about it. There are much better Mexican restaurants than this place... Maybe it's because there is nothing else around and the "decor" is rustic and different that people like it so much... Who knows.
