The atmosphere on the patio is nice with the fountains but it isn't nice having dinner to the smell of chlorine.  The food was ok and the server had no problem honoring the yelp complimentary chips and salsa.  We each got the green chili chicken burrito.  The food was laden with cheese and not for the cholesterol conscious.  It was hard to taste much besides the cheese and the spice but, there was chicken in there too.  If it weren't for the patio/water feature, I don't think this place would be in business.
