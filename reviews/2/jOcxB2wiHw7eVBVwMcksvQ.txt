I was in Chino Bandido on Sunday at around 1PM.  I've eaten there before and knew what to expect from the food and atmosphere.  I was sadly disappointed this time around.

It took 30 minutes for my order of a combo and a burrito to be brought out.  They were busy, but not THAT busy.  It seemed for a good 10 minutes nothing was being brought out and then 1 by 1 items were coming out every 3-5 minutes.  

How long does it take to plate up food which is already prepared?

The restaurant was a disaster too.  There was food all over the the empty tables, food on the ground, trash left everywhere.  One of the tables had a completely spilled drink on it.  The utensil area was demolished.  There was trash and spilled drinks all over it.  There was no forks to be found anywhere, I had to go ask for one at the front.  There was a sauce container that spilled in the box with with the other sauces and it was a big gooey mess!  The entire hour I was in the restaurant, I didn't see anyone cleaning up or restocking the utensil area.

Finally, the food.  After 30 minutes of waiting, they brought out the food.  The food was tepid warm at best, not hot.  Like it had been sitting for awhile.  I had egg foo yong, it looked like jelled brown snot sitting on the patty, nothing very appetizing about it all.  The, patty itself was pretty tasty as was my chicken dish I had too.

Hello Manager!!  Wake up, I don't care if you got busy, my dining experience shouldn't suffer because there are customers in your store.  There's a lot of other places in Chandler I can spend $15 at for lunch.

This isn't the same place Guy Fieri reviewed on his show.  I classify this as a DIRTY DIVE!!!  

Clean it up and figure out how to handle a rush better.  It'll be awhile for me to come back, if I do at all!
