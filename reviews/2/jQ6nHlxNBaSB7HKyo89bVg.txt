This used to be my go-to Roberto's, and sadly, I will not go to any Roberto's again after this.  The staff at this location is fantastic, the restaurant is super clean, the service is fast. If I could give them a separate rating for service, I would. Five stars.

But, much like walking in on your parents in their bedroom, what I saw two days ago cannot be unseen.  The carne asada burritos used to be the very best thing on the planet, and craving one, I popped in to order one.  When the woman making my burrito moved, my jaw dropped and stomach sank. No longer is it fresh beef, or even "we made this earlier and are warming it" beef.  It's canned, cubed beef out of an......industrial can.  There they sat, stacked two high and two deep--huge cans with large print stating loudly, "Canned Cube Beef", and in front of me, my sacred burrito being made with the same.

Sadly, the taste, no matter what they may have done to it, still tasted like higher end canned dog food (it was a dare, and I needed the cash, thank you), and the aftertaste was God-awful.    It brought a tear to my eyes.

I'm sorry it had to end this way, Roberto's.  It's you, not me.
