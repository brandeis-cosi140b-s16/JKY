I specifically asked the guy at the counter if the chicken was white meat and he said yes, they use chicken breast. So I ordered the chicken Diablo and it was gross. The chicken was not only dark meat but grizzly, etc.  They have a sign at the counter that says they'll give you free chips and salsa for a positive review. Now I know why there were so many positive reviews because it wasn't very good. However, the staff was friendly
