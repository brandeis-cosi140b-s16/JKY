I got a carne asada burrito, a ground beef taco and a tamale this afternoon. The taco was decent, the tamale was good but had beans in it which was unusual but still yummy. I was however disappointed with the burrito. I found 3 different hairs in it... But not being much of a germaphobe I just picked them out. The meat had a good flavor but I had to spit almost every piece out because most of it was just grizzle. The rice was so mushy that its texture was more like mashed potatoes, and the hot sauce was really watery....mostly water actually. I wont be back
