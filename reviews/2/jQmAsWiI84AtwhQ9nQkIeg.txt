This place is mediocre at best. I love Mexican but I won't be coming back here again. My refried beans were a dull grey color and were not spiced or even salted. I ordered a number two which is a bean burrito enchilada style with a beef tamale. The tamale was so dry I couldn't even finish it. Simply put, I don't recommend it. There are so many better Mexican restaurants in Phoenix. Never again.
