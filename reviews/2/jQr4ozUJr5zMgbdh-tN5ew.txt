To begin, I know better... With that said, I was hoping Yelp would do me right, but it simply left me $15 dollars poorer.

I ordered around the menu but that still did very little to spare me the American Meal. The restaurant should be labeled American w/a slight influence from south of the border.
Their only saving grace was the server in which I got to chat in Spanish with. She un-Americanized the menu for me as best as possible but You can be sure that w/out her, the place would really have to turn my arm to earn 1 star.

Bloody disappointing & yes I know better, for I am in PA & not CA...
