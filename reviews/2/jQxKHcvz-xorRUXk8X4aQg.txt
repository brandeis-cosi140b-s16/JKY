I have had way better. The chips are boring. The regular salsa tastes like it was out of a jar or possibly just not seasoned very well. The hot salsa tastes like spicy ketchup got mixed into some salsa. The refried beans are probably canned (just judging by the way they curdle on the plate almost immediately) and the rice is nothing to write home about. I had the green chili burro enchilada style with green sauce. I'm not sure what in that was seasoned weird (possibly the sauce, but it may have been the green chili pork) and it just did NOT taste like Mexican food. I didn't really care for it at all and left 2/3 of my burrito untouched. 

My mom goes there regularly and gets a burrito filled with veggies covered in red sauce. The red sauce is much better than the green sauce. The veggies taste awesome - especially the carrots - and she really like it. My step-dad gets a spinach enchilada which he really likes.

I am not really keen on going here again. Everything but the veggies in my mom's burrito was so... bland.It did not taste like "real" Mexican food to me. Not even Amercanized Mexican food. I am sure I will go again because my mom likes it, but I will be sharing her veggie burrito and staying far away from the green chili pork.
