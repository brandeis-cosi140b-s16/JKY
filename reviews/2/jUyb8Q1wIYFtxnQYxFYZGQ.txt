Not too impressed. Was here with a large party of around 25. The chips on the table were a mix of corn chips & flour chips. Did not care for the flour. Our server was not super friendly and rarely smiled but she sure kept the alcohol flowing! I think our group had 7 rounds of shots. She pushed the house brand tequila, which most didn't care for but shots were HUGE. I was the DD and had to ask for water 4 times before I walked downstairs & got it myself. Guacamole had lettuce in bottom of bowl so it wasn't as full as it looked. The quest was tasty. The 'hot sauce' was firey but not much actual flavor. I would not return.
