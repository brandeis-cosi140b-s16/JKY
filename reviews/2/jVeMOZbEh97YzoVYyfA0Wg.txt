I have been a customer of chipotle for over 10 years now and this I by far the worst chipotle I have ever been to. The management staff is terrible and treats their employees like your ordering from an assembling line. No personality at all. When ordering you can hardly understand them because all they focus on is getting to the next person. And when you do answer them back, they don't even listen and have to repeat yourself two or three times. Get ready to have your blood pressure raised while ordering. The food is always never ready and I find myself always having to wait for something to be cooked. Usually I wouldn't mind waiting for hot food, but it comes with a cost. And that cost is the rest of your burrito is cold from sitting waiting for the food in the assembly line. 

Overall, because of the poor management and atmosphere I am giving this a 2 out of 5.  The only reason I am giving it a 2 is because, well its chipotle and I love the food for over 10 years. Fix the management and allow the customers to have an enjoyable experience and I will come back. I'm tired from ordering from a manager who spends more time yelling to hurry hurry to his employees to get to the next person and eating cold food. Can't wait for the location in Stonecrest to open!
