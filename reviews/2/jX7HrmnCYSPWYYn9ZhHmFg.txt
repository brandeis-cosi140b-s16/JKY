Went for lunch with some friends met up here and there was mixed reviews.  I ordered the carne asada burrito - because they claimed to be home of the best carne asada in the Valley.  Totally not true.  The burrito was pretty blah, boring, and certainly not the best carne asada.  I was super excited  to see they had street corn and ordered that as well.  Totally disappointing.  I've never had street corn that tasted and looked like it was dipped in mayo.  A little too liberal with the usage of mayo for my taste. 

My friend ordered the special which came with a veggie quesadilla.  It had guacamole in it - that's it.  Nothing else.  It didn't even make sense. 

The salsa was boring.  That's really all there is to say about it.  

All around, it was very average and uninteresting.  Too many other good places in DPHX to go to get quality Mexican food. 

The one saving grace and the only reason I'll even consider going back was the beans that came with my friends special.  I tasted them and they were delicious.  I will for sure come back and try a bean and cheese burrito.
