Found a Cafe Rio and stood in a forever long line on Tuesday for their delicious Barbacoa tacos!! The tacos were so delicious and so were their quesadillas however I was SUPER BUMMED OUT, not to mentioned SUPER GROSSED out to find some kind of a metal cap bolt cap looking thing in my salsa as I went to scoop some out!! I saw another post on here while reading reviews in line that someone found a Piece of plastic Wrap in their salad... Can you say quality check?!
