After reading some positive reviews we decided to give this one a shot.  Ordered Beef Tacos and Chili Colorado and a couple of Corona's.  We found the service to be genuine and considerate.  But unfortunately the food was just okay.  Certainly not bad but nothing real memorable.

We continue to struggle finding good Mexican food in the East Valley.  Just nothing that is really worth hitting up as there are alternative options that win out over a so-so dinner.
