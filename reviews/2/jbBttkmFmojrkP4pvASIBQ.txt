It was average food. Kind if boring. Too many huge chunks of jalape√±o in the guacamole. The quesadilla my mom got was Inedible, full of way undercooked mushrooms. My quesadilla was cheese and it was good. The bean burrito was just what seemed like canned refried beans. It just wasn't that good. I miss Cancun!
