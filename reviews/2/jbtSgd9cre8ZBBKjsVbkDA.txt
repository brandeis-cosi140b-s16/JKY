Locals AVOID!
This place is definitely meant for tourists. 
Horrible service, mediocre food, overpriced, and a complete rip off. Ridiculous priced "yard drinks" - Special Buy 1 Get 1 Free - priced at $20 each after discount. There are no public restrooms (we were directed to the restrooms inside the casino).
