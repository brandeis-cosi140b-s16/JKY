I've loved this restaurant chain ever since I first tried them in Chicago back in '05, but as you will soon tell from this review not all Chipotle locations are created equally.  This is for the Providence location (which is the last one I visited) yet it also applies to the Pineville-Matthews and South End locations where I've had the same problems.

For a chain that prides itself on the numerous combinations of burritos they can create I've consistently had issues customizing mine, from dumbfounded looks (yes, I do want double veggies with no rice) to skimpy portions (barely half a spoonful of chicken).  I haven't encountered the same pride in product quality that I've seen in the Chipotle's outside of Charlotte.

Continuing on that thread, the food prep lines can't seem to get their act together.  They don't communicate or know how to keep the food going which causes delays and pissed off customers and don't get me started on when they try to roll the damn burrito at the end.  

If that wasn't enough the spotty customer service is the expired icing on this half-baked cake.  Many of the employees obviously don't care to be there which is a weird juxtaposition against those who are trying their hardest.  In the end the inconsistency is just plain frustrating. 

The only reason that I gave this place 2 stars is because even a poorly put together Chipotle burrito is decent and they serve beer.  Yup, that's about it.  Walk in with low expectations and you'll always have a great time.  If you want the real Chipotle experience then drive to another city.
