I'm sure my bad experience with the tacos left me with great disappointment. I did not try the burritos here but what I saw people carry out were ginormous in size. I was severely let down by the over salted taco meat here. My advice is to skip the tacos and go for the burritos and the chimichanga. The Carne Asada plate my brother had wasn't that great either, it was just a lot of food on the plate with plantains with very little to no flavor at all.

If you're looking for tacos go to Mercado Juarez, if you want burritos then this is probably where you want to be.
