I had gone to this restaurant several times and this will be the final trip.  It was pretty good when it first open.  I usually get the torta w/beef fajitas.  It's more costly than it should be but the quality was decent.  I stopped ordering it because the last time I got it, the meat was not grilled how I remember it to be.  This visit, I decided to try the chicken taquito plate.  They were stale taquitos stuffed with flavorless shredded chicken.  I barely ate anything on my plate because quite frankly, the quality had dropped big time.

Service was good and yes, you do get chips and salsa.  Not good enough for me to return, however.
