Came here for drinks/snacks on A Friday around noon. The place was dark and had way too much empty space. 

We had a group of 8 so we ordered the party platter - which is a ridiculous amount of food for $40. Everything was way too greasy, while the meat was ironically pretty dry. 

I also got the margarita, which came in a huge fishbowl-sized glass and was plenty strong. So come for the drinks, get food elsewhere.
