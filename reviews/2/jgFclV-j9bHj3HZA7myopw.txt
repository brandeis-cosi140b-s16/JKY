Worst food ever. You're better off at Taco Bell. Ordered a combo and each item was in a separate box (rice, beans, etc) instead of together like it should be. Food is bland and flavorless. Filiberto's is superior, so that's saying s lot. I've come twice hoping it will improve, but it just gets worse. I won't return.
