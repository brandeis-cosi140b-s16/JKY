Stopped for a quick lunch yesterday and both husband and I thought it wasn't all that great.

We both got a burrito with guacamole and pico de gallo. I've had better meat before. It didn't even taste like asada and it was definitely way too salty. I was thirsty for hours.

There's a salsa bar (we tried a red salsa and a green one. Green one was OK. The red one tasted too much like tomato sauce. Nothing special) but you get no chips with your burrito, you have to pay extra for them.

It was our first time there and most likely we won't go back. There are better Mexican restaurants in town.
