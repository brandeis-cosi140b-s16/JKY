Did they change owners or recipes? This place has been a long time staple for our office lunches for about four years now. It's usually exceptional but the last two visits we were surprised that the food was not as good. The chicken quesadilla which is usually excellent did not have grilled chicken as usual. It was sliced from what tasted like a roast chicken. The avocado was blackened and you now have to ask for the avocado crema which used to be included. Even the salsa tastes different. Bring the tried and true back an we will return :(
