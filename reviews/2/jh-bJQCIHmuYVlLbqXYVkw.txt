Food was acceptable, but the service was not. Wasnt even a busy night and it took nearly an hour to bring out three burritos. After 45 minutes our server claimed our food was coming out soon, then a few minutes later the manager asks us if we need anything...yea we still need our food. Another 10 minutes passes and the two tables ajacent to us (who arrived maybe 40 minutes after us) had their drinks and food already. Manager brings out our food, which is luke warm by now) does not offer an apology for the delay. Took forever to get the check, and even longer to get the receipt and go. Maybe this place has more charm when youre there for the liquor and not a meal.
