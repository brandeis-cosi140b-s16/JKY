Well....the supreme breakfast burrito is good, but that's about it. I've been here 3 times since open...each time the service has been slow and borderline rude. If they want customers to come on 30 minute lunch breaks, or on their way to work, they need to step it up. (Especially considering there are many other options nearby: Los Favoritos is only a mile away)
