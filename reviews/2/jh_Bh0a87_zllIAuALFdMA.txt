Don't trust the 3-star or better reviews.... they probably got some local "stuff" in their food.

El Taco Tote is nothing short of being overpriced per the quality.  Perhaps that's because people go there to get free chips and fixings from the salsa bar.  I don't blame them though- I'd probably do the same if I were short on cash.  

Anyways, paying customers dish out around $8-10 per plate.  I tried the "Quatro Tacos" (yes, that's "4 tacos" in ingles) during my first visit.  It tasted decent, but was not filling and of the quality that I expect considering that I could go somewhere like Sweet Tomatoes and get a better overall experience.

So, if one were to use inductive logic, I'd say there are probably better options out there.  Keep searching!  I can't put my stamp of approval on El Taco Expensivo!
