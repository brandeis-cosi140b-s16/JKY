The dining room is loud. I mean, really loud. Conversations bounce off the live walls like ping pong balls. I cannot understand, for the life of me, why a restaurant would not take the easy means to make a dining area sonically comfortable. As for the food, it's the same fare Pasqual's has been serving for decades. Not bad, but not anywhere near as good as the take-out enchiladas I got at a gas station/caf√© in southern New Mexico last year. Their's were covered in a luscious green chile sauce, while Pasqual's merely bore a hint of sauce half-dried on top. I only live two blocks away from this new location, and will not be back.
