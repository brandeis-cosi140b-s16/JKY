Cold food.  Stale chips.  Small portions (she literally had to scrape the bottom of the pan for veggies).  I'd understand if they were busy or if it was nearing closing time, but neither apply.   I probably visit various chipotle's throughout the valley about once a week, and this is by far the worst.  This is probably the 3rd or 4th time I've visited this location (close to home).  I never wrote a review because I don't like to knock anybody, but this experience seems consistent with this location. Only giving the second star because the service was halfway decent.
