I grew up in Phoenix eating at the various Macayo's stores, and have always thought it was a pretty good place to get Mexican food.  I don't know what was going on with this store today, but it was a very disappointing experience.  Six of us went in for a late lunch, about 1:30.  There were a few other tables filled, but nothing that anyone would consider to be busy.  Our waitress, Megan, was very pleasant, but the service was horribly slow for some reason.  She kept trying to smile and make excuses, like another big party, or a full bar, but we could see that was not the case.  It took ten minutes for our water to get there and twenty for drinks.  The food took another 30 minutes, so nearly an hour after we walked in were we able to eat.  In addition, the food was no where near what I have come to expect from Macayo's.  The food was so light on sauce we had to ask for extra enchilada sauce just to get it where it needed to be.  My red chili was tough and there was so little in my burrito I had trouble finding it.  This experience was very poor and I hope that it is not a sign of things to come with Macayo's.  If it is I will have to find another "go to" place for Mexican.
