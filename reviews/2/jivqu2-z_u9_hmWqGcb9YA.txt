First time here. We tried it on a Sunday so we couldn't take advantage of the Happy Hour deals but it looked like they off $2 beers. 
The place has some indoor and outdoor seating as well. Kind of a surfer theme. You order and pay at the counter and take number with you. Your server brings your meals to your table but you get your own plastic silverware and napkins, etc.
They had a couple vegetarian items on the menu. Nothing tasted bad, but I wasn't impressed. The ceviche and chips tasted good, but it was basically red onion, cucumber, and shrimp cocktail diced finely.  The best part was the red sauce it came with. The bean and cheese burrito was so gooey it oozed out of the tortilla making it very messy to eat. The veggie taco was onions, guacamole, and lettuce. When you looked inside it resembled grass clippings. 
Like I said, nothing tasted bad, and I appreciate that they don't cook with lard, but I really wasn't impressed.
