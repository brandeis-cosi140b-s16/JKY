Sometimes in life you face a decision. Should I take a risk and get my burrito here? Or should I drive the extra mile to chipotle?
Today I made the wrong one. This place maked Qdoba look like fine dining. I got a burrito with rice, black beans, carnitas, sour cream, guac, and pico. It was bland! The beans were just beans. The guac was untraceable. All of this could have been redeemed with some cholula or tapatio. 
But alas, there are only two ranchero-made hot sauces available. Hotsauce tyranny. Greenade and flavorcano. Greenade tastes like that stuff they bring you at bad mexican restaurants to dip your cold tortilla chips in. The latter tastes like f*cked up barbeque sauce.
I wish I could say I saved a buck by forgoing qdoba or chipotle, but I did not. I shall never return to Ranchero's Mexican Grill.
