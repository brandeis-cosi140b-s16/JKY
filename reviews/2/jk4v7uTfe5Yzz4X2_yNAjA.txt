I was not impressed at all. I didn't think you could mess up a basic bean and cheese burrito, but these guys did it. On top of the fact that the cashier was not friendly at all, but the ingredients were all separated. I spent 3/4th of the burrito eating just plain beans, then the last quarter had a bunch of cheese and a little beans. I won't go here again even if their other burritos are better. If you can't get a bean and cheese right, you're not even worth time of finding out more.
