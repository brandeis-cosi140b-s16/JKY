Food was ok. Very salty. We ordered cheese crisps, gauc and queso fundido for appys. Was ok, but nothing exceptional. Had carnitos tacos and hubby had enchiladas. Was ok. Not bad at all but not amazing. 
Service was brutal. 20 min to get a table. Over 45 minutes to get tacos after appys. Meal took 90 minutes. Our kids were going nuts and ate taco chips for dinner because they were hungry. Drinks not served on trays. A server carried four drinks over in his hands. Weird. No cutlery in table, had to ask. Server checked on us serval times saying our food was coming repeatedly. My eight year old said "it only takes me about thirty seconds to make a TACO, what's wrong with these people?" Wish it was still Ling and Louie's. We won't come back. There's way better places to eat in Biltmore.
