Service was bad. We had to go find the waitress and explain we would need to leave if we could not get any service Finally that was resolved and we stayed. Wish we had left. The drinks was so-so and served on a plastic water cup. The taco shell and tostada shell were pre-formed store bought.  The chicken was fresh and the lettuce and tomatoes were fresh.  We (3 of us) did not get sick and we finished our meal but we most certainly will not return. SO many other much better choices.
