I'm a huge fan of the company that created Postino, Windsor,  etc so I had no doubt that Joyride was going to be less than fabulous. Wrong! The restaurant is very cute and the drinks were great but that's about it. The food is overpriced and bland. We shared queso dip as an appetizer, and I had a fish taco with "bomb" black beans. The fish taco wasn't bad but it wasn't great. I expected more for the price. The black beans were boring as well. I would skip Joyride and head to Otro Cafe or Blanco Tacos at the Biltmore.
