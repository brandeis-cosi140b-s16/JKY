I was a Regular customer up to today. I didn't mind the service because sometimes you get the good waitresses and sometimes you get the ones with the attitude. But today I went in for a small order and as I was eating I grabbed some crackers and it looked like the wrapper had been bitten by mice. I brought it to the waitress attention and the owner soon came and snapped at me that her restaurant was very clean and that it must have been the kids that come in. There's no way it was kids because the crackers looked like they weren't tampered with the edges of the wrapper were bitten by mice I mean how stupid can you be to not notice that it was mice getting to the crackers. Very upset at how the owner handled the situation and still starting talking crap at how little I was buying. Smh never coming in again.
