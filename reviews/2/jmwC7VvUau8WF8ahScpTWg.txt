Not too impressed, very hard to park nearby, and inconvenient to get to. Food was middle of the road at best, the menu is hard to understand unless you are fluent in Spanish, and prices are definitely not wallet friendly. The waitstaff talked poorly audibly about the person who had arranged our reservation for her birthday party, which I found surprising at such a place. Unless you just want the "trendy" atmosphere of eating at the "new" old downtown, which is about all this place offers, I wouldn't bother.
