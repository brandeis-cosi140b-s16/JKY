Craving some chips, salsa, and a burrito, a small group of us sauntered into Pasqual's earlier this week.  We were immediately seated (in the bar area), and placed an order for some brews.

Two of the brews were unavailable - they had sold out.  Substitutions were made and chips with queso were ordered.

I'm familiar with many styles of queso... but I was shocked by Pasqual's "queso" - it was more like a soft-spread, cream-cheese-infused queso-wannabe.  Rather than a soft, flowing, warm queso, this was cold and hard-packed in a small Solo cup.  Definitely unusual, and largely tasteless.  Two salsas accompanied the "queso" - neither were exceptional.

Dinner orders were placed: taco plate, a chicken fajita burrito, and a veggie burger (don't ask).

The food arrived fairly quickly, and portions were impressive if nothing else.  My burrito was stuffed full of black beans, grilled chicken, and a few veggies.  A massive serving of black beans (not refried - yay!) filled-out the rest of the plate.  The burrito was decent, but again - bland and not remarkable by any means.

The taco plate was covered in shredded lettuce and cheese; I'm told it was "ok."  I won't even comment on the veggie burger because in the end, they're all about the same... frozen-pressed Bocas taste the same no matter which microwave they came from.

The bill arrived; my meal with a few rounds of brews and paying for the chips and salsa was a staggering $36... a little steep given the unexciting nature.

Interior was large, open, and quite noisy.  They do have a great selection of Tequila - I'd like to sample a few at some future time.
