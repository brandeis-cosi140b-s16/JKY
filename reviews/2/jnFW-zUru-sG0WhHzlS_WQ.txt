Meh. I've had chronic tacos in the OC and it tasted so much better than the one here.

The chips were stale.
Salsa lacked flavor.
They skimmed on the amount of meat.
since its in vegas, it's also more expensive but that wouldn't have mattered to me if the quality were the same :/

This review would have just been 1 star, but +1 for giving a lot of guacamole and sour cream
