I went there with my wife and two daughters. Had a little wait no problem expected, had options to be seated outside under the patio. Ok no problem, got our drinks with in 15 min ok it's busy, no big deal. Orderd our food , had guacamole for a app. Made at the table was great, a little chunky  and under seasoned, I'm ok still staying possitve for a good day, no silverware or napkins at the table, ask the waiter to bring some. Puts a pile of forks spoons and knives in the middle of the table. Ok still staying possitve. Then the wait, 38 min ( yes I was timing)  I asked the waiter about the time and said it was coming. 10 min later food came, everyones food was warm at best. Not a good experience for a specail day. If it's a matter of being busy should have not seated people. This location is closed for me.
