I am a visitor to this city from SoCal, of course I wanna try some Mexican food here in Madison Wi. So I went to see how it was like.....

I went in about little bit past lunch time, and asked a girl at the bar for a menu to take a look at, she looked me all wired, there were few seconds of pause, then asked me " do you wanna look at here?" What kind of question was that? Of course I wanna look at the menu there...where else? 

When I was reading the menu I did not feel like ordering from the girl (and there was a man who appeared to work there with her) so I left.

Assuming they are still in business because there are only few Mexican restaurants out here. During my stay in this city, I passed in front of the restaurant so many times, that's why I wanted to give it a try, but with the workers' inconsiderate service and attitude I did not want to. 

Too bad, because for the city, I thought their menu looked great. 

Hope next time when I visit this city, I hope to try their food.
