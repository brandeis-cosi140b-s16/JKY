The food isn't terrible, but not impressive.  I lived in LA for 4 years, so I'm super spoiled when it comes to having good Meixcan food.  We got a burrito, which was just stuffed with fillers such as rice and beans..no thanks.  There was nothing memorable about the taste of it whatsoever.  Who seriously wants a huge burrito like that?  I'd rather have a normal sized one that actually tastes good and isn't filled with crap.  We got the steak fajitas, which were actually pretty decent.  The steak was cooked perfectly as ordered, which I appreciate.  We also got the chips with salsa and guac, which were good, but, come on, it's really not hard to mess those up!  Overall, I'm just not impressed, but I guess you can't really find that great of Mexican food options in Pittsburgh.
