I wanted to like Chica Loca Taco.  I work right on Walnut Street in Shadyside so I've had lunch at every restaurant more times than I can count.  I was super excited to now have a Mexican joint nearby!  Sadly, I have been very disappointed by my recent experiance.  1) I went there during my lunch break, it took them 25min to make me two tacos (beef and chicken).  10min would be acceptable since I know they make everything to order...but I was the only customer at the time!  2) As I mentioned I got 2 tacos, one beef one chicken. The only thing that comes on the tacos is the meat, cilantro, and queso fresca.  I had to pay extra for tomatos, lettuce, salsa, sour cream, and guac.  Therefore my two tacos ended up costing me $11.25!  From now on I'm sticking with William Penn Tavern to get my taco fix on Walnut street, 3 beef tacos for $4 on Monday's and Wednesdays.
