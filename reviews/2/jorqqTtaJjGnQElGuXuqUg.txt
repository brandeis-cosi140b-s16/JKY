Blanco Tacos seems like a great place to enjoy happy hour ... inviting bar that allows you to sit outdoors or indoors, great happy hour prices for both drinks and food... And then there is reality.

I sat down and the bar and was greeted by the bartender, who offered me a dinner menu, asked what I wanted to drink, and asked if I wanted chips and salsa. I ordered a beer in an unfrosted glass, and said I would love some chips and salsa. The beer came as promised. Props for having Torpedo on tap. 

Another couple sat down next to me, were greeted by a bartender, offered the happy hour menu, drink specials, and chips and salsa. The other bartender then came over to me and offered me the happy hour menu when there were now six minutes before the end of happy hour.  And she asked if I wanted chips and salsa. 

The first bartender came back over, and I ordered one of each of the happy hour tacos, and asked if I wanted chips and salsa. Third times the charm right? Wrong...

I did get my happy hour tacos, a second beer at happy hour prices even though the hand had swung past the witching hour but never received chips and salsa. The tacos were very good. Hand made corn tortillas, great fillings. I especially liked the beef with the chipotle. And the carnitas with the salsa verde were very good too. 

In the restaurant industry, attention to detail is what is important. I do not fault the bartenders. They were personable, gracious, and truly represented the business well. I fault the management of this location. You never allow your staff to become this sloppy.
