Visited for lunch today on a Saturday around 3:00 PM. Was a bit concerned walking in as the place is a dive but figured we would give it a shot anyway. There were just two parties eating, one server, and a woman behind the bar. We were not greeted so after a minute of standing we just seated ourselves. The server came by after a few minutes to tell us she would be back in a bit to take our drink order which took about 7 minutes. We ordered tacos and a burrito which were both bland and disappointing. The service was slow, even with just two other parties present. The bathroom was dirty which I generally view as an indication of overall restaurant cleanliness. Based on poor food quality, slow service, and poor cleanliness/ambience, I just cannot recommend Rudy's.
