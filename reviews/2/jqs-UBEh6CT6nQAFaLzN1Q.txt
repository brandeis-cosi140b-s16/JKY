The fact that Carlsbad Tavern has been around so long exemplifies how forgiving people can be of a friendly neighborhood place. Large portions of mostly fried, mostly bland food, with posole and black beans added so that they can call it "New Mexican." Our steak and chicken entrees were disappointingly low in flavor. Our ravenously hungry teenaged male companion gave his cheeseburger and fries two thumbs down and didn't bother to finish. Artificially colored corn chips came from a bag and were slightly stale. Avoid the guacamole--it was made of underripe avocados that had been pur√©ed into a runny cream. Very friendly service and pleasant outdoor seating, but don't go there for the food. But if you love South Scottsdale tacky, you'll appreciate the entryway, a simulated cave entrance, and the moat circling the restaurant.
