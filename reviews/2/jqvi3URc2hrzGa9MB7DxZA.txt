I'm just not sure what to make of Las Fuentes.  My first visit for lunch was really great.  Attentive, prompt service, fresh, hot chips, and yummy entree.  I was excited to have this place so close to our  house.  Second visit, during dinner, was borderline terrible.  My daughter's grilled cheese was basically margarined-up bread with fake cheese slices that were nowhere near melted or even warm.  My husband's entree (a house special, according to our server) was bland, but my bean burrito was fine.  I feel like I could get this same food from one of the other Mexican places around here.
