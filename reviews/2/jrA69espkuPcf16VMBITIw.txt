Was looking forward to having a Mexican restaurant nearby.  Went with family to check Federico's out firsthand.  We'd heard it was an "awesome" franchise so we were jazzed to try some good Mexican food really close to our home!

We were pretty disappointed overall.  

Pros:  It is nearby, decent parking available, simple, clean.  Portions are decent.  Employees were polite.  They had a couple strategically placed tvs and plenty of seating.  Their Horchata is delicious!

Cons:  On the expensive side for a quick place to eat (around $7.00 for a plate and a drink), with 6 of us this added up to the same it would cost to eat at a "fancier" place.
Most of what we tried was very bland.  Small dollop of Sour cream and guacamole extra 69 cents for EACH serving. Adds up to about another $1.38 per person! 

Husband liked his carne asada burrito.  The enchiladas, refried beans and rice were VERY bland.  The beef burritos had sliced green peppers and big chunks of tomatoes (not salsa consistency).  Never had a burrito with green peppers in it!  (and don't care to ever again!)  We left disappointed and like we'd blown  $60.00.  Even our teenagers were unhappy.  No one finished their plate.

We weren't happy, but will try again on Taco tuesdays for $1.00 tacos.  Hubby says he would get carne asada burrito by itself.  

Will update review if/when we try again.  It is a shame, as its close by and we'd heard good things about the franchise!
