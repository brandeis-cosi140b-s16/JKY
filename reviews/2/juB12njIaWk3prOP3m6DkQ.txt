My co-worker and I stopped in for lunch today. I had been here once before maybe six years ago. I ordered the pulled pork quesadilla. The girl behind the counter prepped it and put on the grill and when the time was up to pull it off, the tortilla got stuck, I could already see it was partially well done and falling apart, she really had to scrape to get it off the grill. My advise: PAM cooking spray. 
I thought she was going to suggest to remake or offer a discount. I paid for my meal and sat down to eat. It was so soggy I could not pick it up, I had to use a fork. I can understand that maybe the pork was so juicy thus creating the well done soggy tortilla. The pork was good, but the tortilla part was so mushy and then the cheese just globbed. I pretty much just picked the pork. The guacamole was good. 
I would suggest maybe for the pulled pork entrees, drain the juice, otherwise you just end up with a soggy mess. 

Not the worst I have had and not the best. This would not keep me from coming back, next time I will just ask for the tortilla on the side or maybe some chips.
