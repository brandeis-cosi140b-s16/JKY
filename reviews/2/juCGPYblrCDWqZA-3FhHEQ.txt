I obviously like chipotle food to post one here. The portion size in this chain is ridiculous. though I've been told to ask for more if I need more, they're just simply lazy to fill up the tray and try to make 10 dishes of an empty one and the look in their eyes when ask for more, avoid it if it at all possible . Rushing the customers when there is even no one else in the line is simply rude.
