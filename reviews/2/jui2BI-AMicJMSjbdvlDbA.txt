I was very disappointed.  I really wanted to like this place, being locally owned and run, but the food was not up to par, compared to Cafe Rio or even Chipotle.  I ordered the fish salad and it was saddly breaded and flavorless.  The salad was small and unimpressive.  My wife had the fish taco's and did not like the tortilla nor the fish also.  I sadly would not repeat.
