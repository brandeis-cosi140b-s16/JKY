If you like food seasoned with half a can of salt then this is your place. If you like your food being served to your husband and your kid and wait 30 minutes for your plate, then this is the place for you! The cashier was so apologetic and gave me a desert for free to try to make up for it at least. But Id expect WAY better for $45. At this rate and flavor, Filiberto's or Taco Bell would have been a better choice.
