Probably one of the worst Chipotle locations that I have visited.  It's crammed in a small ass hole in the wall beneath a McDonald's on the Vegas strip.  It's combined with a Panda express or some other fast food Chinese food joint.  We stopped in for a lunch on a Thursday afternoon.  We were one of the lucky ones to actually find a table.  The food didn't taste as fresh as it could have been either.  There are a boat load of choices for cheap grub on the strip, I should have followed my gut and skipped out on Chipotle.  You've been warned!
