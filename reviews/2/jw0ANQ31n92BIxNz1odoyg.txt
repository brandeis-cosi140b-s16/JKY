First off, the service is great. The guy at the counter taking orders is incredibly friendly and professional. Loved his attitude! The restaurant is clean and there's plenty of space for indoor seating. 

Unfortunately, my quesadilla was a disaster. It was all meat and no cheese. The bits of carne asada were falling out all over the place so I didn't really get a substantial bite of my quesadilla. Its a great size for a meal but it was a pretty disappointing assembly.
