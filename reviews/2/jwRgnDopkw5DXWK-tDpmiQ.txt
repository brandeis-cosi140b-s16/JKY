The food was mediocre and service here is pretty bad.  We waited ~15 minutes to be seated, which was odd since there were many open tables and it wasn't busy.  Hire more staff if this is an issue.  Also, the server was extremely slow and inattentive.  Our drinks would sit at the bar for a long time before another server would finally bring them to us (and it wasn't because our server was busy with other tables).  Here's a novel idea....if you give good service and pay attention to the customers, you'll get a larger gratuity and the restaurant will make more money!   We decided to pay the bill and go elsewhere to finish our dining experience. Definitely won't be returning.
