This chipotle is located inside the Fashion Show Mall.

I rarely eat there. It's my least favorite place to eat at the Fashion Show Mall.

To begin with it's always crowded, and you can rarely find a place to sit. The dining room is cramped, and there's rarely any available seats in the mall area.

It's always very loud in there. So loud it's almost impossible to hear the people taking your order. I usually have to say, "What?" or "Excuse Me?" many times while ordering. 

It's also very expensive, and they don't offer a mall employee discount. There are 2 other Mexican Restaurants in the mall. One facing the strip next to RA Sushi, and another in the food court. There are many other restaurants within feet from there, and they offer discounts.

On a brighter note... The quality of food is up to standards, and it's usually fairly clean. The employees do put in an effort to constantly clean.
