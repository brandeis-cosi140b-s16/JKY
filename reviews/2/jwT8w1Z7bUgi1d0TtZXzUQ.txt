Nothing spectacular on the menu, the gas station location is a royal pain (parking especially), and they lack some basic Mexican food items on the menu.  About the only good thing I can say is that the daily specials are often a screaming deal, such as a bean burrito for $1 (no cheese though, and they wouldn't let me add cheese, even at a nominal cost).
