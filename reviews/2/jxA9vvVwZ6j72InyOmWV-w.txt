The food was sum what edible and we did receive refills on drinks. The wait for everything else was horrible and they weren't even busy. It took so long to get the check or even get eye contact with a server that we could have easily walked out and skipped paying. They also over charge for the quality of food they provide. My advice is to take a 15 minuet trip to Rock Hill to exit 82 B and eat at El Cancun. They are cheaper and have a higher quality in everything.
