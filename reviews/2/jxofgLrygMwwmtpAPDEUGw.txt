Even though it appears to have stayed in the family, we all wish Roberto had procreated a lot less* and thereby our lovely valley marketplace would permit for a better contender when it comes to overpriced, shitty California-Mexican food. 

(*Keep it in his pantalones.) 

This specific Robertos takes the cake for shittiness. Dirty space, indifferent service (whether one orders in English or Spanish, scoffs; what is the point of knowing Spanish then?), and even featuring the shittiest agua fresca I have ever tasted in my entire fucking, miserable life.** 

(**It is like they went to the neighbourhood WalMart, purchased the horchata they sell there, and then felt they should thin it out, so these cheap bastards watered that already-watery shit. Goddammit.) 

Why am I paying 9$ for a Carnitas or Asada plate with nasty rice, nastier habichuelas,*** and barely human-grade meat? I would find this grade of meat inferior to even feed my cat. How is this location still in business? 

(***We call them that; bugger off.) 

Avoids the one-star by managing to not kill me via foodborne illness. Congratulations Robertos Taco Shop on Rainbow near Charleston! And who does Taco Wednesdays anyway? (Inutil pedazo de mierda m√°s ....)
