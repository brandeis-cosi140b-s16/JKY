It's a freaking chain but they do have decent food and good margaritas.  Unlike every other location of this chain I've been to across the country this one has some stupid rule that they have a limit on the number of margaritas you can buy...   Seriously a limit of THREE?  Do I look like an 80 pound sorority girl tasting booze for the first time or I'm I still actually a 200+ pound old rugby player, honorably discharged army vet, seasoned party professional and citizen of New Orleans that finds downing three of these things easier than Cortes conquering the Aztecs?  I  lived next to the original location of this chain in Austin and I never had to contend with such a ridiculous policy.  No other place in Tempe seems to have such a stupid policy.  The margaritas are good but they are FAR from being high octane potent!   I can understand if someone is stupid drunk being cut off but just having a blanket policy that they are going to limit the number of drinks you can buy is just plain anti-capitalist and un-American!  All I can figure is they are attempting to discourage this from becoming a college hangout...  Ah well at least there are many better LOCAL joints at a better value that don't ration out their drinks in the area.
