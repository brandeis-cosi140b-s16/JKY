First time here....decided what to get and the line staff was less than helpful. 
1. A coworker came in behind us and they were more interested in helping him and left our tacos sitting on the grill while talking to him. 
2. I made a comment and they said "oh" and then let it sit there. The lady at register came and finished the meal but you were out of pico and nobody knew where any was. Then the "manager" said some was being made but didn't offer to get us any once it was done.
3. Then we watched the entire crew eat donuts and try the pico they just made with chips. 
4. The lady making tortillas walked out onto the floor with dough in her hand looking at someone in the parking lot.
5. The lady making tortillas walked over to the bathroom area with gloves on to use her cell phone. Then go back, eat more chips and start making tortillas again.
6. Did I mention eating donuts? Because now they are doing it again, walking around the store.
7. Trash cans are over flowing and nobody is cleaning the tables....just sitting around with nobody in line to help.
8. Now the "manager" is putting her hair up with gloves on.
9. Now the next shift is arriving, I can only hope this crew is better!
10. Wait, I was wrong! This employee has gloves on but putting her hair up and fixing her hairnet. Then logs in and now goes and does someone's food with the same gloves on.

The manager has no control over the employees, they run her and the restaurant.
Sometimes you wish you worked for the health department so you could write them up!
