Place kind of reminds me of a bigger version of Taco Bell. Rice is too bland and the beans are ok. I did order the Sonora carnitas and they did have a nice flavor. It seemed it needed to be cooked more and needed a little more seasoning.  The service was good and the prices are reasonable. This place has potential. But it's not there yet.
