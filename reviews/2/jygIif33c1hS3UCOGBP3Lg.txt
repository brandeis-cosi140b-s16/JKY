I had two chicken tacos and two carne asada tacos. Got charged white boy prices because my 4 tacos and a water cost me $11. 

The food wasn't as good as my previous visits. The pastor was prepped, not fresh off the spit. He chicken taco was good. Salsa, as always with these guys, was the star. Green salsa is spicy, but full of good garlic bite too.
