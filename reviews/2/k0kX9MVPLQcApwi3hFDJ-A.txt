I came here three days in a row when it first opened. I work in the Venetian and i was stoked! Service was good but guac is $2 extra. I usually dont have a problem here but it was a bleh day and i was a $1 short of my order:( so dumb but i offered to come back with the money and tip. The cashier asked her supervisor what to do and he said he'd just give it to me. But then, he rolled his eyes. I also work in retail and i know rolling your eyes at a customer is one of the worst things you could do. I felt really bad and was going to go back anyways but i didnt want to run into that supervisor again. The food didnt taste as good as usual. So, i probably will avoid this chipotle and spend my $10+ somewhere else.
