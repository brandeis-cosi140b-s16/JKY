I will never go back there again un fortunately. We had 10 in our group, not all arrived at the same time. We had to go up front and get her own menus there were only two on the table for the two that arrived first. It took forever for our drinks to be ordered and delivered and the same with the food. The food was not that good, it lacked flavor and most of the dishes were overcooked and dry. Staff was not friendly.
