Ok fajitas Sonora. A lot of grizzled meat (plenty of uneatable fat and grizzle) smothered in BBQ sauce. Too sweet. Not what I expected. Not like traditional fajitas. Waiter was not attentive and struggled to keep us with our needs. And we are low maintenance. Not sure how this place stays in business.
