Long day at the Office.  On my was Home, I Ordered 2 Dinners To GO for a Well deserved Friday Night TV Feast.   I stayed away from the Hot Items because  I prefer a Mild Spice and ordered the Garlic Shrimp$13.95.  The Shrimp were Nice size and  perfectly cooked in a gravy that was way too heavily black peppered.  The second Item was the Rellano which was Delicious but small.  Obviously, You need a thick wallet to leave full.  Perhaps, I was still hungy because the left out the Tortilla's in My Order.  Had a discovered that they were missing prior to leaving,   I would have gone back as Tortillas may have been the missing link to the Entree's desirability.  John  Phoenix, AZ
