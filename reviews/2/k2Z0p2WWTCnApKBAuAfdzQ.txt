I have been to this location before and the staff is always very nice and friendly but we experienced something very different this time we went. From the moment we arrived our server was rude to us. She never told us her name (She has short dark redish hair) I am a server and I understand that you can have a bad night but you shouldnt take it out on other customers. The bar was about half full so it wasnt like it was extremely busy but it took over 20 mins to get our drinks every time we put in an order. We ended up after the 3rd round of drinks just ordering from the bar. It took over 40 mins to get the chips and salsa we ordered. She also didnt know the prices of drinks. One of the members of our group was paying cash instead of starting a tab with a card and she kept telling her a different price for the same drink every time she order another round. To top it off she spilt a drink all over two people at our table plus someones phone. She didnt even apologize. Bartenders were very nice and there was a server with blonde hair and dark framed glasses that was extremely nice as well.
