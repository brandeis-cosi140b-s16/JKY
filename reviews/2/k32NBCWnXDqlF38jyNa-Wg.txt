First time to this Franchise and this location. Well lit, in strip mall, good parking and no line at 7:30 pm. I ordered a Taco meal, menu did not specify how many Taco's included. You are asked soft or crispy tortilla ( make sure your tortilla is steamed nice a hot ), by the time I started to eat mind, it was cold. Next choose your meat, ( make sure meat is stirred ) my meat was cold. Next you get to choose, lettuce, salsa, sour cream, guacamole ( extra cost ). Needless to say my Taco's was cold and soggy ( to much salsa ). But my beer was cold! My friend had a chicken Burrito, it was okay, not warm, soggy, taste was okay. The employees tried to be friendly but I could tell they did not want to be there. Total for this visit-meal 1 Taco meal, 1 Burrito, 1 Beer and 1 small fountain drink was $20.00.
