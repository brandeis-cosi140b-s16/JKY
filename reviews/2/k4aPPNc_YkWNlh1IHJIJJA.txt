i enjoyed the food to a small degree, some parts were amazing and others were not very appetizing.  The service was absolutely not great.  That was the absolute problem with this establishment.  The waiter was incredibly rude and condescending.  I was not happy with that and our table and him almost got in an argument with him.  The prices were also extremely high.  It wasn't worth what we paid.
