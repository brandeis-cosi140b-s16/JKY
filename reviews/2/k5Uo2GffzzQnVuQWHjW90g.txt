I'm sorry, Bibianos, but this just was not that good. I got a groupon and ordered takeout. We ordered the green tamale with a cheese enchilada and the taco and enchilada. The tamale was pretty good, but very mushy. Everything else was just very bland. I would rather eat at filibertos. I'm sad because this place is the closest Mexican restaurant to my house but it just was not that good. It was not gross, but it was very forgettable.
