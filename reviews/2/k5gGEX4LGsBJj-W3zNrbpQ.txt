The food is nothing special and a little overpriced. Seafood doesn't seem really fresh. I actually prefer the Mexican markets taqueria next door, better food and prices. The only saving grace for this place is the drinks. They have some of the best preparadas in Vegas. So go here for the drinks but there are many better food options in the area.
