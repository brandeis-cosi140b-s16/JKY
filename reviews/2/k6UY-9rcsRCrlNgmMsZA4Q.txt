Disappointing. Ordered a chicken taco plate, and was only able to eat part of one taco; the chicken was that bland. By bland I mean they had obviously boiled the chicken in unseasoned water for hours. It tasted like Styrofoam, and was just as dry. My boyfriend thought the burrito was bland as well. 

The reasons I give it two stars instead of one is that the chips are really good, fresh made and hot. The salsa is on the watery side, but flavorful. The nacho dish was good as well. 

They have several premium margaritas, starting at $8, which look really good as well. 

The restaurant itself has been remodeled a bit, and it's pretty cute now. Service is friendly and fast, and the food presentation is lovely. If they would devote the same time and passion to the FOOD, this would be a good restaurant. 

In short, go here for the nachos and margaritas.. That's it.
