I can't say this place is bad because it's not.  It's just not that good, either.  We had the steak tacos and the chicken mole yesterday and it was just "meh."  Edible but that's about it.   I will say that the medium Margarita was pretty big and tasty and the mohito I had was really good.  The service was relatively good but the food was just uninspired.  I don't think we'll go back.
