Appeared to be a fun Rocky Point-style place that served food.  No one in the open-air perimeter had anything on plates on their tables!  (?)  Drinks were available with a trip to the bar--the "margaritas" are served in plastic containers for a history of misguided yoots catapulting the glass ones too much and the bottle of Dos Equis was luke-w.

If you enjoy a pounding heavy bass "inner-city" music, massive heavies mingling with the crowd (though friendly) and the Chandler PD standing by waiting, waiting...around 10 pm, then this is where you need to be.  The crowd seemed polite enough--have no idea why this is the gathering place it must be.

Not for us--maybe the atmosphere is different during the week.
