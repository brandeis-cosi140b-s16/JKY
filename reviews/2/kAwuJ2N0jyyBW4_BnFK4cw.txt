My family and I recently relocated here and were excited to try something new. The name is about the only positive thing this establishment has going for it. 

The waiter brought menus and as we attempted to order our drinks, he turned and walked away. I could understand if the place was slammed, but there were two tables with a total of 11 patrons in the restaurant, 4 of them being seated at the bar.

Once we placed our drink orders, the service was quick, but sub par. Our waiter walked by our table of empty drink glasses several times and we still had to ask for refills. The food was mediocre, but nowhere near "world famous nachos" as they proclaim. We were served a plate of toppings on a very tiny bed of soggy chips. 

If you enjoy subpar service, mediocre food with ridiculous prices attached, this is definitely the place for you.
