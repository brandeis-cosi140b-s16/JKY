Everytime I have gone here I always say I am going to a different one. But, I come back for the convienece  they are  just down the street. They are always out of Flan even first thing when they open they don't have it. My shells to my chicken tacos are always broken and lately lots of grissel in my taco. The staff isn't really nice either. They care more of talking to each other than taking my order or even my money to pay. I need to stick to my words and go to the one on Silverado Ranch they are nice and always have what I want.
