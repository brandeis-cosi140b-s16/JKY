This was my first visit here. Its close to where I live. I was hoping to like this place because there aren't many mexican food places around.  Went thru the drive through. No one was in line before or after me. I got my "warm" horchata in a cup. No ice. It wasn't even slightly cool. I  had to ask for a cup of ice. The horchata tasted nothing like horchata should taste. It was awful. I got my drink right away but the food took forever.  I thought oh good itll be fresh. Wrong.. food was bareky warm. It tasted just ok. Nothing special. No smiles at the window. Just handed me the food and closed the window. I still needed napkins and a fork.  I wont be returning.  Gordos
