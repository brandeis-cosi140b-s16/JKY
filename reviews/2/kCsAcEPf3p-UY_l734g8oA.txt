I went here on the 4th of July with a huge party (my family). When we entered they had a kids pool full of nasty water up front because their roof was leaking...not so nice. The waiters were nice, allowing us to go to the bar to order our apps and drinks in order to get hh pricing and dealing with our giant party. Unfortunately, the food at Macayos is just not very good and is WAY overpriced. I got the baja chicken quesadilla and it was fairly dry and bland. It also took a huge amount of time to get our food (but I understand that due to our party size and the fact that it was a holiday). If it were up to me, I probably would not eat at Macayo's again....but I know I'll probably end up back there at some point. Please don't let your friends convince you to come here! With all of the Mexican food options in Phoenix, there is no reason to come here.
