I was excited to try "Rock Taco" but I was not impressed: the floor was dirty (Monday with several employees just standing around)... It was mostly empty, but it still took over 30min to get our simple "happy hour" apps. The food was unremarkable. They have a few "rock" posters up, play some rock on the jukebox, and the walls are black - maybe this is more "rockin" at night?
