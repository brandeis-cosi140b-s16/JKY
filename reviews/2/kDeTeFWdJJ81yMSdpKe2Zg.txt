Drove up to Speaker Box and spoke very clearly and slowly I wanted 7 Chicken Taco's with **Mild Sauce & a bag of Cucumbers " ... with my order.  Two Cars a head of me only.  When I got to the window I had to wait 5 - 8 minutes and then when I got home " no Mild Sauce & no Cucumbers ".  Never leave here without checking your orders 1st.  (And any complaints ... there is a phone number at the pick-up window to call when your not a happy camper.)  
I wouldn't call this place  " Fast Food " either.  You'll have to wait more than U would at a Jack-In-The-Box for sure.
And yes, as another person indicated pre-made at times.  Previously got the Chicken Taco's on the Wednesday's Special for .99 cents and it was obvious when I got home the were not fresh "Hot Made", they were Ice Cold from being pre-made refrigerated .... Order " Fresh Hot " .
