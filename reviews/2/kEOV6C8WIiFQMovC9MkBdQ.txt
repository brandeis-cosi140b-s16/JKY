Used to love this place, but it continues to decline with every visit. Our visit last week was terrible. The line wasn't even long and it took an eternity. God forbid an online order comes in, they will stop the line inside and work on that order without as much as telling you to wait a minute. They just start ignoring you. Beans and rice were completely dried out and had a chewy, crunchy texture. Speed up the lines and don't serve old food. A Costa Vida is opening up across the parking lot, work on the customer service while you can!
