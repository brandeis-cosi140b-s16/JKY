I generally like Macayo's, but this location is frustrating and seriously sub-par. There are a lot of things about this place that send the message, "go away." From the hostess who made us wait for no reason, to the insufficient number of serving staff, to the manager with hickeys ALL OVER her neck (I mean a shocking number of HUGE hickeys. I'm not kidding, we're talking like 9 square inches of hickey), to the dirty floor (15 minutes after opening) to the oddly consolidated and uncomfortable seating. What's to love about this place? And what's with the physically over-sized but comically scaled-down concession-stand menu?
