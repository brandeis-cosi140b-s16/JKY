We came here because my daughter requested it for her birthday.  We arrived at the start of the dinner rush, about 5pm.  It was empty and the dining hall was dirty.  The restaurant is almost exactly like Chipotle except that it is more expensive, the servings are smaller, and the food doesn't taste nearly as good.
