Ordered Cadillac Margaritas, and I think they were all margarita mix with no tequila for $7. Way too sweet. They were running a special on shots of Jose for $2, so we bought a couple to add to our drinks to cut the sweetness. Note, their "shots" are maybe an ounce. Much too small to be acutal shots. We ordered their nachos, and they were HUGE! Definitely the highlight with lots of good toppings. No way the 2 of us were finishing them (although we gave it a good run). We were supposed to have gotten a $2 discount on the nachos with our Total Rewards card, which we didn't get. I didn't notice until later though, and I didn't feel like going back and arguing about $2. All-in-all, it's an OK place, but years ago I remember the drinks were great and I'd spend hours hanging out there. Now? Not so much.
