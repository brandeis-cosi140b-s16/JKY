Well, my aunt and uncle said they ate here and didn't like it, but my boyfriend and I decided to give it a chance. We waited for 15 minutes to be seated (which isn't too bad if they were busy) when she finally seated there was like three tables open so I didn't understand why we had to wait so long. 
   When we sat down we (like everyone else) waited a good 10 minutes to give them our drink order. When our waiter finally took our drink order (2waters) it took him another 10 mins to bring the chips and drinks. Right after he just walked away without asking us if we were ready to take our order. Finally putting in our order (steak fajita for two 18.99)  the food came out pretty fast, but I asked him for a refill and some cheese which took another 10-15 minutes to bring out and by that time we were almost done eating. 
    At the end of it all the price wasn't too bad but the little bowl of cheese was $1.25... Very disappointed,  the only reason I'm giving it two stars instead of one was because the food was pretty good. Never going back.
