This place is so hit and miss. Sometimes the food is excellent. Other times it's pretty bad and then you sit there wondering why you paid as much as you did for food you got. The good news is I think I figured it out!!!! There is one guy who is there a lot of times he is a stereotypical looking Hispanic that is fairly short and probably in his late 40s early 50s... He is no good! Everyone else that works there is great! But that guy seriously charges you more by a couple bucks for burritos. (My go to is the bean cheese and rice) because that's not on the menu it some how rings up at $5.50... If anybody else is working it rings up as three $3.80. And for some reason if you ever seen him in the kitchen the food just taste bad...  I have been here probably 15 to 20 times... However I think I am just going to give them 2 stars and move on... Avoiding certain people at restaurants is just too much work
