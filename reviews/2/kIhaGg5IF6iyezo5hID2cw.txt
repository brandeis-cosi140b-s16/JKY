Pros: Nice ambience, fairly strong margaritas.
Cons: The last time I went, the service was not great.  The waitress got our orders wrong, never refilled our water, and never came back with the salsa we asked for.  It wasn't busy at all, either.  The food is just so-so. Everything seemed overcooked and not very thoughtfully seasoned. It's certainly no Mas Amigos or Maize.
