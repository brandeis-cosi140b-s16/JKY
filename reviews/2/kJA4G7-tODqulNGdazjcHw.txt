the restraunt was clean, great customer service, the reason why I gave it 2 stars was because while standing in line to order, the associate (Curtis) was working the register, taking money and cards, then he would rub his hands all over his face and his eyes, then ran his hands up and down the whole stack of regular cups!!! he did this 2 or three times while I was in line, I could not believe that. I would think someone working the register/cups would be more aware of what he is doing.
