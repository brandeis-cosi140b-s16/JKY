Tucked next to a laundromat, you almost don't notice a new restaurant popped open here.  The space is minimal without a ton of character with tables in the front, a long bar stretching towards the back where a ramp takes you up to a more open seating area.  Given that they'd just opened, the liquor license hadn't been secured quite yet but they were confident it was on it's way.

Our server offered us one tattered paper menu for the three of us, then later returned with a second. I wasn't sure why there weren't enough menus to go around, given that we were one of three tables in the place.  While Mexican food is never my favorite, I was bummed to find only one vegetarian option on the menu:  cheese quesadillas.  

Really?!  Not even some veggie fajitas?  I asked the server what they could do to zip up that quesadilla and she indicated they could put in some veggies.  When I asked what veggies were available she replied "lettuce, tomato, onion, and cilantro".  Umm.  That's it?  Sigh.  

Entrees don't come with side dishes, beans/rice are a la carte (about $3 I think). Entrees were about $7-8.  One side of beans/rice is generous and could probably serve two people as long as nobody is a bean-hog.  All the carnivores enjoyed their food, the chips and salsa were good, and the service was so-so.  But if we're going out to spend $ on dinner I'd like to have a few options besides a cheese quesadilla with lettuce and tomatos.  Oy! Hopefully these are start-up hiccups and the menu is still in development, but I would need to see some major menu additions before I had an interest in going back.
