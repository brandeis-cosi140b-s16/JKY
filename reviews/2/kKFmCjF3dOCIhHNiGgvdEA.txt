For the past 11 years we have eaten here for MANY lunches after church on Sunday, sometimes 3 or 4 times a month.  We went yesterday for the first time in about 4 months (haven't been as frequent for various reasons) and we will not go back.  They have raised their prices quite a bit and taken the kids' special off the menu for Sunday lunch.  We were the first customers yesterday and the chips were burnt.  We asked for a new basket and they were a tiny bit better.  We asked for mild salsa and it came out like tomato juice.  Usually by 11:30 on a Sunday there are quite a few customers in there but when we left at 11:45 or so we were still the only people there.  The food was not bad and I have always thought their chicken was the best around but I am so dissappointed.  We have too many other choices for Mexican to spend that kind of money when we can get the same or better for much less.  We know we can get better chips elsewhere.  I noticed the most of the staff was very different from what we have seen in years past.  Will miss the concenience but have to be wise about our spending and the value received!
