On my way home from an appointment...running late....lunch hour almost over....starving....and it is taco Tuesday! So I stopped in here for the first time. This place is pretty near my house and I was looking forward to having a Mexican food choice (other than Taco Bell) in the neighborhood. 
The place was pretty quiet...and I was seated right away. My server (who was very nice and efficient) came over, and I ordered the taco special (Two beef tacos, rice and beans) I asked for ice tea with no lemon, and when she brought it, some really tall thin man appeared from the bar and told her she forgot the lemon. The waitress explained I ordered it that way. The man walked away. I had no idea who he was and he never said a word to me through the whole meal, but I assumed he was the floor manager. He must have walked by my table half a dozen times and never spoke....weird. 
Anyway, on to the food. The chips/salsa and bean dip that came out were good...the chips were nice and crisp and the salsa was a little bland, but not bad. However, the taco plate was really bad. The taco shells were hard and the meat inside was so salty I could hardly eat it. The beans were pretty much just liquid...amazingly like the bean dip, so I assume it is the same stuff. Lots of rice and shredded lettuce on the plate..which is not what I really wanted to enjoy! 
All in all, I don't think I will be back, even though they did give me a lunch club card (buy 5 lunches get one free) I had to laugh when I turned the card over I noticed someone had written on the back ...looked like a catering order!! Hope they don't miss it!
