This has been my favorite place to eat for years. However, the last few visits I have not liked the salsa! WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO IT?? It tastes canned and not very good at all. And the ground beef is always pink and it looks under cooked and I can't eat it like that. I guess I will have to find another favorite mexican place now.
