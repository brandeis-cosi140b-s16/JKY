This place is very wallet friendly-$1 Margaritas, $2 Sangria, $3 Beers and the food prices aren't bad at all. They had an extensive menu and I opted for the pollo nachos which were great and the sangria was good for $2. I wasn't impressed with the margarita (even after I got the extra shot for $1), like some others said it was completely sugar ridden and not good. The salsa was bland and I've had better such as the generic brand at the supermarket.

Service wise, I am agreeing with it others it was pretty bad. Our server didn't have knowledge of the menu or how to spell mojito (I served for six yrs so I am very understanding when it comes to service but you should know whats on the menu) and she kept stopping by to see if we needed our check when we were ordering rounds of drinks and going to be there for awhile. It was a little too loud for me also and really difficult to carry on a conversation so this place would probably be good for those with kids who tend to get a little loud.

All in all, if you're looking for mediocre food, cheap drinks and a loud atmosphere this is the place for you.
