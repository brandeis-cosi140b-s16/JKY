My coworkers from SLC kept raving about this place one day, saying it was the best Mexican food you'll ever find. I was in the neighborhood today, so I gave it a shot. 

They asked if I had ever been there before, I said no. They gave me a sample of their pork. Pork is supposed to be good because you have good quality meat and do a good job cooking it, not because you slopped on too much sugary sauce. It was almost like they were trying to hide the taste of the meat. 

Settled on cheese enchiladas. Was given the choice of mild, medium, or hot sauce. I LOVE spicy stuff, so of course the choice was obvious. My Diet Dr. Pepper had more of a kick. The food quality was OK. I finished everything, so it wasn't horrible. It was very bland, however. The final kicker was the price. Nearly $10 for two enchiladas and a soda (none of the add-ons that Than discussed, either)? Come on, really? 

The pluses are that the employees were very friendly and did their job well, and the restaurant was clean and well decorated for this type of place (think along the lines of a Rubio's or Taco del Mar).

When I visit Seattle and order Mexican, this is the type of food I expect. But this is Arizona. There's much better Mexican food around here.
