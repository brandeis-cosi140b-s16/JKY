Underwhelmed by the carne asada burrito- the limpest, saddest, messiest burrito I've had in a while. Menu description includes "meat, cheese, beans, and sour cream"- I only detected meat and an insane portion of beans. If your pinto beans are mostly liquid, they have no business being the main component of a burrito.
Asada was either flavorless or simply overpowered by the beans- I will say that it had good texture though. Burrito overall was a disappointment. May return for some basic tacos but overall I was just really underwhelmed. Orange salsa is legit though.
