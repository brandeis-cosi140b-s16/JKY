I really wanted to like Qdoba but their food had no flavor. My husband got a burrito and the red sauce that they "smothered" the burrito in was actually quite good and spicy. However, my chicken salad was flavorless. Chipotle somehow manages to get so much flavor in the salads I order and I was very hopefully that this would be similar. Sadly, it wasn't. One star for the burrito flavor and another start for ease of ordering and cleanliness.
