Meh.
Cute place. Small and clean. Bathrooms  are super nice.

 The salsa they give with the chips is really yummy. The house margarita served in a mason jar was yummy. The Borracho beans are AMAZEBALLS.

I had the steak fajitas. Here's my issue. They give you one tortilla and a plateful of meat. I had to ask for a second tortilla. It should automatically come with AT LEAST 2. Everywhere else I've had fajitas, they give 2 torts.
The meat was quite gristly and came out in whole pieces when you bit into it. So maybe invest in a better cut of meat?
Hubby had the Pescado De La Parrilla, which is the fish. It was delicious. I wish I had ordered that, instead.

It was a quick meal for us on or way home. I may try it again, but the prices are a bit high for what you get. Next time I plan on getting all the appetizers to try.
You MUST get the borracho beans. THEY ARE BOMB!
