This restaurant hands down has the worst service of any restaurant I have ever been to in my life! We love the food and come here at least once a week but always on a day we have nothing else to do. Trust me your server will forget about you! If management worked on the service this place would be great!!! Until then, I would recommend going somewhere else.
