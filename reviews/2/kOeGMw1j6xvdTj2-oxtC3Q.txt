Not impressed at all. The look of the restaurant is not too bad.  Was fairly clean, but just disorganized. Seemed like the young crew was working...the crew that doesn't really care. Our waiter seemed distracted. Had to ask for silverware. There was a gal back in the kitchen who had ear buds in her ears listening to music as evidenced by her singing and dancing. Just a little unprofessional. There was a party going on and it seemed like one of the people in the party probably works at the restaurant since she seemed to be very friendly with the staff. It got pretty annoying when the party got loud and they started smearing birthday cake in each other's faces. It got really ridiculous when one of the waiters got involved and had cake smeared on his face. The party had little kids running all over the place with the mom screaming at them from where she sat. I cringed for the couple who was sitting nearby as balloons were popping in their faces and they obviously we're looking for someone to move them and no one came over. It was just an awkward situation. Be nice if a party like that could have been put In a private room so others could enjoy their time. As for the food, it was definitely mediocre to poor. The cheese they used in the quesadilla tasted pretty cheap. The carne in the burrito didn't taste fresh. Overall, very disappointing. Won't be back, won't recommend.
