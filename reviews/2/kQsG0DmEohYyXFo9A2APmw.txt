I was hungry. But I'm disappointed in Salsarita's. So the employees were not very keen on friendliness but it's an airport so I get it. And I guess this place thinks that steak is the same thing as pot roast? That's what my steak quesadilla tasted like. Yay for free refills on drinks, but if you're looking to satisfy your hunger, pass this place up.
