I had heard really good things about this place and had high hopes. I wanted to like it so badly but no dice. We were starving and conveyed this to our server who kept saying "take your timeeeee, no rush." Ha, no really. We would have loved it rushed. We were HUNGRY! We decided to try the quesadilla du jour after our server told us it was shredded pork in their special sauce. Instead, he brought us the oyster du jour. He said he thought we ordered the oysters. My boyfriend hates seafood and we had just had a lengthy discussion with the server regarding what the quesadilla of the day was. Huh, how did he get that wrong?! He kept running away as we were trying to give him our dinner order. It was just such a long process! My boyfriend ordered the sirloin steak medium rare and I ordered the green chili burger. His steak tasted like hamburger meat and my fries were cold. My burger was good though and I did enjoy the ambiance of sitting near the fireplace in a cozy booth, so thumbs up for that! We waited for our check. And waited. And waited. We put our credit card ON the table near the edge. And waited. Finally, our server brought it over. Our meal took over 2 hours for the two of us. I was falling asleep near the end as we tried to get the check. Between the service and the food, I don't think I'll give this place another shot.
