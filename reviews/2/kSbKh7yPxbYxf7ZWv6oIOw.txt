The idea of a bar with a pool is a great idea. However Spanish Fly could do better.  I've been to this location twice, during the day and a night visit.  I was not impressed.  At night no one is allowed in the pool so everyone is cramped around the deck.  This makes it very tricky walking around the pool.  During the day its a whole other story.  I am impressed with the giant menu and so many food options available.  The drink menu was a great selection too!  I am happy that they did keep the ginormous drinks that Drift use to carry. My first impression of Spanish Fly is that you need a tattoo to get through the door and not just any ordinary tattoo.  You need a giant tribal tattoo or a full sleeve!  This place does get packed.  If you don't have a day bed or cabana, I recommend you get there early to claim a spot.  

OK food and drinks but a little over priced.  The service was OK.  Its a great place for people watching.
