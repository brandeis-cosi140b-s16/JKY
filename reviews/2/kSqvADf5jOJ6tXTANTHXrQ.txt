Allow plenty of time
Arrived 15 minutes early @ 6:45, one other diner at tables. The waitress took our drink order and brought us chips and salsa & beans. 10 minutes our drinks arrives, 15 minutes passes by she asks if ready to order, she takes order and dashes off quickly. 20 minutes later our over cooked food gets delivered by bus boy. 10 minutes passes she gets flagged down by they only other family of four, she asks us how our food was as she passes from ten feet away. We got the attention of the other waitress to get our second drink, she got our drink back in five minutes and smiled and asked if we needed anything else. I told her just the check, I placed my payment in the folder and waited to see a staff member after 15 minutes I take check to staff member was told waitress has to close out check. It was my wife's birthday and I had to get her to a surprise party upstairs. Luckily my wife stepped away to watch laser show. I was able to make a call to the guests waiting for us up stairs. Conclustion: Got seated at 6:45 got bill paid at 8:10
