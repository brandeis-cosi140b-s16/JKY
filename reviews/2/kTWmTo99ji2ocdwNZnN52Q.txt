We hadn't been at Coyote's in a year, but since we were in Henderson, we thought we'd try it out again.   Service was good, the busser kept our water glasses full and chips and salsa coming.  We ordered the shrimp enchiladas and crab meat enchiladas.  Neither left me wanting for more.  I don't believe "real" shrimp or crab was used but flavored fish.  The flavor was not that of shrimp or crab.   The sauce on the enchiladas was just ok, nothing flavorful or that I would want to order again.  Side of guacamole, again, was jut mediocre.  Traditional rice and beans finished the plate....again ok.  Hopefully other munu items are more flavorful, as the ones we tasted would not bring us back for a return visit anytime soon.  Prices seemed to be more costly than most Mexican restaurants we frequent.  A simple bottle of beer was $4.75.
