It's cheap, it's convenient and if you go with a burrito, it's food you can eat while you're driving. There is better nearby if you want Mexican (the 1900 around the corner on Park, for instance) or other sit down food (at the Roasting Company).

I've seen people order $12 worth of higher-end items at a TB, which never makes sense to me. I can completely enjoy (within limits, this isn't Ruth's Chris!) a 7 Layer Burrito or a Spicy Chicken Burrito and walk out of here with change from $5. Add the "fire" sauce for a little extra zing.

As TB's go, this one is within standards. Sometimes they fold the burrito properly (sealed at both ends) and sometimes they don't and you have to make sure it doesn't all leak out the bottom.

I have not been given my receipt a couple of times at the drive-thru, though they are pretty good about not screwing up the order.
