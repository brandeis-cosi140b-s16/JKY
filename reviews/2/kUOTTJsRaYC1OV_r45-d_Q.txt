I saw the truck at Atherton Mill today and it sounded and smelled like a nice snack / light lunch for me and the little woman. I really wanted to like this place. There were 2 people in line in front of me so I expected a short wait, but it took a long, long, long time to get my 3 panang beef tacos. Luckily it was a very nice day and a pleasant wait so I was not too upset. The food was just OK. A couple of things stuck out as being done nicely, but mostly just an OK experience all around.

Pros:
the tortilla was excellent, tasty, crunchy, thin but didn't fall apart, and seemed to be whole grain of some sort.

The veggies were very fresh and you could taste the bell pepper

Cons:
Overall lack of flavor. There seemed to be a sauce of some sort on it but it was so thin it didn't contribute at all. I would rather have had some salt and pepper on the meat and veggies. The lack of seasoning really detracted from what could have been a stellar snack.

Too much dripping watery liquid running out of the tacos and filling up the paper tray.

The meat (beef) was a little tough, nothing terrible but a little care in slicing could have possibly alleviated this.

The price seemed high for what I got. - nearly $12 for 3 tacos with a few strips of beef in each one.

I will give them another chance if we happen to be in the same place at the same time again, but I won't seek them out.
