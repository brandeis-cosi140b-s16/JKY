I'm appalled at the manager's attitude. They have a rat problem yet they're still open and serving food. It's disgusting. One ran across my friend's foot last week while she was waiting to pay for a burrito. After she ran out and calmed herself down enough to process what happened, she called the manager. He basically said "...and? We know we have a problem."

Before this fiasco, I had been going to this location for about half a year now and I've seen that the level of service has gone down significantly in the last two months. I don't know what happened to the previous team but the servers at the front don't seem to know what they're doing. Lots of standing around and not offering an explanation for the delay. No "sorry, we're waiting on veggies/brown rice/chicken/etc." This causes aggravating and excessively long lines during lunch hour (even for chipotle).

The two stars are really just for the nice cashier and the taste of the food. I don't plan on going back to this location unless there's an obvious change in management and cleanliness.
