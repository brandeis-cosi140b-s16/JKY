Wow.  That didn't last long.  Six months ago we were all praising Federico's and pleased that Scottsdale finally has a great Mexican fast food restaurant. Pop!  That is gone.  Raised prices $1 to $2.00 on 20 items in six months (combos & burritos).  Most other things up less than a dollar.  After people writing reviews on their good value prices, apparently they decided to change that.  When I first opened up a Federico's fish burrito and beef burrito this past summer, thought I died and went to heaven.  In March 2014, the only thing in the beef burrito is the meat... with 2 tsp of cheese &  2 tbsp sliced iceberg lettuce shavings  The last time I ordered the fish burrito, there were 4 small slices of tilapia and some lettuce shavings. Federico's had that neat market niche, but I am saddened it is disappearing.  They have a lively business, hope their original creativity and quality when they first opened is resurrected.
