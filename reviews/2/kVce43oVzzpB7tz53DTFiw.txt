So went here for lunch. Looks like a sad deserted place. The small tables had their chairs out of place. If my acid was that empty you better believe I would have at least straightened up the place. 

Anyway I ordered the Mexican  sandwich (torta) with carne asada. My friend ordered a red chile tamale combo w rice and beans. We waited a few minutes and it was delivered to out table. My torta looked huge and was wrapped in sandwich paper I was happy about that.  My plate included the torta w a side of rice abs beans. I opened the torta and it had lettuce, tomatoes, jalape√±os, and very little meat and was smeared with beans. It tasted ok so I squirted a large punt of salsa on it yo Mack the blandness. My sandwich (torta) was a high ratio of bread and very little meat. 

My friend said her food was "lukewarm" but not hot. So this place is less than mediocre wily only recommend it if you are right there in the area and you really need to eat Mexican food.
