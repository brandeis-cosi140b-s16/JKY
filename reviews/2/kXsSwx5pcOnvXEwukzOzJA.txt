We went on a Sunday for menudo and my husband had their egg and potatoes burrito for himself. The burrito alone was over priced and it was quite small. Two menudo plates and a plate with just a burrito, two hochata drinks and a limonada(limonade) came out to a little over $35. The menudo was bland and the services was awful. I had to keep waiting for the waitress so I could have limes and bread rolls for our menudo. It was not that busy, ether. It seemed like the kitchen was having some issues too. They serve big portions of the menudo and it is all you can eat...if you can get them to serve you another plate! I'll try them again for lunch and see if the time of day changes the type of service. I've had better menudo at Filibertos and I'm Mexican! You're better off going to Ranch Market in Gilbert.
