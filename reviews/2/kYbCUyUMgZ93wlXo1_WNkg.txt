This place is just okay as now we are closer to this location, we do have to go here. But the service at this location is horrible. There is this old lady, who just keeps shouting and never able to understand the order properly. One day they had run out of beans altogether and we were just getting 1 kids meal to go, so there was no option but to take 2 boxes of rice. 
At the end while paying this old lady shouts at her co-worker looking rudely at me and says "Charge them for 1 extra rice" I said "why . you have ran out of beans, what is the other option I have. She then realized and had her foot in the mouth. She is always yelling, at the payment counter person, basically Indirectly  shouting at the customer "Charge them for this extra" this that... She is soo rude. Please train her on some soft skills.
