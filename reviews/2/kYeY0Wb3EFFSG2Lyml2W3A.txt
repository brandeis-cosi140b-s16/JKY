I was kinda confused when my husband asked me if I wanted to eat here... It says Chinita (doesn't that mean little Chinese girl?) on the sign, but directly under that, it says "Mexican Bar & Grill", intrigued, I am...

A red colored bleu cheese sauce for calamari which was doused in sweet chili sauce... Oh, there's the Chinese. Guacamole lacked seasonings, quesadilla plater was missing the usual salsa, guac and sour cream :(

Unfortunately, the only part of of the night that I enjoyed was the live music. I didn't catch his name but I remember him from the Onyx Bar at Red Rock, uhm, no I don't drink a lot. I love that he plays different instruments and sings! 

I didn't enjoy the food, I get that they're trying to go for a fusion type of restaurant-- sorry, doesn't work.
