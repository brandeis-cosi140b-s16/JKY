Don't ya hate it when your favorite menu item is removed? (I realize this is a first world problem.) I used to go to Rubio's for their grilled mesquite shrimp burrito. Since they don't have that anymore, I don't have a "Rubio's fav" anymore. No reason to go. A friend of mine chose it as our lunch location the other day & so I went. Tried the current taco special. Can't remember what it was, so it didn't leave an impression. The mesquite grilled shrimp burrito was the only thing I ordered! If I craved it - I knew what I was having for lunch or dinner. No more.  It's been over a year since I've chosen Rubio's. It takes time for me to find a favorite, and I don't want to start over again, especially if there is the risk of it being removed from the menu! So much work thrown aside! Ha! Funny but true.
