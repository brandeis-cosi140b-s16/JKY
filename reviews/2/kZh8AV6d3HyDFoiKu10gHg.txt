It's interesting that Garcia's is tucked away in the Embassy Suites.  I think it probably works out for both parties since there are barely any restaurants in the area and hotel guests are forced to come and order here......damn them.

And as a hotel guest I did just that, but I ordered it to go.  I don't know what the standard for mexican cuisine is here, but Garcias is just shy of a typical Chevy's, maybe not even as good.  I was starving, so I went on a binge and went with the 3 item meal, but then who knew I ended up going on a diet:

-Enchilada - this was ok, and mostly because of the sauce and how they drenched everything in melted cheese.

-Chile Releno - melted cheese is good....but TOO much melted cheese is just death

-Tamale - one bite.....and that's all I had and nothing more because it sucked.

And the guacamole and other sauces were mediocre.  I guess when you're part of a hotel and have a steady flow of guests come in, you can slack on the quality of the dishes.  sad.....truly sad.
