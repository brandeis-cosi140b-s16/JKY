Sal's is good pizza but I'm not really sure what everyone is raving about. I have made lots and lots of pizza.  I worked at Shakespeare's Pizza in Columbia, Mo (some of the best), worked at Uno's in Madison, and also made NY style pizza in Maine.

We have done carry-out twice at Sal's and maybe you need to eat it hot out of the oven?  Once the crust sits for a little while it has the consistency of store bought crust.  On Sunday we ordered two 16" pizzas from Johnson St. One of the pizzas was supposed to come with sausage, mushroom, onion, black olives and bacon.  They got the olives wrong (green) and you could barely find the bacon with a magnifying glass.  A pizza that costs over twenty-five bucks should be made right and I should at least be able to see all of the toppings. 

I was very excited hearing reviews of Sal's because IMO, Madison has some of the worst pizza offerings around.  From now on I think I'll stick to my pizza stone on the grill at home.
