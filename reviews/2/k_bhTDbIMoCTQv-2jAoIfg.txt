Used the drive through for my son tonight. Line was short but it took and exceptional amount of time to get us through the line. When ordering I confirmed we did NOT want tomatoes or sour cream on our items. My son hates them! They read the order back and stated the correct order. But guess what we had on our items....tomatoes and sour cream.  We were already home when he noticed so we didn't take them back. But confirming an order twice and still making a mistake is not ok or good customer service.
