Very average food at best,  from authentic Mexican food and very commercial. Chili con queso was just a bowl of melted processed cheese with zero flavor, just like those jars sold at grocery stores. Chicken enchiladas were extremely dry and again lacked flavor. On a good note, they have ice cold tecate on draft. Service was also good with friendly waitress. So if you want a nice cold beer go ahead and stop in, but if your hungry go elsewhere. Prices are pretty high too, especially when compared to food quality.
