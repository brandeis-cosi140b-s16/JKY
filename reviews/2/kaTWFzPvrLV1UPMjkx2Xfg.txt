Chipotle you let me down.  I come to your establishments regularly and this location something is not right.  

1.  The cleanliness is downright gross.  Food scraps on the floor.  Tables not wiped down.  Chairs looking in dire need of replacement.

2.  No customary greeting!  I always rewarded with a smile but today which was not busy at all and two customers in front of me no one smiled.  Maybe it was just a bad day for the team members. 

3.  Cashier took forever.  It's like she deliberately let the line stack up until she took noticed.
