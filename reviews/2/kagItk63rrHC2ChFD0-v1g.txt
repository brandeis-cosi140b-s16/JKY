I went with my special lady friend and her 2 friends. We were recommended The Mission was recommended  by one of her friends many times over. So, we finally decided to go. Lets start with the drinks. Got 3 of the house margs. NOT GOOD. I want to know what lime juice tastes like Mr and Mrs T's sweet n sour mix. That way I never get them. The menu stated fresh lime juice margs. Reminds me of a marg I had at Chilis once. Anyways, place was packed. We sat down and we got the tableside guac. I told the guy (in spanish) to tone it down, the 2 other people couldnt eat too much spice cant eat spice like us. He understood and laughed. It was definitely fresh. The guac was bland though. Especially for all those ingredients. We shared plates, but only the green chile duck confit on green sauce was anything I would recommend. One person in our party asked for a rum and coke. She ended up getting a vodka tonic. Crappy way to end it.
