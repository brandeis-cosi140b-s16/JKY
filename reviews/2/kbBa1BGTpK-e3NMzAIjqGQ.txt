Drive by this place every morning on my way to work. Never had a urge to eat here until recently. I knew what I was walking into just by looking at this place. Do not know how this place stays in business? Never see any business there! i ordered a breakfast burrito, it had eggs, sausage, and potatoes. Nothing special, something I could have made up at home. This is my opinion, when you have a restaurant. You should serve food that has something special. Not food, we can serve up at home. Give me a reason to return!! The location is very out dated, needs a new coat of paint and get rid of all the pictures. There are too many options in this area to eat at. This place really needs to change. But I doubt if they will!
