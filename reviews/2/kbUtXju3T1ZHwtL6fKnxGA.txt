YIKES!!! I had no idea that they were in the middle of a political fight with food carts AND that they were closed down not too long ago by the health department.

This was one of those -let's be spontaneous moments. Just makes me realize that I need to stay on top of my restaurant research and not just take a chance!

Anyway I had their shrimp dish with garlic. She brings me pollo.. I have her take it back and she brings me the shrimp dish. The shrimp must have been in the sauce for 10 minutes - totally overcooked.. Yikes I say again!  

We had stepped out from the yelp event to have a looksee in the funky neighborhood and the Mamitas/CUBAN neon sign drug me right over there.  When we got inside it reminded me of some of the mexican restaurant dives in Portland and that's a good thing. I should have realized that there were mostly only white faces eating their food and stepped back out though.
