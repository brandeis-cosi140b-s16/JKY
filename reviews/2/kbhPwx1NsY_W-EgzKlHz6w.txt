Subpar Mexican, a lot out of a can, depressingly bad. 

We went out looking for good late night Mexican. We asked a club promoter and he said Ricky's was the only place in the area but said it was bad. If someone from Iowa thinks the Mexican is bad, you know it's bad. 

Got chicken and carne asada tacos with rice and beans. The beans and salsa weren't homemade, the rice was whatever and the tacos were not up to standard for this part of the country. 

Sadly even the house marg was bad. How do you mess up tacos and margaritas and call yourself a Mexican place?

The service was great and friendly and the DJ was awesome. Good check in for some beers and good music, just don't order any food.
