I am not one to write reviews but I had to on this place.  I was super excited to try this place.  It looks cool and seems to have a cool vibe.  I've been waiting for this place to work out some quirks since I have heard bad things and they have bad reviews on yelp.  I thought they are new and are just trying to find the groove.

My boyfriend and I went last night for date night. We saw all the bad reviews, then a couple good reviews showed up and we thought let's give this place a shot, maybe the other reviewers are just not used to this style of Mexican food.  The price is what I would expect at a this kind of place but the food was not.  The chips and salsa were great but the two entrees we got were sooooo bland.  Where is the flavor, it seems to be non-existent.

Our server was great, she even offered to take one of the entrees off the bill.  Which I think is super cool because I assumed we would just pay for them and be unhappy.

Bottom line, I will not come back for food!

I did see they have happy hour and I have heard the margaritas are good, so I will come back and try the discounted margaritas some time. Maybe if we drink a couple margaritas we won't care that the food is bland.
