The employees were really friendly and courteous. The  tacos are small and for $2 a taco I can get the same tacos at another place I recently reviewed for less. The steak is really good. We ordered chicken also and I could taste the chorizo that was left on the grill in the chicken. They also didn't give us our chips and salsa we ordered to go. Overall not a horrible place but pricey for the portions. I'll just go across the street for the same prices.
