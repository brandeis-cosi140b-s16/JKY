First, this place is located in a gas station.  Not that it makes it bad.  In fact, it makes it more appealing to me.  Unfortunately the food was just meh.  The shredded beef had very little flavor to it.  The enchilada sauce also needed some spice.  I guess if I was drunk off my rocker I might want everything on the menu.  Being sober, on a Saturday around 1pm, this place definitely needed some help.
