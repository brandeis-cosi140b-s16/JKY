I've tried this place 3 different times but just haven't been impressed.   It's close to home so I really wanted to like it, which is why i gave it 3 chances.  I ordered 3 different dinners as well.  The bar atmosphere is nice, but i just don't like their food very much.  I've been eating mexican food across the nation for about 2 decades now so i'm pretty picky, as I've had the good stuff.   Taco Bell is close so I will probably just go there.
