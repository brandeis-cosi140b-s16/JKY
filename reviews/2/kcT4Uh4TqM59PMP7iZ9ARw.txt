A Groupon brought us back to what used to be one of our go-to Mexican food places. Either our tastes have changed, or this place has really gone downhill. 

The history of this place harkens back many years & is included on the menu - fun to read. The place has a kitschy atmosphere, and a nice outside area to dine. Located in shadow of the Pointe Hilton Hotel at Squaw Peak, the restaurant still draws many visitors. The night we were there, there were many large tables of guests that appeared to be from out of the area. I know, I'm jumping to conclusions, but locals know how to pronounce "chimichanga", "quesadilla", "machaca" and "chipotle"!

The carnitas tacos were boring and generic and the chicken burritio flavorless. Meh.. Margaritas nothing special. They claim to be "always" voted Best Margarita by a local magazine, but I find that hard to believe. The upside: the salsa is very flavorful. Not a fan of the flour tortilla chips, though.

Years ago we used to come here for the awesome happy hour on their outside patio, which they still advertise. Reduced appetizers during the week, free buffet on Fridays.
 
I doubt we'll be back. The Valley has lots and lots of places to get authentic Mexican fare. We'll leave Aunt Chilada's basic Gringo fare to the tourists and dine elsewhere.
