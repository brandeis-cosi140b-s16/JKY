Finally made it to Hot Taco after waiting in anticipation for it to be built. After all the waiting, I thought it was just okay. Margaritas were watered-down, chips were oily, but salsa was good and had a kick to it. My wife and I each had three different types of tacos with the flour tortillas. I thought they were just okay and a little bland but my wife immediately threw all her food up when we got home. She got food poisoning almost immediately which is too bad. I really wanted to like this place.
