Over priced el polo loco ..only thing that's pretty decent about this chain is the home made , fresh tortillas otherwise I really don't understand the big boner , hype about this place ! Please !! Eat some real Mexican food ppl you wouldn't even know what good , authentic Mexican food is in this town
