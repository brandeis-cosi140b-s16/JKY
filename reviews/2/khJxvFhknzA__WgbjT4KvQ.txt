Well....

It's a 2 star rated restaurant to me.  It's ok, I won't probably go back again as there are plenty of superior options that have better tasting food.  Even Filibertos has a better tasting carne asada burrito than this place.  I was disappointed, to say the least.  

The wait staff was friendly and we were brought pitchers of water and bowls of chips with salsa and bean dip as appetizers.  Quite a few people who have previously reviewed this restaurant have raved about how great the bean dip is but for me, to be perfectly honest, it wasn't really that special.  Garcias will give you bean dip too...and I think it tastes better.  Their salsa is supposedly award winning?  What does award winning salsa taste like?  Not like this watered down blandly flavor that was put in front of me I hope.  

The carne asada burrito I ordered was dry and very peppery.  I definitley wouldn't recommend it.  I was dining with five other people and some of them did enjoy their food but I don't remember anyone going GA GA over it or anything. 

Pricewise the place seemed a little high for what I got as well.  I would probably go to Garcia's or even Elmer's tacos before I'd go here again.  

I don't like to give low scores.  I hate it...but I just wanted to warn anyone who might be thinking about giving this place a try.  

Have a great day!
