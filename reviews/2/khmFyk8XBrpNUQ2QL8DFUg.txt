Worst Chipotle I've ever been to. They skimp on everything to the point you think it's a joke. We kept going back thinking it was just a fluke, continues to happen. Also whether there's a line or not, the service is really slow. 

They literally sprinkle everything, to the point they make a normal scoop and then pour most of it back. 

Will be going to the 92nd/Shea location from now on.
