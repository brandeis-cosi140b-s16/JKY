Had lunch today for the first time at this restaurant and felt rushed by the staff to hurry our time as customers for them to have quick turnovers.  The wait staff never took a drink order until we asked and was pushy on his opinion of what to order.   It was fast food quality and small sevings at nice restaurant prices.  The wait staff was very unprofessional, which is disappointing.
