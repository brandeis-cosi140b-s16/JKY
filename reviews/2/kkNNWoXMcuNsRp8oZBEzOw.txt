My co-worker called in an order at 1:30 pm, well after lunch rush and was told by the lady that answered the phone that "she needed to order right now or forget it".  Ummmm, seriously?? She's lucky it wasn't me that called it in.  She would have gotten a piece of my mind and NOT received the order.  Luckily for them, she is a lot nicer than me.  

1 Star is for my co-workers Carne Asada Burrito, she says it is "the bomb".
1/2 Star is for my rice that is fairly tasty.
1/2 Star is for the delivery being fairly quick.

I got just a ground beef/bean burrito with lettuce/sour cream/cheese.  Pretty much tasted like Taco Bell's Burrito Supreme.  Nothing to write home about...at all.

Overall completely irritated I wasted good money on this place. 

Get SOMEONE ELSE to answer your phone if you want repeat business!!!!
