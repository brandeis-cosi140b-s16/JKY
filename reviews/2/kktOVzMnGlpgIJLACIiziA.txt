Wife and I went there today for lunch.  While I agree with almost all high rated yelp restaurants, I'm afraid I cant o this one.
Ambiance was ok.  Service was Ok.  Food was reasonable enough but we both felt our food just wasn't good enough to bring us back.  
Wife had chicken burrito.  Said there was a lot of chicken but absolutely no taste.
I had two enchilladas, beef since neither cheese nor pork was an option.  They came with the Mexican standard or beans, rice and a dollop of salad.  Beans were ok.  Rice was pretty good and the salad dollop was a salad dollop.
Meat in both enchilladas was either bland also or overwhelmed by the green sauce.  The meat could have been replaced by almost anything and you'd never know it without looking.
With so manygood retaurants in the area, it's hard to justify going back to Sylvia's.  There wasn't anything good enough to bring you back and indeed, we won't be back.
