I personally will never eat there again.

The chips are actually amazing though, I would eat those a lot if it didnt require me stpping foot in the ultimate bro/slut restaurant.


The food is gross, the tortillas are ok, I like the decor actually, but the employees are slutty (and by slutty I saw skirts soo short if they picked something off the floor you for sure would see vagina)

Apparently the uniform is jean skirts and heels.

This is the male glittery shirt wearing capitol of Scottsdale. The food sucks, dont eat here!
