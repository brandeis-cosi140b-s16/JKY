Stopped in on the way to work for a breakfast burrito.  I ordered the Machaca and Egg burrito and while it was ok about halfway through the grease started to soak through so much the filling was falling out of the bottom of the tortilla.  At that point I just was kinda grossed out and threw out the rest of the burrito.  Luckily it was a huge burrito so I had my fill on by that point anyways.  Doubt I'll go back when I know Filiberto's isn't too far away.
