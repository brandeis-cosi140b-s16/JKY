Pros:  Solid bar area with several large TVs.  Came in handy during Day 2 of March Madness and I would assume on Sundays for NFL games.  Coupons...we get Nacho Daddy coupons all the time and were able to take advantage of a free Nacho ($14 value...so they say, but it wasn't big enough to be called a $14 nacho)

Cons:  I got the Enchiladas (beef and chicken) and I thought both were bland.  Also the service.  Our waiter seemed pretty friendly but he screwed a few things up and we thought the arrival our drinks and app was a bit slow.

Unfortunately, coupons and TVs aren't enough to get us back in the door because those aren't really differentiators around here.  I can't say we would be back any time soon...especially without a coupon or during a non-Happy Hour special.
