Expensive and generic.  After ordering our server informed us "since this is family style dining, each item will come out when its ready."   Looking around the room, I saw a lot of awkward tables where one person would have a plate of food, and the other people at the table had nothing.  It was also quite amusing to see a plate of four tacos placed on a table of 5 clearly hungry adults.  Their next dish came about 5 minutes later.  Focus seems to be on these taco plates which are $14.50 and comes with 4 tacos (all of the same type), which we were told were "perfect for sharing".   11 different kinds of tacos on the menu, but when ordering the plate, you're restricted to order 4 of the same. 

The food was very pedestrian, but what do you expect from a Mexican joint with locations only in Chicago and New York?

Manager gave us a "service industry card" to come back and try them again for 50% off on service industry night.  Might give it a second shot if we are around during that time, but will not make a special trip.
