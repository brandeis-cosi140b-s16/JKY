This is a 2.5 star review. Bistro tex-mex. Ain't it grand?

The booths are comfy, the interior is chill and low-light, service varies from great to distracted, and the menu is huge (including a large-ish Veg selection, plus their open-mindedness about subs and alterations). But being as huge a fan of the mexican flavor set as I am, it hurts my soul to see it bandied about, willy-nilly. At least they aren't claiming to be "authentic", as some other high-end places in this town declare - Mexican inspired is pretty accurate.

So I get my order of veggie enchiladas with tomatillo salsa and, although its interesting, there's so much happening in my mouth that with every bite, I'm scratching my head a little harder. To start, they use the same veg mix in all their vegetarian dishes - a finely shredded mix of shrooms, zuch, sweet plantains, pepper. Corn, even. Things are cooked down to an unrecognizable pile of whatever. Too sweet. Pair that with a very carefully opposite of hot green sauce and super mild queso fresco, and you've got the idea - there's no bright, interesting ooomph to tie the dish together, and it needs it, badly.

Other stuff I've had makes me think I'm eating a Big Mac (yeah, its been a while, but still)- the plantain side "salad" is too much, too sweet, 15 flavors all at once that collide and become gastronomic mush. There's sugar, or sweetening agents, in so many things here. Rice, even. Sheesh.

They did make me a torta con huevos y queso, no arguments, although it wasn't on the menu. It was tasty and messy - reminded me of Chicago style rather than NY. 

The salsa is bland, but the chips are perfect. They have a jalapeno margarita (6$) that is probably the spiciest thing on the menu (but isn't, really).
