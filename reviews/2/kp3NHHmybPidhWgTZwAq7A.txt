It's Baja Fresh - it's fast food when your hungry and don't have time or money for something better. The salsa bar looks awesome, but the mango salsa is absent of mango. There is just enough to call it mango salsa. The tomatoes are watery in the regular pico de gio.

The fish tacos with avocado and cabbage are good. I don't know if I would recommend the combination price (includes rice, beans, chips) though because the Spanish rice on my visit was sticky and bland, the black beans were not good, and the chips were just simply -ok.
