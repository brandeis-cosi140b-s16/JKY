Well I opted for the cheeseburger plate with fris and salad for $8.50 that was suppose to have montery jack but was delivered with yellow (American I think) cheese.  Same for the other burger at our table and the beef burrito a la cart at our table looked dry and was I was told.

This was my first visit and we came for lunch and sat on the patio.
The chips and salsa were good. The softdrinks are big and you get refills which is good since they are $2.35 each!

But looking at the other plates with mexican food it looked good and smelled wonderful! The staff was reasonaly nice.  

They have a small bar but the special drinks are HIGH at $7 & $8!

It was a pricey lunch with tip I spent $14. 

Still I might try a mexican meal one day because it smells so good!
