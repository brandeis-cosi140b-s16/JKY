For all the hype you hear, this place just sucks.  Maybe it was better before, but I get the feeling that if you don't look like a Hollywood elite, you're scoffed at.  Our waitress (who finally decided to bless us with her presence) explained that happy hour was 2 for 1 drinks.  Great, the wife and I said, and we ordered 2 margaritas.  She shows up with 4.  What's this, I asked.  It's 2 for 1, she explains, you order 1 and we bring you 2.  If I wanted 2 each I would have fucking asked for FOUR!!!  When I told her I didn't want 2 each she looked so put off (is this REALLY the first time this has ever come up sweetheart?!?) but did take away the extra 2 margaritas.  We had a few more beers and a lackluster appetizer sampler and bounced. Fuck the Pink Taco.
