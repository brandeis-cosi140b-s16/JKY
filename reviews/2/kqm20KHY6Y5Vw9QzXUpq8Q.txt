Decided to give it another try after not visting in over 5 years due to poor service.  Once again it proved I will not be back for probably another 5 years for the same reason.  Seeing as it was Memorial Day weekend there was less than four tables seated at the time we came for dinner.  We were promptly greated by the hostess and seated.  The waitress arrived a short time later and took a drink order and dinner order.  We waited about 5 minutes before the drinks arrived and then after another 5 minutes we had to ask about chips and salsa and if they still offered it as a part of the service.

The waitress essentially forgot about us and I had to constantly look around to get the attention of the staff who was having a social hour at the front desk.  Then our waitress would return and with a piss poor attitude, "is there something you need?"

The drinks were not refilled in a timely manner and when the food arrived the waitress said, "careful, hot plate" and practically threw it in front of my wife (the plate actually slide across the table a few inches!!).

The food overall was good but the piss poor service is going to kill this place!  In seeing as she had probably one table at the time to help this was completely unacceptable.  I think towards the end of the meal she realized how bad she must have been because she stopped by the table a few more times.

In closing, I feel that if I am going to spend $50 on a meal the service had better not be what I would expect to recieve at McDonalds!

** TWO STARS for the food! **
