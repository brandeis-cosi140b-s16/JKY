Ok I had a tamale at the annual Glendale Jazz Blues Fest, I did not actually go inside the place. But the red chili tamale I had was bland and dry with shredded beef brisket at both ends but none in the middle!  Where was the red chili? They offered no salsa with their tamales either and sold no drinks outside their business. The set up nor the tamale did nothing for their image.
