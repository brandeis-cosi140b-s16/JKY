Well this seems to be a growing trend in the "fresh, fast food" arena, quick Tex-Mex. Salsarita's is much like Subway with a Mexican twist. But I think there are plenty of other places that do what Salsarita's does much better.

I would say both Moe's & Qdoba are the big boys that are better, but Phat Burrito beats them all. Anyways, Salsarita's is a quick stop for lunch with a fairly good meal at a good price. They have plenty of options, all being your typical Mexican foods, with burritos being the main hit.

There are plenty of other better quick Tex Mex places than Salsaritas, but if you're close by then this could be a quick meal for a good price.
