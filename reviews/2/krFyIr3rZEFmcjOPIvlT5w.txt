Revisited today with Matt W, and had to downgrade the review...

+ Friendly staff, as usual
+ Very clean inside - still quite nice

- Chips are pre-made/bagged chips; no longer warm/fresh
+ Salsa has improved; not as salty, and not watery (at least today)

Matt & I ordered three tacos each and sampled a little of them all:

- Carne Asada taco: nice sear, but fatty and lacking any flavor; very bland
+ El Pastor taco: good texture, very mild flavor, not fatty at all
- Campechano taco: bland asada + super oddly flavored chorizo = ick

+ Fish taco: nicely grilled; very salty for some reason. I appreciated that it wasn't drowned in slaw - just fish and grilled onion
- Chicken taco: great texture, no flavor, whatsoever
- Lomo taco: cubed pork + onion; very greasy

Even the onion and cilantro as included on the tacos was flavorless... I'm not sure what happened with the flavor profiles here, but nearly every taco was devoid of any real taste. The chorizo was the most flavorful thing, but not in a good way. We couldn't put our finger on the exact ingredient, but I'd swear it was clove and/or nutmeg...

It was inexpensive and our server was really wonderful, but if it's good tacos you're looking for, time to look elsewhere. A little salt/seasoning on the majority of the meats would do wonders... and sear them more!

I'd say this is probably a 2.5-star experience, overall...
