The honorable Mister Barack Obama came here to eat and quite frankly I don't see why.  Hopefully he was just in the area and this wasn't actually on his agenda.  The food was not all that great and the service wasn't up to par either.  The funniest thing about it was we were the only ones there on this particular evening.  Anyhow, I think there are probably better places to eat in the area.  The building is very large and multi colored.  The bathrooms were very clean and the booth we were in was comfortable.
