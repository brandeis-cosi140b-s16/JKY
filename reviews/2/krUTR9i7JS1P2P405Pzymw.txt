The food was pretty tasteless.  I had a burrito suiza that was to be served with house and cheese sauce - it had to pieces of provolone cheese melted on it.  It was alright, but the chicken had no Mexican flavor at ALL.  Other person had pork tacos, which were bombed with cilantro and the pork was pretty tough.  Won't be back.
