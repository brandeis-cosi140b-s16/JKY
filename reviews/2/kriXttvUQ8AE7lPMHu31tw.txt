I agree with Mio, it's not authentic but you probably wont find anything better in Madison.  The salsa was not spicy, the chips were stale.  The chile relleno tasted like it had been fried last week, the tostada had chewy meat on it. The beans were good but heck I eat the beans at Taco Bell too.  Everyone in Madison raves about this place and either they are natives who have never had a decent taco in their life or they are just settling for what is available.
