The food was good, no question. That is the only reason I am giving it two stars. A large ice truck delivering ice was loud, the manager, Tom,was not helpful when we decided to address this. He informed us that "as soon as we left, he was turning the music back up." My father had asked earlier that he turn it down, which they did. It still was on it wasn't off and no one appeared to notice the difference. I appreciate music during a meal but lowering the volume did nothing to the ambience, unlike the ice truck sitting outside the gate for 20+ minutes did. In a nutshell the manager basically said, his ice truck and music was more important than his customers. It was a very clear message and we had been so looking forward to coming here. This was my last night with my family and sadly the manager and his requirement to "run a business" and not concern himself with our comfort. What a great meal that ended in absolute disappointment. Come here if you choose but know that frozen water is the priority over a family of seven trying to enjoy a meal. 
Please read my other reviews to determine if you think I am being unreasonable. I do try to be fair this was unbelievable and outright rude.
