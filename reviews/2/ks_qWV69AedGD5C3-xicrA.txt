The restaurant is beautiful but everything else was downhill. The Margarita on the rocks was mostly rocks and tasted like the too sweet premix they sell in the grocery store. The chopped salad was good but the main meatloaf entree tasted like spotted donkey. This is one of the restaurants at the Boulders resort in Carefree and the entire staff from the bellhops to the front desk recommended it a little too hard which aroused my suspicions. I have to believe there is a lot better Mexican food in this part of Arizona. Our waitress was on automatic pilot so no help there.
