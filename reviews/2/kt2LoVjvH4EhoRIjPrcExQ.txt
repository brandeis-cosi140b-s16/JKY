Rumor has it the flautas are amazeballs. Let's see...

The above comment was my check in at Los Antojos.

The excitement ended with that sentence. It wasn't good at all. A Flauta, at least where I come from, is pretty simple. Take everything that a taquito and/or rolled taco is and instead of using a corn tortilla use a flour tortilla. Los Antojos uses Corn tortillas making these not flautas, but rolled tacos. They were pretty good, but not at all what I was expecting. I also wasn't crazy about the take out presentation. Instead of topping off the fake flautas with sour cream and lettuce they were all packaged seperately. I apprecate the consideration of soggy fake flautas, but one thing I love is the pre-made orchaestration of my rolled tacos and/or flautas. I accept the fact that the middle one may be a 3-napkiner, that's okay. Don't make me construct my own lunch though. 

Given the reviews I was disappointed, but I only tried one thing on the menu. Not sure I will be back to try another. I will say the place was packed for lunch and several people were eating soup, so maybe I should go a different route if there is a next time.
