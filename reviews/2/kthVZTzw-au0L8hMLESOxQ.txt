The server was attentive today.  Refilled drinks with a quickness.  Been a little while since we have been here.  Seems that the prices may have stayed the same but the quantity went down.  We both had Fajitas but only 2 tortillas?  I thought it used to be 3.  I could be wrong but we only got 6 mini chimis in our order and I thought it used to be 8.  Po Pos gives you 8 for the same price as Macayos.  

The restaurant needs to be cleaned.  The light fixtures above the tables were nasty.  A deep cleaning and dusting needs to be done in here.  Hire an outside service to do so.   I am curious what the kitchen looks like if the dinning room is like this.
