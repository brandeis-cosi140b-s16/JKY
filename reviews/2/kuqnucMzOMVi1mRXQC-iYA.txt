Woke up so hungry this morning that I thought I would start biting my right hand. Didn't want McDonald's, BK, Jack... I wanted a true Mexican breakfast burrito.

Once I have a foodie vision in my head, I'm locked in and make it an unwavering attempt to meet my goal.

I order the Sausage/Egg/Cheese Burrito. Excited, I hand the Cashier (drive-thru) my debit card. He disappears for what seems like a prolonged time to just swipe my card. I don't mean to be paranoid, but being a past victim of someone stealing my bank info and going crazy in Montreal, CAN, made me this way. He comes back w/ear-to-ear grin. I'm suspicious as how can someone be THAT giddy so early? Maybe he just is. Happy pills? Chronic? I dunno... I think I just think too much.

Back to the food - I race to my place of work and am DYING to bust the seam on my burrito log. Honestly, the sausage crumbles tasted old and a little dry. Cheese grease was seeping everywhere. On a positive note, love their red (spicy) sauce and the verde (tomatillo) sauce. My tummy is pissed and it feels like WW3 going on inside. I'm throwing the rest away. 

May return but for lunch or dinner fare. May not.
