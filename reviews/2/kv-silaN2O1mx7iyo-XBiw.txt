I typically don't do bad reviews but this place was disappointing. The chips and salsa were great but that was it. The chicken taco was flavorless and I never did taste any chicken there was so little meat. The shrimp tacos were fishy so i didn't finish them. The corn queso dip was blah and cold. And the prickly pear green tea was just a fancy name for plain old green tea.
