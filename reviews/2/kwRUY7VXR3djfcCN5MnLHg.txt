Bland airport Mexican food that doesn't satisfy your Mexi-cravings, but will fill you up.  It seems sort of like Chipotle's crappy little brother.  I got a large (the normal size at Chipotle) burrito with chicken that was unevenly chopped (some pieces were morsels and some could barely fit in my mouth), flavorless rice, pico de gallo, corn, onions, cilantro, lettuce, and a "little bit of sour cream."  In addition to throwing things onto the tortilla as if they were filled with all the hate and scorn of someone who has just missed a flight and been re-booked into a middle seat that doesn't recline, they threw in a huge gob of sour cream.  

The one thing they have over Chipotle is the option to have cilantro and chopped onions.  How come Chipotle doesn't have that?

Surly service + mediocre (but certainly edible) food + cilantro & chopped onions = 2 stars
