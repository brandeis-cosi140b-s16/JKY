I was in the mood for a damn good burrito and knowing I dont like the place across the street I drove five miles to this cookie cutter replica of a fast food chain desperately trying to be an independent Mexican Restaurant.  

The food is average at best very plain and bland. The food on the topping bar was old looking and past its expiration time. 

The employees were pleasant and the only redeeming thing about this store.
