So, on the spectrum of Taco Bell to Baja Fresh, this was a small step up from Taco Bell. I decide I want to try to get something slightly healthy and start looking at the salads; maybe that was my first mistake. I asked about the Chicken and Avocado salad. The young girl behind the counter said there were beans on the salad. When I asked if they were black or pinto, she said, "I think they are kinda like pinto." Telling me that she really doesn't know the difference . . . maybe something they should cover in training. Side note, the salad did not have beans on it. Something else they might want to cover in training.

Then I asked about the picante salad dressing. The response was a sweet/hot dressing. When the salad arrived, I would have called it PACE Picante. I don't mind PACE, but lets be honest about what is being served.

The chips that they gave me while I was waiting were a little over done, however the hot sauce in the squeeze bottle was pretty good.

Now, some my say it is my own fault for ordering a salad at a place like this, however I think there are plenty of Mexican Food restaurants that have delicious salads, Baja Fresh being one of them. So, if you are looking for a salad, don't go here. If you want a 5 lb burrito to make you sluggish for the rest of the day, maybe it will be good - I wouldn't know. Either way, I won't be going back. Honestly, I'd rather go to Taco Bell.
