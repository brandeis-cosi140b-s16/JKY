I used to like the club portion of Gonzalez y Gonzalez until I stopped by today and saw they now have reserved bottle service and all of the seating area is no longer available. $190 for a bottle of SKYY not cool and the restaurant area is now open later. Not a big fan of Reventon at Gonzalez y Gonzalez! The music is still good!
