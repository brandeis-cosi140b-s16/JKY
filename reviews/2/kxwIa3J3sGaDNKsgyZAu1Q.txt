Meh.
I had high hopes for this place. Hole in the wall look from the outside gave me hope that it was old fashioned charm, tried and true food and great service.
We had heard good reviews so I am also suspicious that maybe we just had an off day?
Our server seemed timid and confused...almost had to ask her to take our drink orders which was kinda strange. We had ordered ice tea and it was sour. When we mentioned it was old and had asked for something different, she said oh..ok, just one or both of you? 
Well.. its sour for both of us.. sooo.. :-/
We waited about 25 minutes for a cheesecrisp-- not a big deal as we weren't in a rush. We didn't finish it however, because it was far too greasy. We had sopped up some of the grease but our stomachs said stopppp.. so we did. --Not before I had asked for pico and was brough a bowl of little onions. I said is this the pico? "Yes."
They had two one stall restrooms (one in the dining and one in the bar) which were both full the entire time we were there-- with 2-3 people waiting outside of each.
Not our ideal mexican food spot... Phoenix offers better choices.
