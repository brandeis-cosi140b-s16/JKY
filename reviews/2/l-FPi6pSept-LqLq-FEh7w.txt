It's an ok place ! I wouldn't eat here again .once in a life time kind of place . The portions for the pinche combo was small little rice little beans . And when the woman delivered the she took the plasticware from her apron . Hope she wash her hands after she used the restroom .And her apron looks like it hasn't been washed since they open the restaurant . Definitely not a place to eat if you have weak immune system . Definitely 
You'll have a stomach hurt . So for a 8.95 combo plate not a good deal thumbs down .
