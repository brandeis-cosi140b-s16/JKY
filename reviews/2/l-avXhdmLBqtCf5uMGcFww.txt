Glimmers of greatness, but screwed up in the execution. I read plenty of reviews about good food and bad service, and SumoMaya was true to their reputation.  We had 13 in our group, and the service was bad.  Food took a very long time to come out, with dishes trickling out for over an hour.  As we were ready to pay our bill they brought the last two tapas dishes. For the money they spent building this place, they should hire a strong operations team and get their act together. Food was good, but the wait was bad.
