This place was disappointing. I ordered their #6 shrimp with rice and beans to eat in. I had to pay more for extra tortillas which I don't mind(I want to enjoy this food). The lady brings my food out on a plate to go, (I don't care I'm hungry) she apologizes. I open the to see my food, (what the mother monkey is this)? Food did not look worthy enough to enter my hungry tummy. What a waste of $10. I'll try this place  time next week and try their fish tacos. (You get one more try Filbertos)
