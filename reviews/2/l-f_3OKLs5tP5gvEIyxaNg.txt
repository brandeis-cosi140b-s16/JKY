Omg.  I think you need to know the fellow diners in order to have a good experience.  They paid too much attention to us when we were there for dinner.  We felt like we were the new kids on the block.  Oh, the waitresses were talking about their latest relationship status.  So loud that by the end of the night, I knew which of the girls liked another girl.  Haha.  Crazy.
