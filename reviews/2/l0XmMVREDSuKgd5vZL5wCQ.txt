Not very good... Ordered a pitcher of house margaritas and it had to have been the worst margarita I've ever had. Waaaay too sweet! Tasted like it had no alcohol, and no sour. Just sweet. Almost like lemonade. Very expensive lemonade. 

Also ordered the tostada nachos. Nope. Not very much flavor. Good amount of cheese, but just overall, a big mess of boring nachos. Can get better nachos for cheaper at any other place pretty much. Also, the "entree size" nachos are smaller than some "appetizer" nachos at other places.

On a positive note, the inside was pretty nice. Liked the atmosphere!




Don't come here.
