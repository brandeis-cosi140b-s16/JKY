The restaurant has a nice appearance but the food was disappointing.

We got what looked like a heaping amount of guacamole, but in the middle of it they put chips (hidden to the eye until you get there) which made for soggy chips and less guac.  The guac was actually pretty good but that was disappointing.

I got the pulled pork sandwich for lunch.  The portions were tiny and there was absolutely no presentation.  For $15 dollars at lunch I expect more food and more presentation than I got.

The drinks here are expensive too.  I think they are all about $12 each.  We went for the pitcher of Mojito's and while it was good, it was hard to get the mojito out from all of the ice, etc.

I would not eat here again, nor would I recommend it to anyone.
