For what I got I really wasnt impressed, I got a chicken burrito bowl and a side of queso and chips. It wasnt bad but it wasnt OMG I gotta come back. Their queso was to runny and bland...I've had better at other places that have a similar concept. The service could use some help too....it usually helps to acknowledge people who are coming into your establishment.
