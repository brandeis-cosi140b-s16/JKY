Quesadilla - Imperial Palace
Overall 
2 Stars

Gold Medal - Generous Portions
Silver Medal - Warm Tortilla Chips
Bronze Medal - $1 Margaritas

The food here was nothing special.  The establishment was clean and there was no wait.  The portions were very generous.  The specials were the quesadillas.  I got the loco loco.  It came stuffed fat with plenty of meat and cheese.  It was good, not great but not bad either.  Just good.

There is complimentary salsa and tortilla chips.  The chips were good, it came out warm and very crispy.  The salsa was just salsa.  Nothing extra tasty or special.  Seemed a bit dry to me.

They had $1 margaritas.  For $1 what can you expect right.  

Overall this place really is not that great or special.  The portions are big and the service was very good, but that is about it.

HAPPY QUESADILLAING!!
