Went looking for Mexican cuisine that was within walking distance of my hotel, happened upon Garcia's. Dropped in with a group of seven and it took nearly 10 minutes for our server to greet us and take drink orders. The drinks were then brought out in shifts with the final drink appearing 5 minutes after the first one arrived. Salsa and chips were decent. I choose the shrimp tacos, which came in flour tortillas with a side of rice and beans. Tacos lacked flavor and were overwhelmed by a runny sour cream sauce. I ended up picking out the shrimp and shredding the drier areas of the tortilla to salvage my meal. The rice and beans were the highlight. Additionally, due to inattentive service, we twice had to request that our server come to our table. The restaurant itself seems a bit old and groups of people get easily held up in the skinny hallways. Overall, I'm not a fan of Garcia's.
