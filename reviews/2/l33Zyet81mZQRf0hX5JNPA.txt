Ended up here because my original destination was hosting a private party.

Obviously popular with people from the neighborhood. Lots of folks who greeted each other at the tables,

Food was passable. Beer list was week, but it is billed as a tequila place.

Chips were wimpy. They don't stand up to the guac. I never understand this.

Overall, the place was OK, just not someplace I would choose as a destination.
