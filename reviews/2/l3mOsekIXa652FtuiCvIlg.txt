Hubby and I were craving some mexican, so we decided to try this place. We called about 25 minutes before their ridiculously early closing time of 8pm. The woman was incredibly rude, asked us how far we were (which makes sense it was the nasty tone she used), then told us twice to hurry and make sure we were there before closing. Despite telling her we were less than 5 minutes away. We get there about 15 til, food's not ready and there are 8 people inside still eating! Clearly they weren't getting out of there on time anyway. 

Based on the reviews I expected really exceptional food, I can put up with rude staff for good food. Rude staff and mediocre food? Not so much. We ordered a burrito, some tacos, beans and guac. All of which were just bland, the flavor people speak of must come solely from their sauces. I feel meat should actually be seasoned and not wholly reliant upon red sauce. The chips that came with the meal super thick and overcooked. The portion sizes were also very small compared to most other "mom and pop" mexican joints. Usually for the same price we have enough leftovers for at least lunch. 

I'm honestly disappointed, I was hoping to find a place that could replace the Villa's by our old house.
