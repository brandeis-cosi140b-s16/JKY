Eh. Not that great for food. I ordered the sampler platter and the chicken and beef skewers were served cold and dry. The cheese enchiladas tasted processed and commercially produced. My wife's mom ordered the mujado burrito and it was salty and soggy with the flavors all very bland. Luckily, the Hardrock comped our meal up to $80. I don't recommend Pink Taco for meals.
