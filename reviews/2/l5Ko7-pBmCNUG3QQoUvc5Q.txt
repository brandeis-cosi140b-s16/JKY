Ive eaten here for years and before that I ate at the one in Springerville. The food is pretty good but after this weekend I won't be coming back. My kid brother wanted to go here for his birthday with the folks and our kids So 5 adults, and 4 kids. We left out at 4:30 fully anticipating weekend crowds.  They had us wait for 20 Min's then took us back to a table that may seat 4 then when it was obvious we could not seat here the host dipped out Thats right he was gone just left us standing there, 
I know "family owned" allows for some easement on formalities however that crosses over the line. How about not waste our time? A simple we just can't accommodate you at this time would suffice The host does not have the most. Just simply due to chitty attitude I can spend my dinero somewhere else where they appreciate patronage
