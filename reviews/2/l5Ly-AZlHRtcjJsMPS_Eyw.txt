I'll say it again, I really don't like writing bad reviews especially for local places. But hopefully business owners will find some insight to help them improve what they've got. 

Madison has a handful of Taquerias that offer similar menus--Taqueria Guadelajara, Los Gemelos, Tienda Los Gemelos, etc--and I've tried most of them. Francisco's was my least-favorite. 

In short, dirty menus, spacey service, and flavorless food don't entice a repeat visit. The staple taco came with dry chicken cubes on top of two oily, hard tortillas. Burrito suizo was dry, sauceless. It seemed like the staff were going through the motions, passionless for the food they were offering, which was sad to experience from a customer's standpoint. 

Next time, I will get tacos elsewhere.
