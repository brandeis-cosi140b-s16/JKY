Last three times I have been in the restaurant it has been after 830pm and they are still quite busy.  Tonight, when i was in line, there were 6 people in front of me, 2 who had already ordered.  It seriously took 15 minutes before my order was taken and another 6-7 minutes to complete.  The cashier was off in her own world, all the food was empty and getting refilled, and generally a poorly run night.  Food was ok, nothing to talk about.  But the guac I ordered with my chips was runny and really bad.

You are a quick stop for ok mexican food.  Your late night crew at this restaurant needs to be retaught how to work fast and make people happy.  they clearly need help.  

I will probably give them one last chance, but am not looking for much improvement.  This store needs help as Most chipotle stores are 10 times better.
