Seriously, just bad! The burritos were small and not very filled. I got a Philly burrito and the meat they used was not good! It tasted very artificial. The wait through the drive thru was very long, we probably waited about 15 minutes at the drive thru window just to receive our food. The wait was not worth it. We will not be going back.
