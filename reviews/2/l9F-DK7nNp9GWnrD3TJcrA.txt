The food was average quality for the price, about what I was expecting. The staff was super busy, but they were trying very hard to keep up. There were two mistakes in my large order, but as soon as I walked up to the counter, the girl helping me knew what had happened. We'll probably go back when we're looking for a quick cheap meal, but not too often.
