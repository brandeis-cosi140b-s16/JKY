So I was in Phoenix for work, and had a chance to meet up with an old friend for dinner / drinks on a Thursday night.  After dinner, we stopped at Sandbar for a quick drink to catch up around 10'ish.  First off... outdoor bar in January?  Awesome.  Coming from CA, I'm used to the warmer-than-usual winters, but having 70-degrees at 10pm?  sweeeet.  

The bar itself was average, the staff virtually non-existent besides the bartenders flirting with a few patrons.  ...and the patrons?  pretty much a mix of everything you could imagine.  Blue-collar workers, business men/women, scantily-clad women whose provocative nature screamed of low self-esteem, and jersey shore wanna-be's.  So yeah, they have a bit of everything.  Decent bar for people watching, but I doubt I'd return there unless forced.
