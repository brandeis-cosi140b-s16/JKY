Awful. Not sure the hype on this joint? Had the enchilada's with chicken in red sauce. Spicy! No flavor. The tortilla's were super thick, and there was nothing in the enchilada's?? WTF? The chicken had no flavor, so under seasoned. The beans were not refried but more like just frijoles. They had not real flavor. The rice was hard! Now, I understand this is not really mexican but more Santa Fe style or NM style. But it was terrible. I know the Central Ave location is the original and suppose to be better but honestly how much better could it be from this location? Really, it's that much better? Doubt it. Just another one of those Hyped up Phx places that really is a pile of crap! 
I much rather go to a pile of crap called Carolinas which is 10 times better.
What a joke this place was. No good at all but then again I am spoiled living in mexico for 8 years
