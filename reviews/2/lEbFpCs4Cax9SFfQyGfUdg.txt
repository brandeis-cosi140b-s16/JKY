I'm a big fan of burritos, especially the "garbage" variety of mixed meat, rice, beans, sauce and salsa that I remember from living in Los Angeles and Southern California. They were super big and super tasty.

Not so at Blue Burrito.  My burrito was barely edible.  A Taco Bell Cantina Chicken Bowl is better tasting than this and it's a far cry from a burrito at Chipotle.  The service was pretty quick but for some reason they were out of chicken, so thanks, no thanks I'll skip Blue Burrito next time.

Would have been slightly better if I could have gotten the sauce packets opened.  Maybe it wouldn't have tasted too salty and on the bland side.  There must have been a thimbleful of guacamole on my burrito as I couldn't taste it at all.  The flavors never mixed or fused into anything enjoyable.

What was imagined as a healthier alternative to airport food was pretty disappointing and resulting in my drinking a lot on the plane to get the salty taste out of my mouth.
