We have frequented this place and gave them our hard earned cash many times... I think we go here because of the convenience and not the food/service.  Food is okay - it is really hit or miss depending on if you get a good cook day or a bad cook day.  We have gotten very tasty beef tacos on one visit and the next time, they will be horrible.  No consistency at all.

I just need to harp on one thing which has been consistent - no matter if we have sat in the bar area, at the bar itself or in the dining room.  It takes FOREVER to get your check.  And then it takes an eternity to get them to take your payment.  We have waited 20 minutes just to get cashed out.  I do hope that the management reads the reviews because it's something that really irritates customers.  We want to leave!  We want to give you your table so you can fill it again!
