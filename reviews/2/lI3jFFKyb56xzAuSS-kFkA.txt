The service was unfriendly and the owner acted like he was doing me a FAVOR by re-filling my tiny salsa cup "(I'll do it for you this time; next time there will be a charge.")  Wha???  Most places refill your chips/salsa until your heart's content. 

The ambiance is artsy, which I like, but the seating is uncomfortable and stark.

The food was ok, but nothing special. I had a veggie burro and hubby had cheese enchiladas.  Those were both good, but not great. WAY too pricy for what you actually get, for sure.

Good Mexican?  Los Dos Molinos is a much better bet!
