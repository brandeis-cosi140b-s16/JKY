This restaurant has very good service, and is an extension of the Cabo's franchise when Station Casinos bought Santa Fe Casino and turned it into Santa Fe Station. It is, indeed, located in Palace Station on Sahara and Rancho.

I rate this restaurant 2-stars because:
*) Medium Rare steak was delivered Medium.
*) Fried Ice Cream came straight out of the freezer...not fried at all. I used to work in a 3rd Generation Mexican restaurant as a line cook...fried ice cream is supposed to be...uh...fried. Yes, fried. You know? In a deep fat fryer?

The reason this restaurant earns 2 stars is because of the wonderful service I've predictably gotten every time I've eaten there (about once a month for several months running) and the tortilla chips served with three kinds of salsa and bean dip.

I would really like to rate-up this restaurant but I'm afraid I can't. Maybe in an update, but listen: Medium Rare is a very common, well-taught serving of ribeye and if you can't serve it correctly...pfft.

Open for dinner only, too. Whats up with that?
