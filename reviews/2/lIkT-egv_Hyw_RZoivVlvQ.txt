I keep meaning to send an email to the manager, but keep forgetting.

We've lived in Vegas ten years now and this was probably the third happy I ever went to and loved the appetizer platter, therefore have eaten here very regularly for ten years.  

That being said, the last two years or so have been absolutely horrible.  Not sure what is going on with the management.  The staffing has serious issues, no one is serving the bar top tables, the waitresses and hostesses are aloof and rude, the food and menu have now changed and are inconsistent and horrible.  My food tasted water logged the other day, one of the new aps was inedible and I actually sent it back.  As I said, this was my FAVORITE meal place for ten years and also had a FAVORITE bartender and drink.  This place feels like it is now relying on the drunken drug party crowd and just want to be a bar and not a restaurant, the food used to be so good that I brought visitors here when they said mexican for dinner.  We actually stopped eating here and started eating at culinary dropout as our place of choice when in hard rock now.....please get it together and bring back the original happy hour menu with those potato flautas, the corn cake thing and the steak skewers and quit messing with what was working.  The new aps are disgusting and the wait staff issue is just beyond horrible.  We have now walked out a few times and have been coming less and less.  Oh, and then the waitress asked us if we needed more tortillas for our fajita (because it came with two dehydrated and disgusting ones), so we say yes, only to find a 2 dollar upcharge on our bill.  Just ridiculous and down hill...sad to lose one of my favorite restaurants for the last ten years...get it together.
