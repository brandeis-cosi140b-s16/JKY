We used to be fans of this place, but we noticed that around 11/2008 they changed their prices and their menu, and we haven't been back since. They do have the best green corn tamale in PHX, but I used to get their nachos, and now they are less than half the serving and about the same price. I know the economy sucks, but they are a tad too expensive for what they serve now. 

Not a fan any more!
