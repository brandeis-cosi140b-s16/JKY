After reading the reviews on yelp and hearing about the famous Filibertos from other people I thought that this was going to be a memorable Mexican food expedition. I was pretty disappointed and so was my husband. His taco shell was over-cooked and you could tell it was dark. I on the other hand ordered a chicken tostada. The chicken was not even chopped I got chunks or chicken and they were big chunks too! To top it off they ran out of tostada bowls so they put a taco shell on the bottom of the plate crushed. *sigh* we ended up eating it because we didnt want our money to go to waste but we left unhappy and not fully "food satisfied"
