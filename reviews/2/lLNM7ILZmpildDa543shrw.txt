I got an offer for a free burrito upon signing up for their loyalty program. I go to Chipotle about  once per month and my first impression was that this place is trying to be like them. So, I can't help but compare to and reference Chipotle. The staff seemed a little dazed even though they weren't really busy. One girl appeared to be cutting chicken for the first time in her life, one guy was standing around the register, and the third guy was making tortillas. They do make their own which was pretty cool to see, but I'm not sure it made a difference in the end. Mine was a bit under cooked and gummy. The appearance of the assembly bar (or whatever it is) looked a little messy and a little stale compared to Chipotle's impeccably maintained station and super fresh ingredients. The guacamole was also turning brown. I opted for no beans and just a little bit of rice. The employee asked the guy behind me, "how about you?" which sounded a little rough. I ordered a steak burrito and the steak was quite well done and a small portion. I reviewed the "extras" board and asked for some veggies to round out my beanless burrito since they don't appear to charge for them. I like the idea of them mixing the ingredients but in practice it seemed a little barbaric and unnecessary. I get to the check out line and the veggies ended up costing an extra $1.00 which I had to put on a credit card because I was coming in for a "free burrito." As far as condiments, I didn't try them. They were so picked over, mostly empty, and dirty that I didn't want to touch the bottles before eating the burrito with my hands. With the extra buck for veggies it ended up costing me the same as Chipotle for the same or lower qualify. I suggest going to Chipotle instead unless you really don't like Chipotle...but they are similar enough that you wouldn't like Pancheros if you don't like Chipotle.
