If you are looking for your simple, typical Mexican cuisine you have found the right spot.  We saw this restaurant on Yelp and figured we would give it a try since we were in the neighborhood.  It has cute decor on the inside, not the best location for a restaurant but some things can't be helped and it looks like the area is being updated/remodeled/reworked.  The salsa was okay, not the typical awesome salsa but more chunky and two types.  The cheese dip was titled Land O'Lakes Cheese dip so that basically tells you how that was.  We tried the veggie quesadilla and carne asada.  Both were okay, smaller portions than most Mexican spots which isn't necessarily a bad thing.  Service was okay.  I tried a margarita, it tasted like one your friend would attempt to make for you at home.  We really wanted to like this place based on other reviews, but it just didn't compare to other spots in the area.  Prices were reasonable though and if they rework the menu a bit and add some classic dishes and go the more classic route with their salsa, and cheese dip they'd draw a bigger crowd in on a weekend evening, which is when we went and it was pretty empty.  We'd probably give it another shot then.
