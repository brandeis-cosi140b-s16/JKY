The wait to order the food is insane!!!! The cashiers seem to spend 5-10 minutes with each person! We were third in line and it took us almost 30 minutes just to order. Food came out wrong! There was no chicken in my "chicken bowl" couldn't get a refill and the food didn't even taste good! I'll stick to chipotle!
