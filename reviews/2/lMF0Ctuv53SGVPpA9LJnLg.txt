If you plan on stopping by Vida Cantina, make sure you join their good life club so you can enjoy the tableside guacomole for FREE on your first visit!  http://vidacantina.com/good-life/  I just wanted to get that out there because I was not aware of this promotion and was extremely disappointed when I couldn't take advantage of free food on our first visit, especially since I don't see myself coming back.

The atmosphere in Vida was what I expected and followed the trend of the rest of the epicentre with upscale modern decor.  We chose to sit in the outdoor patio which was a little noisy from traffic but great for people watching.  Our service was slow and lackluster, and our waitress only came to our table three times while we were there.  I saw our waitress wandering around the outdoor patio several times so I know she was free to stop and see how we were doing but she just never did.

After reading all the reviews I had to order the tableside guacomole which was quite delicious!  I was a little disappointed that they didn't actually make it at our table, but I think that was because we were sitting outside.  So if you're there for the show make sure to sit inside.

Our entrees were very disappointing.  Hubby got the carnitas tacos with pork meat in a soft wheat tortilla shell.  I tried a bite of a taco and it had zero flavor and the meat was dried out.  I ordered a cobb salad and made the mistake of not asking for my dressing on the side.  It was drenched in dressing and all the lettuce was soggy.  Gross.

Overall we paid too much money for poor service and not so great food.  I don't even think the free guacomole on the next visit will bring me back.  This makes me sad because I really wanted to like this place.  :(
