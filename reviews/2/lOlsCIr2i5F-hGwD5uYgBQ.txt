I gave this two stars because I will not go back. The only reason I didn't give it one star was because the food was edible and the service was ok. However, I want more than mediocre food for my money. We had the chicken taco combo and a green chile burrito enchilada style (was hoping for a tasty red sauce but it was a soupy green tasteless sauce).  We had the tomatillo sauce and the pico de gallo.   All of it, including the chips were bland. I had a  Stevia lemonade and my partner had a mango lemonade. Mine had too much Stevia in it and I am a BIG Stevia user. Partner's lemonade was so-so. Not much mango flavor and even the lemonade flavor didn't taste natural. Why pay $2.50 for lemonade from a mix? We don't feel a need to give them another try as we often do, because everything was consistently boring. Too bad because  I like to encourage places that serve healthy foods like whole wheat tortillas and brown rice.
