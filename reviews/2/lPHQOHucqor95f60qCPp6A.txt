We arrived on a Saturday afternoon. The place was fairly empty. The atmosphere was nice, but our server seemed like he had better things to do. No eye contact, no smiles. Whatever I guess, onto the food. I had the machaca beef chimichonga, which was really good. My wife has a taco salad. The tortilla bowl it comes in was awesome, but the ground beef was bland, and the lettuce was obviously from one of those bagged salad mixes - you know the kind with dried up shards of carrot and red cabbage. Really? Come on, how hard is it to cut up some fresh lettuce? My daughter had the Carne Asada... not sure what cut of beef that was but it was really tough and had some troubling gristly parts. So all said, our search for really good mexican food in the north valley continues...
