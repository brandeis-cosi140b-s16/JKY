Got a to-go combo from Carolina's tonight- two hard tacos with rice and beans.  I got one chicken and one beef taco.  They were completely devoid of flavor - the chicken tasted like nothing, and the beef wasn't much better.  The rice and beans were good, I had to add some to each taco to give it some flavor.  Maybe I got the wrong thing, but I seriously doubt the other meats could be much better.
