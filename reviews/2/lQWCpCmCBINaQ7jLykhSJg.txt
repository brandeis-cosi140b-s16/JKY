I recently went to grab some lunch and it was a tremendous experience that I'll never forget. The lines were long , too long. People were getting Mad and there were no more.seats. I had to literally eat my food in the car. Maybe that day made it disappointing for me. I'll try to check if there busy before I ever walk in again.
