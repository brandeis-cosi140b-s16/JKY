So...I consulted Yelp on my last visit to Phoenix. I wanted to eat mexican food and the majority of them pointed me here. Sean S was so kind enough to actually meet me out too, so I got to meet a Phoenix yelper in the process!!! 

I prepared myself for the food to be spicy. The salsas that came out were fairly mouth burning, and I was expecting the green chile to be just as hot. It was definitely hot, but did not make up for the lack of flavor the food it was smothered in. We both ordered the blue corn chicken enchiladas. I don't know-I really expected more from this place.  I live in Denver where we have some amazing green chile and New Mexican style cuisine, so maybe my expectations were set a bit high.


All in all..just meh. I'd give it 2.5 stars if I could.  I did like the thick enchilada though. And good company. Margaritas need a bit of work though...lay off the sweet and sour mix!
