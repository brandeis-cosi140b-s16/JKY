My food was good but my boyfriends was still raw in the middle and our server was good. While we were relaxing and having a good time a guy pushed a waitress walking with a tray of margaritas causing  two of them to pour down the back of my shirt filling the booth up with it as well. I was soaked! And disappointed that no one even cared for it. I had to tell the manager my shirt was soaked he then gave me a cooks shirt and the bill. I work at a restaurant myself and know that certain situations like these need to be handled a lot better!
