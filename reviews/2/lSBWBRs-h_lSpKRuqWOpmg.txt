It is clear from previous reviews that either people have different ideas of what constitutes Mexican food, or that employees are writing reviews.

We were excited at the prospect of a new Mexican choice close to home, as Casa Blanca had seemed to slip a notch recently. We went on a Friday night around 7PM. There were plenty of open tables, but we still had to wait 15 minutes for a table. To be that empty on a Friday night should have been our first red flag, and hearing the Mariachi band from the waiting area should have been our second warning. 

We were seated, and greeted by a friendly wait person who took our drink orders immediately. The mariachis were a table away from us, so conversation was limited until they moved away. They were truly horrible, and while we were there, they repeated their very small repertoire a couple of times (3 times for La Bamba!).

The decor reminded me of a fake Mexican place you would find in a tourist area. Whomever was sitting behind me was either bouncing against the booth back, or the furniture were so flimsy that each time they moved it creaked and moved on me. We were treated to a plexiglass table top and paper napkins.

The food arrived in about the time you would expect. The Chile Con Queso was a chunk of cheese melted with some roasted Jalapenos thrown in, as it cooled it turned greasy and stringy. 

I ordered the Chile Verde, my wife got a combo of Taco and Enchilada. The food could have come from any fast food Mexican place, the beans from a can.

The meal ended, and the Mariachis were getting closer to the table again. I think the wait person was just as anxious to avoid them as I was, as she dissapeared for a good 10 minutes while we sat waiting. A Bus erson even came by and started clearing our table.

None of it was truly bad (oh, wait, the mariachis were), but none of it was good, and at about $12 per entree, it fell far short of expectations.

I hope the next restaurant to go into that spot is better!
