I'm a huge Chipotle fan, but it has to be said: this is quite possibly the worst Chipotle I've been to.

They don't have Chipotle in my hometown, so you can bet your sweet ass that whenever I go to a place where there is one, I will plan my meals around it. Hell, I even plan several of my meals around having Chipotle, so that I can maximize my delicious burrito-bowl eating opportunities. That being said, shortly after landing in Madison, of all the places, this HAD to be my first stop. 

It sucked. 

The workers here are more grouchier than your typical chipotle employee. You literally have 5 seconds to shout out your order before the workers give you a look so disdainful you might think you just kicked a basket full of baby kittens. Ugh, the pressure! Not to mention they scoop out your food and throw it in the bowl with such force, it's no wonder that the food portion is so small! Most of it ends up outside of the bowl, and you're left with an order half the size of what you'd get at any other location.

I get it, it's a college town, and no doubt most of the employees are college students. I've been there. Hell, I've even been asked to throw away used tissues at my part time jobs while I've been in college. Life isn't that bad, kids. It shouldn't be, especially at Chipotle.
