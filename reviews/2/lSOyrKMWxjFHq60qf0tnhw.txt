I agree with Joe H.  Nothing special enough to make me want to return here.  And it is always a clue when the restaurant likely holds a couple of hundred people but is empty.

To their credit, my mother really enjoyed the fish.  I had fish tacos, which were absolutely average.

Service?  Average.

Atmosphere?  They should have put all that cash into paying the Executive Chef.
