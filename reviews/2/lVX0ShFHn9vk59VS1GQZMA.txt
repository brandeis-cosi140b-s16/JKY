Used to be a regular here. The past few visits I've noticed a decline in the service. Also noticed a change in the menu along with a price increase, however the quality hasn't improved. We waited over 15 mins for drinks then even longer for food and to receive bill. Overall wasted an hour just on wait time. Waiter wasn't tentative. Won't be returning. Love the owners is the only reason I gave them another chance.
