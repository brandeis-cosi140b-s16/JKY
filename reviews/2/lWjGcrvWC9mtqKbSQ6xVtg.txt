I had heard some really great things about this place and was excited to check it out. Overall, I was disappointed. The food was okay (I've experienced far better - seemed a lot like "American Mexican") - but the service was awful. Our waitress couldn't keep anything straight, and was also super awkward. I don't think I'll be coming back - you can find better food and definitely better service.
