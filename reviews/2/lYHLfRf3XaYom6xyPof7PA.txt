Went here because we had a groupon.  Not opposed to going back, but  would not make a special trip for to get there.   Chips seemed to be out of a bag, the salsa was tomatoes and salt--and a very small portion at that.   Entree portions were large, hot and tasty.  

I had the chilequiles, and had no complaints.  The chicken was done well and the sauce was nice and spicy like I like it.  Hubby had sampler of enchiladas, no complaints.  Daughter had veggie plate #4, and she thought it was good.  That's it, good--not great--no complaints!

Wait staff was very nice!
