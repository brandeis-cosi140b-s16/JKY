I don't understand why everyone likes this place so much. This place is called burrito express and we had to wait like 20 minutes to get our food, with no one in front of us. I got the steak and salsa burrito my fiance got the machaca burrito. His was like 3 times the sizes of mine and my cheese wasn't even melted. My burrito wasn't terrible but it wasn't good. My fiance's burrito was so disgustingly greasy he couldn't even finish it and he loves greasy food, we wouldn't even want to give it to our dog. It looked disgusting! He just threw the other half away and felt sick the rest of the day. We ordered some chips and salsa and they threw a couple table spooned size salsa containers in the bag, which wasn't enough for the chips. We asked for more and they charged us extra for each salsa! The salsa tasted terrible! They also charge you extra for using a credit card. I wouldn't go back.
