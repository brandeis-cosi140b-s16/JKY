The food here is ok...it's a hit or miss.  The service is what actually makes me only give 2 stars though. Tonight I was in the drive thru with 2 cars in front of me and waited a total of 17 minutes!  If it wasn't for the person behind me blocking me in and the person behind him, I would have left.  When I finally got to the speaker to order, it took forever for them to acknowledge me. I ordered and the guy repeated it back then ...... Nothing.  Me: "that's all..thanks". Them: .....nothing.  Me: "hello?". Them: "ok yeah..pull up".  You know....not sure if they're in a carb coma from the food or if they're high (or both) but...ugh...frustrating!  That long wait made me miss Seinfeld!
