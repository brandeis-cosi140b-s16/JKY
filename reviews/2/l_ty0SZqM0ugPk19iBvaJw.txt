I was so hyped on my way here, I brought a coworker to order for the whole store. It was so busy, everything looked great. I said I've never been here and I'm starving. He ordered for me and it literally ended up being a beef burrito with only retried beans and nothing else. I'm sure everyone else enjoyed there's but man was that confusing
