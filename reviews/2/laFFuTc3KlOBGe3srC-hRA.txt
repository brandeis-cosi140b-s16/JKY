My husband and I ate at The Salted Lime for Cinco de Mayo with some friends. We came around 5PM and were immediately seated. 

Chips and salsa are complimentary, which is always a good thing at a Mexican restaurant. There were actually three dips: a spicy red salsa, a salsa verde, and a bean dip. The chips were warm and crunchy and the dips all tasted pretty good.

I ordered a bean chimichanga which was humungous. It wasn't made as I requested (I asked for sour cream) but overall it was still good. My husband had the nachos, and he didn't have any real complaints either. The food portions are generous and relatively inexpensive. The Margaritas were only $4 and served in generous portions as well.  
  
The reason why I'm rating the restaurant so poorly is due to poor service. Our waitress lacked personality and was extremely inattentive. My husband waited 15 minuted to get his beverage. After reminding her, she said she would comp the drink. This was a positive step, but she quickly backtracked any progress by virtually ignoring us thereafter. We had to ask twice for anything we needed help with. She never cleared a single item from the table either. When the check came, she mixed up our orders and charged the wrong checks to our cards. Ultimately, it took us 45 minutes to flag our waitress down to get the check and finally pay and leave. We spoke to the manager who barely apologized, but sent us off with 3 bottled beers for the inconvenience.  

The food was good but not great, and the service is horrible. We definitely won't be coming back!
