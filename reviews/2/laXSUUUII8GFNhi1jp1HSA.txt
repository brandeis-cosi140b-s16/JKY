Guacamole and chips is pretty good, but the tacos I had were not. My fiancé ordered a dish she was also pretty unhappy with. Lucky for us, the waitress(es) we had were awesome and my fiancé liked my dish. I finished off the chips and guacamole, she ate my tacos, and they took her meal off the bill. That's some good service.

The guacamole was really expensive, though. $10 for a smallish bowl? I don't think I'll make that mistake again. The salsas that came with the chips were also delicious. Well, 2 out of 3. But the other one was tomatillo-based and I am really not a fan of those. My fiancé liked that one though. 

So neither of us liked the meal we ended up with, she liked mine enough to eat it (then again, she was also starving...), and the service was good but the prices are too high.
