Its really bad , i know that people who cant graduate high school have to work SOMEWHERE , but if they are working with handling money ... they should at least have a GED.....     My wife was not feeling well and left work early but she was nice enough to pick me up lunch on her way home even though she felt like sh*t.. 

Well here is the funny thing , not only did they screw up the order .. she asked for my chicken burrito with extra sauce no tom , they put no sauce extra tom ..  but they screwed up SIMPLE MATH on the change.   

The bill was 13 dollars and 12 cents ...  my wife gave them 20 dollars and 12 cents ... they gave my wife back  5 dollars and 96 cents ... in which obviously is WRONG.  Then the cashier decided to ARGUE with my wife about the change ... really ?  

We have spoken to the manager and our food is getting replaced , but you REALLY need to either make sure your staff is trained mathematically .. or teach them to use the built in change thing on the computer. 


ugh.  *facepalm*
