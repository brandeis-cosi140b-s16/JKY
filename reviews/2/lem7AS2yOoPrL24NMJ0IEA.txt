I ordered a chicken chimichanga.  The chicken was dry and had a fairly strong unpleasant poultry odor.  The chimichanga had been cooked too long and had no flavor. 2 stars because the rice and beans were OK but those are pretty difficult to get wrong. I also did not like the "no signature required" receipt that they gave me to get me to fill in the tip portion. They should first concentrate on earning a regular customer and not on shamelessly deceitful ways to get an extra dollar out of me.
