Has potential but misses the mark.

If I order tacos without cheese that means the server should have alerted me that they put cheese on literally everything including guacamole, beans and rice. Cojita cheese should not be put on everything, especially when your patrons can't eat dairy and you don't tell them.

The rice was also under cooked and the tacos need two shells or they fall apart.
