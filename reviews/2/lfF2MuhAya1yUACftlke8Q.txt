I had the fish tacos which were good. The salsa that my friends got with their tacos was amazing. However, the "best margarita you'll ever have" was the worst margarita I've ever had. Especially for $15 it was also the smallest one I've had for the piece. Also the bartender, Alex, was more concerned about picking up the tourist next to us than he was about his bartending.
