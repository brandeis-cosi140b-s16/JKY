Not great, but not terrible either.

Pros: My wife liked the salsa, but I say it's just okay. You get two different types, and the red salsa they give you just tastes like a mix of Hormel chili and ketchup.

-Taco; Really liked the shell; it was like you get at a street vendor, seemingly just-cooked and folded. The chicken inside also tasted "homey," like chicken you boiled for hours to make a soup till it was tender. Very brothy and nice.

-Speed; our food was out in a matter of minutes. Kinda scary, actually, as one reviewer put it. Is everything frozen and reheated? Didn't seem that way, as I said my taco was pretty good. But who knows?

Cons: -Lack of spice; nothing on either of our plates had any spice. That said, I feel this place is definitely Mexican food for dumb Americans who can't handle it. Not that I'm looking to burn my mouth on every bite, but a hint of something here and there wouldn't hurt.

Most everything else about this place is unimpressive, but passable. The decor is what you'd expect, service is decent, prices okay I guess. I'm not sure why other reviewers think this place looks dumpy, seemed clean and presentable to me. I'd say "in a pinch, it'll do," but with so many other Mexican places around that's meaningless and Manuel's is just a face in the crowd.

Bottom-line: Go here if you want typical Mexican with a slightly better-than-average dining room atmosphere.
