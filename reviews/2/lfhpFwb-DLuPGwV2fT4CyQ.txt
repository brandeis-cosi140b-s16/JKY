Only O.K.  Carnitas plate tasty. My wife's chile relleno was so-so. Waitress forgot to bring our guacamole. Domestic beer $5/bottle. Tortilla chips were commercially made but the two salsas were tasty. Asked the waitress about the Cuban food - she said it was the same as the Mexican food but with garlic.  We did not try any Cuban. Not worth a second visit.
