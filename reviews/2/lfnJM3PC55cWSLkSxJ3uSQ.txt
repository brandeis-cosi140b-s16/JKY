I've given two stars but really should be zero stars. Due to the amazing ambiance, the two stars go to the amazing setting outside with the holiday lights and fire pit table. Very nice touch! 

My terrible review goes to our service! Our dinner lasted 3 hours, not by choice! Everything took a long time. Our waiter showed no sense of urgency and it was obvious that we were on HIS time. He exuded a sense of superiority with constant correction of our choice in drinks and food. 

I was under the impression that waiters rely on tips and tips are based on service. Our waiter just didn't care to impress and unfortunately this reflects negatively on the resort itself. Ten people walked out of there with with no intent to come back anytime soon.
