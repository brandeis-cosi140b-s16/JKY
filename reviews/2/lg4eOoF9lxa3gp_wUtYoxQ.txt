I heard from my coworkers this place was very good & cheap. 

Well, they were partially right. I mean prices are reasonably & portions are fair. As far as the food goes, it's not all that great. 

Starting off with chips & salsa weren't that good. Too thin no salt and la salsa was too watered down. A coworker was very unsatisfied with his coctel de camaron. He said it tasted like they added Louisiana hot sauce. 

If anything, la agua de horchata was amazing, and the service was great.
