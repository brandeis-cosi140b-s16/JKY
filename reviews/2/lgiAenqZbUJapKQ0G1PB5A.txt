Why on earth would I come here knowing that it had only 1 1/2 stars?  What else?  $25 Food Voucher!!!  For (basically) free food, I am willing to try it at least once.  

The restaurant is upstairs in Imperial Palace.  It's not very big and has more of a sports bar feel to me than a 'restaurant'.  The decor consists of surf boards, bikes, and beer bottles.  Because I had already read the reviews, I didn't have a high expectation.  And sadly to say, my experience echos the other reviewers'  - service was slow (our food took awhile to come out) and the food was very forgettable.  

I had the Pescado Con Limon which was Halibut filets seared in Baja spices, tomatoes, onions, lime and topped with chile cream sauce.
Served with choice of flour or corn tortillas http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zwddv6HjTjDx9fOr3MFtwQ?select=hB3fA-cP6-lzHcSBbwsv9Q.  The fish was actually lightly breaded but had no seasoning what-so-ever.  There was very little Chile Cream Sauce and it failed to give the fish any flavor, too.  I tried adding salsa to it to make it a little more palatable.  However the re-fried beans was good.  

My fiance had the Carne Asada Quesadilla.  He said it was OK (which means 3 stars).  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zwddv6HjTjDx9fOr3MFtwQ?select=kpFGF7KmvpDANgWV1hkfmQ

Free Chips & Salsa was served with every meal.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zwddv6HjTjDx9fOr3MFtwQ?select=CfnBEcYdntK0Ys2yJjFXjA

This restaurant is fairly new and it's a shame that the food fails to attract new customers.
