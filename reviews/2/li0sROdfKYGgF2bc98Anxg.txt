Just didn't work out for us. . .

We stopped by the drive thru Sunday morning to pick up two breakfast burritos.  My wife's had enough liquid in it to fill a small coffee cup.  It was about as hot as coffee as well and spilled down the front of her.  As she was driving at the time, it was a bit alarming to hear her yell in pain--frankly, I thought she was going to lose control of the car for a minute.  She ended up with a mild first degree burn on her stomach.

The burrito was BIG but only fair tasting.  After this experience, we're not sure if we want to return.  YMMV.
