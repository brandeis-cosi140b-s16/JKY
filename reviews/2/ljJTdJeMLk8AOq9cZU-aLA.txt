Imagine a jolly rancher melted down and put into a glass with a salted rim and a taco salad from a place one rung below Taco Bell and you have in your mind a taco salad and margarita from Tequileria.  

Total damage...$27 ($12 margarita, $10 taco salad, $4 tip).

-1 stars for the food and +3 stars for above average airport atmosphere.
