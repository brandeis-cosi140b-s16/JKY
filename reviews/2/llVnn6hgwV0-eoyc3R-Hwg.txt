The quality isn't great, but if you want Mexican and don't have much time, it is better than Taco Bell etc. There seems to be a consistency problem. f you order the same thing meal several times, the meal will be a little different each time. Needs better quality control when it comes to the ingredients being used. Store and furniture are kind of dumpy.
