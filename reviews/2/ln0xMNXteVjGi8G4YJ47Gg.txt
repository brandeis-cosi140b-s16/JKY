Not the worst Mexican food I've ever had, but far from the best.

I've eaten at this particular location several times, and the best food I've eaten has been no better than mediocre.

The chile verde sauce tastes too much like tomatillo and too little like chile verde. The enchiladas seem more like an overcooked casserole than flavorful, stuffed tortillas. The chile relleno may be their best "traditional" Mexican dish though it is very bland. Finally, on the food side, the tacos--at least those served at lunch--lack tomato and onion. They're stuffed with meat, lettuce, a smattering of tasteless orange cheese--and that's it: no tomato, no onion. I can get a more satisfying and better filled taco at a fast-food joint for less money,

Now, as to their "famous Margeritas." The only reason these could be famous is for the poor quality at the astounding price: a base-price blended Margarita, which looks and tastes like little more than a lime slushy costs $8.00. Coyote Cantina on Sunset serves much better Margaritas for the same or less money, especially for the lunch special.

I give this place two stars mainly for the spectacular view., The Margaritas merit no stars, the food one star, and, maytbe, the service two stars, if the people would smile more often, though perhaps they've tasted the food
