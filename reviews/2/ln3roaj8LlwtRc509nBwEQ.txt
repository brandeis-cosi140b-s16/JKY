One word review Meh...

The meat does not have the same flavors of other places like El Gordo. The tortillas were not fresh and the flavor was not there. I had their pork tacos with papaya and pineapple, it took them 2 minutes to prep them, but the quality was not really there. 

On a side note, if you have a friend who can't eat pork for religious reasons, then this place is not suitable since they skillet is shared for all meats.
