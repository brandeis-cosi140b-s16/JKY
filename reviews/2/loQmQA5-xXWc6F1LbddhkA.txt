I'm really upset that I am writing this updated review, but I know I have to do it.  Gordo's has gone downhill, people.  

The food here that used to always be stellar for me is now extremely inconsistent. On the occasions I have received gross food, it honestly has been really bad.  Their enchilada sauce used to be spectacular all the time (perfect consistency, brilliant amount of spiciness).  But recently, I was receiving a thin, gross, tasteless sauce every other time I ordered the enchiladas.  The last meal I had here, I ordered a vegetarian burrito, chimi style.  They neglected to include the guacamole with my burrito.  That's my favorite part of the vegetarian burrito!  [Sometimes when I order it chimi style, they plop the guacamole on top after the burrito is fried.  When it wasn't on top, I figured the guac must be inside -- wrong!]  Also -- and this part really disgusted me -- I noticed that my chimi had seven super-duper, fried-beyond-belief French fries stuck to the bottom of it.  

My husband used to be a huge fan of Gordo's crunchy tacos.  The last few times he has ordered them, the chicken has not tasted right and the taco shells were very mushy.

I guess we kept giving Gordo's chances since we were big cheerleaders for this place from the get-go and was hoping the bad experiences we had here we just flukes.  Doesn't seem like it anymore.

Also, they recently changed their menu and hiked up their prices.  Not cool.  So long, Gordo's, you've lost your Duke & Duchess of check ins.
