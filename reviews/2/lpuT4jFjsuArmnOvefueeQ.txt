We tried this place out for Happy Hour and we were not impressed.  Service was spotty, house margs were weak, we had to ask for chips and salsa and when we finished the small amount brought to us, we were never asked if we wanted more.  I tried the tamale pie corn fritters.  They were uncooked in the middle and lacked flavor.  We also got the papas locas which are cheese fries.  The description says cheddar, but it was actually a cheese sauce and the fries were drenched in it.  The fries were mushy, and not just because of the enormous amount cheese sauce.  The BF got the chicken sliders which he said were "ok".  Nothing about this place makes me look forward to going back...so we probably won't.
