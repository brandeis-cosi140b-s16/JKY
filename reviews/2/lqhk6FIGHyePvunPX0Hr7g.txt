Went here with family because they wanted to go. Apparently the owners used to just cook out of their house and finally moved into a restaurant. Unfortunately, I wasn't impressed. Service was lackluster. It took a long time to get anyone's attention for even simple things like a water refill, and even longer to get orders and our food. Granted there was a large group there but the restaurant wasn't overly crowded other than that.
 The food was mediocre as well. All of the salsas they brought to the table were spicy. There was spicy and spicier, but no mild. The fajitas my husband ordered came with generous portions of meat and veggies but only 3(!) small corn tortillas. Nowhere near enough for the amount of food. My green burrito tasted primarily like poblano peppers. There was really no other flavor in the dish, and I just couldn't eat it. The waiter took away my dish with only 1 bite out of the burrito and didn't so much as ask if I liked it or if there was a problem. Not a good experience overall, and certainly not one that would encourage me to come back.
