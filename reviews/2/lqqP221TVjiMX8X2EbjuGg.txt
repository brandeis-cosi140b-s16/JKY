This review is based on about a dozen pick up orders, most of which have been screwed up in some way. We really like the white menudo (the red is just ok) and its close to our house which is why we've kept going back. However today was the last time we will be giving Rosita's our business.

One major complaint - EVERYTIME we order they give us the standard "20 min" pick up time, yet EVERYTIME we go to pick it up they scramble to find our order,which they most of the time, forget to give to the kitchen then we have to wait another 15-20mins. Annoying. But what's even worse is out of a dozen orders they've only ever gotten two right. They either forget something or give us the wrong thing. 

We usually are annoyed but will go back after a couple weeks, each time convincing ourselves that is just a fluke. But I'm sorry, this isn't a small town with no other options and the food just isn't THAT good for the irritation. 

Maybe dine-in would be a better way to experience Rosita's.
