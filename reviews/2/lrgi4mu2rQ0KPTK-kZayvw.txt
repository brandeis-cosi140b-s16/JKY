Went there to meet a gal pal for some drinks/appetizers.  LOVED the atmosphere and decor.  I'd only been here awhile back w/work folks for lunch.  Unfortunately, I remembered they charge for chips/salsa.  Don't like that.  Waiter said something about...well people come in here and drink beer & eat chips and that's it.  Well,,,who the %@#$ cares!  At least they come in!  The nachos/margaritas were great.  However, the service was awful.  We had to go to the bar to get another drink and the order took 4ever.  During the last 1/2 hour, the waiter deposited the chips.  The waiter also should never have been a waiter as he had no social skills in that department.  I won't be going back there again anytime soon unless someone else is paying!!
