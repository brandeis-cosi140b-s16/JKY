People don't usually come to this downtown Scottsdale night spot to eat. The food isn't anything to call home about and the margaritas aren't spectacular. Infact, the bartenders tend to pour them weak.

However, you will find the party people at the PT. They come to see-and-be-seen. And the bar is SLAMMED with them on Tuesday nights when promoter Brian Durkee hosts Twisted Tuesdays. You'll find guys with popped collars wearing sunglasses at night and peroxide blondes with stiletto heels and cleavage-baring tops. If you're into a scene, this is probably the place for you.
