Bottom line: Nino's is nothing special.  We have been here twice, trying various dishes and have yet to find anything exciting.  The salsa is served in old fashion carafes, and just doesn't have any kick.  I expect more from a neighborhood taco shop.  Lastly, the service is slow and not nearly friendly enough.  I would go so far as to say that the server was annoyed that they were busy, an odd attitude for a restaurant!
