Since my last post, I am so cold when We eat here, summer, fall, winter, spring,  We always need jackets!  that is the only way We will go is when I use drive through.  BTW, I don't like drive through eating.  When I asked the crew about why is was so cold they said that they need it that cold for the back room......NEWS FLASH, TO THE OWNER OPERATOR,....call,the AC company and have them come and balance your units.  You are paying a fortune for your AC!  I think your crew is costing you a small fortune!
