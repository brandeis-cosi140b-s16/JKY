I took my friend to dinner at the Round Corner Cantina on Saturday to celebrate her birthday. We sat on the patio, there were only two other groups of people outside.  We waited for about 15 mins for someone to simply take our drink order. We ordered 2 strawberry margaritas and 2 glasses of water and chips and salsa to start, margaritas came-no water.  We drank the margaritas waited for about another 20 mins for chips and salsa asked a very disinterested waitress if we could place a good order with her since we were abandoned by our waiter... Who was talking with the food runner and checking his iPhone... The waitress informed me that I could get my own water from a container across the patio--the other tables had carafes of water... We ordered the Puerco:it was pretty good and the Carnitas: very dry and disappointing.  This was a terrible experience and I am very disappointed! When we finished I started to walk over to get the bill so we could leave and go somewhere else to celebrate, the first waiter finally came over and said he would bring the bill.... Never apologizing or saying anything.... He then started talking to other waiters so he never brought the bill! I had to ask again! I asked for change for a $10 to tip the food runner... The jerk had the audacity to say thank you  as though I was giving HIM the money! I couldn't believe that any of this was really happening!  I finally got my change left money with the runner and got the hell out of there! The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because it was a cute patio and the Puerco taco was good.  

So if you want to be ignored and treated like you are bothering the waitstaff you should check this place out.
