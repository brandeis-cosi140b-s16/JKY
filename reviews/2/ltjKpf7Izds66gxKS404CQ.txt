The food in this place is OK (it was not particularly hot). Not much better than Taco Bell, to be honest, but when waiting for a Southwest flight at McCarran you don't have a lot of good options.

The prices are high, as they always are at an airport, but not ridiculous.

The service on the other hand, was abysmal. Not particularly slow or anything like that, but I do expect some small degree of courtesy from a server. We were treated in a totally offhand manner, and the server got our order wrong. No hello, thank you, goodbye, have a nice flight, etc. I would classify this woman as rude, to be frank.

Next time, we'll just eat at Burger King or Sbarro.
