So I got a chance to check this place out, finally. I've been suuuper excited for this place to open up, since I'm such a torta whore! I decided to get the Torta Ahogado that came with slow cooked pork, avocado, carrot and some other veggies and the description read with ahogado broth. I imagined some what of a French dip type of thing, but it was more like a sloppy joe. They poured the hot sauce over the sandwich, making it impossible to eat like a sandwich. That may not normally cause an issue, except they lined the little cardboard "boat" for the sandwich in a foil/paper lining that became super soggy. I ended up finding many pieces of foil in my sandwich, mega unappealing. The sandwich was just okay. The bread could have used a bit of time in the toaster, the pork was pretty bland and the sauce tasted a bit burnt.  

The overall feel of the place is pretty cool, it's small with just a few tables outside. I noticed the owner there, but he seemed too busy chatting up the Don Julio Swag girls to check on the customers, which kinda blows. Overall, they get a Meh + from me.  I'll come back again for a different torta next time, and hopefully the experience is better....hopefully
