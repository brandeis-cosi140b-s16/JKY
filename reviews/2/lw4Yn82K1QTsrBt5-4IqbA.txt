In complete contradiction to previous reviews, El Herradero is exactly the very mediocre kind of place you would expect to find hidden in a strip mall. The clear plastic tablecloths and no-budget d√©cor accurately reflect the food quality. A stale basket of chips complete with an errant and quite ancient looking French fry arrived at the table accompanied by a slightly sweet, less than fresh salsa. The chilled ingredients dominated the Carne Asada Burrito making for a cold dish even though it was Enchilada style and heated before served. Pathetically weak Enchilada sauce tasted like something watered-down from a can. The tortillas seemed store bought as did the commercially shredded cheese. Average fast food, neighborhood-Mexican? Maybe. 5-star Mexican restaurant? Definitely not.
