Went to this place about 3 weeks ago and the service was friendly and the food was great. Now I grew up on Indian food and I love spicy food. I usually eat my food with a lot of spices and have a tolerance to it. So the burrito I got was a bit spicy and it was really good. 

okay so Yesterday I went back. The service was RUDE and upset that i came in 5 minutes before close, which i apologized aboit as i had not realozed their closing time and i tipped them! So I asked for a chicken burrito with salsa like last time.  This burrito was SO spicy I could not finish it. In fact I had to get ranch to calm down my mouth. That burrito burned all the way down. I ate ghost chili peppers and it did not hurt this bad. Just sayin
