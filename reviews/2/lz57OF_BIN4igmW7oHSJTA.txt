I tried to post for this store last month. But, for some reason, I couldn't find it. Now, that I have, I added that review for this store.

Whenever I go to a Rubios, I always have the Fish Taco and chips. While the chips were good and the lime and salsa are always fresh (so far), my fish taco was barely warm and the fish not very crunchy (I give this store 2 stars). Seems to me it had been sitting out too long.

However, my mom's taco was soggy and the fish limp; a HUGE disappointment (she gives 1 star). But, liked the chips, lime and salsa, so manages 2 stars.

Perhaps, it was the time of day? But, like other chains, it may also be the store specifically.

Doubtful that I will return to this one.
