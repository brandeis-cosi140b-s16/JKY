I was really hoping to like this place. It's clean and pretty inside and the staff is really nice. Their menu has a lot of potential too. They have a wide variety of options and the prices aren't too bad. The food just didn't wow me. 

We tried a wide variety of items, some good and some not so much. My fella and I ordered a banana leaf wrapped tamale (mushy and not flavorful), a gordita each (lacking in flavor and the gordita shell didn't seem particularly fresh), a beef empanada (probably the best thing I tried, I'd probably go with the chicken next time since the beef was a little too sweet), and two carne asada tacos (pretty good, but my fella felt they lacked in flavor too). 

All in all, not a particularly successful food adventure. I hope they are able to improve on some of their recipes as I think they have potential with their rather unique menu.
