the restaurant we really wanted to try was closed on a Monday so we went to Aunt Chilada's.  It was 2nd time I'd been there in 3 years;  I forgot I was there a few years ago.  Food is FAIR to average (at best) for mexican.  Nice outdoor area.  Will not likely return, there are plenty of places that are MUCH better for Mexican food.
