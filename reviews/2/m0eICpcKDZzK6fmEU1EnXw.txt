I went here for lunch with a few co-workers.  I actually liked the food.  Growing up in San Antonio, I prefer this kind of mexican food: no color only shades of brown, heavy on the cheese, heavy on the salsa.  Wow, now that I write that, I doesnt sound so great... but really, that's what I like.  And that's more or less what I got at Tee Pee's.  So food-wise, it's probably a THREE STAR.

But there were some real drawbacks.

The chips were slightly stale.  It should be a small thing, but you'd think a "landmark" restaurant could handle keeping fresh chips.

The decor is dated and cramped.  The old vinyl seats are ugly, but more importantly, they are uncomfortable and very small.  Two adults sitting side-by-side had better be very friendly.

Finally, the service is horrible.  And to me, that is easily the biggest problem.  The waitress constantly left our drinks empty and had to be reminded every time we asked for anything.

In reality, Tee Pee's should be right up my alley.  But their "we're too busy to worry about the small things" is a big problem.  

I'm not sure they will ever get a second chance with me.
