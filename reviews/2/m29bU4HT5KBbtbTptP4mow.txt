Maybe I'm jaded after living in Phoenix for several years, but I was expecting more. This a place you eat at because you have time to kill before a flight, you are hungry, and you want something other than Wendy's. The beans suck, the rice is bland, and the tacos are overpriced. If you are in Phoenix on a layover, please don't judge the quality of Mexican food in the city from what they serve here. It's a shame too cause the staff here is pretty good. 1 star food, 1 star prices, 4 star staff.
