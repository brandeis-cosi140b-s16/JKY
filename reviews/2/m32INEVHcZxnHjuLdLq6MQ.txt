Visited twice. Not a big fan of Ketzal on either visit. Small portions, mediocre quality. Not impressed with the salsas which are more like salad dressings. They got me into the restaurant for a second visit with a coupon, then refused to honor the coupon. There is much better authentic Mexican in town. I'd prefer a Rubio's before Ketzal.
