Friendly staff- good service, but over all quality was lacking. Taco was greasy, green chili burrito was bland and almost dry.  The margaritas were watered down and didn't have much flavor. Started with the prickly pear and went to the jalape√±o for hopefully more flavor and or kick- sadly they tasted the same.  Maybe it was an off night, but doubtful we will back.... the trip up to anthem for quality Mexican may be worth the extra miles and time.
