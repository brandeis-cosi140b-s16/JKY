Why do I even bother anymore. It is so expensive for what you get. 20 dollars for two bowls that weren't even full. Less than 5 ounces of rice maybe 3 ounces meat and the bowl that it comes in is barely half full. You don't even get drinks with the cost of the meal. Not worth the cost for food that is sitting in a hot well.
