Las Vegas, why you no have good taco shops? 

Look I get it, "craft tacos" are super cool right now, but every now and then I want a taco made with love, lard, and a possible an old family recipe. So far, I have yet to come across this in the Valley. I had high hopes Tacos Los Toritos especially after seeing their four star rating, but alas it was just flavorless tacos, refried beans from a can, and overcooked rice. This meal could have a been a "Taco Tuesday", lunch special at the local junior high cafeteria. 

I ordered the taco & burrito meal, with carnitas. The taco was ok, made street style with two small corn tortillas, seared onions, and carnitas. The tortilla was not house made, but it did hold together while I ate my taco. The carnitas were juicy, but lacked flavor and crunch. To my understanding carnitas are cooked until tender then seared in a hot pan to get them a little crispy. I know this sounds picky, but most taco shops get this right, but unfortunately this was not the case at Tacos Los Toritos. 

The burrito was more of the same, flavorless meat and canned beans, more beans than meat by the way. The was size ok, but does that matter if the taste doesn't match the size? I did however like their green verde salsa, this was very good and I drenched most of my food in this green mixture of tamatillos, chilis and spices. 

Sad to say I will not be coming back to Tacos Los Toritos. My search for a quality taco shop in Vegas continues!
