Worst service I had the entire time in Vegas.  I went here on St. Paddy's Day night because they had some bagpipers going upstairs.  We got there just as they were finishing a set, and the band was complaining about the lack of people watching them.  Well, there would have been more people had they perhaps let people sit.  We tried sitting a few times and were immediately accosted by security to move.  "These are reserved."  And yet, no signs on them, and no people.  So we eventually had to sit up at the counter that runs along the sides.  

It was at that point that everything went to hell.  The waitress came up to three different groups, two of which got there after us, and kept skipping our part.  After that, I gave up, and we moved on to another place.  This took about 30 mins altogether -- worst service I have had in years.
