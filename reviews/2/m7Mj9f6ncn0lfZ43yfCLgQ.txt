To even admit to serving tex-mex is the first clue about how bad the food is there.  And whoever that nit wit was that said Arizona has bad Mexican obviously knows nothing about Good Mex food.  Ill admit right from the start that I don't want authentic Mex. food.  Go on down to Nogales and get some authentic Mex. food Ha!  What I want is authentic valley of the sun sonoran style Mex. food the way its evolved for a hundred years from the early Mexican Legal Immigrants.  Ihave been all over the USA and true you can get some decent mex food in cal, new mex., west texas.  But to get the best Beans, enchiladas, red, green, chile, tamales tortillas you have to get it right here in AZ.  Here are a few great places.  Don Joses, Matador, Carolinas. Manuels, Some Burro, Juans, Ajo Als, Macayos.  The two best are Ricardos and Papagayos, oops,  They closed because the new management wrecked the food and drove away the faithful.  And thats THE TRUTH, from "The Truth" Ciau!
