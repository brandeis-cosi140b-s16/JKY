Everyone in AZ has been to Filiberto's, and if you've expanded your horizons you'll realize it's nothing special. 

But who cares? This is Sun Devil turf. You're drunk, and there's a pretty cool crowd of fellow youngsters looking to scarf down some cheap food and pass out. Socialize while you wait a half hour for your order. When you feel like crap in the morning, just chalk it up to the four loko and forget about indulging in this embarrassment to Mexican food.

Two stars because those poor guys work so hard. Not that this review matters--they'll get plenty of business.
