I used to love this place. We ate here twice a week... The last two times we went, it was horrible. My jade red quesadilla had less than four piece of chicken in it, my machaca quesadilla was missing cheese, and our fried rice consisted of chunks of white rice smothered in soy sauce... Not just a lot... It was soup like! We were so dissapointed, and since it was takeout, we could not get it replaced easily (are were at home already).

Used to be five stars to us... now just a huge let down.
