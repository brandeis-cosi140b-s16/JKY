I stopped in for a quick lunch time snack of guacamole and chips today. The first bit of bad news is their driveway; huge pot holes right where the entrance meets the sidewalk at University Avenue. I mean, break an axle huge.

The restaurant interior is oddly laid out, with huge communal tables and very few places for individuals or smaller parties to sit. The music is loud, and everything has that vaguely sticky patina of a beachside popsicle stand, including the riotous color scheme.

They did prepare my order quickly, and the service was friendly. Too bad the food was utterly disappointing. The tortilla chips had the distinctly off flavor of rancid cooking oil, and the guacamole was thick and gluey in texture and unremarkable in flavor. I got up and left after a few bites.
