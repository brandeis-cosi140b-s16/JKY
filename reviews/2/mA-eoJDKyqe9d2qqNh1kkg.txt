I just don't get it.  Every time I'm at Dutch Bros this place looks busy. I finally tried it for lunch. Well 20 minutes later just getting through the drive through to pay. (3 total cars in line including me) Maybe this is why they look busy. Everyone is waiting.

I get the pork taco meal. What a waste of time and money.  One small taco, good garnish but the meat was over cooked and pithy. The rice is so-so. The drink is tiny. The only saving grace and why I give two stars was the salsa and chips. Good salsa.  

Maybe got there on a 'slow' day but for what you get not worth the money.  Unless you have 15 extra minutes to just pick up chips and salsa.
