Beautiful view and okay service, though one of our meals was prepared incorrectly and had to be re-made. A unique presentation of generously portioned food, that all looked like delicious, Tex-Mex. 

While it was not awful, it wasn't good either. 3 out of 3 people eating got sick, to varying degrees. I don't think the food was "bad", more likely some lower quality ingredients. If you eat a clean diet, and tend to get sick when you eat junk, I'd suggest going elsewhere. Chips were greasy, all three salsa choices were bland. Chips and salsa was $8 and we didn't eat it. Nobody asked if it was okay, and we assumed they were complimentary, as most places in the US. In fact, most of the food was not eaten, it just wasn't very good flavor and WAY too much grease. My plate was piled high and sitting in a puddle of grease extending to the edge of the plate. So much so, that when it was served, some grease spilled over the side of the giant plate.  

Lunch for 3 was $50 plus gratuity. That's a little much for low quality Mexican food in Scottsdale! I wouldn't eat here again, not even if it was free. It wasn't so awful that it only deserved one star. The view is amazing! Maybe some friends and beer on the patio would enjoy socializing. I realize some people like greasy food loaded up in giant portions. If that's your forte, go for it, just keep expectations low.
