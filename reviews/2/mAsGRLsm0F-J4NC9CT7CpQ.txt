I like to consider myself kind of a big deal in the taco community.  Well if big deal status is conferred on those who spend half of their disposable income on a particular product.  Having established my credentials as such, I have to say I was highly disappointed by Los Tacos.  

The visit started so well.  The staff was friendly and I love being able to see them make the food right in front of you.  From there it started to slide.
I saw on the board they had tacos, burritos etc...standard taco shop fare.  Then next to it they have their different type of meats.  I saw tacos were $3.00 so I assumed that covered any type of meat so I ordered two with a soda.  The gal asked if I wanted everything on them and I said sure and then she said that'll be $11.64.  I did a double take on a scale that hasnt been seen since Cousin Larry on the 1980's show "Perfect Strangers."  I asked how it could be that much if tacos were $3.00 and she replied if you get them with everything it becomes close to $5.00.  I downgraded my order to one thinking this must be a pretty big taco for $5.00.  

Well the taco came and needless to say I haven't been this disappointed in size since Pam Anderson had her latest surgery.  I couldnt believe the size to cost, and the additional surcharge for the privilege of guacamole, sour cream and cheese.  The overall taco (I got the al pastor marinated pork) tasted just ok, but certainly it was nothing to write home about.  

There is so much taco greatness in the world, it'll be hard to get me to come back here.  I mean I will eventually because I always feel a place is worth a second shot and it wasnt terrible, just disappointing (isn't that what my dad said to me when he was made at me as a kid?).

Back onto my business class seat on the taco train....
