Not that great but just ok. The spiccy beef burro was good....thought the beef taste different from other beef o eat....maybe it is donkey meat. Not a bad environment and friendly staff. 
Them my tummy hurt bad after ten minutes of eating....maybe it was food i aye earlier or maybe not. So if it taste funny...then throw it away.
