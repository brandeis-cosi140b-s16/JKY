Service is the worst ever our server acted like she hated her job and everyone in the restaurant. Which there were exactly 10 of us. The soda was flat the chips were fried in  old oil, and the guacamole was a joke. It was supposed to be made table side miss attitude came out with her tray all ready mashed up avocados and a bunch of cups she asked us if we wanted everything and I said yes she dumped it all in and handed it to us un-mixed. I proceeded to mix it up and all we could taste was lime it was so sorry we couldn't stand it. I immediately told the waitress that the guacamole was too sour and she took it back gave a huge attitude. We waited for another 10 minutes and finally they brought out our food but still no replacement guacamole. After she served us the food she said I will be right back with your guacamole, she didn't brought out another tray with the same ingredients as before dump them all in the bowl except for this time we didn't get any time at all. Needless to say it also was poorly mixed! I got a taco salad with a side of Spanish rice and my friend got the two tacos dinner special, these were just ok entrees not the best Mexican food I've ever had. I will not be returning to this restaurant and I will not be recommending it to any of my friends and family and fact I would recommend they go Somewhere else altogether.
