lunch here was ... interesting. our server made it clear we were his only table at 11:30 am on thursday. we remained his only table throughout our meal, which was probably better for the restaurant. he was creepy, in a dimitri the lover kind of way (the wacko from toronto ... if you haven't heard of him, google is your friend.). 

the free chips and salsa were great. the chips tasted like they were made fresh and the salsa was unique with a bit of spicy and a hint of apricot. my enchiladas were awesome. they weren't rolled, it was more like an enchilada casserole, and boy oh boy were they an ooey, gooey, cheesy delight. the rice, on the other hand, was a disappointment. it looked beautiful but was flavorless. 

overall, the portions seemed a bit small, especially for mexican food, and the prices were outrageous. my lunch at barrio cost $18 ... $3 for a soda (i'll remember that if there's a next time!), $12 for the enchiladas and $3 for the tip. not that the creepy dimitri-wannabe really deserved one. after he took our order he disappeared. the hostess delivered our food and brought drink refills. we didn't see him again until i asked him for our check as he was cutting fruit 3 feet from our table while my drink sat empty in plain sight. at $3 for a soda, you better be refilling that glass every time it is even close to empty! 

2 stars might be a bit harsh - i've been flip-flopping between 2 and 3 the entire time i've been writing, but 2 feels right to me. there was no value proposition, service was not attentive and the rice sucked. i think this place really could be great, but they've completely missed the boat. i won't go back willingly.
