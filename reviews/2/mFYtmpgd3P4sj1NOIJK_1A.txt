We had a Restaurant.com gift certificate, so we went out to see if they were any good.

We visited just before Christmas...so I can't recall specifics. However, the food was decent. Nothing spectacular, but wasn't bad either. The real turnoff here was the service. Slow. Really slow...and this was on a night that had about 6 tables seated. 

What really stuck in my mind was the 10 minutes and two requests it took to get my credit card back from the waiter when I paid. The last request he looked at me like "whaddya want?" 

We will not be back.
