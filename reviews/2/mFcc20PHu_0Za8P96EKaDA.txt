You can tell when there is a Manager on duty that's for sure!!  I usually get fish (which the last 2 times came cool), and greasy ! Had to send it back.....In the meanwhile the bean burrito which usually has onions (had none) and inside was cool temp also, had to send it back!!  In the meanwhile my husband almost was finished with his meal.  They didn't seem to upset with all the mistakes.........OH Did I mention it was a Friday, probably 10 workers in the back (talking), the place was NOT busy and it was 5:30PM..Prime time for dinner.

NO EXCUSE FOR THE BAD FOOD, AND BAD SERVICE!!!!
