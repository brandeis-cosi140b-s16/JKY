Location - Norscow - Check.  Layout -Bar, tables, patio, creek, etc - Check.  Clientele with plenty of liquid funding - Check.

So the structure is in place for something great.

Problem is that they appear to be striving for average.  The drinks, the food, the cleanliness, the wait staff.  Hit or miss at best.

Not gonna lie, had a good a time here with a friend, but we tend to make the most of any situation.  Easton Ashe is a quality Phoenix cover unit that made for a fun evening, but even they seemed to have a sense of the mediocrity syndrome going around the place.

I am guessing this is a management issue.  Time to step back and take a look at how you improve the total experience for the customer.

Hopeful to update soon with a better rating.
