If you are looking for real Mexican food don't waste your money here . Roberto's has more authentic and tastier food. Burritos are 75% beans 25%  meat and bland. Spend your money at Casa Don Juan in the downtown area instead. That's probably the best Mexican food that this SoCali girl has found in LV... Cabo at Red Rock is better too...overall Super Mex was Super Disappointing


PS - be prepared to have them take your smartphone to the bar cashier to redeem your groupon... Super Disturbing to have someone take my open phone out of my sight :-/
