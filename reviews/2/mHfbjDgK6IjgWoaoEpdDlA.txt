I Really! Wanted to like this place, seeing all the 5 stars, I was sure I was going to enjoy this eatery, alas it was not to be. I ordered the Arepa, Veggie Empanada, Elote Loco, Burrito, Yuca Fries and Drinks, of course. The Arepa was stuffed with chicken, cheese, and some ketchup tasting like sauce. The smell of the chicken just bothered me, idk might be the cheese/sauce combo, did not eat. The veggie empanada was, well I would not order again, the shell was tasty but the same weird cheese, saturated in cheese and bits of veggies, too greasy for my taste. Now the Burrito was ok...ish, too Salty, low quality in my opinion, 100% of all of us there prefer Chipotle. Now comes the Elote Loco, ugh, corn tasted old, dressed up with tons of mayo, cheese, chile to mask it, i feel. The yuca fries were, nice, pretty yummy. The drinks and yuca fries where why they got two stars if not 0. That's the way meow see's it.
