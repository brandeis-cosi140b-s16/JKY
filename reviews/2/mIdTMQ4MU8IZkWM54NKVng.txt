Stopped into Robertos for the first time the other week after a binge study session at the Starbucks next door. I have heard mixed reviews about the franchise and decided to just find out for myself. 

I wasn't feeling too adventurous so I just got an order of carne asada fries to go and ate them outside and enjoyed the weather while people watching. The carne asade was a little too salty for my tastes and the fixings with the fries were alright. I think the saltiness of the meat threw it off for me. Way too salty. 

The portions were great though. It was huge and I had enough for a whole other meal the next day. Granted it wasn't as good the next day since the fries were a tad soggy but hey a meal is a meal sometimes. 

Honestly, I'm not sure if I would come back to any of the chain locations. Maybe out of convenience if I'm ever near one and I'm craving some Mexican food. 

There is also an ample amount of parking at this location so that's always nice too!
