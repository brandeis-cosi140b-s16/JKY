This was one of those places that I wanted to like, just for the mere fact that they are sort of a cornerstone of the downtown Glendale scene. I wanted to like this place so much that I didn't write this review based on one visit, nor two, but three strikes you're out!

There isn't much that Bitzee Mama's does well. In fact the only redeeming trait might be the salsa (but even that isn't enough to bring me back of my own fruition). The service is "OMG - I CAN FEEL MY HAIR GROWING" slow. The food is nothing memorable - if you even get what you order (once I ordered a cheesesteak and I just got the cheese - I kid you not, no meat). The prices are actually high for what you get - and check your bill because once I was charged $47.38 for a soda and sammie which I actually had to argue about with the manager (I was pretty sure I could take her, but dang that's just not right).

Mama's may have been a staple in the past, but her age is showing and she desperately needs a calgon moment!
