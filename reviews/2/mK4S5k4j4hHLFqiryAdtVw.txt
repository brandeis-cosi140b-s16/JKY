Walking in you'll see great and beautiful decor! Everything is really nice from all 4 corners of the building. But the food wasn't that great. It wasn't anything different from any mexican stop i've been at except one thing. We ordered the beef steak special & carne asada fries. The beef was EXTREMELY dry, chewy, and hard. We couldn't even cut it into small pieces so we had to ask the cook to chop it for us. The carne asada was okay, its a smaller portion than what I usually get from other mexican restaurants but it could do. Its quiet in there too, no TV going on (even though theres 2 on the wall), and no radio. So if you're going to go here, go here when you're hungry and do not care what you're going to eat, good luck!!
