Tequila must make the experience a lot better.....  Not sure where the 5 star reviewers have eaten their tacos, but JJTT's food has a long walk to authenticity and quality.  Regardless of the underwhelming impression that the food will make, the staff is friendly and nice.  The folks who were drinking definitely appeared to be enjoying themselves.
