We drove to Matthews Station looking for a place to have lunch outdoors. I liked the terrace, the garage doors raised etc and we decided to give this joint a try. 

I NEVER drink at lunch but since my companion wanted a Margarita I too had one. The plain Margarita was very good (not sweet or weird) strong and cheap. Then I had a second one (siesta time!) Considering that it was already about 2:30 pm and the food took forever to arrive the salsa came in very handy. The special of the the day was ceviche tostada and we also ordered another tostada with pollo, puree of refried beans and guacamole - forgot the name. Forget the food, in fact.  It's not even worth mentioning it. In the future we may stop by for a drink, then walk down the street for dinner.

That's all folks
