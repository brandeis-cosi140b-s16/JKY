When this place first opened up it was awesome.  Generous servings is what I've come to expect at any Chipotle b'c, well, I've visited many from the east coast to the west and several in between.  

This place is stingy man.  It wasn't before but now it is.  The people that work behind the counter are rude.  One day we went there and I seriously had to ask for "extra" of everything or else my bowl would've looked ... empty.  The lady who took my order was not very nice about it at all, like she was doing me a favor gracing us with her presence.  

The cheese quesadilla I used to get my daughter was filled with delicious mozzarella cheese.  Lately, unless I ask for extra cheese, the quesadilla comes out hard, crunchy and barely any cheese on it.

I think in general we just get crappy service in Buckeye but b'c I once knew this location as an awesome place to eat, it's extra disappointing that the service has fallen through the cracks.  The food is no longer consistently good.  And paying for increased prices but less food is just plain disappointing.  I won't not come here b'c it's still a "healthier" alternative than other fast foods but I'm not happy coming here either.
