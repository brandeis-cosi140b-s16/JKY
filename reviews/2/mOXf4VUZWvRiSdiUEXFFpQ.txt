Subpar food that costs way too much. The guacamole is bland, and the tacos were way too spicy, probably to compensate for the lack of flavor. It's more trendy than the other local Mexican spots, but for what you're paying you would get way more food elsewhere. I suggest el toro. 

The margaritas were good, so I would go there again for a happy hour.
