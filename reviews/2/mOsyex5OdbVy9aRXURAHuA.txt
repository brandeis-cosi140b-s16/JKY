Although the menu was a nice change from the average Mexican restaurant, the food was all greasy to the point it was inedible. Chips? Ridiculously greasy. Steak taco...the steak was grisly and greasy. Chorizo was greasy and bland. I had such high hopes for this place. In the future I'll stick with Maize.
