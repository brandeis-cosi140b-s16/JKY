I've never been a big fan of Caf√© Rio, but given it's convenient location and online ordering, we decided to pick some up for a quick dinner last week. 

We placed our order and left to pick it up in the time scheduled. We arrived at the restaurant and the food wasn't ready yet. We weren't in a huge hurry, but they seem a little disorganized at this location. It took several people to handle our checkout and when they said my mom's bowl wasn't ready because the chicken was still cooking and would take another 15 minutes, they offered us a different protein. Since we didn't want the rest of the food to be sitting out while we waited for the grilled chicken she changed to shredded chicken. It was only after we decided that did we realize they hadn't even made the rest of the food yet, so there was really no need to change the order. 

The food was ok, but I don't see myself going out of my way to return to this location with better non-chain restaurants in the area I'd rather give my money to.
