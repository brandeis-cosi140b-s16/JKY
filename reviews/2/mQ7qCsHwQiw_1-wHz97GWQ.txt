I have been to Ocho a few times. There food is fine, nothing extraordinary. Their salsa is ok, but doesn't taste fresh. Their prices are good if you do the lunch specials, but their regular prices are crazy for the quality or lack there of. A single taco, nothing else (beans or rice) is $5.95. For the taste of the tacos, I would think $4 is pushing it. Without something added to the tacos, they are bland, so you must use the salsa to help the taste. Their beans are fairly tasteless so if you are looking for a protein fix without much flavor, beans are the way to go.
