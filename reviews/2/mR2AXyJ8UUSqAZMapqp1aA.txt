Online order was not ready. Hell, it didn't even get started til I walked in and asked for it. 

I asked for sour cream on the side but it was blopped in the bowl.  When the cashier asked the guy who made it if the sour cream was on the side like the order asked, he simply answered, "uh, I guess we'll find out". SERIOUSLY!?!? Fantastic service.
