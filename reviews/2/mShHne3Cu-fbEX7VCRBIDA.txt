I am not a huge fan of Cantina 1511.  I lived right down the street from the Stonecrest location for years and whenever I went, I was underwhelmed with the food for what it costs.  But my girlfriend had a gift certificate (YAY) and we were going to see a movie at Park Terrace next door (YAY), so onward. 

Arriving at 12:30 over the Christmas holiday, the hostesses were very friendly and I was seated immediately.  Soon after my ears started to bleed (not really, I am being a drama queen) because it is nerve-deafeningly loud in there.  To their credit, it was a full house during peak lunchtime, but good dog.  We had to scream across the table to be heard.

The waiter was efficient, especially considering how busy they were.   He kept the glasses of two very thirsty girls filled.  Though I love queso, I refuse to pay $10 for it, so we went cheese-less.  The complimentary chips and salsa were fresh and good. My order of a beef chimichanga ($13.75) was fine.  *shrug  For $14 you get a very large chimichanga with a pile of lettuce/pico.  There may have been 8 small pieces of steak in it.  Meh.

Good wait staff.  And for me, passable food but nothing that I crave or would look forward to.
