I think if you grew up in north Phoenix you automatically love this place - like Peter Piper Pizza. Now that I am a grown up and have found all the amazing Mexican restaurants in town, i think this place is garbage. The shrimp tacos were awful. The only reason I give it a 2 star is because the girl that waited on us was fantastic and sometimes that makes the experience.
