Yes, its a step above fast food, but you pay for what you get. A few months ago I had one of their dinner plates and a drink, maybe an extra taco, and it was 11-something! For a few bucks more I coulda' gone to a sit-down joint and had REAL Mexican food! The food is pretty fresh and all that, but its rather bland and boring. I do like the salsa bar, load your own and take it to go thingy. They also have nice take out cups!
