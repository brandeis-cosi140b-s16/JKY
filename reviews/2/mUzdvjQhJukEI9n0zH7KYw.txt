I stopped in around noon with my girlfriend to get a gift certificate for a close friend Birthday party later that evening. They were pretty busy and I got a croissant pastry while we were in line. When it was our turn we asked for a $25 gift certificate. The gentleman informed us that they were out and would have some available later that evening. He assured us at 6:30 they will have some. The party was at 7 so we stopped on the way at 6:30 and a young Lady says they don't have any. She didn't seem to care that we were promised this earlier in the day and was very rude in saying, Their is nothing I can do. We asked could they put in writing some sort of card that says we have a gift certificate. We informed her that we were on the way to a party and were promised a gift cert earlier. I just think in this day and age small businesses should not operate like this. People have many choices in Madison and I feel this was very very unprofessional and inconsiderate. My family and I will not recommend or do any business with this place again unless they make it right for what they did.
