This used to be my go to Mexican restaurant it was delicious great margaritas amazing atmosphere sure the acoustics on the inside weren't that great but the food was always great as was the service. But boy has there been a slide first off the food it's just not good anymore the margaritas are great and so are the chips but it's no longer worth the trip from Waxhaw! Such a shame!
