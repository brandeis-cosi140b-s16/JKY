Terrible terrible terrible service. We had a reservation and still waited 40 minutes. We waited 45 minutes for our food and 30 minutes for our bill. The food is okay but overpriced for the quality. The only reason it isn't a 1-star review is the restaurant itself is beautiful; however, I would never return.
