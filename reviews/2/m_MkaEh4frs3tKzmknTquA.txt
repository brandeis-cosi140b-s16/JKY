Six months ago i would have given this place 5 stars. I don't know if they changed managers or what. I used to eat here at least once a week and get the chicken meal combo, breast and wing with 2 side salads to keep it healthy. I haven't been in at least 6 weeks, so i was looking forward to it today. 
However, i forgot to double check the order and when i got back to my office I found they gave me a leg and thigh. I only eat breast meat. Not only was it super greasy, but there was hardly any meet on either piece. The tortillas were so hard and chewy. I suspect they were microwaved too long. Today's order was really disappointing.

This is the 3 rd time in the last few months they got my order wrong, which is why i stopped going so often. 

Be sure to check your order before pulling away.
