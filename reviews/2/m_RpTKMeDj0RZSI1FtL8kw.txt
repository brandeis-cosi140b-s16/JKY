The place was empty and the service was still really slow. I ordered the guacamole appetizer, but I didn't get it until my Naked Fajita came out. The guac was really wet for some reason, but the fajita was ok. About as generic as a fajita can get. Nothing spectacular. I read on another review that the margaritas were great, but I wasn't impressed. Definitely used bottled sour mix, NOT the fresh juice I read about. My friends swear by this place, but I probably won't go back.
