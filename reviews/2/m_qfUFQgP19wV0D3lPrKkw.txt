The Del Taco chain is like a slightly nicer Taco Bell with better selection, and potentially more "real" meat in their meals. I typically don't have any interest in this place unless I'm craving nachos or a crunchy taco.

But the other night, I had zero interest in cooking and a killer fish taco craving. So I picked one up, added on a veggie burrito, and they gave me an extra bacon quesadilla that was a duplicate from a previous order. I wouldn't order that, even if it's priced at 50 cents- it's literally a tortilla folded over some bacon bits with some cheese. No thanks.

Beer battered fish taco is exactly what I like, wouldn't order the veggie burrito again though- cheap though it was. They seem to have recently added a cali asada burrito that I may need to try in the near future- somehow I doubt it'll measure up to the cali burritos I got in the bay area, though.
