My mistake!!! I thought it was a good idea to swing by this Filiberto's and grab some Super Nachos.... something quick and easy! The whole visit wasn't quick or easy and the food was meh..... after having to wait 20 minutes in the drive through I was HANGRY!!! Who has to wait 20 minutes in a drive through for food, the point of a drive through is to get your food quick and easy! This Filiberto's definitely doesn't believe in quick.

After becoming quite hangry I finally got my food and drove all the way home. When I got home, my food was cold! Are you kidding me!? We live in AZ no way on my drive home did my food get cold, it was already cold when they gave it to me. The meat was very dry and tasteless! Needless to say I ended up wasting 20 minutes of my time getting my food and ended up throwing it away and cooking something at home! Lets get it together Filibertos!!
