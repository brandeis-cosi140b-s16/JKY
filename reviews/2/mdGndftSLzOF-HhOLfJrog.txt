After waiting 15 minutes to be greeted by a server I thought I would suck it up and be patient. However, it got worse! The soup we ordered had a layer of grease on the top and the margaritas were watered down with cheap sour mix. Furthermore, the food came out at different times leaving the kids without their cold quesadillas. The server was far from apologetic and I was sorry we came. I always look for a positive though-the salsa was delicious. However, it is safe to say I think I will stick to my other favorite Mexican spots next time.
