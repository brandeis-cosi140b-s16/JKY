Coming from Texas, I am extremely familiar with great mexican cuisine. Tex-mex has been a longtime favorite since the day I first had unlimited red and green sauce. That being said, my expectations may have been too high coming here. 

- The atmosphere was great. The decor made the place really come alive (very similar to many restaurants in Charlotte). You feel like you are in Mexico.

- Sauce is solid, honestly nothing to rave about but it gets the job done.

- The entree's are just really bland. 
1) My cousins enchiladas came out cold
2) My enchiladas were just bland
3) Nobody on our table (10+ people) came close to eating their food because it just lacked flavor. 

Honestly, I wouldn't come back here unless someone really wanted to go here and I had no choice. The positive is the staff is friendly and the place is nice.
