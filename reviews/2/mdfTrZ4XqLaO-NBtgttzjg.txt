Wow. Gus beat me to it. No, really. He wrote a review like 15 minutes before I'm writing mine with the EXACT same complaint in mind. For the crowd it gets and the advertisements I've heard and seen, i was expecting this place to impress. My friend really wanted to try and that is the only reason why I did. I will give it to them. Their salsa is pretty fantastic... but that's about it. Tex-mex should never have refried beans. I mean I'm of spanish background, and I take offense to the concept of refried beans. So gross. I got their chicken nachos and got exactly what Chili serves for chicken nachos. It's the whole individualized big nacho thing rather than layers. I've tried different mexican places in charlotte, and Cantina 1511 is by far the best I've had...true to Tex-Mex.

My leftovers from Chuy's are still in the fridge..
