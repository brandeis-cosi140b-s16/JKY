I'm a huge fan of Roberto's, but over the years, this location has consistently been the worst one in the area. In 9 years of Roberto's, this is the only one that's given me food poisoning (chicken chimichanga). The quality is also generally lousy which is weird since every other one pretty much tastes exactly the same - kind of the point of a chain. 

You may wonder why I'd go back to a place that I know sucks. What can I say, I'm a typical lazy American and a 24hr drive thru is a powerful draw. 

Got beef nachos and the shredded beef had a dog food like consistency. So yes it's convenient, but you've been warned. There's a billion other Roberto's so I'd suggest avoiding this one unless you're feeling super lazy.
