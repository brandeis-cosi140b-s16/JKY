Not very good.  Three of us ate here at dinner time. It was fast and inexpensive, but not very good.  I had a chicken taco plate and it was ok but made my stomach hurt later. The two with me both ordered cheese enchiladas and both were unhappy. They both complained that the enchiladas were cold in the middle. Not acceptable. Also, the salsa was right out of the fridge so it made the food even colder. I'm guessing that breakfast burrito everyone raves about must be the only really good thing on the menu. I'll never know. We won't be going back. I've decided I don't like eating my mexican food on styrofoam plates so will steer clear of these mediocre taco shops.
