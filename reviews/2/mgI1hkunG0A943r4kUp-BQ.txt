Came to this location tonight 30 minutes before close and the doors were locked. I called to ask if they had closed early and said they must have locked the doors to early. I ordered a burrito like usual and sat to wait. 10 minutes went by before the manager came to me and asked if I wanted tacos instead because she had already put the beans and rice away... If I wanted tacos I would have asked for them and if burritos weren't available then don't waste my time and allow me to buy them. If the business is to close the doors at 9:30 then maybe the business should be fully operational till 9:30. Going to give rubios a break for a while.
