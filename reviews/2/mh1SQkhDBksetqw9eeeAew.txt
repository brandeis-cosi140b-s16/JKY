I stopped by the restaurant inside Planet Hollywood.  Sat at the bar and was ignored for at least 20 minutes and I was starving!!!  Left and found another by MGM,  I was so hungry for Mexican food I decided to stop in hoping my experience would be better.  Wait staff there Ok, food MEDIOCRE!!  I'd never go back, it was a waste of $$$$  DONT DO IT!!!!!!
