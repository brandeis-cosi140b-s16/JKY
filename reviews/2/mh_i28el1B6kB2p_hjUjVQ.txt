Patrons that go to this dive are Loco! I had expectations that night time hangouts in Ahwatukee would have at least a minimal amount of quality due to its yuppie reputation. I was so wrong on the expectations!

I didn't go to LP for the food, which was lucky because nothing I saw on tables looked the least bit appetizing. This place would fail a health inspection because it's filthy!

I went there to listen to a live band, and to drink and dance. That was a bad idea, although the band that played there was respectable. 

The dance floor is pitiful. It's a dinky old cement floor that probably hasn't had a coat of paint for 10 years. It only shines because of the dried beer and stale grease that covers the dance floor and most of the rest of the areas. I assume people come here to watch ESPN and get drunk because it would be miserable to attempt to dance there.

The live bands get to play on an OK elevated stage that has a wood floor. The positioning of the stage would suggest that music and dance was an afterthought. Why couldn't they have used to the wood on the stage to build a floor that people could dance on? Duh!!!

Apparently people in the city of Ahwatukee have very low standards because this dive seems to get plenty of business.
