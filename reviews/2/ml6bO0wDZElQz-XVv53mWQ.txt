Just not really impressed by this place... I like tacos like all other red blooded Arizonians BUT eh... I've had better. This was nothing more than another Mexican-American Fast food place Also I was surprised this was pretty pricey in my opinion especially since you can get the same thing at any of the million "___bertos" drive thru taco joints and cheaper (Filbertos,Humbertos,Losbertos, etc.) ... ;-( Sorry Senor, I won't be back.
