How is it possible to screw up a cheese enchilada?

I have only eaten here twice in 3 years and yet this place has no idea how to cook a cheese enchilada. Hint: the cheese inside should be melted completely! not cold and still shredded.

Tacos are ok, but really 4 and 5 stars? nope.

This area of town could use a real Mexican restaurant. There is no good Mexican food for miles around.
