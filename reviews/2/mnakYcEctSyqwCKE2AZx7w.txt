I'm sad to say that Super Burrito "fell off".  I've ordered twice here in the past few months and the food has not been good.  The burrito (Potato, Egg & Cheese) I'd been ordering for years was extremely greasy and undercooked.  Another time I ordered take out with my friend and the enchiladas were dry, lacked seasoning and the cheese wasn't even melted.  I felt so bad, I cooked up something for her at home.  I'm not sure if there is a new chef, but I am terribly disappointed in the recent changes.
