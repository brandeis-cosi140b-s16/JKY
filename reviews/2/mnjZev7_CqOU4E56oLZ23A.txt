I feel like two stars is generous but one star is because my friend and I still had a good time and the other star is because we got the Cadillac Nachos for free with the Miracle Mile coupon book. This place was cute and fun but the food was terrible and the service was slow and nonexistent. Our food was cold, my friend got the wrong drink, and her order was messed up three times (even after sending it back). We won't be coming back here.
