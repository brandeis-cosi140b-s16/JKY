This place opened on 8/2/11. Ketzal Mexican used to be here, but Plaza Bonita took over after Ketzal failed. This place is slightly better than Ketzal. The staff is very friendly, but the food was average to below average. Chips were boring. Salsa boring. Beans, cheese, and beef dip was weird but ok. The Macho Burrito wasn't very "macho" and wasn't very good either. My wife thought it was ok, but I thought it was below average. I'd give it a 1 out of 5. She'd give it a 3 out of 5. Either way, not great and this place won't get very good reviews in the future.
