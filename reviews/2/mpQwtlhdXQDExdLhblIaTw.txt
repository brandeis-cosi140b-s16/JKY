My husband made reservations but since the place was empty they weren't needed.. The atmosphere was nice, sitting outside by the Mystic Falls and the wait staff was nice.
 We started with a margaritas. I had a regular one on the rocks and my husband a frozen strawberry..They were pretty weak. The chips and salsa were a disappointment . The chips were stale, the salsa bland and bean dip tasted canned. For an appetizer we had the potato skins. They were good but we had barely started on them when our food came.The food was warm but not hot like I would have expected.  I had the fish tacos and was expecting a fish fillet not chopped up breaded fish pieces that looked more like breaded clams. My husband ordered a taco, beef enchilada and a cheese enchilada but received 2 beef enchiladas (one ground one shredded) and a taco.. He said they were kind of bland.
As we were finishing our server brought the check. I had to ask if we could have flan. 
She was a little embarrassed and the flan was the best thing of the meal.
I don't blame the server for the food. The kitchen needs an overhaul of staff that would make sure the food comes out hot and at the right time.
