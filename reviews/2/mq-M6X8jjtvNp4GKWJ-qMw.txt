I am not sure what all the fuss is about.  Mediocre Mexican served out of a run down drive through with some concrete outdoor tables.  Eating out of Styrofoam containers with plastic forks just bugs me in general. How is it that the whole rest of the world finds a way to wash dishes and serve salsa in  squeeze bottles, but American restaurants are intent on filling up the landfill with disposable plates and little salsa cups and crap?  

I ordered the green enchiladas, and  they were way too hot for me. Others complain of bland, but the salsa verde is way hot.  The food was okay, and if you want  a quick cheap dinner, this might be the place.  And if they took a garden hose to the dining area, bought a dishwasher and some plastic plates, and scraped the peeling paint, I might even be charmed into coming back.
