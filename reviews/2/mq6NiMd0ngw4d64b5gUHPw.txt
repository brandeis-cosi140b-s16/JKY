This is probably the worst Chipotle I've ever been to. I Understand that they get busy but I've been to many locations with long lines that move quickly. This location however, is the SLOWEST one in the world. 

The line is always to the door and you can expect to wait 15-20 minutes before paying. Most of the workers are soooo slow. Each time I've been in they are always low on meat or guacamole and you have to stand there and wait minutes for it to be replaced. 

Also the parking is horrible. The "lot" is super tiny. Tonight there was no parking available and I had to park across the street at the mall and walk over. 

All in all I'm done coming here. I'd rather drive to 7th and Bell for good service and parking.
