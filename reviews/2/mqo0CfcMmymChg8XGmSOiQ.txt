I ordered enchiladas and the tortillas were really cold. My server nicely offered to bring me another plate and I thought "perfect". When I received the second plate however, the food burned my mouth. I did not enjoy my food at all! It looked like they just brought it out of the freezer and put it in the microwave. The location is super sketchy too.
