We went here for dinner tonight.  The service, while friendly, was slow. They did have a large party so that could have slowed things down some.  The food was just mediocre.  We ordered the cheese dip appetizer for $5.00.  It was just gas station canned cheese with green onion stirred in.  By looking at the bowl it came in you could tell it was warmed up in a microwave.  My husband and I each ordered the shredded beef chimichangas.  The rice tasted good, but the top of the rice was dry and crusty, like it was held in a warming oven for a good long while.  The shredded beef was tasty.  We probably wouldn't come back again, not unless we were with others who really wanted to eat there.
