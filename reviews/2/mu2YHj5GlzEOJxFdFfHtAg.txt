Stopped in at the Salsarita off of S Tryon to grab a quick bite to eat.  I haven't been in here in awhile but I remembered that they charged extra to get sauteed vegetable on my chicken nachos, which is what I usually order.  O-kay so first off it's kinda a full house. The line is long but it's moving.  First thing is first, please do not try to take my order if I'm not up there to actually see you apply it to my food.  Salsarita is like Subway and you tell them what you would like to go on you tacos/nachos/or whatever it is that you order.  So how am I suppose to tell you what I want when I'm at laest three people behind and not even up there to look at the choices.  I had to repeat myself so many times that I was starting to forget if I had actually told them to add this or that.  Then they charge for every little thing now.  It was extra for my vegetables, extra for the queso, extra for the black beans...I don't want plain nachos!
When you get up there to pay that was also a nightmare.  They started off by trying to give your food to other people, because like I said you're taking people's order who aren't even up to the glass yet so once they do get up to the right spot, their food is at the cash register...not feeling it.  I don't like my food just sitting there so strangers can breathe all over it after you keep trying to hand them the wrong thing.  Once it was my turn to pay; for me and my bf (who also got a chicken nacho) and one soda, we were looking at a little over $20.00 dollars!  WTH
I paid took my food to a table and then noticed that one of the servers, the one who kept asking me if I wanted "Queso?" and me telling her that she has already put some on mine, had litterally drenched the chips with queso cheese so they were soggy...not one dry chip anywhere.

Needless to say it will be awhile before I come back here...IF I ever do.  I can make better nachos at home n e way :(
