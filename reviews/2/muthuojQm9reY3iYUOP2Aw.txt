First time visiting this restaurant, and heard about it from the groupon deal. As a recent transplant to AZ, most mexican restaurant food is always amazing compared to the east coast. However, this restaurant fell short of our expectations of good Mexican food.

My husband ordered the highly recommended Pollo Fundido. The chicken was extremely chewy and the cheese looked like a processed slice of cheese was melted on top of it. I ordered the vege and chicken tacos which were good, but nothing out of the ordinary.

The margaritas were very sweet and barely had any alcohol, they were definitely overpriced. I've never left a restaurant without finishing a drink, and tonight I barely drank 1/4 of it. Waste of money if you ask me.

I wouldn't recommend this place. The atmosphere is great and it has so much potential, but the food is terrible. Service was just okay.
