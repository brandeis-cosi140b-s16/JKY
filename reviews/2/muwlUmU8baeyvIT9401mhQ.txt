Tried this place for lunch with the same friend that had me try El Torito. There was no comparison. Had a coupon for the $6.99 lunch special. The only thing veggie friendly were the cheese enchiladas, but I didn't want that. I wanted a wet burrito that only came in meat choices. I politely asked if I could have mine with beans, cheese and rice and they obliged. The lunch special comes with a side of beans and rice as well, and your choice of a side salad or soup. I chose the salad.

When we got our orders, my friend got his wet chicken burrito with beans and rice and soup. I got my bean, cheese and rice burrito with just my side salad. What gives? I asked the waitress, and I think she was the owner, why I didn't get beans and rice and she said they used in my burrito, hence why mine was bigger than my friends. She said that next time, she would be more than happy to make my burrito smaller and include the beans and rice on the side. Well...there will not be a next time.

The service was great and the employees were extremely friendly but the food was not good at all. Very flavorless and just bleh. The burritos I fancy at Fresh and Easy tasted better.

The overall look and cleanliness of the place I'd give a C-. This was a one and done experience for me. There's better authentic Mexican restaurants out there for sure. I think others may feel the same as there was one huge party of women there when we walked in and by the time we left, it was just me, my friend and two other customers. Try if you like but I don't recommend.
