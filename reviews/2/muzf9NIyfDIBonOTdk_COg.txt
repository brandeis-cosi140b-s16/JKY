We've been  going here for years, back when it was Lily's. Went last night for dinner and it was absolutely awful. The salsa had no flavor, I could make better. I had tacos, rice & beans, which weren't good. The meat had an odd flavor, the beans tasted like they came from a can and the rice was bland. It's been awhile since we've been, and I won't be going back anytime soon. Plus, they raised their prices and are very expensive for a mediocre at best restaurant. It's too bad, as I always enjoyed going on the weekend for the egg special (green chili, eggs & meat). Pedro's or Popo's are much better choices for a small, family-owned Mexican restaurant
