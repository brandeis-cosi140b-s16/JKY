even though there were a lot of mexican familys dining here  i have a feeling it was because of the portions, the food was ok but not great in my opinion and the staff working in the kitchen and taking orders at the walk up window were not overly gracious to wait wait on me..........a gringo perhaps??????lets not even go there.......
