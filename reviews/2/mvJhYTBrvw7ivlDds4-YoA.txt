This restaurant is obnoxious.

The employees have all been friendly and I've never had a problem with customer service.

I have a few complaints.

This restaurant is NOISY.  

The big hispanic dude chopping the chicken is annoying.  The BANG BANG BANG!!! of the cleaver cutting the chicken echos through the whole restaurant and it is loud.  BANG BANG BANG!!! then he turns around, flips a few chicken carcasses over on the fire, then turns back to the chopping block and BANG BANG BANG!!!  I know they need to cut the chicken but damn... why does it have to be so damn loud???

This store plays "background" music.  Their music isn't bad.  It could be worse-it could be some obnoxious mariachi crap.  But they always seam to have the music turned up really loud.  

And maybe it is the design of the restaurant... maybe this store has some weird acoustics... but everything in this building echos.  I was here a few nights ago and you could hear the conversations of everyone sitting around you loud and clear as if they were sitting next to you.

This place gives me a headache.

Did I mention the food?

The food has a good flavor but the portion sizes are a joke.  I remember years ago when El Pollo Loco gave you your money's worth.  Not anymore.  Like every other chain restaurant they too got greedy and give you tiny portions.  i always leave this place hungry.
