This was definitely the most disappointing meal I had in Vegas.  I'm accustomed to the concept of overpriced food on the Strip, so I couldn't totally fault this place for being any different in that respect.  The chips and salsa were great, and they were promptly delivered.  We ordered two combo plates, a Corona, and a house margarita.  The food was good: not spectacular, not horrible...just good.  We ordered the churros afterwards, and again, just good.  They had nice flavor, but were a bit on the overcooked side.  When the waitress finally brought the check around, though, we were appalled to see that a standard sized bottle of Corona was $9 and the small plastic cup of house margarita was $11!  Seriously?  The larger "specialty" margaritas that the table next to us ordered were only a couple dollars more and looked to be at least twice the size!  I was glad that we declined the refills she offered.

Overall, I wouldn't go back or recommend to friends.  The service was slow (with the exception of the free chips and salsa), and our server was inattentive bordering on rude.  The food was average for the most part.  Drinks were average and overpriced, even by Vegas standards.
