Want to try a new place to have a decent burrito. After watching them make the burrito,  I headed for Roberto's. Disappointed with the pre-cooked meat just sitting on the counter drying out. Made to order just taste so much better, but I will go back and try the taco's. The meat cooking on that vertical grill looks good but the burrito's need to change NOW.
