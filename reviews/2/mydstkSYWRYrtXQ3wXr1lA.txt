I suppose this goes for any Rubio's location, but why so expensive? Way overpriced for what you get. I'd rather pay the same amount, or less, in a real restaurant. Also, we always had hit or miss service here... sometimes good, sometimes not so great. As for the food, well, it wasn't that memorable. Well, since we're stuck out here in AZ, I guess this is the closest we can get to the real thing?
