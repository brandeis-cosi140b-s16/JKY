I love mexican food and I would want mexican food for lunch everyday if I can.  
Now you can guess how excited I was when I found out that I had mexican restaurant right next where I work.  

But sadly enough this Macayo's mexican kitchen was not a real mexican restaurant.
They make McDonald version of Mexican food. 
I can tell that they use low quality meat, chiken etc. 
I am so sad that have to drive at least 5 minutes to get real mexican food.
