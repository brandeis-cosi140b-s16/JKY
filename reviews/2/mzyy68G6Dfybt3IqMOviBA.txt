Recently, the prices at this location have arbitrarily climbed (while the prices at other locations have remained static), and customer service has significantly decreased. The burritos, which were already smaller than usual at this location, have shrunk an inconceivable amount (I now get only about half a scoop of meat compared with an ample scoop and a half at other locations), significantly reducing my satisfaction as a customer. I e-mailed Chipotle directly with my concerns and received a copy and paste response almost two weeks after my complaint. Way to go!
