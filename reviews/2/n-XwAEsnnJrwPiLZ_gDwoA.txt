We had the chile burger with bacon and were not impressed. The peppers were not even not and the cheddar cheese seemed to be of poor quality. What's up with the fries? Was the cooking oil recycled? It tasted like it when I had the fries. The pancake was not the way I remembered it.  I won't be back. Too disappointed that this place has tried to replace Gallo Blanco. You have a lot to learn. It's all in the details. Enough said.
