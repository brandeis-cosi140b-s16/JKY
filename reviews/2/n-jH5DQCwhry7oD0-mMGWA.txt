TWO BIG THUMBS DOWN! I do not know if it is just me but arizona does not have good mexican food. Someburros should not even be classified as mexican food to be honest. maybe its because i'm from California, and we got all the good mexicans. a burrito here consist of beef or chicken wrapped in a tortilla! with nothing else! no way hombre! and they don't even have carne asada, its ground beef. luckily i was there on the right evening where they had a chimichanga for $5 that came with a little more than just meet. and the only reason i ate it was because i was starving and then it was still only "ok".

recommendation- keep driving till you see taco bell
