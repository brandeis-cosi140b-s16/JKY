I came in on a quiet Sunday evening to grab a $5.50 burrito and fries Hooked deal that El Charro has sometimes. It's located only down the street from my place so it was a quick walk there and back.

I ordered a steak burrito and it was ready in a little less than 10 minutes, the guy at the counter was nice.

The burrito was kind of sloppily rolled and seemed to be pretty loose and not quite filled up all the way. This made it a little difficult to eat because the insides kept falling out. The steak was like finely chopped up and at times resembled ground beef. The burrito had like a pico de gallo and lettuce and cheese but not much else, I found myself constantly putting the included green salsa on. It was also quite greasy.

The French fries actually didn't look like I expected, these were dark and actually looked pretty good. Unfortunately though, they were dripping with grease, tasted a little old, and were very soggy. 

Overall everything was pretty greasy and kind of your stereotypical low-cost Mexican fare, similar to Burrito King down the street. I don't think half as good as Chipotle or even Maize, which halfway through my food, I kind of wished I would have gotten instead, even though they're more expensive.
