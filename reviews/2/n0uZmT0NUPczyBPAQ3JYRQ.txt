This review is solely on the service at this location.

I tried the app for ordering from my phone. While I was placing the order, I received a phone call which switched some of my order choices, the main thing being the pickup time from 5:30 to 4:45.

After the order was placed (paid with credit card), I tried to call the location to have this corrected but nobody answered the phone. I attempted to call 3-4 times but to no avail.

When I arrived at 5:30 to pickup my food, I asked what their phone number was, someone pipes up "it's on the card" so I compared number and indeed I had dialed the correct number. 

Side note, I began to explain the checkout girl that the order was probably sitting for 45 minutes excuse of the incorrect time, she said "we made it no more than 15 minutes ago" does this mean I would have had to wait if I indeed ordered for the correct time?

Either way, I definitely had to re-heat my food web I came home...

Back to the phone number fiasco, I proceeded to dial the number in front of them but heard no ringing and nobody picked up. I tried again 5 minutes later and lo and behold they answered after 1 ring....

Also note, when it's a busy time of day, every 15 orders the entire line gets held up so they can refill the selections. They work really slow and don't know how to get the line moving.

P.s. Lately their chicken has been sub-par, lot's off fatty pieces that are inedible..
