Ugh, not a fan.  First off, my husband and I had pretty awful service while the large, loud, drunken table next to us had at least three waiters pouring shots from tequila bottles at their table.  The place is pretty tiny, and I could barely hear myself think.

The food was bland and mediocre, and we ordered a huge mango margarita to share.  I'm not sure if it had alcohol in it at all, and it tasted like oranges.  (Maybe that other table didn't save any tequila for us.)

I would recommend this place only if you are here with a large group to party.  If you want to have a nice dinner with someone, go somewhere else.
