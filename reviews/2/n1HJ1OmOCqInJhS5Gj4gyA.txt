You go to Chipotle and expect it to be the same as the others, but this one is NOT. The bathroom, dining area, and drink self service area are dirty every time I've gone to this location. Need a lemon? You'll find one or two old slices smushed down in those self-serve containers that look like they've never been cleaned. 
I only had to wait and ask for lines three times this visit and don't bother giving me a tray! I loved trying to juggle my food and drink and their accessories around looking for a clean chair to sit on. 
Step it up, Chipotle, I don't want to have to quit you.
