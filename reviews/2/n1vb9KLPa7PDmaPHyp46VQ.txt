This place is seriously lacking in ambiance.. I know it's a restaurant, and I should first be commenting on the food, but the inside of the place was so offensive I have to start there.... Black mold on the ceiling. Flies EVEEYWHERE. Meat sitting around at room temperature in plain view. 

My husband loves this place, so I didn't feel like pitching a fit and succumbed to eating there, seated right under the moldy ceiling. The food was okay. For a place that prides itself on carne asada, it was absolutely standard run of the mill Mexican dive food. The one perk, the portions are huge. But it's not like you actually have the desire to eat all that mediocre food. 

The service: probably passable if you speak Spanish. If you don't... Well be prepared for your order to be wrong. I won't go back here. It was disgusting. But I'm sure there are a couple loyal followers that will keep the nasty place open.
