It's Taco Bell. However I am still spending hard earned money. I often go in and order a bean burro with sour cream. And nachos. Literally every single time they leave out the onions. Really?? It's like a super special order or something and the idiots lose their minds!! It's not brain surgery people ! It's a fricken bean burro with sour cream! For cripes sake!
