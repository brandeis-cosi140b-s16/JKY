This is place should not boast Mexican, authentic food. So many people had told be to come here for great Mexican food, and so I finally did. I was extremely disappointed. The food here is Tex-Mex, at best. You can expect to get blobs of sour cream and cheddar cheese to top your cumin-tasting "Mexican" rice. The salsas were watery and dumbed-down. Again, very inauthentic. I ordered Carne Asada tacos, which are difficult to mess up in most places (though this "dish" does not really exist in Mexico). The seasonings were off and the cheese was unnecessary. The Cochinita Pibil tacos were okay, which is why I am giving the place one star. The decor is as tacky as one would expect in Las Vegas, and the lighting is even annoying. I would never come back here. i would be better off eating at Roberto's Taco Shop! They are equally disgusting, though the latter is cheaper! However, if you are not looking for authentic Mexican food, but actually the dumbed-down, sour cream and cheddar topped version, you definitely will enjoy this place. The staff is also very friendly, which is why I am giving the place another star.
