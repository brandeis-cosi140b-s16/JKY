I used to love this place. No more...

The pico de gallo used to win awards, but now it's bland. The guac is a version of the creamy goop you get in a bag from the super market... No thank you.

I'm a huge fan of pork flautas, but this came out as a gigantic thing that looked as if it were wrapped in some weird pastry batter. Didn't taste much better.

Looking for Mexican in Fountain Hills? Try something else.
