The food at Chipotle is always great, but the service at this particular location is awful. The wait is only so long (even if there's no line) because the people behind the counter are slow to put your meal together, and they're always talking and joking to each other. Even when you're right in front of them ready to order!

I've been here many times because I love Chipotle and it was close to where I used to work. Terrible service won't make me go out of my way to this particular location again.
