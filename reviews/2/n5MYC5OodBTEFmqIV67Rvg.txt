We have eaten here on prior visits to Casa Grande and usually enjoyed the place.  This time four of us went for dinner on a Sunday evening and were disappointed.  The first sign was when we walked in and were told that there would be a twenty minute wait when a quick glance into the dining room to the left showed at least a half dozen empty tables.  That is a clear sign of short staffing and should have been a warning.  

Nonetheless, we accepted bar seating at a high top, not ideal but OK, and sat for ten minutes before anyone came over to check on us.  The first thing our waiter said was it was his first day, the second was he didn't eat Mexican and didn't know what most of the dishes were.  Hmmmm.  He was also trying to be the bartender as well as a waiter and didn't do well at either task.

The food was fair, not the worst Mexican I have tasted, but mediocre at best.  the red chili in my burrito was pretty good, my shredded beef taco tasted like it was made last week.  There are too many other choices of Mexican in the area to bother with this one again.
