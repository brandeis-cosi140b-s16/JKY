The food is good.  Too bad the restaurant doesn't match their prices or quality of food.  I'd say their burritos are comparable to Chipotle.  This was my first time here and will not be going back.  Mostly I just felt like there are so many other places with just as good of food that are priced much better and have a better environment, so why would I come here?  Overall, poor value... $7 for just a decent burrito?  No thanks.  Not here.
