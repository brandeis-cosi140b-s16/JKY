The food was okay, and their methods of attracting business are questionable.  We received a Zabas coupon in the mail which stated, "Buy 2 entrees and 2 drinks and receive 50% off your order."  So, I'm thinking one drink and one entree free.  Not so.  When I got to the register, she says it's 50% off only one entree.  Period.  So what I thought would be a $10 lunch for two of us turned out to be $17.  I argued with the woman, as did several other customers trying to use the same coupon, to no avail.  I told her I'd never come back...and I meant it.  Food wasn't that great to begin with.  Oh, and she overcharged me on top of it.  Only .20 but I didn't notice until I got home.  Qdoba is a much better choice.
