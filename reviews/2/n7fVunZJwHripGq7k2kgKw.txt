In Comparison to Bay area Mexican franchises this place isn't too that great. Its meat rolled in a tortilla. I'm not Mexican but I'm sure that Burritos have beans and rice at the very least. Come to my suprise when I order one from here and receive a tortilla filled with MEAT not even all that great tasting lol. I miss home. I guess you can say but hey if your ever in SAN JOSE Go to La Victoria and tell me who has the better franchise. Later Yelpers
