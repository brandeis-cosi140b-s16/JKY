I have no idea how this place has so many stars. My boy toy and I have been here twice now and neither time was great. It's just... Meh. Not horrible, but not great. I had the hash brown burrito the first time and he had the huevos rancheros. My burrito had nothing but a fried egg, a little but of hash browns.. And bacon. Then, my last 4 bites or so had sausage. No sour cream, pico, cheese... Very plain. His had the eggs with what was definitely canned enchilada sauce.. The refried beans were no better than the canned beans you an buy at the store. The second time we tried a fish taco and burrito... Same experience. The fish had no flavor and was overly fried. I think Los Favoritos close by is way better for a fast food Mexican!
