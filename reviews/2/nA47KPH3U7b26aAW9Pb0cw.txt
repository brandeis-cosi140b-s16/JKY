Cold food. Look at the refried beans. Never seen anything like this. Not even good. My burrito, shall I just call it tortilla... because it hardly has any meat. If you want Filiberto's just go to the one in Ray. It's just about 2-3 minutes away from here. Bathrooms are clean though so a gave it a two stars.
