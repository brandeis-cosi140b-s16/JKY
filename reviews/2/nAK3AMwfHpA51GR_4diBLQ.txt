Had lunch here today with the wife.  Food was ok, not spectacular but not the worst I've had.   My taco was a bit greasy but the shredded beef was well seasoned.   The wife had an enchilada and said the sauce was tasty.  Beans and rice were both very good.  My biggest complaint was the service - marginal, at best.  The waiter seemed annoyed by my request for an extra napkin and our glasses never got refilled.  I'm usually a good tipper, but that guy got a measly $1 from me on a $25 ticket.  On the plus side, the food only took about 10 minutes to arrive once ordered.
