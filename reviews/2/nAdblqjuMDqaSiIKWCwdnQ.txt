Worst del taco I've been to. I prefer the one closer to my home. The lady didn't mind yelling at (into her speaker) at the counter. I actually thought she was rude to me, but obviously she was just rude to the vehicle in the car drive through. Odd to have to whitness that. Then she changed her mind and didn't take my order at all. Total psycho looked at me all happy. "she'll be right with you." All sweet and polite like. At least she stayed in character right? Poor guy at the drive through....
