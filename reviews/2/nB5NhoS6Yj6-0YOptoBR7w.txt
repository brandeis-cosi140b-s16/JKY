This place is owned by the same man that owned the franchised Qdoba.  Been going to Qdoba for 15 years..it started to become hit or miss.  Now that it's Central Taco....downhill.  Some easy fixes maybe some seasoning in the beans (black and pinto), the grilled veggies and fajita veggies have absolutely NO FLAVOR. It's simple...flavor your food!!!! This place will be closed by end of year. Not consistent and food lacks any flavor. Quality check your food if you want to succeed.
