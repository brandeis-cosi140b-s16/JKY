Ruru's caught my eye in the winter of 2015. Since I had been hibernating, I didn't make it out here until the yelp event in April. On an unseasonably warm day, Yelp hosted an event on the patio. The food was good and the drinks were strong. I couldn't wait to come back. It was an all around good time.

Our second visit to Ruru's happened a couple weekends ago. The weather was starting to turn to fall and we came in to celebrate. We sat on their beautiful patio and shared a couple plates. The patio was bustling with people, lots of groups, tvs were on, seemed like a great atmosphere. Like another reviewer said - the queso is good but runny. I would order it again. I ordered 3 tacos, but only 2 arrived and I was only charged for 2 - I tried one of the steak ones (gristly) and one of the carnitas (seemed cooked, chopped, and re-fried on a flat top). I got a side of guac which was watery for some reason - maybe because of the tomatoes in it? Not a fan. Fiance got both chicken tacos and the mahi taco. He seemed to like his more than I liked mine. We each ordered a cocktail and on Sundays they are half price which was a plus. Cocktails were good and strong - no watered down drinks here just because they were running a special. Our server was very nice but we had to ask him several times for napkins which should be a default table setting at a place where you eat with your hands. And whatever happened to my third taco? 

Overall, I want to love Ruru's but I can't. The concept is cool and the patio is nice but the food could be better.
