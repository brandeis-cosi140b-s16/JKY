If there weren't better options in Charlotte, I would probably rate this place a 3 or 3.5 but there are better.  The food wasn't bad; it just wasn't anything special.  The prices weren't any better than any other place either.

My main complaint was that the cheese used in the enchiladas was a wierd yellow color instead of the white cheese used in most other Mexican restaurants.  The taste was off as well.
