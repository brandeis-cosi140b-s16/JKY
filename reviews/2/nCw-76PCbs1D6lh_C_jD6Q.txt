I must say, the food is great.  My favorite is the El Diabla shrimp plate. It normally takes awhile to make, but it's worth it. However, on my last visit, I waited a bit longer than normal. I went up to the counter, and after being ignored for awhile, I handed the lady my ticket. She did apologize and informed me that they haven't even started it yet. I wasn't willing to wait this time. I was obviously upset and they didn't offer to refund my money, give a discount, put a rush on it, or anything. She just informed me that if I still wanted it, I would have to wait awhile. WTF?!!? They replaced my El Diabla, the entire reason I went there, with a couple other burritos. Again, no offer to make it right. In total, I ended up waiting about 45 min-1hr, and still didn't get what I wanted. I should have just asked for my money back. Customer Service is everything. I'm really disappointed. Even though I like the food, I don't believe I'll ever return.
