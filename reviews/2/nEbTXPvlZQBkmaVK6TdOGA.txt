They might have a similar menu and setup to Chipotle, but the food is NO BUENO!!!  

There is just something about it that's not good.  I don't know if the chicken that totally lacks texture or the corn chips that taste more like corn oil.  I want so bad to like this place because it's close to my house.  I have tried to go there like three times now, and I won't be back.

Sorry!
