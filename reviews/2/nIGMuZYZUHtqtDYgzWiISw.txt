This is that place next to the REI off of Southern Avenue. No real ambiance or service to speak of - it's just a little strip mall burrito joint.

I ordered the Devil's Shrimp burrito or burro or something, I don't know. I don't guess I stopped to think about what meaning exactly the word 'devil' might carry in the name, but I found out - it means HOT. Like hotter than pepper spray hot. And yes, unfortunately for me, I do know what pepper spray tastes like - I had this friend in college back in Austin, and one drunken night his crazy little brother Michael slipped me a shrimp that he'd soaked in pepper spray. Lemme tell ya, that was pretty F'in hot, but not even close to the devil shrimp at Taco Nazo. I'll be back, but only to take Michael there when he comes to visit next month. Beware the devil's shrimp.
