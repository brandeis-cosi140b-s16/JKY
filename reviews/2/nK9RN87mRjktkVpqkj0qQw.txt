Not what I was expecting at all! The decor is very funky, odd decorations all over the walls, each room has a different "theme" I'd guess you could say. Paradise style room, hub-cap room, famous Mexicans (im guessing by their pics - don't know who they are though) room, etc.  They have kind of 50's style tables and chairs. 

The food was quite pretty tasty - great salsa!! For drinks I had a margarita, quite good but nothing special. This place is really about the d√©cor and atmosphere, not so much the food.

Best Tip about this place: in the foyer look up!
