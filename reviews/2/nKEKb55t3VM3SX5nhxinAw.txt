Umm, who took the flavor from my food?  Bland, bland and more bland.  Apparently they only flavor things here by throwing cheese on it.  

Ordered the Tacos Morongo, which sounded a lot like the tacos I've enjoyed at roadside taco carts in Mexico, with avocado puree in little corn tortillas.  Great in theory, poor in execution.  The steak was tough and it didn't even taste like they salt and peppered it for flavor. The other ingrdients faded into nothing.  The hubby's Machaca platter, which the server couldn't decide if it was spicy beef or pork, we're pretty sure it was unspicy pork.  

Portions are large.  Chips and salsa are endless but canned crushed tomatoes, onions and cilantro do not a good salsa make.  Anyone heard of garlic? Jalapenos? Fresh ingredients?  Bah, two stars for being atleast edible and because I feel bad for my friends who like coming here.
