I am almost embarrassed to write a review about Taco Bell but this Taco Bell is always SOOO slow!  I went today and the did not have chicken.  I went a few months ago and the actual store was closed and drive thru was only open because they did not have enough staff.

I had to laugh because today, when we went through the drive thru, the guy told us we could start our order, so we did.  After the first item, he said "hold on, I was doing something."  Well, yeah...that is kind of the nature of the job, right?  I usually give people the benefit of the doubt but it was pretty bad.

I do have to say that the food generally looks neater than other TBs, if you do get the correct food or the food at all.
