Terrible customer service and terrible food, unless you enjoy greasy a** food. Usually "fast food" is greasy but it is like they dip their food in straight up grease and leave it soaking in there. 

I came here a month or so ago two times and had their tacos on a Wednesday. Customer service was great and so were the carnitas taco. The tacos had just the right amount of meat and the tacos were not as soggy. But recently, I ordered the carne asada fries, the service was thumbs down just as much as the food. The lady had us waiting for 5 minutes + until she finally saw us (She was too busy on the phone to check the drive thru). Then when we went inside to get forks, napkins, and salsa because she didn't place any inside our bag, we noticed how filthy the dinning area was. Honestly - when you're at work , work. 

I only took a couple of bites of the fries until I wanted to puke. A waste of $7 , idk why they have high stars - unless it's for the 79 cent tacos on Wednesdays.
