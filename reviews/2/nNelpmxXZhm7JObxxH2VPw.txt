How long can a ball roll downhill before it reaches the bottom? On the border has always been one of my favorite restaurants, but over the last couple of years it just keeps getting worse and worse. I walk through the door with a friend of mine and see an empty host stand. I wait for what felt like five minutes of seeing employees checking in on their tables and looking at me just standing there until finally someone shows up to seat me. Please take note and make sure someone is ALWAYS waiting to seat your guests. The service once we got to the table was amazing. Our server was very sweet and constantly checked in on drinks and chips and salsa, which was really the best part of the experience. The thing that absolutely pisses me off is that every single time I come in, I have to send my food back because the kitchen does not understand the concept of what a burrito is. The burritos here look like taquitos, small and skinny, with open ends. 

Corporate America is downsizing portions everywhere, but it gets to the point where it's downright disrespectful to charge people for such an embarrassment. I really miss the days when I used to come here and get a large burrito, or even something that could be referred to as a 'burrito' for that matter.
