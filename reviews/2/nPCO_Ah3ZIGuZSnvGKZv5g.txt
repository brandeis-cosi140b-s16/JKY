This might fall under the category of "too much Information" but... 
In the last two weeks I've been in 4 meetings catered by Qdoba and an hour or so after each meal I've had the worst indigestion. Wow, how do I spell r-e-l-i-e-f??? I need some now. I hope no one in the cubes outside my office can hear the belching or they will think I've been swilling brewskis at lunch. The first time I thought might be an anomaly, but today was the 4th...buuuuurp...lunch and...buuuurp....there it goes again.
