The food is lacking quality and cost is not that great. I paid over $8 for one enchilada and one side; that's it - that was the plate. The enchilada was not very good and my side, tortilla soup, was okay. 

Do not order the sopaipillas. This restaurant does not know how to make them. They were quite disgusting. Sopapillas are supposed to be thin and fluffy yet what we got were fried biscuits. extremely dense and hard to eat. Not very tasty, not authentic sopapillas. 

Needless to say we spent too much money for a not very satisfying meal. Don't waste your money here if you are looking for a meal. I do not know how their alcoholic drinks are since we didn't order any.
