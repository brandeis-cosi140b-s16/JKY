I love mariscos, but i didnt love San Carlos Bay. To be fair, they are known for their caldos and I just ordered filete veracruzana....but still!!! my dining companion got the fish tacos, standard to be sure, but really below standard.
We are regulars at Playa Hermosa, so we decided to try out San Carlos Bay, I wont waste you time on a comparison, just know that all my dislikes about San Carlos Bay do not exist at Playa Hermosa.
Service was decent, food just ok, and unless you are over 60 and white - you may stand out.
Avoid this establishment and head around the corner for a better atmosphere, way better food and a decent ROA.
