I'm not sure where to start. I guess I had my hopes up because there are few good places to sit down and enjoy a meal here in Maricopa. 
   We went during their soft open, they are now officially open. But I haven't heard anything positive about this place from any of our friends since their opening.
   The chips were bland and their salsa was little more than tomato sauce with a couple of chunks of onion. I ordered the Tres Amigos which had chile rellano, chile verde, and chile Colorado. The pork was tough, but the verde sauce was nice. The chile Colorado was bland and even though the beef was tender, it lacked flavor. The chile rellano was ok. I did feel that the breading was too thick, but thankfully the cheese was tasty.  The refried beans reminded me of baby food. Pureed beans thinned with a bit of water. The rice was mediocre at best. My husband ordered the chicken enchiladas. He was unimpressed. 
   Our server was prompt, but I seriously think he was high. Cocaine is a hell of a drug I hear. He didn't speak any English, which made ordering a pain. He also made us feel like we were being an inconvenience any time we asked for a refill.
  The wall decor is fun, though the elk head leftover from when the space was Teakwood's was a bit odd. :)
