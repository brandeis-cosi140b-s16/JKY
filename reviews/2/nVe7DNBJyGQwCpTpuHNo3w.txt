I used to love this restaurant, but the service has consistently been so poor lately that I cannot come here anymore. In fact, it is so bad that I made a Yelp account just to write this review. The servers are all kids that couldn't get into college and hate their jobs as servers. I ordered fajitas for takeout once. Get home to find I received no salsa and no tortillas. Tortillas are an important part of fajitas! I drive back and tell the hostess. She tells someone else that I need chips and salsa, and I say no, I need tortillas and salsa. When the manager finally brings it out, she acts like I am causing an inconvenience. No apology was given at any time. Waiters are inattentive, and the food does not make up for it. Won't be coming back.
