Food is always good at any Filiberto's...but service usually sucks. I stood at the counter staring at a worker speaking Spanish on the phone. She didn't acknowledge me and stayed on the phone. A worker from the back had to come up and help me. The worker working the drive-thru couldn't help me because she was busy with drive-thru.
