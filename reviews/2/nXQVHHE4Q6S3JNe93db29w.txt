It was ok. HUGE portions. But trying to cut up a GIANT burrito with a flimsy plastic fork/knife was somewhat of a joke! There isn't much seating (inside). The chips (although limitless) left a LOT to be desired (tasted like store bought) and the cups you get for salsa are teeny tiny- which the chip doesn't even fit in!! The girl at the counter was less than helpful or friendly-since it was our first time. The food was hot, fresh and fast. But the whole experience was lacking. They (the unfriendly girl at the counter) would not accommodate needing something small for a 20month old. We had to purchase the $6 kids meal, so she could eat 5 bites of a quesadilla- a baby doesn't need beans and rice or a soda... It was awkward having the credit card slip have a "tip" spot, since you order at the counter. So do people that pay cash get asked for it? Or are they supposed to leave on table? We didn't see anyone leave anything on tables around us. But there was a woman that brought our food and asked if we needed anything BUT everything was self serve?!? Not sure how to gauge that one. We will probably be back, but $33 for a 3 adults and a baby for lunch (no drinks purchased) seemed a bit much to order at the counter and eat on paper plates with plastic utensils.
