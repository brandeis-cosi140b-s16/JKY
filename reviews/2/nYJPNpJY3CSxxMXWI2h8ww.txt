I wasn't a fan of the dining area, the space is typical for South Side though, an old building/store front of sorts turned into a restaurants.. very makeshift and dirty looking. We were sat in front of a huge tv on the wall with a very loud spanish tv show, seriously annoying as hell. We could see all of their storage, boxes, junk under the stair case, you can see all the wires everywhere from the lights and tvs...just very unprofessional looking...not a good vibe.

The food wasn't good either. Rice taste like rice a roni, meat in tacos was obviously cheap, chips and salsa were just okay...

I imagine if you are a college student this place wouldn't be that bad, the bar area looks nice, but if you are looking for a good dinner and atmosphere, if you are over the age of 30 you will hate this place.
