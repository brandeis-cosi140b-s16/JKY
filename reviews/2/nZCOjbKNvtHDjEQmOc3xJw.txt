First, the nearly empty restaurant at 4 pm prompted the hostess to make us wait 10 minutes for a booth.  There were tons of empty places.  High handed is how we read it.  Next, we had an average Mexican meal followed by dessert.  The person with me could not get flan since they were still making it so another dessert was done instead.  The bill came and we were charged for 3 desserts not two.  We pointed out the problem and the server was not surprised.  She just took the bill and redid it the right way.  It seemed practiced.  We will not be going back for a long time.  The whole experience left us wanting a new Mexican restaurant who wanted our business.
