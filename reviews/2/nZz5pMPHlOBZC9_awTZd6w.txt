I am a lover of the 24 hour burrito places. Really I am, and given the fact this is the one that happens to be closest to me I am always disappointed that this place isn't better. I have NEVER, in the 10 or so times I've been here, ever gotten my order 100 percent correct. Either they forget my guacamole, or give me sprite instead of mountain dew, the list goes on. In Phoenix we are absolutely lucky with these types of places and I suggest for you to skip this one. I drive 5 miles down the road to pick up my burritos at 4 a.m. I just can't justify suggesting a place that never has gotten my order right. The only thing that is making this a 2 star and not a 1 star is the food is actually pretty good. Not better then some of the other "urtos" out there and they do undercook the potatoes but other than that they are good. Not great. Meh.
