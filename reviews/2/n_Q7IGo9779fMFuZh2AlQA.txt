I ordered the nachos. I had never tasted any like this before. They came on a large salad plate. They had beans, chicken, white cheese and lines of sour cream sauce and guacamole sauce. They were terrible. There was an odd taste to them. $14.00. My friend had an appetizer of 3 mini tacos. $8.00. Small and nothing exciting. We ordered a pitcher of Margarita's without asking the price. $45.00!!! No booze in them either. Very expensive for nothing exciting. Taco Bell would have been better and cheaper.
