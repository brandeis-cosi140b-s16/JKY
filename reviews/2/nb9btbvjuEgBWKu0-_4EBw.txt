MEH. This place is hit or miss. The food is good, I like the barbacoa, but the service can be awful. The  uppity older male host was rude to me and my boyfriend for not knowing where to find the bathroom by approaching us as we looked lost and saying "LIKE I SAID, the bathrooms are around the corner!!" Its like, dude, I didn't notice that you were talking to me before, why are you being so rude?

The parking can be a nightmare. Their motto pretty much is "we can be rude, cuz you probably will be back to eat our food"

I won't be back.
