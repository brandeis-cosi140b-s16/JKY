This might be a great place for breakfast but the lunch was very questionable. Much like like John V. I too was wandering around in the area and saw the two restaurants...and I also chose the less busy. Oops. The menu looks great...lots of fresh fruit salads and breakfast options, but this was lunchtime so I went with the chicken soft taco combo. It reminded me of nothing more than what I would get at a Fillibertos...but twice the price. The combo came with rice and beans (drink was separate) and my total was $10.38. Being a block away from Baja Fresh I doubt I will ever go back for lunch...but I'm giving it two stars for the potential of a great chorizo burrito.
