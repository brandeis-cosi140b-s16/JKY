I had jury duty today, so I was in the downtown area. Lucky for me, my sister happens to work downtown and was able to meet me during my lunch break. Unlucky for me, we decided to try out a place one of her coworkers recommended, and it was less than exciting. 

First of all, the menu is all over the place, they call themselves a Mexican grill (although they are more similar to a Filiberto's), but then they have a whole menu of deli sandwiches, not tortas, but deli sandwiches like BLT's. They also have chicken wings??? We wanted Mexican food, so we went with the shrimp tacos and the carnita taco special. Both came with 3 tacos, rice and beans, and at $8 a plate, I wouldn't really call this a good deal, especially since chips and salsa were an additional $1.99! My sister's shrimp tacos were just that, shrimp in tortillas....no toppings...no sauce....no flavor! My tacos were unappealing at first sight. I love carnitas, but I like the shredded kind, these were little chunks of pork, but upon first glance, I saw more chunks of fat than pork.....gag! These were topped with some chopped onion and cilantro, but I couldn't even bring myself to taste them. At that moment I was wishing that I had ordered the nachos, even though they use a processed cheese sauce rather than shredded cheese (why oh why?!). I did eat the beans, which were actaully quite good, they were creamy and not greasy. I didn't try the rice, but my sister said it was good; simply just white rice with peas and some seasoning. 

I ended up ordering a cheese quesadilla, because I knew I needed to eat something more than beans before heading back to jury duty, and it is was a pretty good; but it is not like a tortilla plus cheese takes much skill! 

I think this place needs to figure out what they want their identity to be....then tweak a few things on the menu.
