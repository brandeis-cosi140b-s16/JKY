I love chipotle, I eat at least once a week at chipotle.

Today was my last visit to the chandler fashion center location.  An employee named Autumn was extremely unprofessional in handling a small complaint. 

I was building my burrito bowl and asked for steak. Autumn was helping me get the bowl started and instead of handing the bowl off the next employee she reached over and gave me an extremely small scoop of steak. It had to have been about 6-7 cubes of steak. I voiced my concern and she rolled her eyes and put 2-3 more cubes in the bowl and told me in a very snappy tone "that's it and if you want any more you can order double" 

I've been to many chipotles and ordered double steak many times, I've also never seen an employee act this way. I thought chipotle made better hiring choices.
