Family, friends and I have been going to Los favs for many years.  Over time the best breakfast burrito became the worst!  It becomes smaller and more expensive every time I return!  

The girl behind the counter is rude and unwelcoming which never turned me off before, as the food was good for the price.  Now I'll steer clear of this place unless the management changes things back to the way they used to be.  

Bring back the old Los favs!
