My coworkers and I came here for our lunch break. It took F O R E V E R to order and receive our food. Then it took an eternity for the waiter to bring our check. Took an hour and a half to get in & out on our lunch break. I ordered the steak quesadilla. Not bad if you like mostly peppers & onions. I had 2 slices of the quesadilla. Of the 2 slices I had, one piece of steak in each slice. I opened the rest of the quesadilla up to look at it. Maybe, MAYBE 8 pieces of meat in the whole quesadiila. Only one of us enjoyed our food. That was Lee. She ordered a cheese crisp with taco meat. I have to say it looked good. However, we all agreed we will never come back here for lunch....or dinner.
