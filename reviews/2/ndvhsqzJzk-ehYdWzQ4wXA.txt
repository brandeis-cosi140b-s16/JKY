I was not impressed with Los Sombreros. This is a tough thing for me to say because I adore Mexican food. Living in CA, TX and now AZ, I think I've had my fair share of Mexican food and this place doesn't measure up by a long shot.. The food  is very average and fairly expensive for what you get. 

The portions were okay, but I still left unsatisfied and hungry..

There are plenty of good Mexican places that serve way better food at almost half the price of Los Sombreros entrees. 

I thought the salsa was excellent. Service was decent.

I'm feeling generous-2.5 stars
