Apparently my expectations were tooooooo high.  Was told by foodies that this place was a must eat.  However my pool attendant said it wasn't.  First where is the "fusion"?  The menu had food from both places but nothing that mixed them.  The waiter said we had to have the best taco in the world...carnitas.  Being from San Diego it was just ok.  The salsa for it was worth the $5.  For the main course we got the Mongolian beef lettuce and Kao Lao Loa noodles.  We were told it was family style so it would be plenty of food.  If you consider 5 small pieces of beef and a plate full of lettuce enough then you are in the right place.  The one piece off beef I had was good.  Too bad they are too cheap to actually make it family style.  The worst part was the noodles.  When I order noodles I expect a plate full of noodles.  This was individual coils of noodles stood up on their end in a bamboo steam pot.  There was 20 noodles with a tiger dipping sauce.  I almost spit up up the sauce on the first bite.  Was like dirty water.  Way too much hype very little to actually eat.  I will never go back.
