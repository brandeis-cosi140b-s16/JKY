I came here quite excited to try a new place.  The name has Taco in it, so I'm thinking delicious mexican food.  Well, it wasn't anything worth willingly going back for.
1) I felt the food wasn't worth the money spent (luckily I didn't spend any).  I was told to get the corn dish, and that it would be good.  Well it was definitely unique.  It came in a bowl with a line of lightly spiced popcorn.  And it was good...until I bit down on hard popcorn kernels 3 different times.  And that was my limit.  Word to the chef; I would definitely suggest making sure there are no kernels in your popcorn if you're going to season and disguise it on a bed full of seasoned corn.
2) My dish was so small.  Only two tiny empenadas and that was it. No rice, no lentils, no side salad; nothing else to enjoy with it.  Quite disappointed.  I knew I didn't want anything too heavy to eat, which is why I ordered the veggie empenadas, which were good.  But by the time I left and got back home, i was hungry all over again.
3) Typically I wouldn't complain about a drink, and maybe the machine was bad, but I just don't do well with any kind of watered down drinks, but their lemonade was oh so wrong :(

Overall, it was a forgettable experience, and I certainly don't plan on spending my hard-earned cash here any time soon, at least definitely not intentionally.
