My experience at this place was pretty terrible. First of all, the mariachi's don't play Mexican music, but horrible versions of radio hits and classic rock. They forgot to place our order so we waited for about 40 minutes to receive our food. The table next to us that sat down after us finished their food when we received ours. The manager gave us 20% off our check for that which is a very disappointing amount since we were standing up to leave when they brought us our food. Never once did our waiter tell us there was an error and that our food would take a littler longer until we finally received. 

Then, a customer at the table next to us got sick, puked everywhere, and the paramedics were called. Sitting next to a table with puke all over the floor was a fantastic experience as well. 

The food was just "ok" and overpriced (but that's normal for Vegas).

Visit this restaurant if this sounds like a good time. I'll never be coming back here:
