disappointment....I was actually driving down McDowell Road looking for a Honduran place that I had heard good things about, saw this place, and decided to give it a go.  I wish I had kept driving.  I am a big fan of tortas, however, and could not resist temptation.  I ordered the torta de aguacate, which is basically an avacado sandwich with mayo/crema.  There are jalapenos and a tomato on it as well. No lettuce.  The bulk of the taste is the mayo/crema, which was so overpowering that I could not finish my meal.  I ordered to go, so I tried to mask the taste at home, adding various ingredients in attempt to improve the flavor by killing the crema.  Morningstar chicken and delicious New Mexican salsa could not save the sandwich unfortunately.  

The place was clean and the bread would have been good without the mayo.  I suspect that the meat tortas are better than the vegetarian one, so others may have a better experience than I.  The elote sounded interesting, roasted corn on the cob with cheese, lime, and chili.  It had the mayo on it too though.  I will not be going back to try it.
