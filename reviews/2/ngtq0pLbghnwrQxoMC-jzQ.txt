Yikes. This was a really interesting experience at Serrano's. I've been to other locations and like the food, but that was not the case here. This was my first visit to this location, and I won't be back. 
The restaurant: The interior was old and dated, and I felt like it hadn't been cleaned in awhile. Gross.
The food: Meh. I got a cheese quesadilla and not only was there grease all over the plate, but I felt like I needed to take a shower when I got done with it. My husband was not impressed with his tacos, and the rice and beans were just ok.
The service: This was their one redeeming quality. Our server was really nice and quick (we were on a lunch break).
Overall, I would skip Serrano's- at least this location.
