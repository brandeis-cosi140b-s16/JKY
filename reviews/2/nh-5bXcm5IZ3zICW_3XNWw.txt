I'm only giving a 2 star because our waitress was great & helpful, very courteous. 

As for the food, I would eat Taco Bell before this place. Their "white Baja sauce", is whipped cream cheese with a tiny bit of jalape√±o. Tasted like butter. 

My husband got minis & more. They were COVERED in a terrible thick layer of cheese, which he took off, then come to find out they drenched it in the whipped cream cheese sauce. 
Their red chili beef was alright, but had hardly any favor. 

To each their own, I guess!! I will stick to Macayos.
