Lackluster service and just-passable food makes this hotel restaurant a rather forgettable place. I went there for breakfast twice, while on a weekend "staycation" at the Clarendon Hotel, chaperoning my son during ComicCon. When my wife booked the room, it came with breakfast vouchers - vouchers that are actually only good for $12.50. Add a cup of coffee to almost anything on the breakfast menu and you're almost assuredly going to blow through the $12.50 if you include tax and tip.

Not that I'd try to dissuade you from having the coffee. It's actually really good. Probably my favorite thing there.

On my first visit, the service was absolutely abysmal. I was seated at the counter -  in full view of everyone - for over 15 minutes before the hostess (seeing that I was being ignored) took it upon herself to scribble my order onto a post it note. I ordered a breakfast burrito with chorizo. I think places like Chipotle have raised our collective expectations as to how large a burrito should be, and this one came in at disappointingly "modest." It was, however, packed with chorizo. Unfortunately its flavor was masked by the copious amount of salt that they put on it. Yikes. It was served with two salsas (stick with the red one) and a small bowl of fruit. Not great, but hey - it was under the $12.50 mark.

The next day the service was a little better. I was seated promptly and my waiter took my order right away. This time I went with the sausage burrito. It was actually smaller than the first one, mainly because there was very little sausage in the burrito. Oh, and no salsa. No fruit either. I wasn't really going to make a fuss and complain about this "free breakfast."

But I'm also not planning on ever coming back.

You may have better luck with their lunch or dinner menus, but I'm not going to find out...

Happy dining!
