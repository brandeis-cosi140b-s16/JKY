Food wasn't great. Ordered the chicken with green chile. In my opinion, the sauce was too watery and a little bland and was surprised to find that dinners do not include tortillas!? I've never order a dinner at a Mexican restaurant that didn't come with tortillas. Salsa bar was the best part. They had about 6 different choice to pick from. Food is on par with Taco Bell.
