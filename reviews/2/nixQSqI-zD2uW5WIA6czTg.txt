While the food is good, and the drinks aren't bad, the service is terrible.

First time I was there, I sat at the bar with a friend.  While I ran to the bathroom, he ordered a drink and 2 waters- telling the bartender I would be right back to order a drink also.  When I got back, not a single bartender came my way or would even make eye contact with me for a good 10 minutes.  We literally had to walk around to the other side just to get someones attention. This went on the entire time we were there, whether we were trying to order more drinks, or food.  I should mention also, that this was about 3pm on a tuesday - there were only 2 other groups at the bar.

On my next visit, we asked for a table.  The hostess kept insisting that we should just go to the bar, but finally caved in and gave us a table when we were persistent.  When she asked if we wanted a booth or table we requested a table so we could see the tv's.  She then told us we couldn't have a table in that section and sat us in a booth where we couldn't see anything.  Once again, it was nearly 10 minutes before our server came by to take orders, and didn't even give us a chance to give our food orders before rushing off with just our drink orders.  It was a long meal...

So anyway, if you don't mind crap service and long wait times between drinks, this is the place for you.  However, if you want to get more than 1 drink in per 45 minutes avoid here at all costs.
