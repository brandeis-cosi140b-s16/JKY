The food is average at best, as is the service. It is not overpriced for what you are served but if you love authentic Mexican food you might be disappointed if you find yourself here. After having eaten here 5 or so times in the past year, if I could give it 2.25 stars I would just to be nice.

I imagine there may be a loyal group of people who would argue with me considering the large crowd that turns up for this place every Friday & Saturday night, but I have to be honest when I say I have never received anything that was delicious. I can say, however, that what I ate was edible, did not cause me to be ill and I have always left feeling full. I believe that having a 2nd glass of wine helps. A lot. 

My husband and I meet friends here for dinner from time to time who love to come here because it is their routine. They well are known by the servers and are always treated well as a result. I would never consider coming here other than to meet our friends who are very comfortable dining here.
