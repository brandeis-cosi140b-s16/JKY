Stopped here during our lay-over to FL.  I was craving some booze (goes great with Dramamine, you know) after a bumpy landing and thought a margarita would hit the spot.

I pretty much dislike all things Cuervo and, unfortunately, almost the entire tequila menu was varying forms of Cuervo.  I sucked it up and just dealt with it like a good traveling princess should.  

The margarita was okay but nothing special.  The lady had a glass of wine and we split chips and salsa.  

We waited around for the waiter to take note we'd finished for probably 10 minutes.  Not a huge deal normally, but when your patrons run the risk of missing flights, service should come before joking around with your co-workers.  

The total bill was around $30.. ouch!  Yes I know, I know... it's the airport.  It's supposed to be over-priced, but considering the lack of service and poor tequila selection (at a place that has "tequila" in the name no less) I was pretty well disappointed.
