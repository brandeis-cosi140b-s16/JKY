The pictures are deceiving went here based off what I saw here on yelp. Let me say for 8.50 they could add a little more meat and even some extra cheese. The quesadilla didn't even stick together and it was a little soggy from tomato juices. Don't get me wrong they have potential but lack that one little spark of a cheesy meaty delicious quesadilla.
