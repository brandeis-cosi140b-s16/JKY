Service was good. Loved the bean dip served with the salsa. Was NOT impressed with the baked chips or the almost raw bell pepper loaded $15.00 Shrimp Fajita. Was more impressed with the ham burger than the Southwest servings. There are a lot of southwestern places here and this one just doesn't serve the quality of food for a higher rating. Unless you are on the small side, you will wish you had asked for a table. The booths are small and I mean small.
