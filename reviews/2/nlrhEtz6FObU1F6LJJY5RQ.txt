I was just expecting so much better. So, so much better. I honestly can't remember much about the experience except that I think I got fish tacos that were ok, my husbands chile relleno was pretty good but the big thing was the rice that came with it. It was AWFUL. He called it "hotel rice." Cheap, bland rice. It had color, so I think it was supposed to be flavored but, alas, it tasted like nothing. It was a lot of money for mediocre food. There are a lot of places you can spend too much money on food on the strip -- don't do it here.
