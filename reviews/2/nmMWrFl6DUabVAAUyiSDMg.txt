Oh Filibertos you were such a disappointment tonight!

We had such a simple order - 2 bean burritos and an order of rolled tacos.  Order after order came up to the window and there we stood waiting and waiting and waiting some more.  It took 22 minutes for our order to come out.  That was after the employee repeatedly asking us what our order was and checking to see if it was coming up.  He finally realized that our order slip was not even on the round about and had to put the order in again.  When we complained that it took 22 minutes for our food, we got a blank stare and a "um, sorry."  

Crappy customer service.  Decent food.  I don't think we'll be going back anytime soon.
