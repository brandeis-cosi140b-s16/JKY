I had heard good things so decided to give it a try this weekend. Joined a friend for food and drinks at the bar. Ordered the spicy margarita, mine was good with just the right amount of heat. My friend's 1st was good but the second didn't even come close the the 1st. Bartender in training - not sure how you get around that but the manager needs to figure out how to provide consistent drinks at the bar. On to the food-we ordered the chips and salsa and then ordered the guacamole. Chips were hot and just enough salt. Salsa was good but was lacking in heat. Maybe there should be two options. The guacamole - had to ask about it a second time in order to get it delivered to us. Chunky, a little too chunky-almost as if the person making it didn't finish mashing it. Again-lacked heat and was overly onion tasting. Ordered the chop salad-tasty although they should leave off the jalape√±o rings. Ordered "you are going the wrong way" and "it goes to the ducks" tacos. My friend has a dairy allergy so the bartender decided to put that note on our entire order. By the time the food arrived, I didn't say anything but I am hoping/guessing that is why my tacos had little to no flavor. They were basically the meat and none of the toppings-bland. I would go back to give it another chance but there are other places in the area that deliver consistently. I don't mind paying for the chips & salsa as others have posted this as a problem, just be good. Bartenders could do a better job making the specialty drinks. And pay better attention to what is ordered. 
The outside area does like a cool place to hangout when it's warm. And they have a nice selection of tequila.  Good looking place-now bring the food & service up to par with the location and price.
