Food is great but they are very inconsistent with portioning. I order cheviche  5 days a week which cost 12.45/day. The least they can do is keep the portion and the order right. They always forget the lemon or they'll try to charge me 2$ for extra salsa that they just throw out at the end if the day cause it goes bad.  I have work at restaurants before, number 1 thing is always be consistent and take care of your customers..
