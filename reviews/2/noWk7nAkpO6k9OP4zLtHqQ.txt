The food itself wasn't all that bad, however the staff was less than stellar. I actually ordered food to go there and the entire time I was waiting, I witnessed the staff having personal conversations that should have taken place outside of the work place. The staff wasn't rude, but they didn't seem to take many things seriously and I witnessed them not really paying much attention to many of their patrons. 

So for the food, not bad at all. The service could use some help.
