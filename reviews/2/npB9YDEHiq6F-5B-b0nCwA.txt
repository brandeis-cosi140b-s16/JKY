the food was bland and uninspired. the service was quick and friendly. another reviewer hit the nail on the head with the salsa comparing to pace from the supermarket. we ordered: a tostada, steak & chicken fajitas, the #1 which is a cheese enchilada and a beef taco, and chicken strips & fries for our little terror tots. again i find myself agreeing with another reviewer-$2.50 for a bloody soda is a bit pricey as well. the husband asked for a wee bit more sour cream and guac. to top off his last fajita...the server brought them quickly, however they were huge portions and ice cold-which he then decided to charge an additional $5 for. it's a good thing i didn't marry a sucker, after arguing with the waiter, the manager complied...however, it didn't come off of the 18%% gratuity that the waiter automatically received from our coupon. next time i want mexican food i'll drive to 67th and indian school and go to popo's...they never fail to deliver.
