I'm giving this place two stars due to the food. I've gotten the same thing (chicken bowl) each time and it is pretty good. 

The major issue with this place is the inconsistency. I work not too far from here and each time I have gone something is different. The hours are always changing, the ordering process is always different, the coffee shop always gets rid of stuff, etc. It's quite annoying. 

The staff seems annoyed most times and the service is mediocre at best. It's very disappointing. The good food only goes so far.
