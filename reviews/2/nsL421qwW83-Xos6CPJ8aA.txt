I've been to Baja Fresh only a handful of times over the past few years mostly because I have never been really impressed with it. My last visit there was on par with the rest.

Upon entering and getting in line, I experienced about a 15 minute wait before I got to the cashier. It appeared as though there were four people working and one of them appeared to be in training. Once my order was in, a nacho burrito with steak and a drink for $10, my number was called just as I was topping off my Coke Zero(which is a huge plus in my book that they offered it!).

The burrito itself was okay. The ingredients appeared fresh enough, however the composition of the burrito itself was just off. One half of the burrito appeared to be just beans, rice and salsa, whereas the other half of the burrito had a few strands of beef, the nachos and cheese. I know the cooks were in the thick of it during the lunch rush and all, but it's nice to have all of the ingredients available at once for your tasting pleasure in each and every bite.

After the manager came by to check on us and clear our trays, I had asked him if any of his employees called out sick. He informed me that two had, one of which had the flu, and he was not going to allow him to come to work (phew!). I applauded his honesty and felt for the guy knowing he was doing the best he could with the staff he had on hand. The initial wait in line was completely justified, however the food itself just did not do it for me. For a $10 lunch burrito, your money is better off being spent at Chipotle, and I think your stomach, wallet, and palate will thank you for it.
