I wanted to like this place, but I didn't. It was really dirty. The BBQ pork was overcooked and tough. The sauce was so-so. This place is mediocre at best. All in all nothing was really that tasty. 

On the upside they have some old pinball machines so bring your quarters, wizard.

I think people give five stars to hole in the wall places just to be special. 

Truthfully, I'd be surprised if my post actually gets POSTED since yelp gets paid to take down posts that aren't four or five stars. 

Look into it people - do your research.
