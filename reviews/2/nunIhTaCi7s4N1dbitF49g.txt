It's all about the location and funky vibe (tattoos, piercing & a few dreadlocks-no patwa). There isn't anything special on the menu (fish tacos???). Oh, that's right.. it's all in the name. The food is okay at best (over priced...must be NoDa) but the service is good. The staff is customer friendly...which really creates a comfortable environment.

Looks like a Socal beach dive has landed in NoDa. Surf's up!
