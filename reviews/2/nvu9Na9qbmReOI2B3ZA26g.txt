This place is the reigning king of the "Screw real Mexican food, we are Americans and make Mexican our way" category.  You know the contenders.  Macayo's,  Arriba, Ajo Al's, Mi Amigos, Julio G's and the like.  They each have their local empires and they are plentiful in Phoenix.

If you are into heavy creams, greasy cheeses, shredded beef, and other hallmarks of this gut busting tradition than Macayo's is the place for you.  A great place to fill up on calories.

On a positive note the chips are alright and their Downtown and Mesa locations are pretty cool buildings.
