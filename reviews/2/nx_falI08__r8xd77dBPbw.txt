This Chipotle-wannabe place isn't so great.  Similar setup with the line and selecting your ingredients, and equally stupid pricing scheme wherein a bean & cheese burrito can be made, but if it has even a teaspoon of salsa also then it's a veggie burrito instead (pay up, buddy, for that teaspoon of salsa).  Staff was a bit grumpy and terse on my Saturday night visit, especially the older overweight lady who seemed to be the manager.  

Salsa portion that comes with the chips & salsa order was pathetically small.

Food was decent.  But... there's Chipotle about a block away, so why mess with Qdoba?
