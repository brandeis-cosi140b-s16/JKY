One Filibertos is like all the rest of them. The only difference is in the building itself and the employees. This one is fairly shady and looks old and dirty. Against my better judgement I have gotten food here a couple times and it wasn't great. The burritos were dripping with grease and the guacamole was bland and tasted like it was from the bottom of a jar. It is not in a good part of town so maybe that is why they don't keep up with the appearance or food. Nearby are much better choices for fast Mexican.
