STAY AWAY FROM THE DRIVE THRU! Each car takes about 7-10 minutes, and god fobid there be 2 cars in front of you on lunch break.

I had their $0.99 taco on tuesday, and only a small pinch of shredded beef. And they are a bit stale. And their regular $2.09 tacos are the exact same.

Happy for Mexican food here in Laveen, but wondering when Filiberto's will be here.
