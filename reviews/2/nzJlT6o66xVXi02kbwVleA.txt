I was seriously bummed when we went to go grab our usual burritos and they were just bad. On our way home from church I called my order in, so we could just quickly grab and go since my husband had to leave for work. The order was simple, a CA burrito w/gauc, a carnita burrito, and a side of rice. I got home to find the burritos were half the size they usually were, the tortillas were dry, and the gauc I was charged for wasn't on the burrito. If my husband didn't need to leave to go to work I would have driven back over there, but there was no time. At least the rice was good! I guess I will be making the drive out to Aliante from now on.
