Do your beans have lard in them?  "Uh, I don't know."  (5-10 seconds go by with us awkwardly staring at each other) and I realize I'm going to have to inquire further.  Response included rolling the eyes, a shoulder shrug, and angrily muttering something in Spanish to the folks in the back.  Consensus is they don't really think so.  But, do we really have to endure people like this?  In customer service retail, you don't just stare back at someone and tell them you don't know.  /sigh

Location is easy to find in the Safeway parking lot.  The drive through is right by the two gigantic trash bins in the eastern part of the parking lot (the trash bins indicate they are for tenant's use only).

Food was similar to gringo-like Mexican chains such as Chevy's and On The Border, but prices were much better.  Rice and beans were plain, and beans portion was quite small with the combo (no more than 4-5 teaspoons).  Cheese Quesadilla was dry.  If you're dining in, get something to eat with your hands because the plastic silverware is among the most flexy and fragile I've seen.  They just don't hold up to a Chile Relleno.

Hot sauce served in ketchup squirt bottles.  It's also more of a "medium sauce" though.
