I have been here 3 times.  Trying to give our local resturants buisness as we usually have to drive to Chandler for meals out.  Unfortunately we were dissapointed yet again.  My meal of huevos ranchero was barely edible.  I managed to eat the eggs and nothing else.  It was so over smothered in a red sauce and not even warm.  The hash browns overdone along with the beans warm at best.  I really wish we enjoyed it the staff is super friendly and nice.  The food not worth a 4th try.
