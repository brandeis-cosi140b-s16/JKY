It was late, I was starving and this is the closest taco shop to my house so I decided to give it a go.  The thing that got me most excited prearrival was that they offered al pastor 24/7.  Not much can beat great al pastor and I have yet to find anything that tops my beloved (and closed down) Tacos Los Parados al pastor, so I had high hopes.  

Those hopes dashed away as soon as I was at the counter and saw the pastor spinning on the spit.  It was as if it had been on there for a couple of days.  I then realized how difficult it must be to maintain quality pastor around the clock.  This is why there aren't any 24 hour shawarma joints.  Yet I was in denial and ordered 2 pastor tacos and 2 chicken tacos for $1.79 a piece to go.  

10 minutes later, all 4 tacos were crammed into a foil package the size of a PB&J sandwich.  I was surprised at how small it all was that I asked the cashier "Is this everything?".  I get home and realized that I had just ordered the smallest tacos in the world.  

I read an article a while back that the current (maybe not by the time you read this) New York Jets coach, Rex Ryan, would eat 12 tacos for dinner before he had gastric bypass.  He certainly wasn't eating these babies.  The chicken was fine and as I had expected, the pastor was dry.  Perhaps I need to go during peak hours when it's fresh?

Roberto's is definitely their main competitor and in the cheap and ghetto Vegas taco game, Roberto wins.
