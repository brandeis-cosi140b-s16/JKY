We went last night for the flamenco show and I was excited to experience the urban atmosphere.  The service was ridiculously slow (15-20 minutes for drinks) and it was insanely hot!!  When we left at 10pm, it was the same temperature inside as out.  The flamenco dancers were absolutely amazing but we will see them again at other locations.  Definitely won't be back which is disappointing because their menu looked good.
