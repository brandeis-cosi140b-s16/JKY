I really want to love Rubios, I've been there three times, and it's on the way home from work. The problem is that both times I've gone on Mon. Night between 7:30-8 and I've ordered the Surf and Turf Taco plate. The lobster taco is o.k. The turf taco has been like eating shoe leather on both occasions. It's just disgusting, and I won't be trying it again. The portions in the large box are small for the $9+ you pay. Both times there were just a few chips in the box, like the chips were too expensive to give you a nice handful. They open the box to show you your meal before you leave, & I'm not sure why. There's just nothing to be impressed about while looking down at a box that is half full. No cheese topping on beans which are pre-packaged in little souffl√© cups. Tues. they have a promotion for $1.50 fish tacos. They are just o.k. too. No special fish taco sauce on the fish tacos like some places use. I know a few other taco places that I would much rather spend my $9 at and get the quality I believe I'm paying for. Feeling a little disappointed now.
