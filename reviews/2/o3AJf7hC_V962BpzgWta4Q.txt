Went to this restaurant asked for a simple classic burrito no beans,so I should of got chicken cheese and rice. Well there was no cheese in it that I could find, chicken was no where to be found so I ended up with a rice burrito for $4.86. I wondered why the place was empty! Now I know. And the place was just generally dirty. My shoes were sticking to the floor as I walked. Sorry to say I won't be back. Sorry el pollo loco I won't be back
