First and foremost, be aware that if you bring a large group they can only break up the bill 6 ways (according to the fine print on the menu). We unfortunately figured this out after our wedding party of 15 finished eating and the server gave us one bill and wanted us to figure how to split it - instead of helping us by doing it via doing it as we ordered.

The manager was very rude when we brought up how this was never brought to our attention and he kept pointing to the fine print and claimed that he was "part of the union"... Whatever that meant. He didn't even offer to have the server split the bill up on their end, so then he thought it was a great idea to start yelling at the bride and basically forced her to pay for everyone's meal on one credit card.

It's a shame because the food was really good and the portions were more than generous. Our server was very personable until she went MIA during the bill discussion. It didn't seem like the first time they had had this problem.
