Didn't feel like eating Burger King so settled on Moe's. I got the burrito which was a substantial amount of food, but $10 is a bit pricey for a burrito. But I guess that's to be expected cause your @ the mercy of Airport pricing once your behind the boarding gate.  I got everything on the burrito so I'm not sure if one of the fillings made it salty. Overall it was "aight" definitely not the best burrito I've ever tasted, & I'm sure you could do far worse.
