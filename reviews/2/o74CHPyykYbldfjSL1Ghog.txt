I used to come here all the time for the queso blanco and ceviche during happy hour.  Recently, the happy hour menu changed and  there  is no longer half off apps and the queso recipe has changed for the worse.  It used to be unique and flavorful.  It is now bland and tastes like something out of a jar.   So disappointing.  The servers here are not very attentive.  However, If you sit at the bar, Jason and Kevin will take great care of you.   So bummed I had to change my initial review from last year, but the recent changes are no good.
