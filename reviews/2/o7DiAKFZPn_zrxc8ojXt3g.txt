This place is nice when you walk in and it smells good but the food wasn't as good as I thought it would be. The price for what you get was not worth it. The beans were burnt and had no flavor, the plate was super hot but the rice was just luke warm. The fajitas had a weird taste to them and I am not sure what seasonings were used. The salsa they give you taste like pace which there isn't a problem with pace but I could have gotten that at home. The woman's bathroom is designed for tall people and not very kid friendly. Not somewhere I would come back to. The waitress was very nice and that is the only reason why I am giving it a two instead of 1 star
