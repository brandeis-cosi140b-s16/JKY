A good place to go for a heavy handed margarita and some bland-gross burritos and super slow service. 

My husband and I came here for the living social pre-fix menu. We each ordered a margarita, both ways. I got the frozen one and it is so strong I felt tipsy after a few sips. We also ordered the poco chimis which weren't that bad.  Then out come out main dishes.  My husband had the combo with a burrito and an enchilada, and I had the grande burrito. We both noticed that the burros had too much skin and made the burrito dry. After doing some "food surgery" by peeling the top layer back and taking off the second layer, the burrito was better but not much of an improvement.  We also ordered the fried ice cream which was probably the best part of the meal.  Sad, isn't it?  Needless to say, we won't be coming back here.
