The reason I'm giving them a low score is because of the horrible phone service. Tried calling ahead - it rang for literally 3 minutes so he could put me on hold for 9 minutes and so I finally gave up and hung up. When I got here 1 person in line (ahead of me). Yes there were people waiting for their to go orders but I would think with the amount of time they've had of being a popular restaurant & being opened for business that they would have come up with a designated person or better phone order system. Not only that - the place needs a serious renovation. With the amount of money (multiple locations) I'm pretty sure they could afford to do a little at a time because it's seriously needed. 
The food though, is pretty damn good. I'm not a big fan of their rice or beans. I usually come for the buttered tortilla, chorizo & egg burrito & my husband gets the machaca, egg & bean burrito.
