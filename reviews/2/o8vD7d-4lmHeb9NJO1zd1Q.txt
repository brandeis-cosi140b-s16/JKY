Okay, went one night about 9pm to grab a margarita! It was terrible, they have some sort of premix that they poured out of an iced tea container. On the rocks... Just unappetizing and sickly sweet. While on the other hand the chicken tacos are always good and Sunday breakfast is good.  Let's not forget the always present distorted symphony of I'll behaved howling children.  God I fear for the future!Ahhh Memories!  Summary : good food, bad margaritas, bring your ear plugs!
