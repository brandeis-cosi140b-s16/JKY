Came back today to try this place out again.  Was craving some chips and tortillas so I came down.  Unfortunately, it will probably be my last time :-(.  I appreciate the follow up comment by the manager, but this place just isn't for me.  

I ordered a chicken adobada taco and a regular grilled chicken taco.  That, a small drink and 3 corn tortillas was almost $12 bucks!  That is one reason I won't be coming back.  Its way way way too expensive for what you get.  The chicken was decent.  The adobada was pretty flavorful and the grilled chicken was alright.  Skimp though.  $3.39 for ONE taco.  The flour tortillas were good.  Not as good as last time but still homemade and good.  My side order of corn tortillas were just ok.  Free chips and fixings were decent.  The place was pretty much empty yet it still took a good 10 minutes for my food to come out.  Meh....not the worst meal ever but far from great and nothing from this visit improved upon my first time there.  I highly doubt I will be back.
