I read recently that Fuzzy's is moving out and Curry in a Box is moving in soon. Perhaps that is why they were out of half their side dishes and the customer service was utterly horrible. It's too bad because with the right management/ownership & employees Fuzzy's would thrive because they do have good food when they're on.
