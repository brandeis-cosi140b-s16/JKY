I am a huge torta kind of Mexican, everywhere I go I have to try their Tortas. When a place specializes in Tortas I get super excited and of course the expectation is higher. So, I woke up craving a good carne asada torta today, I decided to go to this place.  The service is great they're pretty friendly which is why they get one star, the other star is for their mango agua which was pretty good. As far as the torta it was not that great, but I've  had worst. To tell u the truth I'm not sure if it was the torta or the really "depressing" environment in the place. I was the only one in there, the place has plain decor, no music, the AC didn't seem to be working, and there was flies.  I must say it has been the most depressing meal I've had in a while.
