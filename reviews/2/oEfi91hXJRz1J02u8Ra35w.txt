I go there often I like the food.   However the last time I went a couple weeks ago I got my old standby the Arizona burrito.  This time it was so bad I had to throw it out.  Dried out nasty.    Like it had been sitting there for a day.   I haven't been able to go back there because I keep thinking of that meal I had. It just ruined it for future visits. It could have been just a one time thing every restaurant has a bad day. But I was so turned off I didn't go back and probably never will. I normally would've given it four stars but not anymore
