I was not only underwhelmed, but I wasn't even whelmed.


THE GOOD

The night began with high hopes: La Paz looks nice with a glowing bar table, high ceilings, and classy decorations. The 30+ people in our group arrived with chips and salsa waiting at the tables, with the promise of queso and drinks to soon come. Things were looking good.

The chips and salsa: standard
- Very eatable, but not memorable.

Queso Dip: Decent
- Good spicy cheese dip overall. 


THE BAD

The ambiance: Way too loud. 
- It is nearly impossible to carry a conversation with anyone beyond sitting next to you. The high ceilings and spartan decorations do little to absorb noise, sloshing everyone's conversation to a maelstrom of crazy buzzing. Don't come here looking for easy conversation.

House Margaritas: blah
- weak and lacking much flavor. Other drinks on the menu may be more satisfying, but the house margarita was a waste of time and calories.

The Food: unanimously unimpressive
- Street pork tacos were self-described as "authentic Mexican fare". I can say with much assurance (growing up in Southern California) that the tacos were far too heavy on the sweet  tomato-chipotle salsa and falling much too short on the onion and cilantro. Additionally, it was served without lime and rice. And the slaw was inside the taco. It looks nothing like the image in the menu. Major let down.

- The taco salad lacked the key ingredients of beans and rice, this salad is rather unfulfilling and bland. 

- Vegitariano: A what? Looked very sloppy and soggy. 



THE UGLY

The Service: hands down the worse service I had ever received.
- First off, I want to be very clear that I attribute (most of) the poor service to lack of training and experience of the staff (as La Paz just recently opened), not to them personally. That said, I was preparing to slit my wrists with a jagged chip just to make the night end. Let me count the ways in which the service was lacking:

1) Disorganized: 
--- Drink orders were taken twice. 
--- Confusion arouse over who ordered what and even what type of food was on the plate. 
--- Had to ask 3 people twice each and wait 15 minutes to get the salad dressing for the taco salad. 

2) Untimely: 
--- It took over an hour for our food to arrive: No updates, no offer of another appetizer. No offer of more drinks. No water refills. 
--- We were ignored for an hour. Yay, thanks for wasting my night.

3) No water refills: This bares repeating. 
--- Everyone at our table had to ask multiple people, multiple times for water to be refilled, each time we needed it refilled.

4) Unknowledgeable about food: 
--- When asked for more information about a food item, one server read verbatim from the menu. 
--- After waiting for over an hour, servers couldn't identity some of the plates. The rest of the table was awkwardly being served (by asking each patron if this plate was theirs. Also, see section labeled Disorganized above). 
--- More importantly, they couldn't identify my plate--which I could see and identify from where I was sitting. It took asking two servers, waiting 15 minutes (while I watched everyone else eating), and watching a server bend down to examine my (now cold) dinner until I was served the very disappointing tacos.
--- I'm sorry, but if you can't figure out what a pork taco is in a sea of enchiladas, taco salads, and vegitarinos, then someone, somewhere dropped the ball big time. Either that, or I have serious doubts as to the sourcing of your meats and construction of your tacos.


Despite being offered free dessert (as a part of our group deal), we opted to just get the checks and run. In all, we were there for about 2.5 hours on a Thursday night, which would have been fine for quality food, a comfortable environment, and good service. However, my experience at La Paz was none of these. I could tell that the servers were stressed out and under-prepared and my heart goes out to them. Insist on more training.


PS: On your menu, "V Notates vegetarian dishes".... I think 'denotes' is the word you are looking for. "V Denotes".
