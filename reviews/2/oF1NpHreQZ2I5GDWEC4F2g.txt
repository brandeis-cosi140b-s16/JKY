Dear Yelp,

If this is the best Mexican food that Henderson has to offer... Yikes!

Read some reviews boasting about the California burrito here.  Being an avid fan of such burritos, I decided to head over and give it a try.  What I was given was not a California burrito though, it was a regular burrito minus beans and pico.  For those that have never taken a trip to San Diego, a California burrito must contain french fries.  No fries, no Cali burrito.

So after getting over the initial disappointment of no fries, I tore into Faustos (not really) Cali burrito.  The tortilla, which I consider to be the most underrated ingredient of the burrito, was actually pretty good.  Maybe they make it themselves?  Either way, a very solid tortilla.  Unfortunately, that's about the only good thing this burrito had going for it.  The slimy "guacamole" looked like the prepackaged junk you buy at Safeway (or Vons as they call it out here), there was too much sour cream, and the entire inside was cold as a dead piece of vagina!  However, I only dropped four bucks, so I can't really complain too much.

As it stands now, I'm thinking Rubio's really is the best burrito out here.  Like I said: yikes.

I give Faustos Mexican Grill #2 a fantastic score of 2 out of 5 stars.

Love,
James
