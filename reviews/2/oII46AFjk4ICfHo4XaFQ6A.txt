Stopped in the Goodyear location for lunch on Friday.  Wasn't sure they were open, since it seemed dark and there were no cars on the parking lot.  My friends and I were the only ones in the restaurant.  Decor was very dark, and uninspired.  

Our waitress was attentive, and kept the chips and salsa coming while we had some margaritas and waited for our meals.  

The food was mediocre, at best.  Two friends had the taco salad.  The taco shell was crisp, but the salad was a wet mixutre of mystery ingredients.  Nothing about the presentation looked appealing.  I order shrimp tacos with flour tortillas.  My shrimp and cabbage were so wet that the tortillas fell apart before I could eat them.  The beans and rice were ordinary.

Don't think I'll return.  The restaurant is nothing like the original Manny's in Avondale.
