So, I was on my home to SFO from Las Vegas and got up really early to make my flight. On my way to my gate, I decided it was time to have breakfast. I passed up Burger King and a smoothie shop and came across Moe's. It looked like it was the choice at the time. 

I ordered the special breakfast burrito with carne asada ($9.29) and was really disappointed. I should of opted for the smoothie.
