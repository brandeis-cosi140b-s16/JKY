Mediocre, corporately-bland Mexican food (as one would expect from a chain restaurant, even though Los Gringos apparently isn't). The perky waitress either didn't deliver my simple request to the kitchen or they ignored it: I asked for my Chimichanga extra crispy, it arrived soft and doughty. Good chips & salsa, but that should be a given. Wouldn't go back and can only assume the diners giving four or five stars to Los Gringos have never had top flight Mexican. It you think the Olive Garden is good Italian food, this might be the place you; otherwise steer clear.
