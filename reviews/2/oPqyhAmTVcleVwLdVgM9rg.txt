This place was formerly known as Garduno's - other than the name nothing seems to have changed.

The ambience is striking and very nice.  The food is very basic and not that good.  The only thing which stands out are the free sopapillas with honey which they serve at the end of the meal.
The margaritas were not good, very watered down and barely a dash of salt on the glass even when requested.  Their top shelf rita tasted ok and the grand sized rita was like lemonade in a jug.

I'm sure there are better places to have mexican food in the area...
