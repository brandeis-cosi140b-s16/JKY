I grew up on the good food at the Chandler Filiberto's at Dobson & Elliot (great childhood memories).  These days, I go to the Laveen Filiberto's 1 or 2 times a week after a long night at work.  Despite the shrinking size of their burritos in the past year, usually the food I get from there is pretty good, but on a recent visit I experienced quite an awful mess.

I ordered a lengua burrito (which is normally delicious) and a chicken taco with rice & beans.  Everything was good... except the burrito.  They gave me some bottom-of-the-barrel, greasy lengua.  I've never had a problem with their beef tongue until that night.  Inside the burrito there were nothing but big, unpeeled chunks covered with hairlike taste buds (which I had never seen before on their lengua) that were chewy, disgusting and soaked with orange grease!  All this was surrounded by a layer of beans.

Lengua burritos cost more than many others on their menu and I expect them to treat me and the food I pay for with more respect than that.  I wouldn't have been upset at all if they chose not to serve me that greasy mess rather than use my order to clean out the pot before sunrise.  So instead of calling to complain I decided to write this Yelp review to bring attention to their recent inconsistencies in the hopes that the restaurant takes action to prevent any other customers from having this kind of experience.

Greasy, nasty lengua...  To be quite honest, that just pisses me off!
