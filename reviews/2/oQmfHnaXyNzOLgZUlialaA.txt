Was out shopping with a girlfriend and decided to stop by and have a margarita. We asked the waitress how much the top shelf margaritas were and the waitress said they are $10.00 but we have a special where you get 2 of them and a free order of nachos grande. So, we said sure. That sounds like a great deal. We'll do that. Well, the bill came and it was $36.00 including tax. We called the waitress over and told her we were confused. She apologized for the misunderstanding stating that she had neglected to tell us the margaritas that came with the special are the larger size margaritas and they are more expensive. I told her there is no way we were going to pay $16.50 a piece for a margarita even if it did come with a free nachos grande. Had we known the drinks were so expensive, we never would have ordered the special. We weren't going to eat in the first place and the only reason we did it is because it was a great deal. The waitress sent the  manager, Santiago over and we explained what happened and he said "sorry I can't do anything about it." He basically told us we ordered what we ordered and even if there was a misunderstands we needed to pay for it. After he argued with us for a few more minutes, he agreed to take $11.00 off of our bill. That was all he was willing to take off.  It was unbelievable given that we had misunderstood the price of what we ordered   because the waitress had told us the wrong price and the for the manager to argue with us, made it even more unbelievable. Santiago was a total jerk and acted as if we  were trying to get something for nothing. I will never go to that Chevys again and I will also tell my friends about my experience and urge them not go there.
