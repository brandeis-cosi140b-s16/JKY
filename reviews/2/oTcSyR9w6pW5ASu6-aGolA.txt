This place isn't bad but it sure wasn't the greatest!  The girl who rang us up looked like she needed a nap and a personality boost.  The meat tasted pretty good but my carne sada fries seemed a little americanized. Still satisfied my craving for mexican food but i wouldn't say for sure i'd ever be coming back.
