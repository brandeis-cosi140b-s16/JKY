Went here with a Groupon because I wanted to try somewhere new in town! This place was... all right. The staff weren't especially friendly and it felt as though they wanted us out of there as soon as my husband and I finished our food. 

As for the food, I ordered one of their combo plates and it was good! Not the best Mexican I've had, but it wasn't bad either. The beans were great, and it's hard to get me to like fried beans. Definitely the best part of the meal! The rice was meh and the chicken tacos were okay. 

Not a big fan of the atmosphere, though. It looked fairly dirty, I was half-expecting a roach to come crawling across the floor. And I think the place would look much better if they had real matching chairs, instead of assorted lawn chairs.

Probably won't come back here unless we have some sort of coupon, Groupon or otherwise.
