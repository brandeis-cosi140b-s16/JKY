Went to this restaurant a few nights ago with a big group of friends to celebrate a birthday. I'd never been here before, but I'd driven by. When I first got there I was impressed by the ambiance - there are huge windows with a great view of the valley below. There's also a band that does some live music. I had hopes for some good Mexican food as I don't really have a Mexican restaurant here in Vegas that I love. But this place was definitely a let-down. From the super spicy and not good salsa, to both the entree I ordered (bland steak fajitas) and the waiter-recommended entree that my husband ordered (ribeye with cilantro sauce - the steak was just not very quality, very fatty), this place was just a disappointment. I don't drink, but the people in our group that did were quite surprised when they got their hefty checks at the end of the meal.

I do have to say that the service was great. But other than the service and the ambiance, this place doesn't have much to offer.
