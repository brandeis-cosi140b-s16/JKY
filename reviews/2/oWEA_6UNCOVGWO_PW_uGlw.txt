Love what they did to the building, the food, not so great. Sunday night, 4 of us ordered 3 tacos ea. and got one of every side dish. After 3 different servers auctioned off our food around the table, all the tacos were cold. The ancho chilli black beans were unedible, they tasted like a handfull of chilli powder and cumin. The chorizo rice was bitter and no one ate more than 1 bite. The happy hour $5 wine could not have been much more than a 5 oz pour. The happy hour margarita machine was down, no subs offered. Had a small $9 margarita that tasted good, but no value at that price point. Never offered a dessert menu, still not sure if they even have dessert? 
This look like a case of spending a ton of dough on the building, and trying to make it back by cutting corners on the food and alcohol. Probably wont be going back anytime soon.
