Another business across the street that I really wanted to like. The service was friendly.  They even had live music the night we went. But the food.

We had both kinds of salsa. It was okay. Chips were a little greasy but better than being from a bag.  Whatever.  I ordered some kind of taquitos after having no idea what the server was telling me.  Unfortunately, they were just not good. I'm a picky eater, but even +1 had to agree with me.  It had a smokey flavor in the way that your pap's scotch or dog bacon would.. as if they just poured it on. The rice and beans were okay, but no better if I microwaved them myself.
I don't even remember what +1 ate, so it couldn't have been great. We even had churros for dessert (told you I was really trying here!); good, but undercooked. 

After the rave reviews of the Beechview location, you'd think this would do just as well.  I'm hoping this might be that new restaurant trouble, but for now, I'd avoid it.
