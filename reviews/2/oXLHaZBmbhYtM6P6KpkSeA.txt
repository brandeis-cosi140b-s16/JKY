Dissappointed.  So I've gone there a couple, three times.  I have not been impressed each time, but decided to give it another chance, you never know...  Well, now I do.  Ordered the Fajitas Texanas, they were pretty bland even after adding salt and adding plenty of salsa (asked for the hot one, as always).  The kicker for me though, was being charged 60 cents for the extra tortillas.  They gave 3 at a time.  C'mon! Restaurant mark ups?  I get it for the liquor, but the tortillas?  Really?
