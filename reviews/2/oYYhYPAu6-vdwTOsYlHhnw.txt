The girlfriend and I visited Vida last week because of a Mexican food craving that I had. I absolutely love enchiladas, so I figured I couldn't go wrong w/ my order of chicken enchiladas. Boy was I wrong.. No flavor at all and the outside was like gnawing on chewy cardboard. 

Even though I was very displeased with my order, the girlfriend was happy w/ her taco salad so I figure I'd give 2 stars based on her opinion.
