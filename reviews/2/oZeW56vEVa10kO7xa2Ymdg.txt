First time here. I had 3 carne Asada tacos and a side of beans. This place is super pricey!!!! Tacos are $2.50 each and are small. The food was okay, the beans and salsa were the best. Carne asada tacos didn't have too much flavor. The horchata was amazing! Probably the best thing here. Won't be back. It's not worth the money.
