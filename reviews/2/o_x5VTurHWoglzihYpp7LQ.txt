Had a craving for nachos earlier and thought I'd give this place a try. I ate here once before when we had moved to this area 4 years ago...and I thought it was ok, but it was something I forgot to Yelp about.

This time I remembered to Yelp.

I'm going against the grain here (surprise) and am going to say it wasn't all that. The other time I came here it wasn't all that either.

The carne asada on the super nachos was bland. The guac? Bland. The refried beans? I never knew they were refried beans until I looked at them.

I can't believe I'm going to say this...but I think I prefer any of the 'berto's over this place.

Yea, I went there.

The place was clean, the girl who took my order was friendly and the guy who gave me my food was friendly as well. Parking lot could do with a good sweeping and someone could pick up all the debris that's out there.

I'll keep looking for a better place to eat.
