I liked the staff. Very friendly waiters. I also liked that it's open 24 hrs a day. My friend and I went in because it was 1am and it was open so we figured, why not? 

The chips and salsa were good. Very tasty salsa. The actual entrees... that's another story. I ordered the chile relleno meal. It came with rice and beans. It is really DISGUSTING. The batter on the chile is super thick and greasy. I seriously couldn't get past two bites. I felt like throwing up immediately. The rice tasted old. Like it was starting to get a metallic flavor from sitting in the pan too long... that's the best I could describe it. 

I was going to give it just one star, but my friend said her chicken flautas were ok. I definitely  wouldn't go back though.
