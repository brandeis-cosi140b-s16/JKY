After visiting the casino in Maricopa, we were hungry for some Mexican food. So we happened upon two police officers and asked them where the best Mexican restaurant in town was. They told us Plaza Bonita was the best. If this is the best in Maricopa, I feel sorry for you guys. The meal was unremarkable in every way. My beans were so runny they wouldn't even stay on my fork. On a good note, the restaurant is beautiful inside and the chips and salsa were ok. Would I come here again? Nope.
