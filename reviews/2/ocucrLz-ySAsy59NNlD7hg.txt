This place is really trying to be upscale and it just doesn't deliver.  I've been here twice and it's failed to impress me.  Good value and the guacamole made table side is cool, but it's been done and they don't do it any different here...  My friend ordered the chicken fajitas and I thought the quality of the chicken looked a little suspect.  This recent visit was met with sub-par service.  Just nothing wows you at this place, unfortunate.
