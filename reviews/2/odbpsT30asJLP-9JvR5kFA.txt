The only reason why I gave this place 2 stars is because they have a drive thru and when I placed my order on the phone it was ready in 10 minutes. The food is just ok, like you would find at a much cheaper price from a Filibertos. I expected to find something special about their food since their prices were higher then I usually pay, but it wasn't. My kids got the rolled tacos and when I tried one it was bland and greasy. I got the chicken fajita quesadilla, and was very disappointed. The quesadilla was more like a burrito with so much filling that the entire bottom was soggy and in edible. The onions and peppers inside were cut in so many different sizes that some pieces were burnt and some weren't cooked at all. My husband got the taco enchilada plate. The sauce had way too many different flavors going on.  The only part of the meal that was good was the rice. I will it be going back to this place because I can get better food for less money here in chandler. Very disappointed.
