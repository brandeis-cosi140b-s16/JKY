I first tried a Chipotle a few years ago.  I wasn't a fan at all.  So... I figured we should give it another try and this time around it wasn't bad.  It's pretty decent fast food... nothing really special about the place but people seem to love it.  

My one very large complaint about the place. If you are not a fan of cilantro... then your choices become very limited on what you can add to your burritos or plates.  

Cilantro and lime rice
Pico de Gallo(which is to be expected)
Corn and cilantro...

That leaves you with sour cream... cheese...and lettuce to add as your toppings. 

I'm not a fan of cilantro... so the menu really shrank.

All in all.... not bad... better than Taco Bell for sure...
