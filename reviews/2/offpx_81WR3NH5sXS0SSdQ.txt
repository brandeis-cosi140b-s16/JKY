I am being generous with the two star rating for this place.  Ordered a combo that included a beef burrito and cheese enchilada.  The quality of the cheese in the enchilada was so low Taco Bell would be too ashamed to serve that stuff!!! The beef burrito was HUGE, but included way too many green peppers.  Had to get a knife to cut up the massive burrito, but even the quality of their plastic utensils is so low I was surprised the  little knife didn't snap in two.  
As a bonus, the ice machine wasn't working, but the courteous counter worker did get me some ice from the back.  I won't be back to this place ever again.
