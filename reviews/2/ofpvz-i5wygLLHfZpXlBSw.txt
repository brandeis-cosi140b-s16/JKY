The changes to this place within the past 2-3 years have been stark and not encouraging -- I believe they are currently managed by some folks who used to manage Monty's Blue Plate Diner, and while it's understandable that there are management changes over time, I can't help but wonder if this is why my experience there recently was so utterly mediocre.

Let's get down to the nitty gritty:

- A few years back, the variety of tacos was decent and interesting; daikon, achiote tilapia, salmon, etc.  Nowadays, it's down to the minimum and served up (in general) on awful store-bought flour tortillas.  The corn tortillas that were their staple seem to be a thing of the past for the most part.

- I decided to try the "tequila shrimp" taco, and it was a watery, runny mess.  "Runny" is never something you want for a taco.

- Their chips are now the cheapest imaginable, out-of-a-bag generic, cardboard-like chips.  Microwaved for a minute to give the false impression that they're actually made on site (to an idiot, perhaps).  I felt the enamel getting lost with every chip I ate.

- The service was pretty slow -- took us something like a half hour just to get an order of guacamole.  Sorry, were you waiting for the avocados to ripen or something?

When I lived down the street from Tex Tubbs, I gladly went in there once a week or more.  I've since moved away from this location and haven't been in it in quite a while -- I'm sad to see the charm and the modicum of authenticity in their food gone.
