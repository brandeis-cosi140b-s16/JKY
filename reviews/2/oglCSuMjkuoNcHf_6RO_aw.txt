A friend and I went here last night (it was a Friday night). We arrived at 8:30pm and were told it was a 20 minute wait for a table. When we were finally seated (around 9pm) about half the restaurant was empty with multiple empty tables, which I thought was a bit strange seeing as they had not only us, but other people waiting. 

We ordered the tableside guacamole which came with cranberries in it, and was lovely. I prefer the guacamole at The Mission though, because they ask you how spicy you like it and it is more tailored to your preferences, at Barrio Queen, they just put everything in and make it in front of you. We both ordered 3 tacos from the menu and the Paloma cocktail. The cocktail was nice, a little syrupy, and too sweet for my taste but overall not bad. The tacos were very small, but nice. I love spicy food, and so does my friend but we were floored on the carne asada y chile taco. I think it burnt about half my tastes buds out of my mouth and was quite unpleasant. The jalepeno in it had been roasted and none of the seeds had been taken out so it was like eating fire. As someone who never has problems with spicy food this was a massive surprise. The one taco that stood out the most and really impressed me was the chicken and chorizo barrio house special taco. It was truly incredible and given half the chance I would eat about 10.

The one thing that put me off the most, was the ambiance. While the location and decor was nice enough, and somewhat what you expect from a Mexican eatery in Arizona, for the price of the meal I thought the decor was a bit down market. This place lacks sophistication, which is reflected in the patrons who get very drunk and loud, while there are crying babies at the next table. So if thats the kind of mood your in, go for it. But the claims that this place is Mexican fine dining is false.
