Went there for an early dinner today.  I had a baja steak burrito and my daughter had steak nachos, along with two diet cokes.  My burrito was ok.  Megan's nachos were ok.  Neither one was anything special.   The salsa bar was a mess.  They say there are no tomatoes, so all the salsa they had was the green stuff and something else that was black and didn't taste very good.  There were no limes in the salsa bar, and I love limes, so told them.  I was almost done with my meal by the time they finally got them out.  Garbage was completely full, almost spilled stuff on the ground when I was trying to put my stuff away.  Tables were a mess.  But the employees had time to play grabass in the back.  I had a groupon, so got a good deal.  I won't be going back.  I like Fili Bs much better.
