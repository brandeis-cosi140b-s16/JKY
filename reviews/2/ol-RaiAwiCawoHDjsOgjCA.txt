Terrible deep fried ice cream. Diet taco salad was pretty good. The fajita burrito on the menu neglects to warn you about the beans rice onions and peppers. My mother in law said it was OK but nothing spectacular. I might come back for a drink at the bar and for the Chips and salsa but for the food most likely not.
