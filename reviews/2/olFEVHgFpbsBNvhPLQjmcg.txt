Not as good as the former California Taco shop and I should know having just moved here from Chula Vista , California. They used a lot of rice and beans to fill my carna asada buritto. Could not taste any meat probably because it did not have flavor and the meat was such small quanity. Plus the prices went up, people in Pittsburgh do not what a REAL taco shop should be. The lady working my the front counter forgot my order or flan, so she really got a $6 tip. They are also trying to sell Costco bought M&Ms and candy for $1.50............ really ?
