talk about being disappointed, every time i go to vegas i stop by another central american restaurant, i won't even say which one it was for the sake of this review. when i reached said restaurant it was closed for renovations and recommended  la casona bar and grill. excited to try a new place we got in the car and headed here, big mistake. the food is terrible starting with the chips and salsa that they bring out i was surprised they would serve stale chips like that. i also ordered a baliada and a traditinal plate. the baliada was hands down the worst one I've had in my life and thats not me being dramatic, stale tortilla and the filling was not good at all. the traditional plate was ok but i have NEVER been to a central american place that served store bought flour tortillas, the side of "fried cheese" was un edible. wish i would have just gone to in and out and had a burger before heading back to LA.
