Went here for lunch today. The staff was friendly and retaurant was clean. I made a food order to go for co-workers. I ordered the Pancho Villa. Presentation looked good. It tasted decent. My friend also ordered the Pancho Villa and we both commented on how the there was layers of the tortilla. Its like they use extra large tortillas and quadruple wrap them to give a little girth. So if you peel the layers away its really not that big. Every thing tasted ok but didnt blow me away. With Mexican restaurants being a dime a dozen I probally won't be back. Sorry.
