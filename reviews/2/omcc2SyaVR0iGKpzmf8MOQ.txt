Went in to pick up a menu........ No prices on it....no location addresses or phone number on it.  No prices on their website as well. Pease dont tell me prices fluctuate 
From town to town?????

UPDATE: 6/6/14. Just ate at Americas and they finally have menus with prices.
I had the carne asada burrito and my girlfriend had the taco trio.
The fruit on the tacos was a good addition but overall.....just ok.
The tortillas are the same as i buy from the supermarket and their guacamole.....well...it was bright neon green and smooth like soft  serve icecream.
Not sure if its made there or a buy out product. The latter i believe.
I believe the tortillas, chips and guac are all buy out products.
Once again.....ok at best
