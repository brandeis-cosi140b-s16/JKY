My bf had gone to watch a bball game @ PT's and we should have just eaten their half priced pizza there, very good and crispy by the way. Well he ordered a wet burrito, which he said was just ok, nothing to write home about. The chips and salsa were ok. I ordered mole enchiladas. and you tire of the sweet taste after awhile. Mole should have spice, when there is none it tastes, well ... WRONG. I honestly can say I didnt' hate it but I didnt finish my food and let my bf pick apart the rest of it for me. With so many other choices I dont think I'd go there again.  They got nothing on Rubio's or Baja Fresh, and those arent exactly "authentic" either. also as a note, they dont serve menudo. If they did I'd have ordered that... but so far Viva Michoacan is the best one i've tasted in town.
