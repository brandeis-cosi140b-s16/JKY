Not as good as the review makes it seems it's okay but this is just oversized and over priced. I grabbed some chicken nachos let's just I can make better ones at home. But it's good if your not looking for authentic mexican food. My girlfriend grabbed chicken enchiladas and again not the best. Paid a total of 36.78 round up to 37, I should have just gone to an actual restaurant and payed more but better food. At the end I didn't even finish the nachos it was too much and not the best same with the enchiladas. Guacamole is not the best and it's 2 dollars extra.
