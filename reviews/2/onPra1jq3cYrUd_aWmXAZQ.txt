It took me a day to gather my thoughts on this place and write my review.  This is my 2nd visit here, and the first time was a First Friday and it was packed, so I didn't feel I could write an accurate review.

This visit was a Sunday morning when the restaurant had only a dozen or so people dining.  
I just want to start by stating to the servers of the city:  "If you don't like your job, Nevada is an at-will employment state.  You can quit any time you like, and find other employment more suitable for your interest or skill sets."  

On to the food.  The salsa and chips were fresh and tasty.  The guacamole was definitely not very impressive.  Was like creamed avocado dip.  No spice, very little acid, and just left me disappointed.  I enjoyed the ceviche tostada, although it was a little salty.  The red pork tamal was okay.  Overall, this meal was less favorable than a few other chain options for Mexican fare we have available in town.

I think I'll hit a renowned taco shop in the downtown are next time.  Or order my tameles to go.  That seemed to be a trend I saw whilst I was dining.
