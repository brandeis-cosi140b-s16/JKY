First off let me say that up until tonight I was a huge fan of Rubios. I would always order their grilled shrimp tacos or bean and cheese burrito. It always tasted fresh and wasn't greasy. However, tonight I decided to try their new California bowl. I was expecting it to be somewhat similar to Chipolte's burrito bowls. Well . . . the concept was, but in reality it was not even close. The rice was clearly over cooked as it was all mushed together and had no flavor. I assume it is called the California bowl because of the guacamole. However, the amount of guacamole was highly disappointing. Once I mixed all the bowl ingredients together, I couldn't even taste the guacamole which is the best part. I added chicken and again highly disappointed with how much chicken they added. I could barely taste that there was even chicken. Overall, the NEW addition to the menu was a huge disappointment. In the future, Chipolte will be the only place I go for a delicious burrito bowl.

On a side note, I was also disappointed when Rubio's stopped carrying carnita's. They have two strikes against them in my book.
