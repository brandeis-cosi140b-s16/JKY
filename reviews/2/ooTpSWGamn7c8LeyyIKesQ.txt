First, let me say that On The Border is my favorite Mexican restaurant!  My experience with the Mesa OTB was very so, so.  Service was slow.  Food was OK, but not nearly as good as what I'm used to.  I believe I am spoiled as I live very close to the OTB on Bell across from Arrowhead Mall where I can honestly say I have never had a bad meal!
