I personally don't understand why everyone likes this place, probably just the fact that it was on Diners, Drive-in's, and Dives.  I could care less if a place has been on TV or if a famous person has been there, those opinions don't influence me at all.  Anyways, I hate the ordering process, you fill out a piece of paper with what you want and how you want it, confusing if you haven't been there before.  The place is filthy, reminds me of a soup kitchen.  The service isn't bad but they should work on cleaning the place up.  I don't see how anyone can say the quality of the food is good.  Below average Chinese food crossed with below average Mexican food equals garbage if you ask me.
