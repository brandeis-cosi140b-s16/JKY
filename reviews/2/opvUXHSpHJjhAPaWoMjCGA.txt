I used to love Macayo's, but the menu has been redesigned and it's a disaster. Favorites like the green chile burro are no longer available, and the food that is available is in tiny (although nicely-presented) portions that are greasy and not as flavorful as the previous dishes. I understand the desire to freshen things up, and the new decor looks okay, but the food is the reason I used to go and the reason I won't return. From the fact that the restaurant was nearly empty today all through what should have been the lunch rush, and their super-slow servers still had nothing to do, I'm not the only one who feels this way.
