Scratch my last review.  I'd rather give up the clean restrooms after all.  I was really disappointed at my last visit.  And let me tell you, it's hard to disappoint me if I'm having Mexican food.  But the salsa was blah, the green chile was blah, everything was blah.

I really should have considered the dire Mexican food situation in Scottsdale before moving here.  Now not only is my house worth less than my car, but I'm driving into Phoenix to eat anyway!
