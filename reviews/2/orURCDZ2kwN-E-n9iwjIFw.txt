My first time at this location, and if the food weren't actually pretty good, I would have rated it a one.

We visited during a lunch hour on Saturday, and I wouldn't have thought the amount of business justified a waiter taking literally a few minutes to get our drink order. In fact, I think ours was the only table in the section with customers seated. I was tolerant of this initial slowness thinking it would get better from there, but it never did. Every step required an extended wait right up to getting my check. The waiter didn't even check in on us while we were eating. When I got up to go to the bathroom after the check had been presented suddenly the waiter was there to get his money. And this is the ONLY time I've been asked for my ID with my credit card at a restaurant. 

Some might defend that as a necessary and even nice security step given the world we live in today, etc. But if left a bad taste in my mouth. A restaurant shouldn't be doing this. I had just spent over $100 for a dinner and drinks in a far nicer place in Denver, and wasn't asked for an ID.

So overall, a decent place with good food who needs to manage their help a lot better, and stop asking for ID from customers paying with credit cards.
