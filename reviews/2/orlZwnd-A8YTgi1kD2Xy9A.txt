Ordered nachos to go over the phone. I asked for everything on them except meat- rice, beans, lettuce, guacamole, cheese etc. They asked if I wanted anything else on it and even read the order back to me. I picked it up, got home and it was a plate of chips with cheese and lettuce on top. And sour cream on the side. Seriously? Very disappointing.
