Had dinner there last night around 730pm. The food was great! The combo nachos are some of the best I have ever had. The Carmita enchilada plate was great. 

The concerns are around the service. The staff seemed to either be untrained or understaffed to care about the guests. We got our first drinks then were never approved again until after the dinner was done. Sadly we will not return based on the service level provided. I hope someone reads and follows up with their team on this. The food is too good for you all to lose guests because of staffing.
