For the past few weeks, I have been on something of a "taco tour" of north central Phoenix. Santos Lucha Libre earned itself a stop on account of its (a) being listed as one of the highest-rated restaurants in Phoenix and (b) only being ten minutes away from work.

I'm not sure what I was expecting other than just great tasting, authentic Mexican street food. What I was certainly not expecting was a setup basically like Chipotle, where you tell the person behind the counter which meats you want, what you want on the tacos, etc. If you think this is how food should be prepared, you're wrong. Sorry, but you're just wrong.

Anyways, resigned to the fact that I would be forced to make game time decisions about whether I wanted lettuce, onions, sour cream, and/or guacamole, I ended up getting a few different varieties of meat on my street tacos. 

Now, I'm not going to pretend that this was a bad meal. Was it disgusting? Nope. It was just average. The meat was average, the tortillas were average, the salsa bar was average... Everything was average. But it was presented in a way that makes white people who like the slop they serve at Chipotle think they're onto something special. It's like a better Chipotle, and that's not a compliment.

If you're offering authentic Mexican food, there should be more meat options besides boring beef, chicken, and pork. Where's the lengua and chorizo? If you want hole-in-the-wall food, go to a real hole-in-the-wall... And if you want fancy tacos, there are much better places to get fancy tacos.

There's really just no reason to eat here. Not when there are countless hole-in-the-wall Mexican restaurants in this part of town. Not when it's just a block down the street from Los Reyes de la Torta. Not when I have to drive right by the far superior Paquime to get there.
