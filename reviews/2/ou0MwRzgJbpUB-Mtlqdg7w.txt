Steel Cactus gets two stars for their rooftop deck.  It's a nice place to hang out on warm days.  I've gotten food here numerous times and have had several bad experiences with food of questionable freshness, so now I basically just go for drinks from time to time.  With that being said I find their margaritas to be overpriced for what they are, even on happy hour special.  Their other mixed drinks are decent and are about 7 bucks.  Their happy hour deals on wine and beer are okay, but the selection marginal.  All in all, I go back because of the rooftop deck, and in truth, they probably have one of the best set-ups in Shadyside to kick back and meet up with friends.  If only the food/drinks matched the atmosphere.
