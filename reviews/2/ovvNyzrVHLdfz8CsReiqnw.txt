I really hate to rag on the corner of the Valley where I grew up, but if Salsa Cabana were located in West Mesa, Tempe, or Phoenix, I bet it'd have 2 or 2.5 stars. I've eaten tons of Mexican food in my life. I like both Americanized tex-mex and authentic Mexican (though I prefer authentic). This is neither. It's food at a weird way-station in between. I ordered two fish tacos, one shrimp street taco, and one steak streak street taco. Every one of the tacos had far too much in the way of toppings with an extremely meager serving of the base meat. Honestly, the meat probably made up 15-20% of the volume of each taco's filling. The meats were not at all flavorful (which is probably why they were smothered in toppings). There was way too much of the creamy sauce on the fish tacos and they were loaded with "pico de gallo" (which wasn't really pico, it was basically just chopped tomatoes. I'm not the type of yelper that knocks a place down to 1 star because the cashier didn't smile at me. I'm focused on the food. And the food here was, sadly, not good.
