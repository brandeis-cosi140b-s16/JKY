I really wanted this place to be awesome because it is so close to my house and right next to where I grocery shop. At first I was super excited walking in it had that los angelos mexican feel with the orange and yellow colors and huge menu board. I ordered a Carne asada burrito and it was one of the biggest let downs of my life burned meat the rice was bland and the beans were ok at best. To make it even worse I look up to see that the meat I was eating came from a bucket under the counter! This is sanitation 101 you don't do that ever! Needless to day I will just make the extra drive to rosaritas beach where the food is much better and cleaner it costs a bit more but well worth it.
