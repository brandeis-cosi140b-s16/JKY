Margaritas were ok, they had a different level of booze each time. The happy hour price for a house marg. was what I would normally pay for non-happy hour anywhere else. The location is pretty sketch. The service is pretty non-existent. Our server got to us pretty soon after we sat down, so I figured the other reviews had sparked some change in them, but I soon found out this was not the case. It took 10+ minutes to get drinks that were ordered. One drink too 20+ minutes. It took 30 minutes for our server to run our checks. .They were not busy at all, the place is HUGE and there were maybe 20 tables with at least 7 servers that I saw. The chip buffet was just weird, the salsa was nice and cold, but the chips tasted like vinegar. The only thing they gave you to put chips on was a small side plate, kind of difficult to put chips on.
