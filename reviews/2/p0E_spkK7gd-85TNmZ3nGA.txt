The food was like any other chipotle, which is good, but the service at this location was not good. The wait in the relatively short line was really long, and the ingredients were carelessly thrown together. When we got up to the register to pay we had to wait for the girl to come and take our money while she was chatting with another coworker who appeared to be off duty. Then when she finally came up to us she spoke with an attitude as if we were being really slow and holding up the line. Not a good customer service experience for sure.
