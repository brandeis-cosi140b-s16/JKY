In my mind, there is one reason to not instantly veto any trip to Pedro's: the free fresh tortillas for the table.

There's not really a reason to go to Pedro's, but I'm actually confident in my ability to find something edible on the menu now after a recent trip. I had a burrito (uuuh...top right column) that was reasonably decent (surprisingly so, actually) keeping in mind my rock bottom expectations.
