I went to this restaurant because of the great reviews that were written by people that don't have a clue of what good food is. The place was empty for the 2 1/2 hours while we were there and that was on a Saturday night at dinner time, that should have told me something, We ordered a dozen of the worse tasting oysters that I have ever eaten, no flavor, oh excuse me they did have flavor only because I squeezed on lemon juice and hot sauce. Those two condiments probably saved me from dying of food poisoning. I ordered the whole  fried red snapper and when it was brought to my table it looked as if the filets were cut off to make another dish, but it wasn't for any customers, probably the cook wanna be in the kitchen. The fish was anorectic looking and burned to the bone. I was a knuckle head for not sending it back. The shrimp dishes that we smothered in cheese sauce and bubbling was impressive but tasteless just as the rest of the food. Lousy food, great bargin, NO MAS !!!!
