Tonight was our first food truck experience. We saw the ad for the event at Ellis Island tonight with 3 food trucks and thought this was our chance to see what all the fuss was about. Sadly, we could have skipped it. The only redeeming item we had was the hamburger from Sloppi Jo, which was tasty. The chicken tacos were horrible and we only ate two bites, the mac and cheese not much better. 
I thought the deal was the food trucks are gourmet, not the case tonight. The wait to get your food was also very lengthy, thinking we should have went to a brick & mortar.
