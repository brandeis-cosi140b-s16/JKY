I've never been to a Mexican restaurant that actually charged for the chips and salsa. I guess it would be ok if the chips and salsa were the best chips and salsa I've ever eaten, but the chips did not taste homemade and they were cold. $3 for cold store bought chips and salsa? Come on!

I felt the food was overpriced and it took a long time to come out of the kitchen, despite almost nobody else dining in the restaurant. The menu is small for a Mexican restaurant and the inside dining room is very poorly lit, so it's very difficult to read the menu. 

My friend and I both had fajitas (I had steak and she had chicken) and we both enjoyed the food. Not the best fajitas I've ever eaten, but still pretty good. 

If they were to drop their prices by 20-30% and stop charging for chips and salsa, then I'd consider going back but until then, I'll fill my craving for Mexican food somewhere else.
