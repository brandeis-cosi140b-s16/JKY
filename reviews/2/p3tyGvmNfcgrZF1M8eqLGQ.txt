i did not like this place. the only thing i think it had going for it was the red salsa at the salsa bar. i ordered a plate of adobada and that shit was BURNT. i'm not saying it was well done, that would have been fine. what i'm saying is, i didn't have one bite that didn't taste like charred bullshit. i had to drown my shit in salsa. they did give me tons of onions and cilantro as if to say "here, we know we messed up. put this all over your food to make it better". the rice was flavorless and mushy. the beans tasted old and had hard spots in them. bummed out. i've never trashed a place in a review before, it doesn't feel good.
