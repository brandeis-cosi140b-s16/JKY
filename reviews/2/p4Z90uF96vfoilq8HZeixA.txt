Okay, so hard to believe I am the FTR of this Garcia's location since it has been here for eon's (and looks like it) and is still one of the staple restaurants around the Metro Center area that hasn't closed down or changed. 

The food is the same as it has been for the last 15+ years. Decent, not great and sadly, the shredded beef in the taco I had tasted like it was boiled without any flavors or seasoning. 

For those of you reading this review who have never been to Phoenix (Arizona at all in fact) you may not be aware of the greasy deliciousness called a cheese crisp. This is seriously where it is at pretty much all over the Valley. Garcia's does make a fine cheese crisp and for that, I am still grateful and willing to go. 

The one good thing I can say is the restaurant still seems to have a hopping bar area with live music a few nights a week. Good for the happy hour crowd, but since I was there with my mom and a cousin for lunch, it didn't do anything for me knowing this. 

Word of warning to ladies who need to potty while in the restaurant area...The bathroom is as old as the rest of the place. One toilet so if you drink a lot, be prepared to wait your turn.
