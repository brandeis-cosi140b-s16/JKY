My burrito was given to someone else and I caught the mistake. Then our chips were not cooked so we asked for done ones and the manager comes back with a smart alec answer telling his cooks we want them extra crispy. No buddy, we just don't want them raw!!! The drive to Stephanie is world it. When you get the right food though it is very good.
