I was not impressed with this place. I ordered a 2 taco combo one carne asada and one pollo asado. The taco shells were thick and hard. The meat was bland. I had to put lots of sauce on it to give it some spice. Also, I ordered tortilla chips and a drink. My total was $11.48. I could've gone to a nice sit down restaurant and received something that tasted much better for what I paid. Next time I will drive the extra 3 miles to go to chipotle when I'm craving tacos.
