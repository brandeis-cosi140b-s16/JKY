Went with a friend and my sister for early dinner, reasonable prices for happy hour on apps and drinks!
Food was mediocre nothing special and can't really compete with more authentic mexican joints in the area.
Was a mexican restaurant posing as a sports bar is how I'd describe it.
Basically just went because we had a groupon NOW deal, wont be back again.
