The food is OK but I prefer Garcias.  The shredded beef on the tacos was bland and the beans had a weird taste. The queso was the best part of the meal but it was runny. Maybe they were having an off day but I don't intend to return.  On a side note, the apple crisp was great but that's not what I go to a mexican joint for.
