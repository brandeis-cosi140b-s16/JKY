I'm not much of a fan for this place. I like the idea of eating at buffets and not getting up to get your food, but the food here is just not up to par with me. I didn't even get another plate after my first; however, I found myself just eating all the sweet stuff. =T Sugar makes things better, right? LoL!
I do like one thing from this place (but it's not enough to make me want to come back here again) and that's their sopaipillas; however, I feel like it used to be better before because they actually put stuff on it, but when I came here, they served it plain. I had to drench it with chocolate syrup. 
I was really surprised that it cost about $20 for two people with drinks included...I know I can spend my $20 else where and be satisfied completely. Sorry...
