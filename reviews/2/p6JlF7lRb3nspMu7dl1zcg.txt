Not very good, and overpriced. I went in for lunch, and waited at the counter a few minutes before the cashier even acknowledged me. When she finally did, it was strictly business, and there was no greeting. I planned on getting a carne asada or canitas plate, but they were listed as $11 and $12. No way am I paying that much when I could get the same thing elsewhere for closer to $8. I got the the three street taco plate instead with carnitas. The tacos were good, but nothing special. The rice was good too, but definitely came out of an instant rice bag. The beans were awful. They were almost certainly the dehydrated type that you just add water to. Why am I paying $8, for a small amount of food, when 2/3 of it was instant mixes? Either the price needs to go down to reflect the quality, or the items need to be made from scratch and worthy of the high prices. The customer service definitely needs work too.
