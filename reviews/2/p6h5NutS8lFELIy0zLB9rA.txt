My wife and I got a Groupon for here,and were hoping for the best,since we live so close,it would be great to find another place to frequent.We came a little after lunchtime on a weekday,and there were only a few tables occupied,but finding a table that wasnt still dirty was a challenge.The waitress was very friendly and helpful.First came the chips and salsa.The chips were cold and stale,and the green salsa didnt have much flavor.The red salsa wasnt much better,and it came in a ketchup squeeze bottle,one of my new pet peeves at some Mexican restaurants.
           When the food came out,it was hot and very attractive.We both had a platter with a Cheese Enchilada and a shredded beef Taco.The beans were good,but the rice was very bland.The Enchilada was bland,also.The taco shell was one of those preformed ones like you get at Taco Bell or in a box from Old El Paso.The meat was flavorless and tough.
            If the food was decent,we could overlook the messy dining room.But with two strikes against it,I dont think we will be coming back,Groupon or no Groupon.
