The food is good but watch out if you use your credit/debit card! I'm a regular, weekly customer and they have always been great but on 11/30, this was NOT the case! The cashier charged me multiple times thinking it did not go through even though the device said, Approved. I asked him if I was going to be charged multiple times and he said no, it didn't go through, the receipt didn't print. The next day I noticed multiple charges (including one at $107.36 when the charge was supposed to be $10.76) and I called and spoke with the manager. He talked with his merchant services, said I'd be refunded in 48 hours. It never happened! I had to call my bank to file fraudulent charges! Got the 3 refunds from my bank on 12/9, but had to file another fraudulent charge against Baja for a charge on 12/8 because I had not been there to purchase food since 11/30. Have to wait for my bank to research this because that's 2 claims against Baja. I notified the manager of this 12/8 and he notified his merchant services (Wells Fargo) and they are not doing anything about it! I told the manager at Baja that I filed a complaint on the BBB and would write a bad review on Yelp. He said he tried to help me. It's true, he did make an effort, but it's not enough to say "I tried" when I am still waiting to be refunded! I told him to tell the owner that he needs to get involved to protect Baja customers from their merchant services! Like I said, great food, but be careful when using your credit/debit card!!! I'd hate to see anyone else go through my nightmare!!! I'd recommend Rubios, Faustos, Roberto's, Don TorTaco.....never had problems there.
