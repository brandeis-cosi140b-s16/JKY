As much as I've come to love their burritos, I'm giving up on Burrito Drive. I've tried over the summer to keep my enthusiasm but I'm not trying any more.

The only good thing about this place is the food.  The bad things, listed here, have caused me to walk away: (1) slowness of service, (2) late deliver times, and (3) inaccuracy of the orders.

(1) If I place an order over the phone to pick up at your location, don't tell me to be there in 10 minutes when, 10 minutes later, you haven't even started on my order.  Also, don't say, "No, it will be ready in 10 minutes" when I offer to be there in 15 or 20 minutes.

(2) If you tell me that the order will be delivered in 30 to 50 minutes, don't show up in an hour.

(3) If I order chips and salsa, bring me the damn salsa.
