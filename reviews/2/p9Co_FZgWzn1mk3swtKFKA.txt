Hmmm. Not sure about this place. Visited once. Food was decent, but not real hot (temperature.) More authentic Mexican than Taco Bell. Not the cleanest place. Friendly service. I would not be afraid to try it again, but it did not leave a lasting impression. Oh, and they have large portions. I left stuffed.
