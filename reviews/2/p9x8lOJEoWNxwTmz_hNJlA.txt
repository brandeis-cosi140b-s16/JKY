America's Taco Shop make some of the best meat available at a mexican food restaurant... Having said that, with the surprisingly small the portions combined with how steep the prices are, it's better to go somewhere else.

My burrito was about as thick as a broom handle and my wife's quesadilla had almost no cheese at all in it. Spent too much for not enough!
