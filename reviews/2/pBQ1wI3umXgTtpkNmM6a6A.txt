2.5 stars
It's one of those hole in the walls where you feel really bad about yourself after. 1) The food reminds you how fat you are and 2) the flies in the restaurant has probably touched your food already and you know that it's a fact that flies like to touch poop too. 

I tried the chicken torta at this site and it was edible. The sandwich consisted of boiled chicken and a lot of creamy stuff sandwiched between two loaves of Mexican (?) bread. It's one of those things I probably won't recommend to my friends but I'd secretly eat it when I'm alone.

The additional 0.5 stars is for their spicy pickled carrots. Because of its crispy and crunchy nature, it seemed like a fresh batch. These pickles definitely made the chicken torta more edible. Actually, it was like I was eating pickled carrots with a side of chicken torta! Haha!
