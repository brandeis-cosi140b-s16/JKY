Well where to start this is the 4th time I've been to this restaurant and each time something new (and worse) is experienced.  We were the 1st table to be seated at 6:15 PM on a weekday "so that tells a story".  The food is usually pretty good (very bland) for mex taste though.  The salsa is super mild (like diced tomatoes) but I guess that's better than choking hot.
They serve in a condiment size bowl (we had 4 at our table) and had to ask at least 6 times for refills.  Chips very hard but ok, served in a wicker basket also very small (we had to have refills at least 4 times), oh !! did I mention we also had to ask for refillls.

The 2 waiters never did anything refills, clean off dirty dishes or ask if wanted more coke refills at any time. " we had to ask for them". BAD especially when it wasn't busy AT ALL !!  We asked for sour cream (1 dollup) which cost $1 (wow can you spare it).  The cheese crisp was cool not hot and definitely not crispy..Just like we got melted cheese no tortilla base at all !!.

Unfortuntaley, we would like to recommend (nice decor and food itself was
decent but the service NOT) the far SE Valley needs this type of clean and decor for mexican dining.  To many fast food type going up all the time.
But, we all know unless they spiff up the service they will always have a empty dining room.
