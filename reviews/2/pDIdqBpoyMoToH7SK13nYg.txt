Went to try El Pollo Loco for the first time. This is a new location in a building that used to be a Wienerschnitzel and then Costa Vida. It was very busy and while standing in line one customer kept passing in front of me going to and from the salsa bar, which was annoying. When we got up to the counter I asked the cashier what the chicken burrito has in it. She said "Which one?" I said, "The regular one." "Classic?" "Yes." Thought that was pretty clear. She started to say creamy cilantro and then corrected herself, "pico de gallo" and then named a couple other ingredients. She didn't seem too confident, which had me a little concerned. Didn't want to end up with anything green on my burrito. I ordered that meal (with chips and a drink) and asked for no pico. She seemed somewhat inexperienced entering our order on the register.
When we got our food, I cut open the burrito to verify its contents. Rice, beans, chicken, and cheese. No pico. That's good. Got some mild salsa from the salsa bar. It was very watery and had almost no flavor. The pico was just as watery but with larger chunks. Tried the fire roasted salsa which had the most flavor but I didn't care for the thick consistency. So I mixed the mild with the fire roasted. Better. The chips were lousy. Cold and... not stale, but almost a burnt taste. My friend ordered a small mac & cheese and fries so we could both try them. The mac & cheese was identical to KFC. The fries were most akin to Sonic's. Nothing special. And the burrito was fine.
For my friend's meal, he did get the guac on the side as he requested, but they forgot to leave the pico off his quesadilla. The people kept coming in... there was a continuous line. I guess people like it? I will comment that the salsa bar was difficult to access because it's small and people were always getting salsa. I wasn't impressed by any means, but I would go back. I want to try the desserts (churros and cheesecake chimi).
