First, I came here with a coupon from one of those entertainment books my daughter's school sells.  Many items were excluded including the lunch specials and the menudo.  Apparently, to be truly Mexican you have to enjoy eating a cow's stomach in soup -- menudo.  So Eli M. and I vowed to return one day.  Ah, yes, I am not even a little Mexican, but suffer from a proclivity to try unusual foods others turn up their noses at.  Enter Groupon.

Having purchased a Groupon that excluded the lunch specials, but not the menudo, Eli M. and I, with some friends in tow, made our return.  I told Eli M. that menudo costing less than $7 seemed a little dubious given the extensive perpetuation process he described, but we didn't let a little thing like that deter us. As the menudo was cheaply priced, I also ordered a chorizo burrito a la carte.  I was trying to max out the Groupon, and soup, regardless of the contents, didn't seem that filling.  Eli M. doesn't eat much and was satisfied with just a medium sized bowl of menudo. In terms of taste however, he said that it was okay.  He said it was too greasy, which is what our friends also said of their food.  Moreover, they have Pepsi instead of Coke.  And the location is a bit out off the quick lunch radius.  So, it looks like Eli M. and I will max out at two visits to Susie's.  Thanks for the menudo.
