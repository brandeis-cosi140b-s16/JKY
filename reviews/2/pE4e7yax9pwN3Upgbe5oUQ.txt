Let me start by saying I am a business owner myself, I own 2 bars & 1 is a full pub with food!! So I understand the food service industry very well! 

Anyways, we Just stopped to get coffee after visiting the mob museum. My son ordered the taco fries, & I got a parfait & coffee. I enjoyed mine. But when my sons food came out..... It looked like bad hotdog stand food! The portion was $8 & wasn't very big. But the worst part was they were basically cheesy fries drenched with soggy slimy onions.

He's usually easy to please, although I wouldn't have even wanted to taste 1 French fry.....  I guess if you like cheap greasy food, you'd be happy!! 

He is only 15 & was compelled to ask for an alternative. They did allow him to get a refund & reorder, so that's something! Although the refund took 15/20 minutes lol

Oh & their sour cream is RANCH! FYI
