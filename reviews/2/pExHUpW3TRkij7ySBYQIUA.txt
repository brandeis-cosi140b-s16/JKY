Not that many choices for food in Florence, but we picked the wrong restaurant. This is basically one of those 24 hour Mexican joints, but it also features a dining room. So, it was like a Filberto's decided to offer waitress service. I could tell because it felt like they dumped 15 of those to-go cups of watery salsa into a bowl and there is your salsa for the decent chips. The guac was bright and shiny and lacking anything that resembled avocado. The white meat chicken in my green salsa enchilada's was tough and hard to swallow and the charro beans had a lot of strange ingredients floating around in a soupy kind of mess. Other people's entrees all looked good, but all were sub par or maybe we just needed a few drinks to make this drive through food edible again. I guess if you live in Florence (which is an ugly town) this is the best you can get.
