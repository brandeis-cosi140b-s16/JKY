Pretty bad food but a nice ambiance sitting outside. Standard chips and salsa to start: chips overly greasy, salsa with no "kick" (and very little flavor besides pureed tomatoes.) We both ordered tacos: fish, and chicken. Chicken tacos come in corn tortillas: a little healthier was my goal but no: the tortillas were brushed in oil before being used to form my tacos so picking them up was more of a greasy mess. Also absolutely loaded with cheese and very little meat. My wife had the fish version. Deep fried tilapia in flour tortillas. Decent tasting, but again, very greasy. Standard sides of refried beans and rice came with both. 

A nice day drove us to this place; a margarita outside sounded appealing, unfortunately we should have stuck with the drinks and no lunch.
