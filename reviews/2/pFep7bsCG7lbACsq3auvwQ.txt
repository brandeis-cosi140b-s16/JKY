You know, I gave this place another try and I don't think I'll be going back.  My burrito was greasy in a not-so-good way, which should not have been the case considering there was nothing in there that should've caused this.

As much as I'd like to give these guys a chance to change my mind again, I don't think I can do it - mainly because there is no pride in keeping the dining area tidy.  Its the least a burrito joint with a 15x15 dining area can do.
