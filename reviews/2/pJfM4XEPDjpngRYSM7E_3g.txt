We were excited to go here since some friends had recommended it. It wasn't nearly as good as they were saying. We got a bean and cheese burrito and the breakfast burrito. Both were really bland and the breakfast burrito was $9...seemed over priced. Probably won't be returning here. The food wasn't bad but it was unimpressive overall. If you're looking for good Mexican, taco y taco is WAY better.
