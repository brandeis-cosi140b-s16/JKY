Disappointing and ridicules expensive for value received. Arrived at 6:00 informed we were there for Happy Hour until 6:30 advised Margaritas were $3.00 off during happy hour. Placed our order for two Margaritas requested an Avion Tequila waitress did not indicate the Tequila request would void the Happy Hour pricing.  The drinks were so small it literally took seconds to finish. The glasses are so small 8oz max once filled with ice the volume of drink in less than 4oz. ordered two more prior to 6:30 because its Happy Hour what the heck. Ordered Grilled Fish Tacos and Shrimp Tacos. Rice is Uncle Bens white rice no flavor. Taco's were OKAY! Not great just okay. The salsa frankly is the best part of the entire meal. When the bill comes imagine our shock when our Happy Hour Drinks cost $64.00 that right $14.00 each plus $2.00 each for the named Tequila. Thats $16.00 per drink. Total dinner cost $101.00 When I asked waitress she says yea gee sorry I didn't know that until the bill printed out sorry..... Avoid this place ripoff.... food is so so drinks are small and way to costly for what is received. Predict they will not survive.
