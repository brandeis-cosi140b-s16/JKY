Mediocre food that took well over 30 minutes to get. I wasn't the only one that night. Most people left pretty pissed. Maybe it was an off night, but I felt like I've had way better food from Chipotle and some chain restaurants for the same price and in a reasonable time frame.  Skip this place and keep looking!
