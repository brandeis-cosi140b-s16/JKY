I have always been curious about this restaurant when in the Charlitte airport. I ordered chips and guacamole. Since that is the only thing that I ordered (I love guacamole ), I was highly disappointed in the flavor of it at this restaurant. It didn't seem old, it just didn't taste good at all. Their chips aren't top ranking either, so I wouldn't recommend chips and salsa. The service was good.
