Not impressed.  The staff was not motivated and the food was very, very average.  We had the green corn tamales and a wet burrito.  the green corn tamales were actually decent but pass on the wet burrito.  The worst part for me was that the refried beans were extremely runny.  Its definitely a hole in the wall, and i thought a little run down, but its gotten decent reviews from others.  so i'm willing to say we didn't do good on our food choices.  So good luck with yours (but with so many delicious mexican food options in the valley, why go here?
