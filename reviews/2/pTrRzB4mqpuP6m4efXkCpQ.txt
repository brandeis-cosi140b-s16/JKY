The last 2 times we've been here the food wasn't as good as when it first opened. We stopped in for dinner last weekend after not having been here since our last subpar experience 6 months ago, but the food was the same. It just doesn't taste as good as it used to, but I can't put my finger on exactly what the difference is. The salsa verde isn't nearly as good, though it used to be my favorite salsa. My husband ordered the chicken fajitas and was not satisfied. He asked me, "How do you screw up fajitas?" My daughter ordered a burrito with red enchilada sauce on it and she complained that the sauce was sweet and ruined her burrito. Next time I have a hankering for Mexican food I will keep driving.
