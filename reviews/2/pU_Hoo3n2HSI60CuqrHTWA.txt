You would expect a place called Old Tortilla Factory to deliver the best tortilla...as yelp would say on a 2-star, "Meh, I have experienced better."  The chips that we got made from the tortilla was cold to start off with.  They gave us a tortilla separately with a cheese butter.  That was pretty decent, but when it came to my red enchiladas, I was not very pleased.  The red sauce on the red enchilada sauce tasted like very bitter vinegar.  I have tried enchiladas from many establishments throughout my life, and this has to be THE WORST.  

What saves this from a 1-star performance was pretty decent margaritas.  I may have to come back here to try something else, but it may be a very long time.
