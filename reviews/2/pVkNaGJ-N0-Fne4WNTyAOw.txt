I came in on my lunch break and customer service was good. I ordered my food and went down the line but when I got to the cash register I noticed the girl behind the counter clearly had full blown pink eye. I work in childcare and know exactly what it looks like and this was not just a little irritation. Pink eye is HIGHLY contagious and she should have been sent home immediately when her supervisor saw her even if they were under staffed. That was just a complete turn off for me. Honestly I wasn't hungry after that but from the looks of my food I wasn't impressed anyway. Should have gone to Qdoba.
