Yeah... Taco Migo is no friend of mine. I've tried this place and WAS NOT impressed to say the least. In a town full of taco shops you need to step outside the box. The food was not greatest, the burritos were small with soggy tortillas. For the same price I could've got a couple of burritos at Filibertos. The inside of the building, on the other hand, is very nice. The order takers were not very friendly and borderline condescending, like Im suppose to know whats in the burritos already. I definitely did NOT expect fries.  Yeah, dont waste your time or money.
