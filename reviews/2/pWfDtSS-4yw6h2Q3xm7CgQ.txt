I have been told by several friends that I should try this place. I love Mexican food, do I was really exited.  However, after eating here I can say...If you like processed low quality ingredients... This is your restaurant. I believe all their good has either been frozen or comes in a bag. I know you got to keep your food costs down, but c 'mon.  My wife couldn't finish her food and she only ordered 1 taco. Their chips and guac isn't even made with real avocados. It's made from a pulps bag that you squeeze out. No bueno!
