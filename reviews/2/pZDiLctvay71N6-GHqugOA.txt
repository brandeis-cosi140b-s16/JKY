the service was fast & friendly, the place had plenty of seating & 2 flat screen tv's and a small salsa bar . the menu was a little limited. we were fully expecting this place to have fried quesidillas & tacos and stuff since that seems to be the trademark of taco shops in santa cruz,ca where we visit every summer. the tacos were the same 2 bites tacos everywhere in town for $0.99-$1.29 but here they wanted $2.00 and the meat was tender & spicy but the cilantro was so dry i could smoke it, the salsa bar was empty and offered no carrots,radishes or jalapenos just salsas & cilantro mix and pico de gallo which was a little dry too. overall the food was decent but overpriced,some of the enormous burritos people were eating looked real good. they did provide everyone a bag or basket of tortilla chip s but they were way burned and not salted. they did have coca-cola in a glass 16 oz bottle.
