The interesting things about Frank & Lupe's are the name and the decor but other than that nothing else really stood out. Oh except for the chips, great chips, but a restaurant can not only be about chips. The food was mediocre I didn't even finish my enchiladas which is rare for me didn't find it was worth the calories. Might be a cool place for just drinks and app's but certainly not dinner.
