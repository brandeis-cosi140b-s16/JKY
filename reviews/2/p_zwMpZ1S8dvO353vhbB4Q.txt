It's shameful how "downhill" this place has gone.  I used to be a huge fan when the Sirrine's owned it.  I'll stick to Rancho de Tia Rosa (which IS owned by the Sirrine's) next time.  

The service was PAINFULLY slow.   Now, I could understand that years ago when I used to go and it took 45 minutes to an hour just to get a table.  But when only 4 or 5 tables are filled there's NO EXCUSE for poor service.  

The salsas used to be SO MUCH BETTER and more flavorful.  They are a hint of their former selves.  The salsa verde - previously a stand-out in the green salsa category - is mediocre at best... and that's a tremendous compliment.  Oddly enough -the chips are still some of the best I've ever, ever, ever had.  

The food - like the salsas - is a shadow of its former self.  It lacks the succulence, the flavor, and the wow-factor it had when Dennis Sirrine was calling the shots.  It's bland, slightly dry and just not there anymore.  What was equally disappointing is they've replaced their iced tea (something used to drive across town for) to a horrible concentrate.  Blech.  

Considering this place used to be packed to the gills on a Tuesday afternoon at 2pm and now you can easily walk in on Friday at dinner time and have your pick of tables, the restaurant needs to recognize the issue and DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.  They absolutely cannot go on like this.
