The red salsa and chips were good, the green salsa was way too sweet for my taste.  I ordered the seafood tacos and it came with rice OR beans, not both which I thought was odd.  I ordered the beans, which were quite tasty.  Regarding the seafood tacos, the shrimp themselves were good, nice a large, but overall the shrimp taco was quite sweet with the pinapple salsa that was on it.  The fish tacos were just okay.  

Overall I think this restaurant is very Disney-esque with its theme and caters to the local crowd (bland) and is not very authentic.  I will stick to Los Dos Molinos or Blue Adobe.
