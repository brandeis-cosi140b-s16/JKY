Good music,  but place was kinda empty.  They handed me a buy 1 get 1 drink free coupon when we entered.  We ordered a margarita and a bud lite. 30 bucks wow,  and one drink was free. I would expect at that price maybe some chips and salsa but nothing.  I had to go to the bar to order no waitress in site.  Much better places to go in Vegas
