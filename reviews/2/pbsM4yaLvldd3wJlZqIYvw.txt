Ugh, what a waste.  I know that this place is beloved by many, but really and truly this is straight up, flavorless Mexican chain food with some hatch chilies arbitrarily thrown in at times.  It's a total study in mediocrity, from the bland salsa to the weak margaritas.  Tacos, enchiladas, burritos all left me snoozing.  They get a star for their commemorative mugs (hilarious!) and another for their exceptionally wonderful servers (very sweet and attentive) but that's where it ends.  I can't believe this was the place that the President ate at when he came to visit - I'm joining the throngs of people in the valley that swear against this place.  Like Tim Meadows in Dewey Cox "You don't want no part of this!"
