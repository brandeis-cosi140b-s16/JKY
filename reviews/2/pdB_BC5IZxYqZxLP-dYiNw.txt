I hate that this is the closest location to my house. I love Chipotle, since it's easy to cobble together a pretty healthy meal. First, the parking situation leaves a lot (of spaces) to be desired. Second, this location seems to always be overstaffed, but very inefficient. The last couple of times I've gone, there's been an employee in between the food assemblers and the cashier whose only functions seem to be greeting people who walk in the door and making sure all the paper bags are folded before handing them to the customer. She creates an unnecessary delay between ordering food and said food making its way to my belly. Third, they seem to always be out of something. Last time, it was chicken. How they didn't have another batch of chicken ready to go, I have no idea. The way they dealt with the problem was inefficient, as per usual.

I think I'm about ready to drive the same distance in the other direction to Qdoba.
