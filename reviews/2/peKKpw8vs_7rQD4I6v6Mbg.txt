I so wanted to like this place, but the service and food were both disappointing. After being seated we were served chips & salsa. The chips were stale & the salsa looked liked a soup, too runny for my liking. I requested new chips & they were just as bad as the first. As for our entrees, we had quesadillas & shrimp and chicken fajitas. The chicken in the quesadilla was non-existent and the fajita chicken tasted like they used taco seasoning out of a package. The rice and beans were the best part of the meal.
As for the service, horrible. I know it was Friday night, but we could not did our server & when he did show up seemed very rude & rushed.
