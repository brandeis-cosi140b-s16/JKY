Bad service. I placed an over the phone order, and the guy was rushing me. Then when I get my order it wasn't close to what I ordered. Then I ordered 2 soft drinks, and he only charged me for one, and then he wanted to charge my card for just one drink and pay the fee. Absolutely non professional and Very disorganized.
