We eat out 3x per week and I can't remember the last time we weren't satisfied with our meals. The house margaritas tasted like just sweet and sour mix so we got dos exis drafts next.  The fish in my fish tacos was grilled so much it was as dry as jerky. The rice was super dry as well. We had eaten here once before and it was fine. Our server, Ryan, was a nice kid and a good server. I guess Macayos is a crap shoot. Good luck.
