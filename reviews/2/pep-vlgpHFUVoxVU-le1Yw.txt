I wasn't expecting anything incredible from this place. But I feel like you'd have to make an effort to have bad Mexican food. It was pretty bad. Well, more like just fast food. I had a beef taco and cheese enchilada with rice & beans. Taco was pretty greasy and the cheese enchilada had completely unmelted cheese inside of it. Service was bad and they were mid-cleaning everything when we came in to eat. Which was 2pm on a Saturday. I don't want to see that! Yuck..
