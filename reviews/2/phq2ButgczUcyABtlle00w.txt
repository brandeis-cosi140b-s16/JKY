Posted to La Comida's Facebook Page by me after a terrible bout of food poisoning. Will update if I receive a response. 


Hi, let me preface this by saying there are a lot of things I truly enjoy about your restaurant. The margaritas are divine, the chips and salsa are incredible and the service exquisite. I had eaten here once already and couldn't wait to come back. A friend of mine had informed me of a certain hairy situation that occurred while she was eating here. Despite this, I wanted more of your delicious tacos. I came in Saturday night and had the carnitas tacos with rice and beans on the side. Everything tasted great and there was no incident, until a few hours later when I got home. That's when the fever, chills and vomiting began. The next 24 hours was basically the worst ever. I deducted I became ill as a result of your food, simply by the fact that I ate no where else in the hours leading up to or following my visit. I am not writing on your wall to receive anything for free or to cause a stir, there just isn't any other form of contact I can find. I only ask that you and your team review your cleanliness, preparation and food safety procedures so this does not happen to other diners. I will most likely return for drinks, but definitely won't be eating here again.
