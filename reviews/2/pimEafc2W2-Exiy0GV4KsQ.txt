Been here a lot   Mostly because there are no other bars in the area.  Food isn't this places strong point   Also it's way over priced   However the service is really good   Except when it isn't.  Seems like there are a few great waitress and counter persons and some younger girls that don't belong in the business. My wife and I live in the neighborhood and just about every one we've talked to has pretty much the same sentiments about this place as we do.  Too bad!! It could be a great place and a real moneymaker but somebody is dropping the ball
