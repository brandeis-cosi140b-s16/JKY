What were they thinking when they were pricing their menus?  $17 average for a plate of ok mexican?  I can understand if its a gourmet restaurant, but this is really just a run of the mill strip mall kind of mexican restaurant...the kind that isn't really mexican at all.  You'll do better to hit Filibertos unfortunately.   

I do have to give them props for mexican cheeses and not your usual yellow cheese boat like a lot of cruddy semi-mexican food joints like El Bravo/Carlos O'Briens, etc.  

Their flan was flabby and too creamy, the chips ok, needed more salt.  Salsa was weird, but ok, kind of funky different.   I tried the margarita...no tequila flavor even though i thought I ordered Hornitos, it was all some icky sweet/sour mix, not well done at all.  The chicken enchiladas were pretty tasty after all, good shredded chicken - nice flavor, nice green sauce, so it wasn't all bad, just wasn't that good for the price.

They do have a small outdoor patio, which is nice.  But with their entrees at $17, I'm not going back.  There are so many very good small mexican joints around that have good fair prices with awesome food that this place won't last.
