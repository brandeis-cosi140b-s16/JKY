Typically, I prefer qdoba over chipotle. But I was disappointed in the quality of the food in this particular location. 

I am a big Qdoba fan. I go to college in Oakland and two years ago, I literally are at Qdoba every week, I love it! But this location just didn't cut it for me last time I went. 

I ordered a veggie quesadilla. Easy right? Something that can't be messed up? Wrong. The woman working was very nice, although they appeared to be pretty disorganized in the kitchen. She asked if I wanted any rice on my quesadilla to fill it out a little more and I said sure why not. 

Basically, the rice wasn't cooked enough, there was barely any cheese on my quesadilla and it was tasteless and falling apart. The best part of the entire meal was the side of guacamole. 

I still love Qdoba, but I won't return to this location.
