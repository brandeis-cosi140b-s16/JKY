We came to Paz for the first time in a few months for some quick food and drinks. Unfortunately, after being seated and receiving chips and water, we were ignored for about 30 minutes and decided to leave. This is the first time we have actually walked out of Paz, but we have noticed their service becoming increasingly slower over our past visits. Bummer, because we absolutely love the food and atmosphere.
