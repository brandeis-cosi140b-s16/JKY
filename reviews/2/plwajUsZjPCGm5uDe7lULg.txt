We decided to try this place being that it is so close to my families house and I was craving tacos. My husband and brother got the footlong burritos which they both said they were bland. My brother also got the ranchero sauce to put on top and he was so glad he tasted it before he put it on his burrito because it was awful. It had a really weird taste like tomato sauce and slight enchilada sauce taste but no seasoning whatsoever. My sister and I ordered the carne asada soft tacos and the meat really wasn't that great. It had like a grilled weird flavor to it, my sister said the same thing. We got our son a soft chicken taco and he ate half and said he didn't like it. Overall the staff was nice that's why I gave it 2 stars but unfortunately my family and I agreed we'd never go back.
