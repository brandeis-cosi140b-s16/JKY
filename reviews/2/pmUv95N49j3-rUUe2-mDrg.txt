We came here for our anniversary dinner.  First and probably the last time.  It was really LOUD with club/techno music playing, very hard to hear what my hubby was saying.  Our waitress was just blah, didn't know the menu at all and seemed distracted.  The food was interesting/fine.  We spent too much money for the experience we had.  Too bad, wanted to love the place.
