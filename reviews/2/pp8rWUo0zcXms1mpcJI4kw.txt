The food was okay and the hookah was harsh. I enjoyed the music. The service was horrible. It took forever to get anyone's attention, and then once we ordered stuff, it took forever to get what me and my friend ordered. We ordered drinks and it took so long that we asked for the check. When we finally got the check, our drinks came. And the waitress was angry that we got our drinks, wanted to take them away from us, and finally we were asked to move to the bar to finish them. However, we didn't even want the drinks. I just don't understand why we were treated so disrespectfully. It seemed like everyone else was getting great service...
