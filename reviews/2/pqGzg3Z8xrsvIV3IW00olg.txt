I would have given it one star, but when the food finally came it wasn't half bad.

Is it just me, or if you were running a place in an airport, wouldn't you manage toward the fact that some if not all of your customers might have to catch a plane?  I guess that they assume everybody's flight is delayed and is grateful for the chance to kill time.  Not that the many TVs are well managed.  When there are a bunch of games on, why are almost all of them tuned to Florida-FSU?  You are in Charlotte for crying out loud.

The bad service contributes to the sketchy atmosphere.
