I went into Julio's yesterday for lunch.  Didn't start with a good impression at all.  When I ordered my margarita I was asked for my ID.  Understandable.  I've worked in the restaurant industry for 10+ years, I get it.  But I didn't even get a smile, or even eye contact.  I then stood there for about 5 minutes while the employees passed around my out-of-state license (I just moved here a few months ago, and I'm 24, btw).  I found this pretty unprofessional.  The older blonde was cashing me out and piled on the attitude.  If she had rolled her eyes one more time, I'm pretty sure they'd roll right out of her head.  The younger gentleman who brought out my burrito put the food down and walked away... that's it.  

My point is... if you like food, you miiiiiight like this place, it was mediocre.  If you like good service, don't waste your time.  If I was the owner of this restaurant, I would be embarrassed to employ these people.  They were rude, condescending, and pretenscious.  

I had the spinach and chicken burrito.  It was meh.  The margarita was great, but came in a plastic cup... pretty anticlimactic and non-environamentally friendly.  BOOOOOOO!
