Bizarre. Cheerfully greated by hostess. Offered and accepted dining room on roof. The chairs were dirty and the vinyl tableclothes charming. Very slow service, maybe it was the server who belonged at 24 Hour Fitness front desk. Food was ok; when we asked for cheese atop our pasta his response was "oh there is enough cheese in there"...........WHAT?!
