I was in downtown Glendale the other day for business and we decided to walk over to Bitzee Mama's for a quick lunch.  Well, it was anything but quick.  They really weren't that busy, and we waited 10 minutes to be seated, then 15 minutes to put in our order.  Needless to say I was rushed at the end to eat and return to my meeting, gratefully the chairman was with me for lunch.

The menu offers a nice Mexican and American dishes, but I would suggest the Mexican side, come on, that is obviously their thing, specials of Tamales and such, you can go to McDonald's and get a hamburger (without the wait of course).

I ordered the Burrito Enchilada style, which was good and authentic.  Once the food arrived, it was hot and had the typical Sonoran taste that you get in Phoenix.  The food was good and kept this review above 1 star which is where the service was putting it.

They really need to come up with a new culture of customer satisfaction and quick pace to keep their reviews from continuing to decline.
