Not for me, thanks.

I'm from New Mexico.  Not far from Taos, in fact.  This is NOT New Mexican style food, and it is NOT Taos style food.  At least, not a place that plans on staying in business.

Sure, the place is cute.  Sure, the people are nice and friendly and provide decent service.  Sure, the price vs. quantity ratio is more than fair.
And the food isn't the type of bad that will make you sick.

Had I been going with the aim of getting some Americanized Mexican style food, I may have given more stars.

But to me, going to Gil's for New Mexican food is akin to going to Idaho for good Mexican food.  It's just not happening.

Sigh.

And for the love of all that's right and good - will SOMEONE in this town learn to make a real sopapilla???
