We just moved to the area and were very excited for being so close to this place! Literally walking distance! The ambience and service are authentic, but the food is just NOT RIGHT! The chips are plain, salsa is good, of each dish we've chosen, none was eatable! The refried beans tasted anything but beans! All we can say is that it is a shame such a good location, and potential, we so little care for the food it self! Hopefully it will change for nothing remains the same forever!
