Service is awful.  The manager is just plain snappy!  Takes forever to get your order. If your in the drive-thru expect 15-20 mins waiting. Oh and make sure to check the bag! Because 90% of the time something is missing! The food is greasy and at this location they have a cook that seriously can't cook because sometimes it tastes worst then normal.  On the chicken burrito, sometimes it's just drowned in red sauce and all watery. 

Just not a good fast food place.
