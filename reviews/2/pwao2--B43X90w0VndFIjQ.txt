This place was just OK. There are much better Mexican food restaurants in Charlotte. The service was on point and everyone was very friendly. Ordered the cheese dip with the chips and salsa, the cheese dip came out cold and sent it back for them to put it in the microwave and it still wasn't warm enough. For dinner me and my companion split the large mushroom quesadilla. It was tasty but once again it was also cold. If the food came out hot and fresh i would have given them 4 stars.
