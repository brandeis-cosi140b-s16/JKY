It had been a few years since I was last here and had enjoyed the food. So when my friend picked this place for her Birthday lunch I was excited to go. The place wasn't crowded which was nice. Our waitress was very friendly. I ordered a chile relle√±o and red chile cheese enchilada with refried beans. Although the portions were great they were very bland. No kick from either chile. Even adding salt didn't help. I was disappointed in the lunch. I will go back one more time to make sure it wasn't an off day. But if not I will never go again.
