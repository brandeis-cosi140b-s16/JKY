About 15 years ago I would stop in here to grab breakfast before heading to work a couple times a week. I have noticed for sometime now that Dima's Tacos is still in business, so I made a point to come in for breakfast to see if it was like I had remembered. Inside is small with only maybe 4 or 5 tables. The woman who took my order was nice and gave me time to look over the menu. She also told me that they were not the original owners of Dima's and that it has changed hands over the years. Her and her husband recently started a lease, so anybody familiar with Dima's Tacos before might notice a difference in the menu and prices. Since it had been so long since my last visit, I just hoped for good food. The prices are fair depending on what you order. Some menu items are made fresh and other stuff isn't. My total was around $11.

Agua Fresca - This wasn't made fresh and came from a fountain machine. It also tasted watered down. 

Cheese Quesadilla - Good size and really the only thing I enjoyed. It's kind of hard to mess up a cheese quesadilla.

Bacon Breakfast Burrito - I knew it was not going to be like I remembered Dima's being all those years ago, but wow it really wasn't the same! The burritos used to be really big (double wrapped) and now they are long and skinny. I don'y mind since they use really big tortillas and it still ends up being a decent size. The scrambled eggs were not mixed all the way before being made, so I ended up with a white and yellow scramble, not good. There was only 2 or 3 small pieces of potato in the center and that's it. The burrito could have definitely used more potato. I also paid for extra cheese to be added and there was none at all. The bacon tasted good, but was hard at times.
