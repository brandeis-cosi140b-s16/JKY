As soon as we walked in , we felt the great atmosphere. They were very nive to my friends and I. There was a mariachi band that played some great songs for us . i give it two stars because of the food. The beans were horrible . they tasted like can beans . the sopa de fideo had no flavor , couldn't made it better my self. I asked for alot of onions and limons to give all the food flavor. The drinks are delicious bit food is terrible. Fell bad saying because they were really friendly but i have to be honest. Its to expensive for the quality. I think all the comments are misleading .
