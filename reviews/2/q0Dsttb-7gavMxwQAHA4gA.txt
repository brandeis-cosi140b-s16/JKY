The decor of this place is nice. It is southwest enough without going overboard and tacky. The atmosphere is comfortable; the tables and booths are spaced out enough for conversations. The food is decent. The food being ok, the price, and the service made it an ok experience.

For a Mexican restaurant, I am disappointed with their margaritas. My friend ordered the grapefruit, which she found too sour. I ordered the prickly pear, which I found overbearingly sweet. We ended up switching, and drinking, although she didn't like mine either. If you want a great prickly pear margarita, go to Mesa Grill. At Mi Casa, it is pure sugar.

The chips were fresh and warm, which was a plus, but their salsas were lacking. None of the trio stood out as impressive. 

Our group of three ordered the specialties of the night. One was a 14oz. NY steak specials served on top of a cilantro lime rice, grilled vegetables, six shrimp, and topped with crisp onion straws for $24. The steak was seasoned well. The shrimp was cooked nicely, but was overpowered by the sauce it was smothered in. The rice was my favorite. The chef explained that he purees the cilantro, adds in the lime juice and butter, then tosses the rice in it as a binder. The other special we got was a tilapia with three shrimp over roasted corn and black bean rice topped with mango salsa for $18. I did not care for this dish at all. Nothing stood out as spectacular or worth eating. 

The waitress was scrambling, a bit inattentive, and just seemed nervous. I found it odd that we were never asked how we would like our steaks cooked. I will just count myself lucky that she went the safe route and entered medium, because waiting another fifty minutes for a new order would not have been an option.
