I will never come here while in Vegas. Lesson learned. We were seated quickly and they had funny entertainers. Hence, 2 stars. We got there pretty early for Vegas standards, about 11AM, so they werent busy. The waiter forgot my drink after 10 minutes. I ordered the enchilada and steak taco deal. It was the most boring Mexican food Ive ever had. I had to add soooo much salsa, but it didnt really help.
