The food as always is on point. I was completely thrown off as the line was backwards. You order to the left and move to the right. Not a big deal but I was in line much longer than I have ever been at Chipotle  because they were out of steak and chicken. It was lunch time and it seems they didn't plan well enough to handle a crowd. Some staff was friendly while others were just blah, no emotion at all. Parking at this location was another challenge. With so many small businesses there it was like musical parking. My go to location has minimal parking but there is always an additional option of extended casino parking at Sunset Station. I tried this location but I have no plan on returning here,
