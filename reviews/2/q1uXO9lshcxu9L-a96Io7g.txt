17.47 for three burritos that seemed more like wrapped soup than than actual Mexican food. Sloppy leaky beans and virtually flavorless red chilli. I still have the green chilli burro on the counter waiting for tomorrow morning. Hopefully by then I can eat it without changing shirts. I live close by and rarely see the place open so I stopped by when I caught the "open" sign on.......rare enough. Live and learn.....
