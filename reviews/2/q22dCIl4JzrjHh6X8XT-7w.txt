Let me start this off by saying that I love q'doba, the food is delicious. Reason for 2 stars you ask? Well I'm currently standing in line, I'm the only one here. I was greeted with "I'll be right with you" and then I waited while the two ladies here finished their conversation! So while the food is great, this experience was not!
