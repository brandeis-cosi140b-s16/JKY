Oh Vince, living here in Vegas you should know better. First of all, the chips and salsa, really? If you are going to have a southwest/ Mexican style restaurant, the lowest expectation is that you have fresh chips. Bagged chips are not acceptable. The food was mediocre at best. We got a beef burrito with no beans, it came with only rice inside, no beef! The only reason I'm not giving 1 star is because the margarita was good and the service was good.
