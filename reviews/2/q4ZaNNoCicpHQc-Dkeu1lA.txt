Wow not great.  Was surprised because of so many positive reviews.  I would put this place "on par" with Macayos but no better...and that is not saying much.  

On the positive side the service was excellent.  The atmosphere was fine, pretty much like any other mexican place.

The food in my opinion was not what I expcted given all the good reviews here.  Chips were ok but the salsa was very watery and their "hot sauce" is more of a chipotle type thing than a red hot sauce.  I had enchiladas trio and it was well below average.  The beef one was ok, the cheese one was also ok, but the chicken one was barely even cooked.  Rice was seriously overcooked as well.  

Pretty much exhausted all the possibilities of mexican restaurants in Surprise.  They are all below standard...probably will head to Arrowhead area when we have cravings for this type of food in the future.
