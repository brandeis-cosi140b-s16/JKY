I will have to admit, If you want real Mexican food in Las Vegas, El Gordo is the place. And yes it is way far from the strip. We literally walked down here from where we were staying at, but it was fun. Enchiladas, tiny mini tacos are the best. Taste real good as if you were in TJ or East L.A. My only annoyance is the huge crowd and some of the element of ghetto people it attracts. The place is big with a few tables and outside tables, but it can get really noisy when trying to order food. Chilli fries are really good, and i like the fact that i can watch the employees cook and prepare the food. Great place, i hope to come back on a less crowded night.
