Thank you for the diarrhea Don Tortacos!

Basically, we came here after JF and I ordered the carne asada fries. The price was the same as everywhere and the actually plate wasnt lovely nor was it delectable. I hate the carne asada here! It was over cooked and no bueno! Customer service was decent, and they have a little salsa bar.

The next morning I wanted to die. It was horrid.

No Mas Tortacos!
