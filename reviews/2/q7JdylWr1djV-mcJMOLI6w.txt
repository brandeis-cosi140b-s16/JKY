Come here quite often, in my opinion this is probably one of the better Mexican restaurants in town. Prices are a bit high but you get what you pay for. I love the complimentary green salsa as well as the red salsa. Only complaint from me is service. Bartenders are awesome but wait staff, is not always the best. I work as a server as well & I just believe you should always make your guests feel welcomed rather than a nuisance. Our server Dolce (i believe was her name, didn't get a receipt) was extremely rude. My friends and I sat without water for about 20 minutes. we consistently tried to get our servers attention & she just kept walking away from our table as we were trying to order a drink. & then when I finally got frustrated and went to the bar to order my Bloody Mary, she asked me why I didn't order the drink through her! & when I responded saying that I had tried to, several times, she told me I didn't. Whatever, I just kept to myself but when it came to paying we had asked for separate checks & she brought one check & then disappeared for another 15 minutes & then split the checks with the wrong items on each bill. TWICE. I can understand that being confusing had there of been 10 of us or something but there were only 3. It's not that hard. Needless to say, my friends and I got so frustrated that we just paid the bill and then figured out the proper amounts later on. Overall experience... Disappointing, but I will be back nonetheless because the food is good.
