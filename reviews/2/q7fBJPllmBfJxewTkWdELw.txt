Well, last year I visited, ate twice. Great time, full restaurant inside out plus people waiting as it was new. 
This year, and looks like I will be visiting for work more....12 at the bar, 8 in restaurant, happy hour. Was ignored:( I knew what I wanted. Finally ordered one drink and tacos. I even shared I've been here last year. I thought that would help. Everyone at bar were locals. Complimentary drink to my right by manager..I finally asked for chips at the 15 minute mark. They made drinks for others. I got a passing waitress attention asked for chips. She asked if I asked before. I said yes twice. So manager came over from the two guys to my right. Asked is everything ok. I said, it's fine, I have $$ in my pocket, you are taking care of the locals. I'm fine. 
I DO NOT recommend this venue. When I left, two women walked in locals they were all over them. Let the place go under.
