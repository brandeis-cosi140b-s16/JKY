My wife and I decided to try this place after seeing it reopened after being previously the location for "El Rico's" which we loved! From our entrance in the settings look very welcoming. We were sat down quickly and brought chips and salsa to start. The chips were great and freshly made and still warm. They serve two salsas, a red and a green. The green is sweet and has great flavor. The red salsa on the other hand I was not a favorite of. It had a weird after taste and was unlike any salsa I've tried before. 

We both ordered our meals I ordered a carne asada burrito and my wife ordered shredded beef tacos. My burrito was a good size and the rice and beans on the side were tasty. The carne asada on the other hand was very dry and didn't have great flavor. Overall I was not a fan of my burrito. 

I tried the taco and it also suffered from severe dryness. The meat was so dry I had to drink water to get it down. 

On a plus side the staff was friendly, but I just can't give it more the two stars based on the food and the price we paid for it. I don't feel the quality is there at all.
