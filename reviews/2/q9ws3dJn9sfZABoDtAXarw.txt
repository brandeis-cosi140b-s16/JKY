It's in a neighborhood that looks to be conducive to quality Mexican food.  I mean crap, Chi Chi's Cabaret is right up the road (apparently).  But I think the food failed to hit the mark in terms of outstanding Mexican/Sonoran fare.  It was lackluster and not very tasty.

Lots of decent reviews caused me to go out of my way to eat here with my family.  The prices were a little steep for the food they gave.  $12 dollar enchilada plates and $10 dinner specials.  

I'd have to say the stand out entree of the night was my plate.  I ordered the MP-1 which was basically a Green Tamale dinner.  It was actually pretty good.  I like the hint of sweetness that is present in the masa.  The beans were decent as well and tasted homemade not canned.

But there wasn't anything very 'Green' in any of the flavor of the entree.  

Otherwise, everything was pretty standard.  Service was great.  Food came fast.  But all in all, I wasn't knocked off my feet.  

I might possibly give this place another chance.  I really did like the ambience and location.  We'll see.
