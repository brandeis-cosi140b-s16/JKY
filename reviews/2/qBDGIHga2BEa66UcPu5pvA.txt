1)  The bean and cheese burrito only has an undetectable amount of cheese.  If you order "extra cheese", then the amount of cheese does not change.

2) The shrimp burrito is EXTRA spicy, which I suspect is to cover up the taste of old shrimp.

3) The machaca burrito and horchata are good.

4) The prices are reasonable.
