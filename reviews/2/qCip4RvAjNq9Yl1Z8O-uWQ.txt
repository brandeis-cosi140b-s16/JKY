Not the best, but certainly not the worst place in town.  This location was recently remodled and it seems a little more open than before, but the new front doors make the place look more like a circle K than a mid-level restaurant.  I was typically going there 3-4 times a month, but recently it seems to me like the quality of food has declined over the past 6 months and after the last visit, I am not planning on returning any time soon.  I'll probably check it out again in a few months.  I would have given this place 3 stars prior to the recent experiences.  The staff seems friendly and welcoming.
