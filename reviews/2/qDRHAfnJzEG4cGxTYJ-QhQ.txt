Looks great. It's not. This should be enough reason to stop reading this and walk away. 
But if you are a fool and are interested then read on


First the place looks nice. It's big has a lot of seating so that's pretty good but it all stops here

We ordered chips and salsa with a side of guac 5 buck for the chips and 1.70 for the guac. there is a LOT of chips couldnt finish it with just two people
but it ends here

the food stunk
its HORRIBLE quality its so bad!! the tacos are disgusting, the tortilla breaks the food is COLD its like they microwave it and just let it sit on the table for an hour and wait for some poor sucker (me) to order it...BLAH
