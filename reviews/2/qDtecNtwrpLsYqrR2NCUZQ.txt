The restaurant is fairly large, but we were the only diners at lunch time.  We shared 2 each of the pastor and borrego (lamb) street tacos plus a diet cola.  The tacos were made with only one tortilla that wasn't very soft and the runny salsa added little in the way of flavor.  Overall, we thought the tacos to be a little below average.
