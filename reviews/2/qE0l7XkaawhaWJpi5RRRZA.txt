It a clean new location, with a cool drive-thru. That's about it, I ordered a egg, ham and cheese burrito and it was drenched with like egg juice, yukkkk. So I called to let em know about it, and they wanted me to bring in the burrito?!? Lol, too bad for them, cause they we're busy, & a lot of customers saw that, they inspected it,like Inspector Gadjet.... Who does that??? Anyways I ordered a different burrito, free cause I couldn't get a refund...

I'll stick to my usual, it's a lil further but there food @ Ramiro's is always perfect.
