I gotta agree with the others and I was surprised.  The quality was fresh, made to order, the 2 employees were very nice.  But yea it was VERY bland and lacked flavor.  What a disappointment.. Why work so hard to make everything fresh and to order and not have any flavor in mexican food.  I ordered their wet burrito and btw their sauce was as thin as water and that too was soooo disappointing. 

I will say that this place can EASILY improve and if you, I'd go back but otherwise I'll take my business up the street to Lindo Michocan (however you spell it)
