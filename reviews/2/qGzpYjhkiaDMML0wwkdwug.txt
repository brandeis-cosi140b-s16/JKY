I absolutely LOVE the Blanco's in north Tucson. The food is fabulous, the views are incredible and the service is impeccable. The Scottsdale location is not so great. My husband and I went here for an early dinner one night and we waited for a table for what felt like an eternity (even though there were only like 6 other diners) and our waitress frequently forgot about us. Then to top it off, I got sick after eating my tacos! My husband enjoyed his meal and his margarita but we won't return.
