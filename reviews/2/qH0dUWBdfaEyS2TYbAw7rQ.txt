My husband and I stopped here for lunch at random, and our experience started off well enough with rather addicting chips and salsa.  We ordered a queso dip as well for them, which made them that much munchier.  However, with the exception of their signature margarita (which was quite lovely), nothing else managed to bump the star rating for us.

We both ordered the chicken chimichanga.  It was edible, but no where near worth what we paid for them.  And they were FULL of cheese.  A good thing you'd think, right?  Not this time, it was overkill. 

The most disappointing thing though was the general lack of attention to detail in cleanliness.  The tables had bits of... stuff still on them, as did the base of the spiral-stand that held our chips.  The floors were dirty.  And my husband discovered a stack of fossilized Mexican-food crumbs pressed in between the seat cushions of the booth.

A shame, because at first glace it looks like an awesome little place.  We'll probably not make this decisions again, unless we're just after drinks and chips.
