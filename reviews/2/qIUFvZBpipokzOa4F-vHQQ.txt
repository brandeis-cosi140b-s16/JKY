The only reason I gave my experience 2 stars is because the food was awesome... Beyond that, my experience was not so great. My friend and I were seated right away, but getting our drinks took forever. Once we had ordered, again our food took a loooong time to get to the table. Our server came and checked on us maybe once, and that was after we flagged her down. On top of the annoyingly slow service, our table was sticky :/ 
All in all, great food, horrible service.
