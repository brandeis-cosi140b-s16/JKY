Now for fast food I must say El Apollo Loco is one of my favorites, but my visit today fell short of expectations,  got the 1/2 chicken combo for $10, but I think the chicken was malnourished, cause it was so small I left hungry.  also had the pinto beans amid broccoli which was tasty.   as for the chicken it was over cooked and dry, such a shame.  I would probably come here more often, but have had same issue before.  this location is the closest to my home and still drive 15+ miles to get my El Apollo loco fix.   glad they are opening a new one in the Goodyear area.  let hope quality/quantity is better.

Now for the service the staff is very friendly and prompt, that is one of the reason I have continued to come back. If this stars were based on service only they would have got 5 stars,  but because of cost vs. quantity I will not go higher.

El Apollo loco get bigger pieces of chicken, your price of a meal is not on the cheap side so stop getting such small chickens
