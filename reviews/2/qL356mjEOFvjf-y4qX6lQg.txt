I received a "buy 1 entree, get 2nd for 50% off" coupon in the mail and when I saw a super burrito on the menu that had steak, chicken, and shrimp, my husband and I decided to give it a try. The gentleman (possibly the owner?) taking the orders was very nice and helpful. Upon asking, he told me that everything was cooked to order as I saw the cook behind him putting each of my super burrito's components on the grill. Their condiment bar had a couple types of hot sauce so I got the pink one made with habanero peppers. 

When I got home and we dug in, we immediately realized how bland everything tasted. In a burrito that had the works: rice, beans, sour cream, pico, steak, chicken, and shrimp, it all melded together as one bland mouthful. This is unfortunately not what I was looking for when I wanted fast Mexican food. I was craving my greasy fix and got what tasted like a health-mex burrito. I figured that the salsa might help, but even that was so watered down, that I couldn't get any flavor from it, and only the spice. I really wanted to like this place because of the customer service and what looked like a fantastic menu, but they really need to fix their seasonings in the food and hot sauce to be more vigorous.
