This used to be the Guadalarjara Grill/Cafe/Cantina and then it was the buffet while it got remodeled now its a Cabo's-but the food just isnt up to par with the Red Rock location and it doesnt have the old salsa bar or fresh-made at the table guacamole.

Red Rock location is 10X better food & service.
