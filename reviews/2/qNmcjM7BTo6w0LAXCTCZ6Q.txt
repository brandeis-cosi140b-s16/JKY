I have heard about all the past famous diners here such as President Bush, and many athelets, etc.  We walked in around 6pm and was like, "THIS is the place? are you SURE? is it even OPEN???"  it was dead inside.  Ill just skip to the food part-  I ordered this dish that came with a ground beef taco, cheese enchilada, and beef tamale.  All of it was good expect the tamale which tasted "grainy"  ok here we go, long story short I wont be going again but glad I went to SAY I've been.
