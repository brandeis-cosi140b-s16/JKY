The employees are friendly but the food itself is pretty bland. The meat and sauce is very unspiced and just doesn't taste Mexican at all. It doesn't even really taste like food actually, its just like chewing a flavorless stick of gum -- you know something is in your mouth, but it doesn't taste like anything at all. The only decent thing was the queso and chips, so you can try that if you absolutely must go here, but I would advise finding a better place if you want Mexican.
