Eh...  would be great Mexican food in Oklahoma City or Ohio, not Phoenix.  Would be like eating at Bucca de Beppo in little Italy.   My 13.00 top shelf marg was so sweet I could barely drink it.  Pork was good but tasted like bar-b-q not carnitas.  For a chain go to Chipotle, for the real thing go to Barrio Cafe.  Bright spot was tomatillo salsa, very good.
