No bueno. The burrito was not good. There was an abundance of cheese...nothing but green peppers, meat, cheese and lettuce in the fajita burrito. Literally. I could have easily made better. The chips and salsa wasn't good either. Some chips were drenched with salt... and others had nothing. Service was also slow and not attentive, which was surprising since our waitress was training someone. You would think they would go above and beyond since someone was watching them...
