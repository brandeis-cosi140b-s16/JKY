The service was terrible - the food was not much better. We waited forever for our drink orders, but tried to give them the benefit of the doubt because our kids had to get milk from the bar. When we had to get the chip guy to refill our drinks, I knew it was no fluke. 

We then pulled up the Yelp reviews and read all about what we were living at that moment. But as we hasn't gotten our food yet, we still had to wait. 

I was full of chips and water, so I wasn't  able to finish main course. The only reason I took it home was because I was taught as a child not to waste food. 

Won't be back-ever. Wasn't all  bad, but with so many good restaurants within a couple of miles, eating here would be a waste of time and money.
