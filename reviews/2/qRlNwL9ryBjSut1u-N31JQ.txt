I tried 4 different tacos. This place is way over priced for street tacos at 2.95 per taco. I had 4 tacos and a drink and it was over $15. For a place that is supposed to this good there sure wasn't much of a crowd except for the group of 10 that I was with. The Mahi Mahi as of this moment is making me sick, not sure what kind of fish it was. I will not go back.
