Visually appealing and nice idea, this was described in a local review and a Mexican food Benihana. Menus were bulky and difficult to read in such a close seating arrangement (go there, you'll see what I mean). Food was bland, though my wife described the green sauce on the enchiladas as very good. Rice was undercooked (it's not supposed to crunch like that), and the server looked at us like we were from another planet when we asked for a spoon for the charro beans. Service was clumsy at best as staff seemed unfamiliar with the tablets and card readers used for ordering and billing. While my server got it on the first try, I saw another server at an adjacent table scan a patron's card at least a half a dozen times. When presented with the check, I saw that my entr√©e was $2 less than the price on the menu, but I was charged $18 for a $10 quesadilla. I pointed those errors out to my server who corrected one and let me keep the $2 discount. I imagine these are issues that will resolve themselves as staff become more familiar with their equipment. If this restaurant can improve service and bring the food up a few notches, then I believe it will survive. If not, it'll be another empty retail space.
