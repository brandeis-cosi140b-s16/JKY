The food was good but there seemed to be a lack of communication and no consistency between morning staff and night staff. My friend ordered the same drink 3 time and got 3 completely different drinks. I ordered the shrimp ceviche. It was  good but very spicy. I never had it before so I can't judge on good it really was. The queso was delicious ! I do have to say I was very happy they moved happy hour to 3:30 ( it's normally starts at 5) for us because we had such a large group.
