Overpriced.  Carne Asada fries is $9.16!  Carne asada chips is $8 (about $.50-1.00 more than most places)  The chips are already expensive.  Why does it cost an extra $1.16 to substitute fries?

I had a california burrito.  It didn't have guacamole.  The first rule of carne asada is that it should always have guacamole.
