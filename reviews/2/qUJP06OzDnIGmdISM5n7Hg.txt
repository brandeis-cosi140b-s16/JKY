The decor looks oddly modern not the typical Mexican restaurant decor. 
They have a candy store which I find it pretty interesting they have all kinds Mexican candies and pi√±atas too.
They play the music awfully loud and our table were right by the speaker did not help. 
The chips were pretty hard it has like the fried pita texture. Salsa were bland. 
Horchata taste really water down, no flavor whatsoever. 
The fajitas were ok I didn't like the texture of the chicken. 
My rice was kinda greasy
Overall the food taste bland and it's passable but not great.
The service is kinda slow and not very friendly and they don't really pay attention to you they basically just take the order and bring the food out to you. I think they're busy taking care the guys at the bar.
