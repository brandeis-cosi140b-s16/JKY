This place is TERRIBLE. We waited for 90 minutes for our food to come out. The service was bad and our drinks ran dry several times while we suffered through our interminable wait for our food. 

Granted, the food was good - but definitely not worth the crappy service or the unreasonable wait, especially considering we were one of only three groups in the entire restaurant. Would not come here again.
