This place is progressively getting worse. I have noticed that they are expanding, which might be the reason why their quality in declining. 

My beloved burrito is no longer good. I've tried it a few times before deciding the lower the review. The steak is really tough. I have wondered whether or not the meat is actually beef. 

The cleanliness of this particular located has also declined. Roberto's is now by go-to Mexican spot.
