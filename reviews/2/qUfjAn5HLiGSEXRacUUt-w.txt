First off, you have to pay for chips and salsa...so sad.  If you upgrade to queso dip, salsa and chips, its $20.  Sorry but that's really over the top pricing.  That said, the chips and salsa are good.

Prices: it's really expensive in comparison of other Mexican restaurants.  My wife and I had lunch.  Fajitas and tacos, chips/salsa, 1 ftn drink and water: $50 
The only restaurant to compare to at these prices is the one in Aria and it's really good.

The ambiance is very nice, however the day we were there, it was super cold in the restaurant.  Like jacket cold.

The food is so, so.  There really doesn't seem to be any spices or sauces going on.  The chicken fajitas really didn't have any kick or spice.  Personally, I have made better fajitas.   

However, the Chimichanga is really good.

I have to recommend the Cantina restaurant in the Tuscany or Amigos Mexican Restaurant at the Fiesta Casino.
