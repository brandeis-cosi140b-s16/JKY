Pros: Cheap, huge portions, friendly staff.

Cons: This is not the best C-U has to offer as far as Mexican food. 

What I ordered: First visit- enchiladas verdes (chicken) with a side of beans. The salsa verde was bland- notably lacking in onion, garlic, cilantro, and salt. The chicken was seasoned with a sweet and smoky tomato sauce... the smoke flavor overpowered the salsa verde, tortillas, cheese, and cream. They use sour cream, not Mexican crema, which was disappointing. The beans were lacking in flavor. I don't know if they were canned or if they were boiled in water without onion, garlic, etc. Second visit: steak tacos and rice. The tacos were so greasy- it was as if the meat was deep fried and then they poured two tablespoons of oil in the taco. I asked for a flour tortilla, expecting (hoping!) for a good flour tortilla, unfortunately it wasn't any better than the store-bought flour tortillas in the refrigerator section, having that unmistakable preservative taste. 

Bottom line: Probably fine if you just want nachos and margaritas and don't know good Mexican food...but head elsewhere for non-Americanized fare.
