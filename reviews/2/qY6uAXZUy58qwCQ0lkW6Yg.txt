There are some serious management problems at this Qdoba. I live nearby and go here often, but only because I prefer it to the Chipotle next door and get a free drink as a college student. The line will get very long and the staff takes forever compared to Chipotle. Also, I went in once and the person at the counter said nothing the entire time and instead awkwardly pointed at things. The place is always not as clean or put together as Chipotle and I think this particular store suffers because of it. The line for Chipotle is always out the door while here it slows down so much that people leave. Please, hire at least 2 or more people for the rush times!
