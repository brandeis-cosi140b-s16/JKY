Ugh! I should have read the reviews before eating here. Service was slow but once he got to me he was friendly; thus the 2 stars. I ordered a taco salad without meat. Sufficed to say I have never been so disappointed in a salad. How can you go wrong with a salad? Well this one was missing the tortilla strips which made it a Taco salad. And it was extremely wet...scary wet. I couldn't even eat all of it. Will never come here again unless it is for the extremely high-priced margaritas. Again the only reason for the 2 star is because of the server (Thomas); otherwise, Taco Bell is better.
