Fun decor good chips and Salsa but slow slow service our waitress came by half a dozen times to apologize. Said was because of one big table maybe 6 people on a half empty restaurant. Then my Chilli Rellano with cold. My wife's salad was good but not a good first experience in a town with way to many Mexican Restaurants.
