Lunch buffet is $7.99.  They had rice, beans, chile relleno, pork & onions, chimichanga, enchilada, salad, cantaloupe, brownie, & white chocolate frosted brownie.  Chips come only with ok salsa.  Hubbie had $8.95 burrito mexicano instead of the buffet.  No a/c but has fans which were not on.  Husb pulled on chain to start fan which made it more tolerable but in 105 degree weather, we were going to leave d/t the uncomfortable level (& I keep my house at 82 degrees so I can tolerate heat no problem)
