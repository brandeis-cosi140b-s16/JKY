There aren't a lot of dining options in this area of the terminal so I went here. This place was okay but nothing special. I tried the pork bowl and the pork itself was lean and tender. The vegetables didn't seem too fresh and were also just okay. The rice was overflavored or overseasoned and tasted like one of those premade boxed rices. This place is alright for airport food I but I wouldn't go here otherwise.
