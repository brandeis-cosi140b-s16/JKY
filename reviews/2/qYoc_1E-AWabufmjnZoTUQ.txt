I wanted to love this place as I am a huge fan of Three Amigos but after a few tries, I am calling it a day. The tacos are good, not great and trying to take out is a mess. The containers melt from the heat and the lids don't fit the small sauce/guac cups. We tried the chicken, steak, fish and shrimp tacos and the shrimp was the only thing that really had flavor. We also tried a gordita, a pupusa and an arepa and while the pupusa and the arepa were really quite good, the gordita was nothing more than a pile of shredded cheese and some chicken inside. Personally, I'll stick to Three amigos.
