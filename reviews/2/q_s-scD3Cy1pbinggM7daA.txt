nah, son. 

we stopped here on the way to our hotel after our flight from NJ. My colleague said to just pick anything out i saw along the way. I somehow expected ANY Mexican place in Arizona to be good, kinda like in San Diego. Apparently I was wrong. 

I love carnitas. Our waiter raved about the carnitas there when I expressed my interest. dude was either full of caca or has never had good carnitas in his life. I've never had carnitas so dry before. this place is obviously about serving large portions for low prices - but the quality is lower than the prices. i wasn't even feeling the fried ice cream here. it's not easy to get me to talk negatively about dessert, yo.

the Cadillac margarita was okay. and if it weren't for the Frida Kahlo art on the walls I would chalk this experience up as a total loss. Frida gets a star all her own.

Oh, saw the end of the Giants/49ers game where the Giants won it in the last few minutes. that was good too.
