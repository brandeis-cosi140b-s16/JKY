There's a truth about some restaurants that we sometimes don't want to acknowledge. Like Chotchkie's, the fictional restaurant from "Office Space," sometimes people come to a restaurant for the atmosphere and the attitude. Never mind that the food is astonishingly mediocre.

Hate to break the news, but Chuy's is the Chotchkie's of Tex-Mex restaurants. Lots of kitschy atmosphere, plenty of chirpy attitude (seriously, some of the waitstaff here act like they're spending the last few months of a prison sentence at a halfway home), and the food is simply very bland. And Tex-Mex should NEVER be bland. 

Look, I don't dislike Chuy's, but it feels a lot like what you get when you go to a joint like Chili's or Outback; a so-called "authentic" and "real" atmosphere that's anything but. For what they're charging you - no kidding, this is some seriously expensive Tex-Mex - you're definitely not getting your money's worth. 

You're better off at La Unica at Indian Trial or Three Amigos off Central Avenue. You'll get a better dining experience, and you won't be bombarded with kitschy silliness that borders on obnoxious.
