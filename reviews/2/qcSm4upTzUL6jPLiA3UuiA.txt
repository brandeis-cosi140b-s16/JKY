Well this place could definitely use a facelift. The service was super slow and unmemorable. At least the food was pretty good, but I can think of a handful of other family owned Mexican restaurants that are much better. My boyfriend didn't like his meal of a taco and chile relleno, I believe. Glad I gave it a try, but probably won't be back.
