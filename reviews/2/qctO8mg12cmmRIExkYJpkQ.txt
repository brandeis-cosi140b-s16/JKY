Maybe 2.5 stars.

Service was prompt and friendly. Water delivered with no straws, had to ask. Son's water glass had stains on the inside. Sat on the patio.

I had a chicken fajita burrito. It came with rice, and black beans. The burrito was bland, The chicken was grilled and cubed but not much flavor. There were also pinto beans and cheese in it but none of the ingredients were hot enough to fully melt the cheese so it was just kind of warm. The black beans were good, the rice...meh. 

Other dishes ordered were steak tacos that were good (4 stars) and a quesadilla appetizer which was just "ok". Both my kids told me that my own homemade quesadillas are much better. 


Probably won't be back not because it's bad, mainly because I have limited opportunities to dine out and I don't want to experience mediocrity when I do get the time to go out.
