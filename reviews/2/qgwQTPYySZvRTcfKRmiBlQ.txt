My family and I love the food here but the service is really slow! We waited in line for 30 min to place our order. The teenage kids working behind the counter are either rude or pretending to work. This place could be really awesome if they had some competent workers behind the counter. The tortillas are fresh and the burritos are amazing. Just be prepared to wait a long time and be treated like crap
