I just noticed this was so highly rated and wanted to send a little more reality the way of the burrito drive. The only thing it has going for it is the fact it delivers, and would pass for a business meeting or simple catered event. If you are looking to go out to enjoy some Mexican food-you can look pretty much anywhere else and be happier.  

I've tried this place a couple times over a year ago now, but doubt anything has changed. I disagree with the implication that chipotle or qdoba is inferior to this place. They are comparable, but I would rank chipotle significantly higher. So long as you don't think of this place as a mexican restaurant or receive the food for free, you might not be disappointed.

Come here to remind yourself just how good places like El Pastor and Taqueria Guadalajara are.
