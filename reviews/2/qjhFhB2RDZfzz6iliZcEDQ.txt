Review:
I really wanted to like this place because it is a beautiful restaurant, and it's parking lot is always full so I was led to believe it was awesome food.  However, after trying it multiple times (fooled again!) I have to say I won't be back.

Their food has no pizzazz and their salsa is nothing to write home about.  Considering they are in the two dollar sign price range ($$), I would expect much better food than what they offer.  One of the times we went, there weren't too many customers there (but they were fully staffed) and we spent almost 2 hours there because service was so slow, even though we ordered a total of two dishes for two of us. There was a bigger group of about 8 outside who already had their food, and their kids were running in and out of the restaurant screaming at the top of their lungs past everyone's' table and none of the staff said a word to them (and their parents didn't care either).  

I would say considering they're in Arizona they should step up their game when it comes to Mexican food but obviously there are enough people eating there already, so I guess they don't need my advice.  Since it's so popular with others, maybe it's worth a try, just don't go with high hopes.
