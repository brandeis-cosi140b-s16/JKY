If this were my first experience with a Moes, I'd have been pretty unimpressed. We actually went through security twice though because we don't have regular access to Moes, but thought we would get there since we could.
We stood there for at least 2-3 minutes before they acknowledged us, we were the only ones in line. The guy that took our order had no idea what a Billy Barou was... odd, since its been on their menu forever as far as we know, including the menu right there in front of him. While he was making my homewrecker, I guess he hadn't quite mastered the moes technique for getting guacamole and sour cream into a burrito and I ended up with one huge glob of sour cream and one glob of guacamole and hte rest of the burrito had none. He didn't really seem to know what he was doing and none of the other employees seemed like they were trying to help.

The ingrediants were definitely not up to what I think Moes standards would be. The rice was dry, the steak seemed like it had been under a heat lamp, and the chips were not that good. In addition, the the lack of the salsa bar that I'm used to at Moes was a bit of a bummer.
