Place took a tumble in the rankings yesterday. The order of fajitas was reasonable at $8 (minus $2 with coupon), but the food was not good and neither was the cleanliness of the restaurant. The fajita chicken was undercooked with some red appearing in one or two strips. Another strip was riddled with fat.  The salsa bar was a mess at 7pm as most salsa's were out and didn't seem to be refreshed in quite awhile. Corn tortillas served with meal were very thin and garden variety. Just a bad effort, but I guess I started relying too much on a few good meals. It is still a chain in the end. No bueno.
