Ok, I have read other posts that ran into the same issues that I did here. The food was average but it may have been better if I could have got what I wanted. It is not that they got my order wring, but they ran out of some of the things I wanted. I get that it was dinner time and people had been in there all day, but you have to know when you are running out of guacamole (which is $1.50 anyway), and find a way to get more.
It wasn't just the guacamole that they were out of, they also somehow ran out of brown rice.

I ended up going with a cilantro lime rice, which was good, but again not what I wanted. Over all I feel like I got a bunch of beans, ok amount of chicken, no guacamole, and a secondary kind of rice. 

I don't come here often and this is not the way to get me going back.
