Mexican?  Hardly.  That was as unMexican as I could imagine.  Put it this way - if you think Panda Express is actually Chinese food, you'll think this place is authentic Mexican.  From start to finish a very mediocre meal.  Atmosphere was good, service was OK (just barely) ... With so many restaurants to choose from, won't be going back.
