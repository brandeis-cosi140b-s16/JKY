Food here used to be good!  Now our last visit, we were sat at a booth that we had to wipe the seat first, the wall surrounding us looked as if it had not been cleaned in quite some time (the dead fly on the window sill confirmed this).  The wait staff not to professional, I know we live in Arizona but I prefer not to look at the butt cheeks of waitresses hanging out as I am eating, they really need to go to a pant uniform instead of those shorts.  Free chips and salsa, um they have gone to using these small bowls that barely fit a handful in them and they were gone before we received our drinks.  The cheese crisp has been reduced to might as well not waste your money portion size and last 2 times here have had to send it back as I told the waitress I ordered a cheese crisp not a burnt crisp.  Food comes out and is blah, my taco shell is hard and tastes stale, her enchilada is so blah she eats a quarter of it and we bring it home and threw it to the dogs to eat.  Their was a time I was so unhappy before leaving at the hostess desk I spoke to the so called manager on duty, he seemed as if I was interrupting his busy time which consisted of not doing much.  I told him of that bad experience and he made no real attempt to make it right just stood shaking his head, ( probably figured he already had our money your bothering me just go away), well I told you then another bad experience and I will not be back so not only will I not be back but I am writing this review and making sure to tell everyone I know of your restaraunt and it being in their best interest to steer clear.
