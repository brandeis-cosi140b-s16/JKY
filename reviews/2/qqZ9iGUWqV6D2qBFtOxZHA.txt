Alright since I live in Arizona I have always passed by this place on my way to Harkins in Mesa, so I decided a pre Jurassic World meal at this location would be worth a try. I was greeted by a welcoming service but the food paled in comparison. I ordered the 2 piece thigh and wing combo with mac and cheese. Sadly, the mac and cheese was the best part of the meal. The chicken was dry and had no classic el pollo loco taste to it for a good kick to the meal. I had doubts unfortunately whether the meat was well cooked during my experience. Additionally, the portion was extremely small for a hefty $7 within a fast food setting and I was left famished after my meal. Based on the crowd within the restaurant consisting of me, myself and I, I understood the paucity of individuals at this restaurant. 

In the future, I hope the quality of food within this establishment is vastly improved, otherwise I'm afraid my sentiments will be echoed in similar fashion.
