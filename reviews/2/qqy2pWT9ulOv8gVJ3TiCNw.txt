So I totally should've read the reviews before I went to lunch today.  I wanted to cross off another place on my triple D list so Roberto's is close to my work so I went to check it out.  

I ordered the El Pastor plate which has meat, rice, lettuce, beans, and a tortilla.  The El Pastor meat was actually good I enjoyed that but the rice and beans were really bland.  I judge a Mexican restaurant by how their rice and beans are because if they care about those items then there is usually a lot of love in the food.  

So overall this is just another run of the mill Mexican restaurant and it's in a gas station so no points there either.  I will have to go to Anthem to try the real Roberto's so I can really cross it off my list.
