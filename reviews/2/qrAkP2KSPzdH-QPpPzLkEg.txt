My go to place is Chipotles but frequently go to Qdoba when it's convenient. Today I was unimpressed. The service was great, quick but the brown rice which isn't really brown, just white rice with some spicy coloring was totally undercooked. The first couple of bites o was afraid of losing a filling. This location although convenient, is now far down on my list of go to places. I constantly get emails with coupons to help boost their sales (presumably). Quality control on their food might be a bit more wise.
