We have been going to Maria's since we moved here 2.5 years ago, but the quality has taken a real dive in the last few months.  The last time we went a month or so ago, the food was so bad, I'm not sure we will go back.  My husband thinks there may be new owners, as the usual people were not there when he ordered.  And the food was really so different from what we usually get here.

The carne asada was not even a little asada.  It was bland, fatty, and tasted more boiled than grilled.  The salsa was watery and flavorless.  Not at all what we were used to from this place. Very disappointed as it used to be authentic Mexican in a sea of Sonoran, that we don't really care for.

Also, I don't really agree with everyone else's description of this place as a "hole in the wall" or dive.  The restaurant is small but clean, and it is located in a fairly new shopping center very typical for taco joints, at least in most other areas of the country I have been to.  The place is also very low on the stereo-typical Mexican decorations.
