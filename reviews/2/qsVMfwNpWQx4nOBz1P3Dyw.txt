This place, which caught my eye en route to the Shadyside Mad Mex, is entertaining solely for its brazen ineptitude and fair to average food.  The friendly, but totally dizzy and distracted and ditzy,  servers are amusing to watch as they wander around in a stupor...basically kids new to the summer job, but they need some guidance and instruction. I ordered a frozen Margarita.....I was told it would take a half hour to make!!!   Talk about being wasted away again in NON-Margaritaville!!!!  The tacos were of the Taco Belle school......just okay.  Their home made chips are good, though.  Maybe they need that guy on TV that whips whacky restaurants into shape.....although this place seems pretty successful. Folks were flocking in like sheep to the trough.  I will try it again....they gotta improve at some point.
