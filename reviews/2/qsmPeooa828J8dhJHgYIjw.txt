In a word, too expensive.

The food is creative and fun, but it's not at a price point that most of the people who would be interested in this place are at.  Their chips and salsa is pure highway robbery too.  They charge $5.75 for it and must make about $4.00 per order.  My burrito (the Sheh-Meh-Neh) was actually pretty good, but there was something in it that tasted off.  It could have just been that one burrito, but I couldn't finish it---and that's not because it's a decent-sized burrito.  I ended up spending close to $16 on a burrito and chips, and I admit that the shock I felt then (I didn't realize the chips were so expensive) is infecting this review.  It may, in fact, be "New Mexican Food" but it's priced for the Nouveau Riche.

I would try other items on their menu, but I would much rather spend $10 elsewhere.  Perhaps some night when I'm hammered and money is flowing out of my pocket as fast as alcohol is pouring into my liver.  Until then, Adios.
