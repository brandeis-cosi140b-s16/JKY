I came here as it was somewhat close to the airport and I had to drop someone off there. Anyway, I chose this place because of the glowing reviews that it had. I'm not quite sure what the hubbub is all about. Although the lady at the register was very nice, the food was nothing to write home about. We ordered the chicken taco, tripe taco, jaz burrito, and a large horchata. The food was on the greasy side and there wasn't much to top the taco with. There was a bar with lettuce, pico de gallo, and different hot sauces, but no beans, cheese, rice, or avocado. The same could be said for the burrito. The real downer here was the tripe - it was WAY overcooked, hard, and had a slight livery taste to it. You could tell that the tripe itself wasn't very fresh. The best part of the meal was the horchata, but that was just decent and not the best I've had. Next time I'm at the airport, I think I'll stick with La Frontera.
