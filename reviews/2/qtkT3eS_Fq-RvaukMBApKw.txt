The food is very expensive and tastes very bland.  The carnitas had no flavor, dousing it with salsa didn't help either.  Their beans, a hallmark of good Mexican food, are smokey flavored.  Maybe as an option this would be okay, but most people do not want or expect smoke flavored refried beans.  The shrimp in the fajitas was good, but not worth me going back for.  The place is beautiful, and in my neighborhood, too bad I won't be returning.  When I left I was jonesing for good old Filibertos, just down the street.
