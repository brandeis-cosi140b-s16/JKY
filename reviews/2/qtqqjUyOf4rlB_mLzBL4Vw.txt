Macayo's is a restaurant that I have been to many times throughout my entire childhood. When seated you are met with chips, along with a mild and hot salsa. This location is great as it is close the the UNLV campus. The down side is the service is slow, and never ever friendly. It seems as though ever time I have been to this location I am lucky to get a water refill, and I am never greeted with a smile during anytime of my meal. It seems as though I am always "bothering" the server. 

This visit I got the fish tacos, with a chipotle sauce. The lunch portion is great, giving you two tacos for less than $11. I do not eat the beans or anything else, so I am not a fair judge there. Other than the food, this particular location as become known to me for their bad service.

If you are looking for a typical Mexican restaurant, and are prepared to wait patiently for refills and service, this is a great place to grab a bite to eat.
