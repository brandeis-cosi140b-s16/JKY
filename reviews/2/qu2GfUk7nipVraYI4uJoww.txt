I'm seriously confused by all the positive reviews. My husband's co-worker said this place was good. We've driven by many times and it's always crowded so we gave it a try last night.

The interior is nothing to write home about. Maybe the divey look is what they are going for so I won't knock it. Surprisingly, they have a decent vegetarian menu. I ordered the veggie fajitas, no rice and no beans. I'm used to the fajita being served in a mini skillet that's sizzling hot with goodness......NOPE. What I received was a hot plate with diced vegetables, a side of corn tortillas and a side of guac & sour cream. The veggie mixture consisted primarily of tomatoes and carrots. Where are the bell peppers??? The veggies were not marinated or seasoned so I relied heavily on the salsa to punch up the flavor. My husband got the carne asada plate which came with rice & beans and tons of cheese melted on top. He too relied heavily on the salsa. I will say that the wait staff was friendly.

If you want Americanized Mexican food then go here. If you want an extensive tequila selection then go here. I don't care for either therefore I will not be back.
