Maybe it was what we ordered but I was quite dissapointed. Having walked in after seeing such good reviews, I guess I had high hopes.
The restaurant itself is nice-good lighting and ok ambience.
We were offered water as soon as sat down so that was good. The server brought out a complimentary and generous helping of tortilla chips and salsa. The chips did not seem too fresh and the salsa was bland.
He came back to take our order a few minutes later. I order veg chilli rellano and D ordered the veg Quesadilla. The roasted tomato sauce that the chilli rellano came with was ok, and I somewhat liked the flavor of the roasted potato pieces but the rest did not have much flavor. Even though I had requested my dish to be spicy, it was not. I tasted the quesadilla and felt that the black eyed peas that were used to top the dish to have a weird flavor. Took a small bite of the quesadilla and it was dry and quite tasteless.
I wanted to try this place but maybe we went on an off day. For a saturday night, the place was not that busy and seemed to have lots of servers just roaming around aimlessly. Even with that, they took some 15 minutes to collect our credit card and bring it back after bringing out the bill.
