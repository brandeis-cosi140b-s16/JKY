This is only in reference to the veggie burrito:  Stick with the meats.  The Veggie burrito costs more than the fish and equal to the other meats (wha???), but serves up less... The beans are flavorful, but other than that it's just the boring standards, too much rice, a few slices of peppers and onions, some cheese, and a couple shreds of lettuce... I wish I had paid less and grabbed the mahi-mahi again...
