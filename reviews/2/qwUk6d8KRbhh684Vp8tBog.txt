Habaneros could be cool because it's Mexican American food seen through the lens of the Midwest, but it's got to fix a lot.

Positive #1: It's cheap
I suppose cheapness is important to some people. When I rotate things through my everyday I definitely am concerned about cheapness, but it has to be good first. But if I were really concerned about being cheap I'd probably avoid fast food and do things like farmer's markets...

Positive #2: There are options
Being picky is what makes me the discriminating diner that I am. But format isn't as important as, you know, flavor and taste. The difference between taco and burrito is minimal. One is more shareable. The other holds well. Neither is optimal. The burrito rolling technique leaves a lot to be desired.

Negative #1: It's not competitive
I feel like the jerk who has to say it, but you have to. This place really can't compare to chain burrito joints. Staff at either popular chain both a) knows more about their product and b) is faster. I can't get excited about your product if you're not excited about your product.

Negative #2: It's not unique
If the mechanics behind your chain aren't better than your competition, your product might as well offer something different. I'll stray from something great for something different merely because I'm interested.

Being more Madison or more Wisconsin or even just a little weird and better put together would make this place a lot more interesting.
