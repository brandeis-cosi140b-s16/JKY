Worse Pollo Loco I visit. Everytime drive thru takes too long when its full and empty. They always forget something. One of the managers is so busy playing around, he has no time to manage. Therefore the employees are a reflection of that and get mediocre service. The food is actually cooked well but again, you can only wish to get what you paid for. It sucks that the staff service is what factors into my going to eat there. If you can go to a different Pollo Loco, I recommend you are better off.
