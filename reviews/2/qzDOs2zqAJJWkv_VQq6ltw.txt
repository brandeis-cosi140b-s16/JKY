Was so excited after hearing all the hype about this place. Looked cool, dishes sounded interesting. But, that is where it ended. Our service was SO terrible. By terrible, I mean....what service? We rarely saw our waitress. Our food came out at such totally different times over the course of an hour that some people at our table of 8 were finished long before the others even started. The food was meh. I was expecting better or even more interesting than what hit my tastebuds. Any higher end sushi place has similar, and even better flavor combos now. The one highlight was the mushroom tacos. We all agreed it was our favorite. I'd recommend to go to see and be seen, hang in a cool spot, but don't come hungry.
