Meh.

I was shocked to see the Greek Isles gone, but decided to try this place out anyway (after all, who doesn't love a taco?)

I had the chicken tacos and wow, they were very underwhelming.  There was a massive pile of raw cabbage on the taco, with a little bit of chicken on top of it, then the usual garnishes.  It was very dry and just bland.  The chicken didn't have much flavor at all.

The waitress warned me when she brought the salsa out that it was outrageously good and very addictive.  I thought the salsa tasted like crap, almost like store bought.

There are way better options around.
