Grab a fruit parfait at one of the satellite food places or something and spare yourself. 

Sure, airport food is usually not super-great and my expectations were adjusted accordingly...but I HAVE had good quesadillas at airport spots before. Heck, a Chili's does a better job than this place. The quesadilla was greasy even for a quesadilla. I had instant food regret as my stomach attempted to run away from its impending doom. 

You get about 6 chips with your order and absolutely nothing hints at freshness--the pico de gallo is in its own neat little container that it's been living in for quite some time. Dang, man, would some lettuce or a freshly chopped tomato kill you? 

The service was really good though; our waiter was friendly and prompt and awesome. The food was not his fault.
