Visited Casa Reyna in the basement of their strip district location off 21st and Penn avenue for lunch on Good Friday.  Their ambiance downstairs is decidedly cool and feels appropriate given the genre of food.

My co-worker and I opted for the special of the day: verde chicken enchiladas.

The chips and salsa were good.  The enchiladas were OK, but nothing special.  The chicken was tender, but it was just overly boring and nothing to make me say, "Wow!"

What deserves special mention is the horrible service.  We were seated quickly, and then sat awhile waiting for our server.  He eventually made his way over, and after repeating our order a couple of times (due to language difficulties), we waited for our food.

A decent amount of time had elapsed, but our chips and salsa were nowhere to be found.  Our chips showed up, and then thirty seconds later our lunches showed up.  I would have rather had the chips instantly while we were waiting for our food.

After the food was delivered, no one checked on us for an extended period of time.  Since we needed to get back to work, we flagged down the manager (our server was too busy setting up tables to cater to the ones he already had), and asked for our check.  Instead of the manager getting our check himself, he tells our already in-attentive server to get it.  We never interacted with the server after the initial placing of the order.

More time elapses.....

Now we are getting mad, because we've waited about 20 minutes after asking for our check, and the dirty dishes are still sitting in front of us.

It wasn't until we stood up, put our jackets on told the manager that we were leaving did he finally bring the check.

tl;dr: Food was ok, service was horribly slow and inattentive for lunch.
