Three words....Everything Needed Salt 

We came for lunch during the week and it was completely empty at 12:30 in the afternoon. Only one other couple came in while we were dining in. 

I ordered a chicken salad and my husband got a pork burrito. The meats were the only thing I had that actually had salt on it, and a little too much at that. 

You can get romain or cabbage on your salad and I decided to mix the two for a little more texture and I am so glad that I did because almost everything else was over cooked and soggy. 

It's your basic diy: salad, bowl, burrito & nachos with some very similar toppings that you would see at chipotle only with a Hawaiian twist. 

I got fajita veggies: under seasoned &  incredibly soft and oily. 

The corn salsa: under seasoned, and the corn was overcooked and chewy. 

The pico: under seasoned & did not taste fresh. 

The salsas were all under seasoned. I tried them all and went back because after I started eating my salad I realized it needed some heat and I thought I had asked for the spicy salsa. I went and asked for a side of their spicy salsa and brought it back and realized that I already had it on my salad but it didn't have much heat to it. 

The girls working were so nice and they offered us some samples of their meat but they were out of beef so we were only able to try the chicken and pork. 

I think this place could be excellent if they got their seasoning down and cooking time on the veggies right. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case at this time. 

They also gave us a sample of their coconut dessert bar and that was the only thing I ate that was properly salted. A dessert bar...
