Black Chile was the name of the previous restaurant that occupied the space. Just a tidbit. Now to the review:

The hostess was very nice and polite to us and we were greeted quickly. A major plus in my book.  We really didn't have to wait on a Friday because a sit at the bar opened up...I am walking to the bar with my wife. My nose is assaulted with the worst smell, the smell that only comes from bars that make fruity drinks and use fresh ingredients.  I can't knock 'em but they need candles or something.  

Too the food we go:

Salsa and chips. Check.  The salsa is legit.  I could order that all day.  
Fajita's. Meh...salty, salty, salty. Good portion but you will need water.  

Overall thoughts:
I am trying to step out of my box because I am a creature of habit. Ya...I prolly won't go back.
