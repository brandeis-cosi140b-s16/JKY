I'm not sure how this place has so many good reviews because it seems like the exact sort of place that would be on a TV restaurant fix show. The menu is really eclectic in a confusing sort of way. There is asian food, mexican food, cajun food, greek food, bbq, american, etc. The inside of the restaurant is unspectacular and had an awful odor when we visited. We sat outside in the patio area, which is definitely charming. The outside area is the only reason this place is 2 stars instead of 1.

Prices on the menu are high, for drinks and for food. This would be okay if the drinks and food were better. My $12ish margarita was pretty much all sweet & sour mix. The cheese enchiladas were average and I didn't care too much for the sauce (really spicy without much else flavor). 

The outside area is really cute and adorable. If the drinks were cheaper it'd be a great spot to sit out & relax (and then eat food somewhere else).
