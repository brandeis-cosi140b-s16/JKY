No. Not the one! 
After a good wait, we find out breakfast ends at 11am. On Brunch Day? I am sorry but Sunday is Brunch day and breakfast should be available till at least 2pm. Your rules.  Fair enough. 
The service: rushed: guy was so busy I felt his stress as I took my time deciding. Pleasant, but clearly busy! 

The place was clean, loud and lacked ambience and charm.
All of which I could live with, had the food been outstanding. 
If you know me, you know I can eat. I don't leave food behind especially when it comes to my comfort food like beans and rice. Both came piping hot but lacked flavor! There was no soul in this food. The Machaca looked great with fresh jalapenos and tomato but yet again lacked seasoning. Sadly, I did not mop my plate clean with the very good flour tortilla that was served with my meal. 
My husband's combo was as generic as they come. 

Over priced with too long of a wait for what is essentially generic Mexican- American food that lost it's authentic soul somewhere along the way, so I don't suspect that the Chilaquiles would have saved this review!
