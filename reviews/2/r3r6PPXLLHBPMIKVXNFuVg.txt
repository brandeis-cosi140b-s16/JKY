I do agree they have some of the best green sauce but this restaurant fails in so many ways. 

When you order you see the buckets of meat sitting there in open air behind counter. Second everything is microwaved. Have you ever microwaved shredded cheese on a styrofoam plate? It's not great. 

Better options in old town include America's taco shop and Julio's too where dinner is actually cooked and not thrown on plate and microwaved. I wouldn't recommend it.
