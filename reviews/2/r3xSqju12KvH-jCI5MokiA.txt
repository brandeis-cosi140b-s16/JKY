Other meat i tasted was ok but carne asada was the worst meat cut i have ever had and i am not picky at all.  I even lived in mexico for months. Eaten Mexican all my life.


Shredded meat is ok but carne asada was worse chewing than bubble gum.  Maybe thats the secret of this place.  Buy cheap meat and shreds it so someone can actually swallow without chewing.
