The food is great. We love the chips and quesadillas. I had a salmon salad that was really good. I've not had anything that wasn't tasty. 

The location is great. Midtown CLT is a fun and growing community next to the river and the greenway. There are condos and apartments popping up everywhere, and there are great places to eat. Parking is nightmarish on this end of Midtown, though. The Trader Joes garage is a real disaster of civil engineering

The reason for the low score is that the service has always been terrible. We've put up with it because we liked the food but it is consistently bad. One of the reasons you decide to eat at a Mexican restaurant is for the chips and salsa you get from the beginning. Today, they kept telling us for an hour that they were "waiting on the chips" to be made. It seemed like joke; like we all knew there were no chips. W e never got our chips.
