Disappointing.  I like the idea behind this chain (fresh ingredients, naturally raised meat), but was expecting slightly more for the price.  I ordered the carnitas fajita burrito.  The rice was great and the salsa tasted fresh, however the peppers and onions were undercooked to the point they were still crispy and the onions so hot, I could still taste them an hour later.  Maybe my experience was an exception, but I won't be in a hurry to try it again.
