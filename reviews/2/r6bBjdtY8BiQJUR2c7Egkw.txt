We sat in the lounge because the Colts were playing the Cardinals and found a table with a great view of the many TVs. That was probably the best thing about the evening. 
The corn chips were warm and fresh but unfortunately only came in a very small soup bowl. We did order more and they came but at the same time as our food. 
We had to order pico de gallo as the complimentary chips only came with salsa. The pico de gallo was ok but not fresh and not worth ordering. The salsa was interesting. Not my favorite, but at least tasted fresh. 
I had a miller sharps and I don't think I have ever had a colder "beer". Of course Miller Sharps is nonalcoholic but either way, very nice and cold. 
I ordered the carne asada. It was not real flavorful. It was tender and good but not great. It actually tasted like a decent steak but I wanted that special spice that makes it Mexican carne asada. It did not have it. 
My wife had the beef carne picado and you should too...if you like your dish to have two jalapenos to each piece of tasteless beef. I guess I can't say it was tasteless, it tasted boiled to me. My wife ate most of it but the two little pieces i had were enough for me. I could only muster up enough courage to have on chunk of jalapeno as well. I really enjoyed the re-fried beans that came with her meal. Unfortunately mine came with regular beans that were not that great. 

The service was very good. Pleasant, quick and friendly. 
I wont go back, I wish I had read some of the reviews first.
