This place used to be quite good but I think they may have had an ownership change recently.  Over the past 12 months or so we have seen the quality of the food and service level both drop to unacceptable levels.

The food is overall average - the fajitas down right poor and the drinks very inconsistent.  They do get somewhat busy with a bar crowd but that too seems inconsistent so when they do get busy the service gets very bad.

When service deteriorates the Manager (or owner, I'm not sure) seems to hide from customers. 

Overall, make the trip down to Shea Blvd and find much better at better prices.
