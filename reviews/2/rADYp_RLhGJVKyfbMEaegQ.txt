The staff are unfriendly except the young man this morning. Not one smile from the 2 girls... they only serve breakfast in the a.m. although i am unsure why i couldnt get veggie bowl unless the rice wasnt ready??  My kid had the bacon breakfast burrito, said it was ok. You can get a drink and guac added to your meal for 2.99 but no chips so unsure what the point of the guac is... wont be back even though i come to the airport 2-3 times a year... not because of the food, but because of the 2 girls... the airport is miserable enough....
