I would guess it has been between 10 and 12 years since we have dined at Abuelo's. It was relatively close to an event we were attending and we decided to give it another try.

This restaurant used to be fantastic when it first opened. Not so much anymore. Back in the day they had a medallions of filet mignon in a chipotle cream sauce that would knock your socks off it was so good. That item has been gone from the menu for years (which was largely why we stopped going) and the place has only gone downhill from there.

I ordered a chicken angel hair dish with veggies in a cream sauce and it was bland and awful. The sauce tasted like it was from a can or bottle: terrible. The chicken was bland, flaccid and worthless. The veggies, although fresh and crisp added nothing to the dish.

My husband, who ordered a chimichanga, was also unimpressed with his meal and said, "there is no reason to ever come back here."

All that said, the service was good and the chips were light crispy and warm and the salsas were good, but that was not enough to salvage the meal or create any expectation that we will ever return or tell anyone to go there.
