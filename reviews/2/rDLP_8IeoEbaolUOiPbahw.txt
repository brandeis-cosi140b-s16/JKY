Champaign Chipotle sucks. 

Honestly, I love Chipotle. I've had it in numerous places, always enjoyed a big juicy burrito, but this one... The worst of the worst. My burrito was half-sized, and most of the ingredients were overhelmed by rice and beans. Barbacoa was tough and dry... Rice was dry too, Corn was pale and weird. Pretty much all of the ingredients tasted different!

Never again.
