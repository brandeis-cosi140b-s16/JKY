This is a Mexican restaraunt, I went there for a meetup.com event.
I was not impressed with the atmosphere, service or food.
the seating is too close together and uncomrtable. 
The food was bland.
The service was not very profesional.
My frozen strawberry frozen margarita tasted like a fruit smoothie with no alcohol.
The only bright spot was the outdoor area with the authentic mexixan tiled steps, which I took a picture on.
This place is a dud. I will not return.
