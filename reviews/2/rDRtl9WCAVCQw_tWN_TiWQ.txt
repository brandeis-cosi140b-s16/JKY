This place was just O.K.  I have been in AZ for almost 2 years now, and I can honestly say that it is my least favorite Mexican restaurant thus far.  

Pros: 
-The waitress was awesome. She was both waiting tables AND cooking--now that's skill right there. 
-The chips were amazing. The salsa was alright, but it kind of had a pizza flavor because of the oregano. 
-The rice and beans were delicious! 

Cons: 
-They upcharge for EVERYTHING. Want to share? That's an extra $1.50. Also, they charge $1 extra for chicken--yes, chicken, one of the cheapest meats out there. Oh, and it's an extra dollar for pork and/or carne asada. I understand the carne asada part, but pork and chicken? Not so much
-Speaking of chicken, mine was terrible. I got a chicken burrito, and it was just plain, boiled chicken inside a flour tortilla--nothing else. It was seriously just boiled in plain water. There were no spices, no nothing, just plopped a chicken breast in water. Tasteless. My husband's machaca was pretty good though. It tasted like plain roast beef, but it was MUCH better than the gross chicken. 

With all that said, I probably won't be going here again. It was way too expensive for food that was mediocre at best. I much prefer Humberto's down the road. It's cheaper and the food is much tastier.
