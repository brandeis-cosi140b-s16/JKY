Tried to come here for lunch today. Sign advertised 5.95 lunch and I work right across the street, so I thought what the heck... "it can't be that bad." Well we will never know cause they were closed for lunch. No sign, no explanation, just flat out locked doors. Unacceptable.

The only reason this place gets two stars is they offer free chips and salsa with check-in. Fun fact, 94% of mexican restaurants already offer free chips and salsa.
