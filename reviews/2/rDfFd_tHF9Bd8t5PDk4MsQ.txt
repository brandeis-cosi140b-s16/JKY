GOOD: You can buy Mexican sweet bread till closing time if they are not sold out. That is not all they sell. Tenían lo que parecía gelatina, flan, y arroz con leche. The prices are economical and the menu is extensive. Beef, pork, chicken & sea food. Tacos, tostadas, burritos, tortas, enchiladas, chiles rellenos y caldos. 

BAD: 20 minutes before closing they turn off the burners and fryers. I went on Sunday night, the red blinking "OPEN" sign was on but no food could be cooked for me. The salsa station was a horrible mess with spoiled cucumbers. The lady was mopping and was not friendly at all. 

UGLY: the grocery store odor was of rotting potatoes & meat. It smelled extra fishy too. I have been to other grocery stores where they sell fish & shrimp as well, but the smell here is scary. The workers smoke outside in front of the door and they are scary unfriendly. Made me feel like I was going to get mugged. 

I'm very disappointed. I don't think I'm going back there again. I didn't get to taste the food. I went to Cardenas and got a huge pre made chicken salad for $3.99.
