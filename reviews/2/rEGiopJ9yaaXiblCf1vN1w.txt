I have been to this place a few times because friends were already there and talked me into meeting them there. I have never really thought much of the food but it was not bad enough to write a review about. How bad can you mess up mexican food? But recently I dined at Julio G's and the experience was enough to inspire me to share.  First of all the decor has always bothered me there.  Pink Neon reminds me of some 50's diner.   I always expect to see a Milk Shake on the Menu when I sit down.  Also on this must recent visit I had really poor service. It was only slightly busy but it took an inordinate about of time to get a simple combo dish out.  

They thing that stuck me most about Julio G's was how expensive it was.  Nothing on the menu was less then $11 for a combo dish.  Actually I think a 2 item combo was like $10.95 and a 3 Item was like $11.95.  Man, $12 bucks for some marginal Mexican Food? I realize prices have gone up on food and produce.  I am sort of expecting to see some price increases across the board at some of my favorite spots.  But this was what I consider to be way out of line with the quality of food, service and overall dining experience.
