If I had reviewed this place after only eating their food a few times, I would probably have given them 5 stars.. I've ordered delivery from them about 8 times total between the middle of march and now. The first 4 times we had food from them they were excellent! The food was delicious the delivery didn't take very long, the delivery guy was great. Overall, those first 4 experiences were awesome. Since then their service has gone downhill consistently. The last time that we ordered from them our order was entirely screwed up and we had waited 1hr & 50 mins for chile relleno, 2 tacos, 2 horchatas, and a taco salad. All of our food was cold and we only got 1 horchata because the delivery driver dropped the other one. Their tacos are usually great but these were just bad. Anyway, I'm not sure what's been going on at Moreno's in Tempe, but everytime we've ordered from them it's gotten worse. I hope this is temporary because when we first had their food, I loved it.
