The two stars are nostalgia stars for previous meals I have had in the company of my family here and do not reflect the truly pitiful service I endured on my most recent visit. My husband is a great cook and I can churn out tacos and enchiladas that are as good, or better than, the fare at Abuelos. I go to a restaurant like this to be taken good care of and enjoy good service on a day I am too busy to cook for my family. The fact that no one could be bothered to greet and seat me in a nearly empty restaurant (waitstaff actually looked at me waiting and then looked away rather than acknowledge me) and the fact that I couldn't get any help mopping up a spilled drink when I was the ONLY patron in the whole bar part of the restaurant and the bartender and waitress could not have failed to see me running to the bar to get cocktail (!) napkins (in a futile attempt to clean it up myself) is unforgivable. My advice is to enjoy one of the many other excellent dining options in Madison where service includes acknowledging their customers.
