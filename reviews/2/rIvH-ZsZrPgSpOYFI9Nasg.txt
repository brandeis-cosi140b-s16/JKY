I've eaten at this place a few too many times. Everyone in town always seems to want to meet up here, and I'm really not sure why. 

Granted, there aren't too many other great Mexican options in the area (which is sooooo disappointing when I need a nacho fix), but this place isn't really even a "let me settle for this because it's here" kind of place. It's more of a "I should really drive to nearby Charlotte for a more delicious Mexican treat if I'm going to be spending this kind of money and consuming this many calories" type of joint.  

The food always taste soggy to me, whether it's the nachos, the tacos, or anything in between. The service is consistently slow, but the staff is generally friendly...which makes up a tiny bit for everything else...but the price is not right for food this blah.
