This review was meant to be written 3 weeks ago...here it goes..
on the Guatemalan side, we ordered:
Pupusa: like a tortilla with white looking cheese on top.  Nothing special.  Was very filling...but not in a good way.  Annie said she usually gets the one with pork, but they didn't have it at this restaurant
Taquitos:  with shredded pork.  aight.
Tamale:  real chicken, with bones!  this was good.
Sopa de siete mares:  lacks flavor...I took a sip and didn't bother for more
horchata:  tasted too earthy for me.  I am used to the mexican version.  
hot maiz drink:  first few sips were good...then I got a headache...

I don't know what happened here, but maybe it's just the food that we ordered, but I don't think I will be coming back

Sorry :(
