Came here with mom for some dinner after some errands. Mom had a feel for mariscos so we decided to try this place. We arrived about 30 minutes before closing and sat down. We were then told by the waitress that the kitchen is closed for hot dishes but they do have cold dishes since it was near closing time. Although, she wasn't nice about it at all. Ok, we were understanding of that since we knew they needed to clean the floor and do anything else before closing. So we ordered two cocteles de camarón. Pretty easy and simple. As we were finishing up she came by with the check and placed it on our table. I was near to finishing at about 10 after 9 and not nearly 3 minutes go by until she comes by to tell us we need to hurry and pay in such a rude way. I'm big on customer service and that completely changed my mind about the place. I mean the coctel de camarón was good but the service from the waitress was awful due to her rudeness, which makes me not want to return. I know maybe she was tired and wanted to finish her shift but there was still a family of 4 next to us who arrived much later than us and she could have been said it in a much better form. My mom asked her a question in a polite way as I was paying and when the waitress was going to answer she seemed bothered to answer the question. Really?! Bottom line, food was good but service was bad. I mean I've never been to a place where they hurry up their customers to pay. Who does that?! And if that's the case, maybe they should consider changing their closing hour in order to give them enough time to do what they need to do before their actual closing time. Including having their customers pay their bill.
