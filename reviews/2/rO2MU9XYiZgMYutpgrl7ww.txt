Went here with pretty high expectations, especially since they push the whole "Top Chef" thing.  The margaritas, pina coladas, and chips were really good but was disappointed by the fish tacos and the sangria tasted like it didn't even have alcohol in it.  Everyone else liked their entree so maybe everything else is good but I highly recommend staying away from the fish tacos.
