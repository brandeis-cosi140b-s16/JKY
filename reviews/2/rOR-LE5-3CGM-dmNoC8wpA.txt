Went for the first time today after constantly driving by.  First impression was that it was too dark, I had to shine my phone onto the menu to be able to read it.  Then the real issues started with the service being the biggest one.  Took a good twenty minutes to order and then an eternity to get my tacos.  They were okay, nothing great though.  Server came by one to all if o wanted a refill however never brought it out.  Between the mediocre food and terrible service I don't think I'll go back.
