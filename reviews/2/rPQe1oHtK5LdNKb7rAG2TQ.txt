Have eaten here twice.  First time was quite good - but the second time was unremarkable.

First time eating here, had quite a bit of tequila from their large selection - very good.  Also - they had great options for tableside guacamole with interesting options - pepitas, serranos and other items one could add in.  Had the meatball entree in the smoked tomato sauce, was quite good.

Second time I came here (a few months ago) - it was just another unremarkable mexican restaurant - nothing special, standard fare (at an elevated price), had an entree which was a layered seafood enchilada - unremarkable and nothing to remember.

Much better options on and off strip in my opinion for either more interesting (diego, border grill) or more authentic/homestyle (lindo michoacan) mexican food.
