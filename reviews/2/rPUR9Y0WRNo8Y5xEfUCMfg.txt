This place is just OK.  If it wasn't for the really awesome salsa then I'd say it totally sucked.  The guacamole was not good...too tangy or something.  The bean dip seemed like it was a can of refried beans poured into a bowl.  I'd probably go back to have some more of that yummy salsa and to try something different to see if it could redeem them...but I'm not counting on it.
