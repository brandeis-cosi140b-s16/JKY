OK I'll go 2 stars. We went about 630PM on Sept 16, 2015. There were 7 of us. My chimichanga was not covered in sauce, because the guy asked me if I wanted red or green and I took the less picante (hot) and he said that'd be red, but the sauce was dark brown and in a tiny metal cup on the side. So far so good. But !!!!!!!!! the shredded beef was super, super salty, a pain to eat....the salt just RUINED THE TASTE. Order taken reasonably soon, but a lot of confusion as to who ordered what when they came with the plates. They ID'd each dish and asked whose it was. So my chimi was kinda' dry and again, horribly salty. I ate half and brought it home. Still salty. My wife was very happy with what she got, but for my dinner, 2 stars, no mas, es todo (no more, that's all). Lo siento mucho (I'm very sorry). :-(
I don't think I'll go back. I like BACKYARD TACOS up on University Dr in Mesa a WHOLE LOT BETTER.
