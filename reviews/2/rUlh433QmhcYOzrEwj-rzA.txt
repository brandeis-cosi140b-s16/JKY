Oh boy. I have to update my previously GREAT review.  Dropped in for late lunch. The watermelon margarita was still yum, but for the soggy piece of watermelon garnish. Ordered the grilled mahi mahi fish tacos and...they arrived smelling like low tide. I picked up a piece of the fish with my fork and nibbled...OLD. Sent back. Re-ordered with a shredded chicken burrito and it was tiny little pieces in goopy red sauce with tasteless green sauce on top of a gummy burrito. Seriously, like a mouthful of sodium gravy. OMG. Back it went...and I was done. Staff was okay about it. Got the check and the waitress says "My manager took off the two," I'm thinking..yeah, I'm not paying for anything I didn't eat! LOL.  Paid for my $8.59 margarita (which they had these drinks for $4 on a weekend last we stopped in and had them with the former fish tacos that were good and didn't smell) Got out of there and went to BJs to eat lunch.  Thinking I'm not arriving back here anytime soon.  Inconsistent food, consistent drinks with seriously fluctuating pricing.
