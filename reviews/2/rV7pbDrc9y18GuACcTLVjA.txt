Awful food!! Shells are not crispy, partially cooked, meat has NO NO NO flavor.  Their combinations stink - People don't just eat Enchilada's! Poor choice on the Taco salad. Rolled tacos are called Taquitos.  There is no juiciness with the Fajitas, the prices are out of sight. Re-fried Beans are usually mashed so there are bits of beans, but not whole uncooked beans...disgusting! Kid's menu goes to 10, what are 11, 12  year olds? Adults? 

Your menu needs an overhaul. The bathrooms are small and smell like mildew. Waitresses take forever to get you drink refills - unless its a bar item. The space in the building is so cramped you can't sit 4 comfortably at a table. 

The old green color on the walls is so uninviting. Why not decorate like an authentic Mexican restaurant? Horse pictures - is old west, not Mexican. American / Mexican restaurant - maybe. 

Anita's Cocina is tired, needs a desperate update. Get with today's technology offer free wifi. Take your outside decorations inside, call restaurant impossible...you need help!
