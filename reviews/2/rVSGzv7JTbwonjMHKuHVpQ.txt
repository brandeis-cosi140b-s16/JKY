Booooooooo! Thumbs Down!

To be exact on my rating, it is a 1.5 stars. I reward 1 star for the decor (and because we have to) and another .5 stars for effort, and then rounded up to get a measly 2 stars.

Our order was the Phoenix Chicken or something like that, Guacamole, and the 20 vegetable fried rice. All dishes were not up to par in terms of taste. The chicken and the fried rice were recommendations from our server.

The fried rice was bland and it was maybe the equivalent of 3 bowls of rice at a chinese restaurant. This is not a lot of fried rice for about 20 dollars. 

The chicken was actually a cornish hen I believe. It tasted okay, but I would have preferred a chicken from el pollo loco, to be honest. That dish was also in the neighborhood of 20 dollars or more, and if you know how small cornish hens are, you might agree that 20 something dollars for that amount of hen is stupid. 

The guacamole was a whopping 15 dollars. This was honestly the only thing we ordered that I enjoyed, but it wasn't worth 15 dollars.

The service was pretty good until our server asked if the fried rice she recommended was good, and I replied, "It's okay." She then asked, just okay? And I confirmed, " Just okay." Then she quickly got our bill without saying another word, or even a thank you or anything, just dropped the bill. When we paid, it was another silent transaction void of any actual speaking on her part.

Water doesn't come with ice. The decor in the place was interesting, but I would never come here again.

To sum it all up, the portions were small, the price tag was high, especially for substandard -tasting food. We came here because we wanted to give it a shot. My rating isn't solely based on portion size, because I would honestly prefer fried rice from Panda Express and El Pollo Loco if portion size was the same and prices were the same. Please don't waste your money at this restaurant.
