Let me preface this review by saying that I don't frequent Mexican restaurants, so I can't really compare TP's to many others in town.  That said, they seemed QUITE AVERAGE & I noticed nothing that wowed me at all. There were the usual chips & salsa (two kinds) brought out before the food.  Had lunch with a friend and ordered the grilled "large" chicken quesadilla. Hmm...quite plain actually, I was kind of surprised.  The only thing on/in it was cheese and chicken, with a VERY small smattering of lettuce and tomato along the edges of the plate; more decoration than anything.  Asked for the sour cream to be on the side but that didn't happen - slightly annoying but not a huge deal.  I mean overall it was ok, but there just wasn't anything TO it for $7...fairly cheap but I was underwhelmed.  I've had much better quesadilla's as appetizers at non-Mexican restaurants...and made much better ones at home if I do say so myself.  Ok, so is TP a bad spot, no.  Is it a place I would make an effort to go back to, NO.
