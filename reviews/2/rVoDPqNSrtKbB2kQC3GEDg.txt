I know it's airport food, but it's still very overpriced. There was old food and drinks on every empty table when we walked in, and it took forever for them to clean up so we could sit down. The food is decent and the atmosphere is nice, but the service and price makes it hard to give the Jose Cuervo Tequileria more than 2 stars.
