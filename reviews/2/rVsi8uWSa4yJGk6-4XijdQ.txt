I did not have the greatest experience at this El Pollo Loco location the other day.  Service was slow.  The floor was stickier and more gross than that of a movie theatre.  I was handed a cup and then told the ice machine was broken.  They did offer to fill it with ice in the back but it seems to me that should have been done before handing me an empty cup.  They did not have any iced tea or horchata from the looks of it.  And the soda was all coming out with little more than water and a splash of syrup.  It was watered down and extremely flat.  This place has really gone down hill lately.  The one saving grace was that they did, infact, honor the coupon that brought me in there.  I received an accurate order and it was good.  Every other part of this place needs some serious improvement.
