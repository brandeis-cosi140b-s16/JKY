I hate giving this place two stars because the waitress was really awesome, the restaurant was very clean and festive but the food was not good at all.  My family and I decided to try this place for their happy hour.  

I ordered the grilled jalapenos which is described on their menu as  grilled jalapenos stuffed with a blend of Monterrey and jack cheese, wrapped in bacon and finished with a cilantro dressing.....sounds good right?......what I actually got were six sorry excuses for jalapenos, burned at the bottom, seeds NOT removed with sprinkled cheese and bacon bits!  Not wrapped in bacon and because of the seeds they were so hot you could not eat them.

The next item I ordered was Juana's combo platter.  This came with a tamale, 2 mini chicken chimi's, 2 taquitos, a mini quesadilla and guacamole.  Sadly my tamale was cold in the middle.  It had a green olive in it that was somewhat frozen....yuck.  The other items were good.

The third and final item was their South of the Border nachos....you could tell they had made this item first because the cheese was congealed so that when you went to lift a nacho, you could lift the entire plate.  Once we peeled off the "shield of cheese" the center was total mush, as it had been sitting there for a while.  the only chips that were crispy were the ones around the edges.

I was really sad that my family and I did not like the food because our area needs a really good mexican food place.  They do have really good salsa but their chips were store bought, as in I think it was a bag of tostidos rounds and tostidos regular chips mixed together.  

So if you want terrible food with great customer service you can go to la casa de juana.
