Uch, I cannot get over how mediocre/borderline bad this place is. This had nothing to do with Gallo Blanco goggles either. The tacos are just ok- chewy bland meat, dry chicken, overly salted everything. I decided to give it another try today despite our bla first visit, because I REALLY wanted to like it. My husband ordered the Pollo Asado platter and the chicken breasts, pounded super flat, were dry as a bone! He ate about three bites and was done. I had a salad, which was fine- but it's a salad- you don't have to cook salad. We ordered two desserts which came with ice cream. When they brought out the dessert, we asked about the ice cream and the server went to check - coming back to say they "don't even sell ice cream." I pointed to the specials board in the back of the restaurant and it clearly said "with ice cream." To this she replied, "oh yeah we have to erase that." The brownie dessert was so bad- I mean dry as a bone crumbly terrible bad. I'm pregnant and eat almost anything- especially chocolate brownie- and I wanted nothing to do with this thing. Maybe the ice cream could have hidden it. On top of everything, the service was SO painfully slow for the restaurant being near early. After we ordered, it took almost thirty minutes to get our food and another thirty after that between waiting for dessert, check, etc. The first thing I did after my meal was text another foodie friend to tell her to stay away! So so so sad :(
