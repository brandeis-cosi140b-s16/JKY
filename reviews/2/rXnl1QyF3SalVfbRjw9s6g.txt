Expect the same food as any Chipotle.  Service could use some improvement at this location. I gave it a try since I have been overseas for several years, and wanted to see what the rave about Chipotle was, but honestly here in Arizona, I have found much better tacos and burrito at a whole in the wall Mexican place, and for less money.
