I like this place but they can't get an order right for nothing ! I would have died already if I was actually allergic to beans. I said no beans about 3 times, took a bite and got a mouth full of beans  this has happened twice already and I had to drive all the way back to get a new one..

Service is everything too me so 2 stars
