I came here really hoping that I was going to get some good Mexican food while I was in Phoenix. Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed. I think they spent more time decorating the place like it was a Greek Orgy room than focusing in on either the food or the service. 

I ordered enchiladas that came out gloppy and tasteless. My companion ordered vegetable fajitas where the grilled vegetables were either soggy, burned, or quite possibly both. Despite it being a quiet time there (3pm), the server appeared rarely as they seemed to be overreliant on their new table touch screens rather than actually paying attention to their customers.

Quoting another reviewer, this place is very "cold and corporate" Considering the plethora or choices in Mexican places in Chandler, I'd suggest almost anywhere else, including taco stands that charge 1/4 as much.
