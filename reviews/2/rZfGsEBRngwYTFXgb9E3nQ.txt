I am from California and there is plenty of quality Mexican food joints. So i have a good idea what good Mexican food tastes like... From the minute i stepped into this place i was not impressed.
The kid at the front register was a bit douchy for my liking... He must have mistaken me for Latino because he laughed when i said i wanted a steak torta! Steak translates to asada kid use your brain and again laughed at the way i said jarritos... get over yourself kid and take my order. like i said above he was just kinda douchy!

Ordered a steak torta and a small cheese quesedilla.... the torta was mostly bread and lacking in meat... the meat was tasty but just not enough of it.. the sandwich was all bread filler....  bread was good but i didnt pay for a breadwhich! ha

quesedilla was standard fare; small and greasy... 

The salsa bar was ok but i mean maybe you guys can label the fucking salsa? 

All in all if i was visiting arizona gain i would not come back to this place.
