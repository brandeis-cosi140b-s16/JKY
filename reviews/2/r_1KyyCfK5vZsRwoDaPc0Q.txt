This is the first Mexican restaurant I went to that did not serve complementary chips and salsa. The higher priced portions of enchiladas and shrimp tacos (I think it was) only serve two where everywhere else I go its three.  Factoring that all in its too high priced for me, especially since it is nothing special at all.  Our waitress was very nice though.
