I wouldn't bother to go back, but if you want decent Mexican food in that neighborhood it's alright.

Nice enough inside, except for two big TVs in the dining room (actually 3, but the one at the back was not turned on), one TV right above our head blaring a movie in Spanish.  The other TV was blaring a soccer game, and the sound on the TV was broken, going in and out.  It's bad enough to have the flashing TV in your peripheral vision, but two different soundtracks going on, plus people talking and crying kids made us wish we'd asked for takeout and sat out in the car to eat our food.   It was a drag sitting in there.

The food was average.  I had the carnitas and my husband had the flautas.  Lots of food, but not that flavorful.  Rosita's (on McDowell in central Phoenix) has carnitas that are 500% better.
