So the bartender was amazing. Didn't get her name but Amazing. But to the owner, please get away from the Pre Made Margaritas.  They tasted like Lime Gatorade and tequila.  And way over priced for a pre made drink.  We always look for local areas for great food and drinks but a little disappointed.  50 dollars for 4 drinks and one app. Sorry but a one time deal for us.
