I'm not sure what's so great about this place. The take-out food I got the other night was not that good. The chicken taco was soggy. The carne asada taco was okay--good tortilla. The tostada was lukewarm by the time I ate it. Other things I have gotten here have been incredibly greasy. It is cheap, I will say that much. But I guess I prefer Los Taquitos to this place.
