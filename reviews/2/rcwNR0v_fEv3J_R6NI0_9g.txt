My experience here a few weeks ago was a big disappointment. 

My friend and I went before a show at Gammage last week for the 15% off discount with our show tickets - we were so excited to give this place a try! As a lover of all things Mexican food, I can tell you that this place makes a lot of empty promises. 

I had the chicken taco, pulled pork taco, and street rice with a side of guacamole. While the chicken taco was pretty bland, it was definitely the best thing on the plate. Before I ordered the pork taco, I was warned that the mango habanero sauce would be extremely spicy, but I reassured my waitress that I would be fine. Naturally, I was expecting a big bite of flavor after that claim, but was severely disappointed. It tasted like some sort of alcohol didn't cook out completely and the mango habanero didn't have much flavor - just heat. I tried adding the guacamole to give it a lil' flavor, but even that didn't help. Now, the biggest disappointment was the street rice (which shouldn't even be named that). Though the rice was obviously green from cilantro, there was hardly any cilantro flavor AND the rice was undercooked. I actually couldn't even finish eating it. 

Overall, I had really high hopes for this place and hope management sees this post and makes the necessary changes they need in the kitchen.
