I'll preface this by saying we showed up right before closing and it may have affected the quality a bit. This place is very hyped up and we didn't feel it was worth it. We ordered the pork belly tacos, tinga poblana tacos and a torta (which wasn't a true torta).  There was no choice between flour and corn tortillas which probably should have been the first sign, the pork belly and the pulled pork in the torta was hard and overcooked. The pico de gallo overpowered any remaining flavor of the pork belly and nothing had a distinct flavor. It was a very boring and average meal that was barely a step above Roberto's. The atmosphere was cool and beautifully painted as well as a friendly staff, but we all know the real reason we would go.
