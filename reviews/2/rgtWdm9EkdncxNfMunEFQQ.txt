Considering what I read from all the reviews I thought I'd really enjoy Casa Rasta. 

On my visit I ordered the Queso Fundidos with Green Chorizo which was supposed to be "spicy" but it lacked spice and had no flavour definitely wasn't too impressed.

But I didn't let that stop me too much. I then went on to order the Jamaican Jerk Chicken, CItrus Marinated Pork, and the Roasted Pork Tacos. Still a little lack luster in flavour. I don't know when I think Mexican and I think Carribean cuisine i think loud bold flavours. Casa Rasta nice try but you're not doing it for me. 

Maybe I'll try Casa Rasta again but I don't think I'll be making a trip out to Beechview JUST to go to Casa Rasta.
