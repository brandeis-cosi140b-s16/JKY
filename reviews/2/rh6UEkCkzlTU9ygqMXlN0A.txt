Nice little Mexican joint in North Scottsdale - puff puff pass please wink!  Literally, just pass.  Parking is limited for such large place so I wonder what happens during rush hour, or maybe they didn't expect any rush!  The food - tacos, nachos, chimichungas, etc....nothing too impressive, but I can't say I was dissatisfied.  I didn't expect much so I wasn't too disappointed.  I ordered a couple of drinks and maybe I should have ordered more to drown out the sorrow of this experience!  Our service was good at least I can say, but then again we were one of the two customers around :(  - Enjoy...or not.
