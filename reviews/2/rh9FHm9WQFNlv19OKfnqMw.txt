Food is good I prefer Taco Bell, the meal deal is only $5 good price. Not what would call fast food since we waited in the drive thru for 10 mins more then once and last time the order was forgotten. Oh if you dine in make sure you ask for the sauce when you get your food if you can otherwise good luck catching someone later.
