I wanted to like this place because my friends do, but it just didn't happen. I ordered a single chicken taco although it was cool watching the process, the end result was a soggy folded burrito. Was quickly asked if I wanted beans or rice and I asked for rice, and got a half scoop of overly tangy lime and chunky cilantro rice for a three dollar up sell. Although it tasted ok it was disgusting to eat.
