First, my fajitas came out long before any other food. The chicken in the fajitas was sauteed, not grilled or even marinated. Normally, fajitas come with a few tortillas and a separate dish with a selection of goodies that may include cheese and salsa or guacamole. But none arrived. And then the skillet started cooling. I thought they'd bring over tortillas and fixings fairly soon, not to mention my wife's food. No dice. By this time, I was already picking at the flavorless chicken. After a while, my wife's quesadilla arrived, and the waitress finally brought me a plate.  I tried explaining to the waitress that my dish was missing tortillas, and she emerged a few minutes later with fresh corn tortillas. But no other fixings. I asked the waitress if the dish came with cheese, so she brought me a salsa bowl filled with freshly grated cheese. There was a small language barrier, so I didn't try to bargain for any more "fixings". Unless I was confused about how to serve fajitas, it was apparent that neither the cook nor the wait staff were well acquainted with them. Oh well. Probably will not return. My wife's quesadilla was ok.
