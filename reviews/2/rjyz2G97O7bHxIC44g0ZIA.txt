Oh, Taco John's...what did I ever do to wrong you so?

I thought you and me were close, TJ--I mean, back when I was in high school, you were the mad shizz! I always repped you to the heathens who thought running to the border to ring bells was better than your food. Quesadilla--I hardly know her!

But now, now...now you are but a paltry shade of your former self. Did you get taco cancer and are wasting away from the inside?  What happened to making the goodness I used to know?  

Once, TJ--you and me were tight.  We were bros.  We had each others' back.  Now, you're more concerned with half-heartedly throwing me some frozen crap that's been deep fried and drowned in sauce with some brown, wilty lettuce and lifeless tomatoes.  What up with that, TJ?  Is that how you treat your boy now?

I thought I knew you, man.  I thought I knew you.
