This is a place I can't imagine will still be here. First, horrible location. Second it is a large seating area which is almost always nearly empty everytime I pass by or go in.  Third, even though there was only 2 other customers in the place, not a single person approached us as we stood at the front desk waiting to be seated.  15 minutes we stood there waiting for someone to even notice us.  When we finally did sit down, we were again ignored for long periods of time.  Finally left because no one took our order.  

In my humble opinion, you can't succeed with a Mexican Bar and Grill that has high prices for the same food you can get at the corner taco shop, especially in such a location with little foot traffic, poor visibility and bad customer service.
