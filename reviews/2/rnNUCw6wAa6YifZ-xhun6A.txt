Ugh, I'm done with this place.  Tried it a few months back and was not impressed, but decided to give it one more try tonight.  I think the only thing I've liked was the tamale.  My boyfriend liked his enchilada style ground beef burro, but I tried it and didn't care for it.  I had the machaca burro supreme tonight.  The meat was somewhat spicy, but overall it was bland.  The rice has absolutely no flavor, and I love good Mexican rice.  Finally, the cheese crisp was tiny and was anything but crisp.  Plus, everything is overpriced.  I will just pick up Taco Bell next time.
