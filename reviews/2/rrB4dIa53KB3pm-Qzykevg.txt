You can do a whole lot better for the price here. I came here for the first time ever because it was a late night and Chipotle was closed.

I ordered the Ultimate Double Bowl with chicken. 

Here is the description from the website: "Double up on a double portion of delicious citrus-marinated chopped chicken breast or carne asada on top of authentic pinto beans, rice, cabbage and garnished with sour cream, shredded jack cheese, avocado slices and pico de gallo salsa."

1. The chicken was so overcooked. Parts of it were "grilled" (aka burned), and incredibly chewy.
2. Shredded jack cheese? Really? ...Because there was none.
3. "Citrus-marinated" - Hardly. The chicken was pretty tasteless and wasn't marinated in anything.
4. Tiny tiny glob of sour cream and tiny glob of salsa.
5. Mostly beans, rice, and chicken...pretty bland.

My stomach was in knots for the rest of the night after this meal. The quality of the food was just plain poor. I probably won't eat here again, but I try anything twice just to be fair. 

As far as the service, it was good. The drive through was incredibly fast and everyone was relatively friendly.
