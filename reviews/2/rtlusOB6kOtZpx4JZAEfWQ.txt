I got the chimichanga burrito to go and it was overall good other than a few pieces of chicken that were overly cooked and unfortunately when I was almost done I found some sort blue food wrapping small piece in my chicken just a tiny piece but still it shouldn't have been there, I put a picture up of it next to green chive so you could see the difference in color and that it is actually a blue piece of something. Before I end I'd just like to add I would never write something that wasn't true if the food was great with no issues I would totally write a review that was overall great I've got other food from here that was good with no issues such as the nachos but was very disappointed this time with the chimichanga, I'll probably try again and hope this was just a one time mistake because they are overall a great restaurant with good service.
