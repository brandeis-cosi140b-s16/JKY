Went to Rio Rico last night with my wife for dinner.  I had a gift card so I decided to go.  The food is actually very "sanitized" "Western" for me, but then it is expected.  I am the kind of person who is more used to going to a place that tends to be slightly more authentic.  My wife is similar.

My wife ordered a tamal and chicken enchilada.  She said is average, but unfortunately rather salty.  

Me, I ordered crab enchiladas.  It was okay, but again it was rather salty.  

I guess when it comes to Mexican and seafood, we probably should go elsewhere.  It just was not the kind of place that my wife and I would go to again.  Then again, we tend to like things are little more authentic, and that kind of push the envelope a little.
