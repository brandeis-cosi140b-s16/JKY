Not impressed. We went in around 4pm and there was only one table in there. Exterior was really original and set a good vibe, then we stepped inside and I felt like I was in a tattoo artists bedrooom. 

Took about 5-10 minutes for someone to come out of the kitchen to greet us and seat us which was not a good first impression. The salsa bar had good variety but was set up very poorly. The "togo" salsa containers you use to grab you salsas were so small you couldnt even fit a tortilla chip into it, We had to get a plastic spoon to get our salsa onto our chip because there was no metal utensils on the table. They didnt provide us little plates either so our table was a mess before we even started ordering.

As our tacos hit the table the first thing we noticed where that both mine and my husbands plates had big cracks on them. Flea market much?I got the smoked marlin taco which had the texture of canned tuna fish with a minestrone like vegetable concoction on top and the shrimp tacos, pretty decent. The corn tortillas were pretty flimsy though and resembled the storebought el paso brand.

Service was not the best either, our questions about the tacos were answered with finger pointing at the menu and blank looks like...uhh you dunno what achiote rojo is? 

All in all, the fact that we said we should have gone to chipotle instead says everything.
