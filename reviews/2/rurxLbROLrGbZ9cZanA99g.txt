Maybe I'm a hater or maybe there is something wrong with this place but the Starbucks of tortilla based food leaves me with a meh feeling.... Part of it might be the crowd but the other part maybe what I feel reminds me of a blob wrapped up in a whole lot of yuppie tortilla. Obviously many people love this place as they are popping up everywhere. This is either a sign of me being out of touch, maybe even a subconscious attempt to be a food snob or it's just a sign that people will buy into the theme that is being put up by this place on a massive scale. I just know that it's not for me.  This location is always swamped by legions of office workers and students to the point that you will be waiting in a line if you do decide to go here. The place is lively and to be honest if you are looking to meet people maybe even a few girls to talk up it might be a good place to go.
