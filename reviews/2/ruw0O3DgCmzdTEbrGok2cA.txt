Just plain bad all the way around. I had one of those giant fishbowl margarita's and it was way too overly sweet. not a good margarita at all.  I didn't even eat dinner there but tried some of my friends dishes.  The ceviche was a total rip off.  it was like $15 and it came with a tiny tiny portion like honestly its ridiculously how tiny the portion was.  come here for the atmosphere and nothing else.  Don't expect much for food quality here.
