When traveling abroad, I've met multiple people from around the world who would tell me, after I said I was from the States, that they loved NYC.

I've generally replied that NYC is the United States in name only (based on the diversity and the absence of personal motor vehicle worship for a start) and if one wanted to see what 'murica is about and meet the "average [United States of] American" that one needed to get far away from there.

The Tortilla Flat rest stop is far away from there. Exploiting the legacy of the Lost Dutchman and tales of a likely fictional gold mine in the Superstition Mountains (I couldn't make this stuff up if I tried) to create a tourist trap for those "adventurous" enough to venture out in the 110-120 degree desert is also much more in line with the frontier spirit.

Almost everyone who visits here seems to be Caucasian and the average age of adults here is likely upwards of fifty. Call me a hopeless romantic but I'd like to think this is a sign of everyone else having figured out the only gold in them thar' hills is that which is transferred from visitors to the proprietors of this establishment.

No samples because we have no confidence in our products that cost more by volume than hipster favorite Churn, hate the customer if we can get away with it, and giving something away would be socialism. Why do you hate America?

In balance, it is hard to argue with Primus -- The Devil Went Down to Georgia playing anywhere when one walks in, although if Lucifer had found either pricky pear gelato or bottled water that costs more than soda I'm sure he would have been satisfied.

The Tortilla Flat stop is useful as a free bathroom in the gift shop if the kitsch doesn't overwhelm before reaching it but, otherwise, bring supplies if venturing out that way. The Wild Capitalist West preys on the unprepared.
