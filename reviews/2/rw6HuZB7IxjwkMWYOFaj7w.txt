A month ago I wouldn't have had a complaint about this location but after tonight, we won't be going back. It seemed as if the entire staff was new except the guy behind the grill annoyingly yelling out that the veggies/rice/steak was ready. They were way understaffed and poorly managed, come to junk of it no one seemed to be in charge at all. One would think with all the closures of chipotle in other states that they would be doing everything to keep their customers. To top it all off the food was horrible, the rice was undercooked and something had too much water in it as I was left with a puddle in my dish. Yuck.
