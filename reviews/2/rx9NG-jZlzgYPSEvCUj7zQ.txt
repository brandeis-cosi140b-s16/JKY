What the heck just happened?  I love OTB, come here at least once a month, service is always great, food great.  This time I had to check to make sure I was in the right place.  The chips were stale. Our server SS LL OO WW!!!! I am not a big fan a super spicy food which is why I like OTB.  When I placed my order for the new bowls they have I specifically asked the server what spices were in it and he said the hottest thing was the pico, so I asked for it on the side.  The bowl was so spicy (for me) I started to choke when to grab my drink and it was EMPTY, as I am sitting here dying my son is trying to get the server and he is just meandering around the restaurant.  This trip sucked and I won't be back for awhile.  Step up your game OTB, I'm starting to see a lot of negative reviews.
