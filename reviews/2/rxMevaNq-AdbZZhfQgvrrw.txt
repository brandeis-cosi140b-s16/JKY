Every Sunday I get great tacos at a flea market by my house. I found myself with time to kill at the Phoenix airport on a Sunday morning and decided to keep the tradition alive.

I had the chorizo breakfast burrito. It wasn't bad but it wasn't good either.  Just kind if bland and forgettable. I guess I shouldn't expect too much at an airport but if a wagon at a flea market can make great Mexican a full kitchen should be able to do the same.
