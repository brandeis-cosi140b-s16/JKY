Love your food. HATE your happy hour?? What happy hour really. My girlfriend and I were visiting recently and we were so excited to grab a special which happened to be, insultingly enough "cougarita" the night we were there. NOT FUNNY. I was celebrating my 40th and not remotely in the mood to be classified as a "cougar". Plus the "Cougarita" was disgusting!! I asked, and they had no other specials available. Booo!
