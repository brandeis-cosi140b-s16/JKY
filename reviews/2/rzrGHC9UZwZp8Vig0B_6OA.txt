This is actually the first time I have written a food review. I was really excited to see a Mexican restaurant coming to this area.I have a few guys I work with that live in the Cornelius area that have eaten at that location and said good things about it,especially the Margaritas.We tried Taxco 12/24/12. The inside was done nicely to suit a Mexican restaurant. The chips and salsa were good not great. Unfortunatley the Margarita was on the bottom of the list with worst ever and we actually ordered top shelf. I ordered the Cesina as the menu description looked really good. The steak was honestly so thin there would have been no way to cook it and it not be completely dry and it lacked any taste at all. The plate came with rice, not much taste at all,re-fried beans,more soup like,and a small bowl of lettuce with only a few diced tomatoes and onions on top. It looked unappetising and tasted about the same. The service was so that they actually brought each one at the table their food seperately about 2 minutes apart on each.I really want to like this place as it is minutes from our house. I think I will give it another chance and try a more commonly ordered dish. As far as the Margaritas I would recommend passing on, even if they were free.I will review again if I re-visit.
