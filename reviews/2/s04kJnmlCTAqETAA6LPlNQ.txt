I have been to 2 locations, Fish Hatchery and Lien, and both times was uninterested in finishing my meal.  Stale tortillas, bad cheese, bland sauces... go to Taqueria El Pastor or Taqueria Guadalajara for tastier, more authentic meals.

Heck, you can do slightly better just down the road at Casa del Sol.
