I was very excited to try this place out. Read the reviews before I went. 
First off, it took 3 people and 2 separate trips to get a beer and a cold glass. We ordered the Serrano guacamole which was just average it didn't taste fresh. The chips were good, salsa was mediocre at best. There was no heat to any of them, that may be what's one people like but when I'm having Mexican food at least the salsa should have a little kick. 
Then I ordered ONE al pastor beef taco, and it was served on the wrong tortilla. It was ONE taco for Petes sake! 
The rest of my party had been having frozen margaritas and had had 2 already, their third one was brought out on the rocks. 

Service isn't the greatest and their food is mediocre. I'm giving them two stars because at least the place itself was cute, quaint setting in an old church but definitely not enough to come back.
