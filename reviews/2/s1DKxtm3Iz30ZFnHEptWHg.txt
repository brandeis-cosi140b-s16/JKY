I went here several times. It's usually good. The service is usually good.

BUT the reason I put 2 stars is because they need to learn how to train their workers better. I usually get workers that work well. However, today I ordered gauc and chips, barbacoa bowl, and a carnitas quesadilla... and the only items I received were the quac with NO chips and a barbacoa bowl. I think the workers were either new, untrained, or deaf. And the line also literally didn't move for about 10 minutes... two girls were working at the time.. I don't know there names, but they don't do there jobs well and need to find another one.
