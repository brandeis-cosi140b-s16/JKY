Salsa was good, service was good....Food was not something I'll be writing home to tell mom about, one plus is that the chicken in my enchilada was moist, I was pleased with that, beans cold, rice clumped together & flavorless. Shredded beef tacos were flavorless, maybe we came too late at night not sure but GARCIA'S SALT & PEPPER, ONIONS, GARLIC, ETC. HAM HOCKS IN THOSE BEANS SOMETHING PLEASE!!!! Other than that you seem to have a good customer base or your sign is elusive either way good luck
