Food: Overpriced but tastes good
Service: Lacking

We went here with a Groupon.  Our waitress was not friendly.  She served the food, but that's about it. Our appetizer (chile poblano quesadillas) was brought out cold.  It had clearly been sitting on the line for awhile. It was bland. I had the Tortas de Lenteja ($18).  Which were fried patties of lentils and other veggies served on a plate of tomatillo sauce. It was good, but not spectacular.  My companion had the  vegetarian chile relleno($15).  The pepper was stuffed with tasty assortment of veggies. The accompanying cheese enchiladas were doughy. They looked more like flautas.

Overall, an ok dinner, but the food is not worth the price especially with the poor service.  Also, the chairs are really short. I felt like I was sitting at the kid's table.
