The good things about Yayo Taco are the value and the beer selection.  With the student special I got more food than I could handle.  3 tacos, 2 sides, and a drink; they even let me upgrade my drink to a beer for an upcharge.  The beer selection is awesome too.

Unfortunately, this restaurant can't be judged at face value.  The food was awful.  I'm talking about tacos that were flavorless, the chips were stale, and their signature salsa and rice was disgusting.  

This was so disappointing.  Everyone has been telling me how good Yayo's is, the ambiance looks fun, the portions and presentations are good, the service staff was well informed, and the value was amazing.  However all these things are just a fa√ßade for really bad food.
