I always come to this Taco Bell and have had great service in the past. My order looked right on the screen. The girl on the intercom seemed nice. But it wasn't until I received my food is where I really felt like it was a waste of time and money. I really should have gone to jack in the box across the street. Like I get that it's fast food but common.
I ordered two cheesy bean and rice burritos and it seems like they didn't get the rice part cause it was all beans. And I love your guys rice. Next time I'll be sure to ask for only cheese and rice. The nachos bell grande were horrible. The cheesy potatoes weren't the same, it didn't taste like they usually do. Like they were sitting out all day and they just topped it with cheese and sour cream. And what made me upset was after eating all of that with my brother I opened my Doritos locos taco supreme to find out it wasn't even supreme?!?!?! It's gonna be a long time before I come back to this Taco Bell. If that's the case I'll go to another one 15 minutes away. And finally your diablo sauce taste like ramen. It was just all bad. Service seemed fine until I opened up my food.
Giving 2 stars today, service was nice but the food just wasn't up to par.
