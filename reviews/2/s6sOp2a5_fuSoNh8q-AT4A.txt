Amigos Tacos is in the same strip mall as the Cracked Egg off of Rainbow. They've been open for a while and I finally decided to check them out. I was feeling really hungry so I opted for 3 carnitas tacos. The price for each one was about $2.60. They're served on larger 6 inch tortillas (not the really small street taco tortillas) with the meat piled on, along with onions, cilantro, tomatoes, and guacamole. The guac wasn't fresh. It was looking a little brown so I scraped a lot of it off. I was expecting the carnitas to have a "pulled pork" look and texture but it was just diced up pieces of pork. It tasted ok, but again not the tender, succulent pulled pork I was hoping for. You do get a lot of food for the price, but with so many other taco shops around town I doubt I'll be back.
