Chipotle had a line out the door because it's good, but I was in a hurry, so I had to settle on this place. Never any lines to worry about here!

Horrible.

The place smelled like a three inch road trip inside the lower colon of sick deer.

Every employee with whom I spoke had apparently awoken on the wrong side of the bed. Not a smile to be found. 

And my lettuce was rotten, wilted and brown. That is inexcusable in a restaurant, and surprising to encounter at a national franchise. Who's in charge here? Makes me wonder whether the meat is beyond its expiration date too.

Stick with the guys whose door is propped open with customers waiting to get in. An empty restaurant like Qdoba speaks for itself.
