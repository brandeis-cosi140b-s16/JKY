Came based on yelp deal. 5pm and zero customers. This should have been my warning. My lemon in the water was already squeezed and that scares me. Ordered taco salad and a 16$ chimichanga. Had leftovers and left them there. Very sad excuse for Mexican food. Salsa was good....but the "hot salsa " tasted like water. Waiter said that was the only hot sauce they had. What mexican restaurant doesn't have tapatio or cholula.? Regardless we left a 30% tip and left it at that!
