I have never written a Yelp review before, but our  meal at Mundo's was so confusing and talked about for hours afterwards, so I felt I should start. We went out of our way as the vegetarian selection looked very good and I like to support non-casino restaurants.

The crooner that night was extremely loud. So loud that we simply just stopped trying to talk to each other and stared blankly for the entire meal. I can't believe that this would ever attract people to come to the restaurant, but it certainly makes me not ever want to go back. We figured the food would be excellent, but we were very wrong. The red and green enchiladas was best described as a big bowl of cheese. I ordered the pork tenderloin. For $28, I got four pieces of meat and a basket of fries. The meat was OK, but I guess I was expecting more for $28 at a non-strip restaurant. Jose the waiter was very good, so he earns the extra star.
