This is always the stand-by when my friend and I are broke and hungry.  It's right across the street from his apt. and he always has coupons from restaurant.com, so we can gorge down some food and pay close to nothing.  

I'm not saying the food is bad, it's pretty good.  I like the shrimp and chicken fajitas, and I love the margaritas specials.  Cabo's o.k. for some cheap eats, but it's nothing to write about...oops I just did!
