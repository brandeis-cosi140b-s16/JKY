The ONLY reason I'm giving two stars is because at least they had the courtesy of warning me the morning of, that our reservation was being cancelled. On Valentine's Day. I guess they could have let me show up to locked doors. The message got the point across but I had to call back to discover the reason for this clearly appalling and unacceptable news. 

Maria, the hostess, answered promptly. She must have been aware that people were angrily calling back, so kudos to her for taking the flack for the ill-conceived cancellation decision. She informed me that they were closed for the day due to a staffing issue. I asked if there was anything management planned to do to compensate those who had made reservations (weeks in advance) for Valentine's Day. She said no plans were being made. Incredulous, I demanded a better answer than that. Maria gave in and told me that that the restaurant will most likely shut its doors permanently in the following days. Her sincere apology and exasperated tone confirmed with me that this whole situation wasn't her fault. Shame on the managers/owners for making her sit and take these calls. Honestly. 

I called two days later (Monday). The phone rang and landed on an anonymous, unbranded, voicemail box. 

If, in fact, Fogon continues to operate without any consolation to the many people who made Valentine's Day reservations, I will adjust my review down to 1 star and let everyone I know to forgo Fogon for good.
