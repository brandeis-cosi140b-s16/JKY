First time here, thanks to yelp, but the place was definitely not worth the 4.5 yelp stars. Ordered the special combo with a side of toast. The sausage and bacon were decent, however the eggs were worse than what we make at home or maybe just at par. Now coming to the pancakes. They tasted like those frozen pancakes thrown into the microwave and served on a plate. This is after I had asked while ordering if the pancakes are made fresh!! They won't have told me that they aren't! Oh well! Hubby got the breakfast burrito and it was very average, definitely smaller than what we have had before at other places. Salsa served with it was a joke! 

Definitely not coming back!
