My woman and I were wandering around Gilbert on a Monday when we stopped in at So-Cal Fish Taco for lunch.  The place is deceptive, in that when you walk in the front door you don't see much seating.  The real action is out back, which is very nice, except I wonder if they're able to keep the place resonably comfortable in the summer.  

The waiter told us right up front that they were slammed, and didn't have sufficient wait staff to handle the noon rush.  OK, at least they're honest and up front with us.  We ordered the Shrimp Ceviche Tostadas as a starter.  Word of warning: Eat these immediately on arrival.  The juice quickly soaked the tostada, making it nasty.  Then we ordered the Blackened Grouper and Talapia tacos, and were ultimately underwhelmed.  They were OK, but for $8 a plate I would expect a bit more than just a tablespoon or 2 of fish, covered with all the other stuff.

After downing the grub it took seemingly forever to get the check.  I hope they solve their staffing issues soon.

Bottom line - OK food, small portions for the price.  I'd go back, but not as a first choice.
