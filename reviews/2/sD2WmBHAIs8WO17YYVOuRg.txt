I wasn't surprised to see the rating when I looked it up.  I came with some girlfriends who live in the area yesterday, and left feeling like a poophead for recommending the place.  

I always liked the Arrowhead location (but after talking about it, found it was probably cuz I always order a margarita and am a lil tipsy :)...  

The waitress was rude, she looked at my friend like she was stupid when asked if the chicken or beef fajita was better.  The food was just not that good at all.  The fajitas came out overcooked.  Some cups and silverware were dirty. My chimi was so-so. 

The cheese crisp was yummy though.  I will stick with the Arrowhead location for my margaritas and cheese crisps.
