I have been a regular (6-8 visits monthly) at Mendoza Express since it opened. While the food is very good, and people are friendly, they are very stingy. Signs posted throughout the restaurant that only one refill per person for soft drinks. The amount of salsa they give you complimentary is about enough salsa for three chips. Today, I asked for an additional serving of salsa and noticed a charge on my bill. As a regular, that really bothers me. There are too many good Mexican restaurants around to stand out for reasons other than the food and experience. I'll most likely be taking my Mexican food cravings a little further down the road to El Paso in Bridgeville.
