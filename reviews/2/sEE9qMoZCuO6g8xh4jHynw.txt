Disappointing is all I can say.  My husband and I just happened to be driving by and decided to stop in for lunch.  Decor is very bright and pleasant.  A nice salsa bar with several choices, however, the pico de gallo and mild salsa were extremely bland, no salt, tang or heat at all.  The chips were free, but almost chewy instead of crisp.

My husband ordered the ceviche tostada (good) and the pozole (passable), mine was a little worse.  I ordered the three item combo so I could sample a few things to get a better idea of the food.  The green chile and cheese tamale was flavorless, lots of thick masa with canned green chiles in the middle and no cheese I could find.  The beef taco on a hard shell was unseasoned pot roast on a soggy taco shell, and the cheese enchilada arrived cold with a very thick red sauce.  The refried beans were unpleasantly pasty instead of smooth and creamy and, again, unseasoned and the rice had no flavor or seasoning at all (there seems to be a pattern here with the cooks not seasoning or tasting the food going out)

Price for this was $20 without any drinks (water only) so not terrible price wise, but considering the poor flavor and quality it was not worth it.  Needless to say, we will not be back.
