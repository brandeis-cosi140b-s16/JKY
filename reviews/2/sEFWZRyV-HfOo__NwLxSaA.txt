Soooo excited about Cafe Rio having coconut shrimp everyday! I've been coming to either this location or the one on Sahara 4 times a week for a coconut shrimp salad. I came here today to get a little bowl of heaven and after standing in line for 20 minutes I was told by the manager they aren't allowed to make a coconut shrimp salad. ONLY the tacos are permitted. I told her they had been up charging me for the shrimp and I'd be more then happy to comply. She said no then yelled next. I was pretty ruffled by this experience because my past ones have been pretty decent. I guess I'll be sticking to the Sahara location even though it's a ways from my house.
