Their salad lettuce and customer service are doodie. Seriously I wish I could have taken a picture of the salad lettuce, brown and wilting. I love getting salads, but I had to get a burrito bowl with regular lettuce to swap out. And the cashier doesn't say a word. Just takes my card, gives me my receipt and I leave, cool dude
