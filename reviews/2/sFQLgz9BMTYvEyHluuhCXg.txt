This place has really good carne asada fries but.. They are really expensive considering it's just mean fries and cheese with the Guac sour cream and pico. We got the carne asada fries for 12.00 and then two chicken tacos... The tacos had barely any meat in them and were not that awesome.. The rice seemed like someone spilt salt in them and I asked for extra green sauce and the person helping me told me I could only have one green and one red .. Wish they were nicer and not so expensive I'll just stick to fillibertos from now on...
