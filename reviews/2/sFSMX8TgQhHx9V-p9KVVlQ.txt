I like this Baja Fresh, but this location is going down hill... The staff seems to change a lot, always new people in training... High turn over rate. They seem to mess up on special orders so beware.... They speak Spanish to each other a lot and makes us feel uncomforatable, makes me think they're talking about us.... and it's just plain rude!  My biggest complaint is that they were swepting the floor right next to our table, literally right on top of our feet...It's like EXCUSE ME,  I am trying to eaty here! I don't want dust flying up into the air and landing on my food! They have done this there a few times now!  Why do they have to sweep & mop right next to the customers! It's annoying & insanitary I feel...  The ceiling fan s were also on full blast, further stirring up all the dust!
