A few years ago, I would have given this location a 5 star review but it has gone downhill since then. They used to give discounts if you only got a few things in your burrito. They have continually raised prices while giving smaller portions. I'm pretty sure they use smaller spoons. And I get that they are a corporation and that the decisions aren't always up to them, but there is no denying the value has gone down hill. It's still good food, but not worth 9  dollars a person.
