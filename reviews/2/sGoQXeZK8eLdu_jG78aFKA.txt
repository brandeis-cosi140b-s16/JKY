I'll preface this with this: I'm relatively particular about any sort of food claiming to be Mexican. I tried the California burrito, a menu item I'm generally fond of. Mine was not freshly made, perhaps since I stopped in shortly after three, so I excuse that a little. That aside, I immediately took notice of the fake shredded cheese they use. The meat did have good flavor, the guac was fine, and I did like their salsa verde. For a mediocre burrito, I'm most taken aback by the price: nine bucks for a pretty small burrito! I noticed two tacos were the same price, which I thought there's no way two tacos would be that much. After what I received, I fear that might be exactly what you get. I've had much better for half the price! I'll come back if I'm desperate, but otherwise would get more bang for my buck elsewhere.
