Went with family last nite again.  Reduced my rating by two stars due to a few things that irked me.  1)  Made reservations but when we got there, they did not have table reserved for us.  So they put two tables together to accomodate my party -- one table had wobbly legs and was unevenly matched to the other table.  2)  Then they screwed up our drink order  -- got the plain and frozen strawberry margaritas reversed.  Also got the cadillac margarita without salt reversed with the regular one with salt.  3) Forgot to serve one of our appetizers. 4) and lastly, one drink arrived after we had finished eating.  No offer to exchange the drinks to make them right, and no comp from the bill as a token of apology --- did not expect them to take a meal off, but they could have at least taken one drink or one appetizer off the bill.
