I've been here often (husband loves the louies) and it seems like everything I try isn't my favorite.  Last straw was last night - ordered the los albondigas soup (one of my favorites from other mexican restaurants) and was sorely disapointed.  6 HUGE slices of carrots, 3 medium sized meatballs and a few other vegies (tomatoes, celery) floating in a broth.  Smelled like stew - tasted like stew.  Not what I wanted.  Won't be coming back.
