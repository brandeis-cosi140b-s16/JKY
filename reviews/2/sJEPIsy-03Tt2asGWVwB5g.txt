I don't see the big deal about this place.  The food is nothing spectacular, they don't really have any good drink specials.  Oh, and the service is horrible.  I went there twice and had bad service both times.  The wait times for a server to take a drink order are ridiculous and they don't like to come back and check on you.  The servers would rather hang out and talk to each other than take care of their customers.  I would recommend going elsewhere.
