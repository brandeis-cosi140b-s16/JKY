I stop in at Taco Bell about once a week, typically going to the one on McClintock & Ray. Today I was in a different part of town so I came to this one instead. The service was typical for a drive-thru, but that surprised me as I was under the impression that ALL of Taco Bell was pushing for better customer service. 

The location on McClintock and Ray always has AMAZING customer service, with the drive-thru attendant genuinely asking how your day is going and occasionally throwing out a joke but always offering a smile.
