We went here craving Mexican food. I'll start off by saying I had no problems with the parking lot but the place seemed pretty dirty (ie. door, tables).  They started cleaning while we waited for our food but they dumped a bunch of windex or something right outside the door to get in so we had to either jump over it or walk through it on the way out. Not the most appetizing thing to smell while you wait for your food. We tried the enchiladas, cheese quesadilla, and carne asada burrito. The burrito meat was really unappetizing...my husband only took a couple bites and decided to forgo it. The cheese enchiladas were okay, nothing special. The rice was good but the beans smelled and tasted funny to me (maybe they are just more authentic Mexican than I'm used to, idk). The cheese quesadilla was on the greasy side but tasted good. I think I will pass on Morenos in the future unless it's to try the sonoran dog.
