Blah.  This place bores the shit out of me and every time I go, I get more annoyed that I just spent an hour of my life there.  Its never by choice, obviously the Patron has a few faithful fans but I have yet to find the fun at Loco.

Next door to My Big Fat Greek Restaurant right on Scottsdale Rd, this patio is usually pretty packed.  Which adds to my frustration.  Everyone is smooshed onto this gated in patio, talking about how much they hate the bar.  What, like there arent a dozen other places to go to within 20 feet?  The bar took forever with our drinks and I felt like the bartenders were talking trash about patrons.  Youre not cooler than us except for the fact that youre making money at this dump instead of spending it.  

Speaking of drinks, I havent ever had a great one (read: "great"=strong) and prices are just like every other place like this.  Food is mediocre and I usually try not to eat just so everyone can tell how much I dispise it here.  

Never have I met someone fun or worth knowing here, and since I can make friends with a doorknob, this is a serious statement.

Happy Hour?  Dinner?  People watching?  Youre Loco.
