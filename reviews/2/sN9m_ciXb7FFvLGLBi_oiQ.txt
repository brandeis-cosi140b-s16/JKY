To start off "best in town" that is definitely a big statement to back up.. "Best of Phoenix" is an even bigger one.  Typically yelpers are not from the Hispanic community.   Because of my Hispanic palette I would say that this place has very bland food.  Watered down shrimp cocktail, and al pastor tacos that were really not flavorful.  The restaurant itself is nice and cozy. Decorated very well and Mexico City looking with lots of color..  Staff is very nice.  But there are definitely better Mexican sea food places.
