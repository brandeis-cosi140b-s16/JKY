I ordered their new Avocado Burrito with a small soda, they corrected me "you mean the number nine" (a chicken avocado burrito)... Um ok, they'd know their menu better right?  

WRONG... The chicken avocado burrito is DOUBLE in calories and fat (I couldn't even finish eating it, it was so gross)... Be careful when ordering, you may end up with more than you bargain for.
