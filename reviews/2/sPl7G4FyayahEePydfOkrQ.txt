This Mexican place is located on and/or near a golf course...? Possibly a retirement community? That is the clientele for sure. It is kind of like a diner in a Midwest town that attracts the olds to have coffee and eat really bland Mexican food at "that one thar Mex-ee-can" place.

The tables have no hot sauce on them. HUH?

The menu does not feature burritos. HUH?

I had an a la carte chicken burrito that didn't come with ANYTHING. No salsa. No sour cream. No guac. HUH? 

I mean, I get that I ordered it a la carte, but not even a dollop of sour cream? Makes you go hmmm. The chicken was sub-standard and didn't have much of a sauce in it. As I sat there eating it I was envisioning a Chipotle burrito I could have gotten for a dollar less and it would have been a thousand times better.

Maybe I should have ordered something different, but for a place called "El Burrito" I was shocked there was not a plethora of burritos to choose from.

I say go to Chipotle over this place if you want EL BURRITO. 

PS - While I was there the US Foodservice truck pulled up and made a delivery. I knew this because he had an employee fill out a form and I watched him get in his truck and drive away. US FOODS you GUYZ. YIKESES.
