This location disappointed me. I came here last night and ordered the two piece combo to go. It came with a breast, a wing, tortillas, and two sides. 
EVERYTHING SUCKED. 

I usually really enjoy eating el pollo loco's chicken but this place served me a lousy meal. The chicken was dry and came in small pieces. The wing was also half burnt. The mashed potatoes had nothing special about them either. I didn't even bother with the tortillas. All of this came out to be $9 and it wasn't worth it at all. 

The service was also pretty bad. The cashier forgot to give a cup to everyone (including me) that ordered a meal. I would see each person ask him to give them a cup. He would also keep forgetting what people ordered.
