If you mind waiting 30 minutes for water and more than 45 minutes for a soda, then you probably shouldn't go here.

We had a table of 10 here for Father's Day - and they weren't even that busy - and that's how long we waited for drinks. Oh and we sat down and were never given menus, we got those for ourselves.

However, the food is decent. The salsa is good. And the food and drinks are cheap. Though I wouldn't come here again since it's irritating to wait so long for a drink in 110 degree heat, some may not mind and then maybe this place is worth trying. But if you're like me and love Mexican food and a great experience, I wouldn't recommend spending your money here.
