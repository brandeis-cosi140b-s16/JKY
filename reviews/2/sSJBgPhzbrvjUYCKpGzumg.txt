I always like to support small businesses.  So when Gordo's opened, we went to them quite a few times.  I especially liked their chorizo and egg breakfast burrito (and always got it without potato).  However, I don't know what has changed, but the last 3 times we got lunch/dinner there, it was not very good.  Specifically,  used to order Carne Asada burritos, and they were awesome.  Just the right mix of beef, onions and guacamole.  A couple of months ago, I ordered 2 Carne Asada burritos, got home with them and found that there was some beef, but mainly refried beans.  I called Gordo's and said what I found when I got home with our meal.  They apologized, and were very nice, but said that they were low on beef, so they added beans.  I explained that I did not want a bean burrito, but a Carne Asada.  If I would have known they were low on beef, I would have ordered something with chicken.  They said I could bring my receipt back and they would refund me, or I could get something different.  I did not have time to return and do this.  So I chalked it up to a "whoops" that wouldn't be repeated.   Everybody deserves a 2nd chance!   About a month later, I again went to Gordo's and again ordered 2 Carne Asada burritos to take home.  This time, the meat was kind of crusty dry (like over cooked and kept in a warming device).  Again, they loaded the burrito with refried beans.  Although I do love bean burritos, that is not what I ordered.  I don't know if this little restaurant is having $$ problems or has a new owner, or what.  Sorry to post a less than stellar review, as I would really like to see these folks succeed.
