I really wanted to try this restaurant.  Since we're eating Mexican food tomorrow I didn't want to get a full meal so I ordered some guacamole as a good indicator of how the food is.

I was disappointed.  The guacamole ($2 for 4 oz) was really peppery.  Not spicy with jalapeno peppers but black peppery.  

Based on the guacamole I probably won't go back for a full meal.  Too bad because the food really did smell good when I walked through the restaurant.  The employees were also very nice.
