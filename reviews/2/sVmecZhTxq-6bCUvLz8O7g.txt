Yuck. This place is gross. Tortillas and lettuce are not fresh, salsa sucks - tastes like tomato sauce. TV's are annoying. That aside the patio and happy hour are decent - just go for drinks.. Or get so drunk you can't tast how bad the food is. Or better yet, walk down to Taco Del  Mar - it's actually better than the food here.
