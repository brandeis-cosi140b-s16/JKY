We came in to pick food up to-go this past Saturday for dinner. I ordered the Balsamic and Roasted Veggie Salad with chicken and NO roasted peppers and onions. But, when we got home I had to sit there and pick all the onions and peppers out. Now if they weren't roasted veggies it would have been easier and the flavor wouldn't have tainted my dinner. 
I know she heard me because she repeated the order and emphasized NO peppers and onions, so this falls on the guy in the back cooking. There were ZERO guest in the restaurant when we came in, probably because it was storming really bad and it wasn't ideal weather to get out of the car. 

IF, and that's a BIG IF I come back (my boyfriend lives a mile down the road so it's always on the list of possibilities) I would have to thoroughly check my food before leaving, something I shouldn't have to do.
