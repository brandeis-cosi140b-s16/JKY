Against my better judgment I decided to give Vida a try......I had heard and read mixed reviews and that alone usually will keep me away, but I was advised to try a specific dish.  The service was spot on and I had high hopes but after receiving my 'lump' crab nachos my whole attitude changed.  There were 8 pieces of individual nachos buried in cheese and little else.......hmmm $12 bucks for 8 pieces of baked cheese nachos?  I gave it a try and all I tasted was cheese and grease...no black beans, no crab....cheese.  I thought perhaps they had given me the wrong order so I peeled back a glob of cheese from one of the 8 pieces in search of 'lump' crab to find little bits of crab.  Ok, my bad.......that's what I get for going against my better judgment so I took a L on this one as I had promised myself not to bother with this place......
