My bf and I decided to eat lunch here due to the rave reviews on Yelp and from friends. Unfortunately, we were disappointed with our experience.

We walk in and seat ourselves.  The server took at least 10 minutes to take our order. There were a good amount of folks already eating and enjoying themselves, so we assumed it was a bit busy.  My bf was trying to get the server's attention to no avail. When she finally came by our table, she apologized and mentioned that she forgot about us.

We ordered menudo, red tamales, steak taco, steak gordita, pastor gordita and enchiladas.  The food came out quickly, and yes, it was delicious.  Though our tacos didn't have as much filling to it like seen in the other Yelp photos. While devouring the food, we noticed how dirty the cups of water she served us.  We should've purchased bottled drinks in the front store instead.  

Other than dirty cups and bad service, the food was good.  Not great compared to other Mexican restaurants in town.  I'd go elsewhere.
