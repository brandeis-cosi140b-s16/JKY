The service was slow and inattentive, especially considering there were only 3 tables; she forgot my drink and I had to ask for it again after my food came. I had a chile relleno plate and the food was decent and exactly what I would expect from any other Mexican place. The guacamole was delicious and seemed freshly made in house. The prices are quite high for standard Mexican fare. They've obviously raised the prices to whatever maximum they think Summerlin markets can bear.
