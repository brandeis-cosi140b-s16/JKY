Today I went to Roberto's on ranching and lake mead and it was a disappointing experience! It started with a lady working there that kept grunting and yelling about some drama that was going on in that location. When I say grunting, it was loud because I was in the drive thru and she was in the back somewhere and the lady helping me was more interested in her drama than helping me!

So I finally get my carne asada breakfast burrito and it was bland! It was so under seasoned that the water down red chili couldn't help it! Why because the chili was bland and had zero heat or flavor as well! 

So disappointing, that robertos is turning into a fast food chain! What they are today and what they were before are two polar opposite restaurants! You can tell that they have new leadership, just by looking at their cheesy marketing posters and flyers taped all over the place. Roberto's stop trying to be like the other fast food places because they suck and stay true to your brand and produce quality and not fast food!
