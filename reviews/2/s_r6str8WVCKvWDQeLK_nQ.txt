I usually order the family meal-- their fire grilled chicken is usually tasty, hot, tender and flavorful, but lately the quality has deteriorated. The past 2 times I ordered through the drive through,  the chicken were dry and inedible--- it will be awhile before I try them again, too bad as this location is really convenient for me :(
