I usually wait to review a restaurant until I have visited at least two, if not three times. The major exception to this rule is if I don't plan to visit again.

I gave them two instead of one star because I had been suffering from stomach flu for a week, and mistakenly chose this restaurant to break my fast. What I'm saying is that they might have good stuff, but I won't be going back to find out.

I ordered the five tacos, a good deal at $4.95 I think. Unfortunately, they were deep fried taquitos, not traditional Mexican tacos. I liked the cheese, guac, and lettuce that was piled high, but unfortunately I didn't like what it was piled on top of.
