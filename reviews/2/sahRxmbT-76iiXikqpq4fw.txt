The food here is pretty good.  I'm giving it a low rating because this place is dirty.  The service is also, extremely slow because they only have one person doing the register and the cooking (might be a health hazard handling money and food).  A manager type came out and did a walk around to inspect, and then walked away.  Apparently, the amount of food and wrappers all over the place met company tolerances.
