Dirty!  Door . trash overflowing on to floor.  Then you get your food...the seasoning bar is dirty, spills and scraps of food.
We remainwd in the resaurant for 40 min. The counter staff made no attempt to clean the season bar or pick up trash.
I made a call to customer service.  He didn't even ask my name or contact information.  He said that he would make the management aware of the problem.
