When Los Favoritos changed to Papa Chevo's they said the menu would remain the same. However, I have noticed the quality and quantity of food decrease over the past few months, but today was the most drastic. The breakfast burritos are more tortilla than filling and they increased the prices. So, you are paying more for less burrito. Sigh. This used to be my favorite breakfast burrito place. The search for a new place begins now...
