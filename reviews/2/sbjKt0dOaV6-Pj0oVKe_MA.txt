Not the worst Mexican fast food restaurant but pretty low-grade food products. I will say that their pinto beans were flavorful and that saved the fish tacos plate that I ordered. My husband ordered the enchilada and he said they were just "ok". They do have a salsa bar and you get chips with your meal on your plate. Atmosphere is ok and seems fairly clean. 
We will not be going back. Baja Fresh is much better with higher quality food and service.
