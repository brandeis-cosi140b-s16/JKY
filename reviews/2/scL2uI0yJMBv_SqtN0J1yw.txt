Recently moved to Phoenix, and this place is in my neighborhood.  El Pollo Loco is overpriced food with very small proportions.  I spent like $10 on some quesadilla's and they came with a small packet of tortillas and mushy salsa.  I'm a skinny guy, but was still hungry after eating this. The staff at this location seemed uninterested in their jobs both times I tried out them out.  Not worth it.
