I don't really know what to say. This was my second attempt eating at this location and I can say I'm still not impressed. 

I ordered the chicken lettuce wraps, but was appalled at the sad wilted lettuce that they had the nerve to put on my plate. I didn't bother asking for a replacement of the lettuce, since I was already grossed out by the soggy greens that were there. I'm shocked that anyone would even bother placing them there to begin with. I'd rather they just tell me they ran out of lettuce than putting that gross stuff on my place. I pushed them to the side and concentrated on the shredded chicken and salsa. The chicken was beyond dry and flavorless. The salsa did little to help that either. My fella got the carne asada meal and although he was relatively happy with his meal, he found the meat to be a little flavorless as well. He thoroughly enjoyed their salsa, so that was the only plus of the meal. 

I left still hungry and happy that I had my Entertainment Book coupon, otherwise I would have felt utterly ripped off for our meal. I won't be back to this location. In this case, strike two and you're out.
