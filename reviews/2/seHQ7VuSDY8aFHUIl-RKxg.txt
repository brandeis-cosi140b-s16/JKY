Meh. Just ok. Boyfriend and I got a groupon so we tried this place today. 

I ordered the jalape√±o cilantro margarita and it tasted like a house margarita. I asked if they could make it a little bit spicier and when I tried that one I swear it burned my throat on the way down. One extreme to the other. 

I ordered the Mexican pizza. It was essentially a cheese crisp with tomatoes and I added grilled chicken. No lettuce or anything else on it. I thought it was odd. 

My boyfriend ordered the enchilada stack and it was tiny. They forgot to bring out the black beans he ordered. 

We did order the sopapillas and those were amazing served with vanilla bean ice cream. 

I told our waitress when we first arrived about us having the groupon. She said she would take it off the bill at the end. When the bill arrived the groupon discount had not been taken off, and I was double charged for my chicken on the Mexican pizza. It was corrected but took double the time.  

We both agreed we would not return and frankly I'm glad we had $25 off from groupon because the food and service was NOT worth $50.
