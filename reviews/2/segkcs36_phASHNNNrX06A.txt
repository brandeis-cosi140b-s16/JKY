so sad when you have a bad experience but i hope it's the only time because we liked this place. 

the food can be marginal....but what i hate is bad service. we must have gotten a trainee, which is fine, but attitude is everything. i don't berate, complain, or otherwise be rude to my patients (not to their face anyway). it's bad work ethic and i'm providing a service to make them feel better and to let them know i care...

ugh....our waitress kept rushing us all night....taking away the chips too soon, constantly pushing the bill on us "have you paid, have you paid, have you paid"....enough! for christs sake, it's not even that busy right now, relax! couldn't get our bill right either. as for the food this night....cold and slightly stale tortillas....the stuffed quesadilla was absolutely flavorless and way too cheesy/greasy....yikes. better luck next time!
