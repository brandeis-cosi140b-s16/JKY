Great reviews, big disappointment.

Cute place, I felt like I was in Mexico.
Good chips. okay salsas.
Food . . . chile relleno was a salt trap, green corn tamale was not exciting, my friend's pasta dish was entirely bland and kind of a goulash without sauce.  I did something I've not done in 20+ years here in Phx: I left more than half my meal on the table.  When I rejected a to-go box, the hostess/server didn't bat an eye . . .
Service, nothing special.

Too bad.  My friend and I love Mexican food (not Americanized, either) but we'll cross this one off our list.
