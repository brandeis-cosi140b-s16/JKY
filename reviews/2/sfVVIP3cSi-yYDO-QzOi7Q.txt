The Atmosphere of the restaurant was very cool. Very warm welcome. Unfortunately I give the 2 star Review because for the price of an Enchilada plate you get 2 small enchiladas with Red and Green Sauce that are  very good, they taste very farty. Also they don't have very good salsa it's either sweet, mild, or Habanero that burns your mouth there is no happy Medium. 2 Stars, probably won't try again.
