This is the second time I've been here and this time I was a bit disappointed. The scallops and shrimp I ordered was lackluster. The scallops were fresh and perfectly seared. However the shrimp was small and overcooked. The seafood was wading in a pool of some kind of bland butter wine sauce. I thought I ordered an entree but I was served something more along the line of soup. The greens of some sort that were also in the dish were too bitter for my taste. There was some rice I dig out of the bottom of the dish, but nearly enough.
The service was extremely slow after the meal. The server, while attentive in the beginning, was no where to be found after we said we didn't want the dessert menu. Mind you she only had one other table in our section and out still took more than 20 minutes to get the check signed and get out of there after declining the dessert menu.
