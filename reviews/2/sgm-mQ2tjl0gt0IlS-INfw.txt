Why put in a location downtown location and refuse to accomodate the business lunch crowd?  Food is fine but the customer service is lacking.  Our party of 7 was reminded "no separate checks".  So, on the back of a napkin we do our math... Restaurant barely 1/2 full, but it's too much to split a check.  Service abismal.
