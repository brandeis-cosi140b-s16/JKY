I didn't love my food at Super Burrito, but to be fair, I must tell you that 3 trailer-park, hillbilly, in-bred, DOUCHEBAGS, interrupted my famous "Taco Inspection!" 

We arrived at Super Burrito at about 2AM on a Friday night (first mistake) and immediately upon entering the restaurant and identifying myself as "The Taco Inspector," these three ass-clowns got in our face and would NOT stop talking crap--even after we got our food and sat down. 

The date ended with the Scottsdale Police showing up, and well, at least we got a couple minutes of these cock-noses on video with my flip camera!

From what I remember, my tacos were kind of bland, but we will return for a repeat-inspection.

Peace from The Taco Inspector!
