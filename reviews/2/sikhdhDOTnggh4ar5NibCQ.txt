Hamburgers here might have been the talk of the town early last century, but in today's fast food market David's burgers are  neither fast or competitive. Lunch hour and it took almost 20 minutes for a hamburger patty that couldn't have been on the grill for a minute. The David's Deluxe isn't by any way except weight maybe. Could have been the 1 1/2" - to 2" of chopped lettuce. Sure wasn't the single piece of bacon , pickles or patty.  Maybe I should have tried the Mexican, but you can be sure I want be making a drive from East Mesa to Scottsdale for just that.,
