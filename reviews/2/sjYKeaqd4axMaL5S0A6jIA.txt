These type of taquerias are a dime a dozen in Las Vegas, but I wanted to stray away from my usual places to try something different.  Unfortunately, I didn't find the jewel I was expecting.  The carne asada nachos were "over the top," but the grease under the chips was ridiculous.  Not that I was expecting healthy fare, but it would have been nice to have had the chips patted down a little bit.  Had to rely on my table top for that task.  Gross.
