great bar.... not great food.  ****but it's cheap****  this is a great location and really cool atmosphere. just don't go in expecting very good food. I would suggest grabbing some chipotle beforehand, then going in for some wings and beer. I had the chicken enchiladas. they took the enchiladas and put some chunks of chicken on top... making it obvious that the cheese filled enchiladas were just heated. I guess not too bad for 9 dollars. i was suprised that rice and beans was extra. The chips were pretty good but the salsa was just chunky processed blah.  my best guess is that the kitchen simply a line of fridges and microwaves. definitely stop for a drink however. total bill with tip for two people including 2 drinks each was under 35 bucks.
