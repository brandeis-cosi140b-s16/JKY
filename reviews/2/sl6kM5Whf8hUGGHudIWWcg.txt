Wow just wow.  I haven't been to a Qdoba in a while and finally had an opportunity to take my better half there ( she is a chipotle fan) and try it. I was super excited but 5 mins in line and I knew this wasn't the same Qdoba.

Their menu used to be simple. Now they have all these options, cheese whiz in your burro?  Gross.  Anyhow I went with the basic. Steak burro, white rice, corn salsa, cheese and black beans. 

Steak had little to no flavor.  Rice was just as bland, the amount of celantro in the rice was minimal. The corn salsa was good.  Cheese is cheese.  Black beans were so so too. 

She has the grill chicken burro, same setup as mine. Chicken was like rubber with no flavor.

Where is the flavor?  I had to use damn near a quarter bottle of hot sauce. 
 

Very disappointed.  Sad to say that chipotle has a better burro..  We won't be back
