Got there about 8.30pm yesterday, ordered 8 pieces legs & thighs with 2 sides 'togo'. After i paid with the cashier he asked me again do you want legs & thighs or mixes with breasts?? I said legs & thighs please. He turned arround talked to the cook, i cant really hear what they were talking about, BUT i have clearly heard the cook said IT'S OK. Got my order legs&thighs with they lovely salsa. I was curious  while im driving back home, what was that "IT'S OK" about??? Told my wife to look at the receipt & i was charged for breasts instead of legs&thighs. Came back talked to the cashier & the Manager returned $2 & she appologized.
This is not about the returned money $2 only, c'mon! Its about service & BE HONEST TO YOUR GUEST!
Got home 5 minutes after that, After smelling the deliciousssnesss of the chicken in the car and hungry stomach : got really dry dry dry,small legs&thighs at home :( 

The rice,beans was good & the salsa was bomb! Here is why i gave them 2 stars instead of 1.
