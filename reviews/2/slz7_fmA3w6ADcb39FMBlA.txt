10:15 pm on a Friday night in Mesa.  got an itch for some mexican food.  Headed over to Filibertos Mexican food.

My main target was the carne asada Fries.  I was curious and hungry.  My brother also got the carne asada fries and two tacos carnitas.

The fries were a good idea gone kinda bad.  Fries covered in cheese, guacamole, sour cream and diced carne asada.  

I had high hopes, but was soon disappointed to find the fries soggy (under cooked soggy) and the other ingredients uninspiring.  

The place does scare my stomach a bit.  Reading other reviews today about being sick with the runs after eating here is believable after having been there.

NOTE:  my brother really loved his carnitas tacos, flavorful and crispy.  He would go again.  he also did not care for the carne asada fries.

Kudos for the late hours and cheap prices.  (2 Stars)
