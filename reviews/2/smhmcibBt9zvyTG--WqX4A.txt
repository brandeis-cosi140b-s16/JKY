I came here tonite after my workout at EOS. It was right next to my gym so why not. I ordered a Baja bowl with chicken, black beans, veg, NO RICE with a side of extra veg and extra chicken on the side..my meal cost me $15 and some change and I didn't even get a drink to go with my meal. I got my food and I have to say, I am not very please. My bowl has way too much beans in it and very little veggies. I could count the pieces of bell peppers that was on it. It almost look like a bean soup. Extra side of chicken was over priced. You don't get much for $4.99. I am not a frequent Baja customer but I don't remember it being this pricey for a meal. And I don't remember the bowl having this much beans. Guess I'll have to ask for LESS beans and MORE veggies on my next visit. Service was friendly though and the place is clean.
