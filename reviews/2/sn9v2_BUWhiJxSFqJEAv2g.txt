In snowbird season, please don't torture yourself by trying to come here. 'Nuff said on that.

The food is Americanized Mexican fare in a colorful environment. The margaritas are good, especially the mango. The huevos rancheros are good. Nothing here to write home about. The service usually stinks. Super long waits for your food and also for any drink refill.

I waited half of my life to finally see my server to get the bill and get the beck out of there.  Let me also say that this was NOT during snowbird season, and didn't seem exorbitantly busy.

Mediocre at best, I wouldn't recommend Los Gringos. It's for crazy white people (ha!) who are afraid of real Mexican food.
