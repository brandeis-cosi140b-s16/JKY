I really wanted to like this place and should have read the reviews before dining here. It was edible at best for the majority of folks in our group.   Perhaps we ordered the wrong items.  We chose the tacos thinking that would be a signature of the restaurant since it is in the name.  Most of the tacos looked like they were thrown together.  All the tacos that had fried items like fish, chorizo, avocado were so heavily fried it was like chewing on little rocks in your mouth.  The margaritas were sub par and the salsa was lacking heat.  The service was fair but we were surprised the server didn't notice that we left most of our food on our plates.
