Salsa was great, food was OK, service was slow, and I feel the manager could of made a better attempt to resolve the situation more quickly. We had a party of 8 people. The shrimp was still frozen at 1pm on Saturday. We waited 20 minutes for the waitress to comeback and tell us there will be no shrimp cocktails, and took the manager quite a bit longer to come by. This is one example of why I rated the way I did. This was one of the worst visits I have ever had at a restaurant. But again, the food was at least decent enough to eat.
