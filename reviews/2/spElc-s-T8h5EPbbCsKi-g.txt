It was OK. Here are my problems. Fuego sauce....said it was extra hot, however, extra hot? Nope. Fires out fellas. Pace picante hot was HOTTER by far. The medium salsa was mild.....enuff said.

The pork tamales were without pork. I think the cashier meant to say that the pork was in the green chile sauce but the sauce itself didn't have any pork in it as well. 

My quesadilla had sour cream and guacamole on the inside when it was toasted. Nothing like warm sour cream to soften the taste buds. Chicken on the inside was flavorless...flavorless the green Chile that was supposed to be inside the quesadilla was thin to say the least. Tortilla was good however and the service was friendly. Overall, we will not be back.
