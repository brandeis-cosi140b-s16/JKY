I live in Elizabeth & I have been to Sabor twice now. The first time I tried a selection of 3 of the street food items. It wasn't horrible but it wasn't anything to rave about either. Everything was pretty bland and unexciting. I don't rule a place out after one mediocre experience though. I returned a couple of days ago & decided to try a steak burrito with chips. The burrito was pretty bland as well, the chips were good. I will also note that on both trips here the toilet has been broken & the bathroom was not the cleanest. My stomach was not too happy on either occasion either, I'll leave it at that. I really like Three Amigos, I was expecting a lot more from this establishment. I don't believe I will be making a third trip. If I get a hankering for a burrito I'll drive a little further to Chipotle.
