the first thing i noticed was that it was very clean. eerily quiet. the two men behind the counter had beady eyes and wide smiles. very patient in waiting for our order. i ordered the chicken taco and enchilada with rice and beans. my girl got the rolled tacos meal with a large horchata. para aqui i say as im handing him $12. pretty decent

after sitting and chomping on carrots and cucumber for some moments we decide we dont want to stay and ask for it para llevar. they got kinda upset. as we get the food and start collecting salsa my girl over hears them talking shit in spanish. i wouldnt normally mind but she was very offended especially since there were other mexicans in the dining area. 

we didnt say anything but quietly left. 3 stars for being one of the only taco shops in the area with decent food. 

im from san diego and eat mexican food all the time. barely do i ever get a hint of disrespect.
