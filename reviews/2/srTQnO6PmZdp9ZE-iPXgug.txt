Bleh. Not impressed at all. I've had better food at Taco Bell. Okay, maybe not, but I did not have a good experience here. The thing that pissed me off the most? What can't you order a taco plate with different tacos?! They have to be all the same for some strange reason. Wonder if they suffer from the 'just because it's in Summerlin it must be awesome' syndrome. They did have tasty salsas....but you pay for the chips. Not a game killer but chips, c'mon man, it's like not getting bread at an Italian joint. Kinda adds that touch. 
And one last gripe, the outside patio, they have these short stools that are impossible to sit in and look classy.  You're straddling these things like your bareback horse riding. Me and the guy at the table next to me looked at each other as we're trying to get comfortable, like, are these things for real??!

Raise the tables, quit trying to look chic and make it comfortable!
