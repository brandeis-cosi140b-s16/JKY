First of all, I'll confess I've only been here with the children I've babysat... so the chaos that usually accompanies groups of kids may have partially swayed my opinion. On another note, this also gives Zapata's points for being kid-friendly... kids eat free on Sundays!

Chips and queso here are really good. And the decor is nice and colorful and not way too tacky (like a lot of "cantinas").

Zapata's does have a vegetarian section of their menu, positive points for that... but only 6 options. I definitely gobbled up most of my "Champinon" burrito, but it was a little salty and not as fresh as I'd prefer. 

I'd most likely go here during work again, but not on my own.
