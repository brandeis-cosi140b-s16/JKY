I came here during my friends' bachelorette party not knowing it was a Jose Andres restaurant.  I wanted something to eat before heading into the club, and this place was way overpriced, and lacked quality! Not to mention, the portions are teeny.  On top of that I had to wait about 30 minutes for a super small taco, and the taco was just okay.
