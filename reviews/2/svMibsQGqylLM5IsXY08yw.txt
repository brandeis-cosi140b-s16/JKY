PINK TACO is amazingly, stupendously, brilliantly... AVERAGE!

Nothing remarkable about this place except the name. Average food, average service, average crowd. 

I wonder if their marketing department ever expected that they could over-hype something so much that it would just let people down.

I am yawning as I am writing this.
