This place is so close to home that I really want to like it but there are just too many reasons not to.

As another Yelper stated the decor is nice post remodel and that is as good as it gets here.

Chips and salsa were brought to the table quickly and when my wife requested HOT salsa it was brought out quickly as well.

Placed our order..... carne asada burrito for me, fish tacos for my wife. They must be rationing fish in the kitchen.  Two tiny pieces in each taco which didn't fill the corn tortilla end to end. No flavor and not hot.

The carne asada burrito was small and the tortilla was like a firm paste. The quantity of tortilla outweighed the amount of carne asada. The beans were almost warm which puzzled me because the plate was very hot.

My wife asked for additional chips which never arrived to our table.

We were never asked if we enjoyed our meal. Im guessing that the amount we left on our plates spoke for us.

5:30 on a Saturday night and the place is at 30 - 40% occupancy. I am pretty sure I know why.

We will not be returning.
