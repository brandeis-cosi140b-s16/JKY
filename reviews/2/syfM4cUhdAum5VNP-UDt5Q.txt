Gus said, pick a spot for dinner. Knowing he has not been here I picked Don Rafa as I liked my lunch for the most part. 

6:30 pm Saturday night and no one in the place when we enter. Well two employees were sitting watching the game on TV, very loudly. I know I have mentioned this before, but I hate TVs in restaurants. I should have turned around and left, but chose not too. Both employees wandered to the hall at the back when we entered. NO greeting of any kind not direction to a table. We sat ourselves which I guess is OK since we were the lone customer. Another expressionless young man comes to the table to take a drink order. Must be the trade mark of the restaurant, no expression, no smile, no hello, no spark in the wait staff. I think I would pick something else as my trade mark. 

We ordered one of those round cheese things, the name escapes me. It was fine, after all how can you screw this up. 
I ordered the Taco Taco Platter and Gus had the Chile Relleno. I honestly have no idea what has happened to the food but it was just not good. I took bites of a few things and could not continue and Gus said the same about his. So we paid the bill and went on our merry way. 

This was too expensive to try again and get crap food and lackluster wait service. Adios
