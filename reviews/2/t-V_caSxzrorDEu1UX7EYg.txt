Wow I was sad I had to write a poor review for the resturant I had high hopes. First the atmosphere was nice,clean and relaxing. The service was great but the food was over the top salty. I love mexican food and I can eat it everyday but not here. I enjoyed the salsa but the chips were to salty the the dinner which was nachos it taste like I was eating nothing but salt. I am not sure why this was. I had to drink alot of water to flush out my body. Would I try again probably not I just had better and not worth the drive for me.
