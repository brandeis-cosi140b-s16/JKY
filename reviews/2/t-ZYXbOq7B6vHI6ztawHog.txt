Chino Bandido, you robbed me of a good lunch!

This place came highly recommended by some of my peers before I moved down here. The concept is very cool, but I think the execution just isn't there. The idea of combining Mexican and Chinese foods intrigued me, but when my food arrived, it came in a aluminum to go container, looking like food I hadn't finished from the night before that I reheated. It was also unceremoniously  dropped off in front of us, they seemed it bit unorganized. 

As for the taste, I give it a big Meh. Not bad, not good. The fried rice wasn't very good, but the gringo chicken was tasty. The carnitas was a bit too shredded, it lacked texture and was similar to ground pork. I might think about giving it another shot,  but my coworkers have deemed this place "Off the list..."
