Walked through the door and approached the check-in counter to be seated by the most uninterested in their job hostess.  No expression, no welcome, nothing.  Busboy comes around and non-chalantly tossed small plates on table without any greeting as if he had no pride in his job. Our server though seems to be the redemption, but I'm not sure.  So far the chips n dips are yummy, and I can see the waterfall, too bad its hotter than oven outside. Food was good, but missed a lot of the real flavor in homestyle dishes. 2.5 stars.
