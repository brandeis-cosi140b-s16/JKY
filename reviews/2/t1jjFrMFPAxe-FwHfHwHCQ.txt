Six of us went in for drinks and some late night snacking. We ordered some nachos and they brought complimentary chips and salsa. This was my first time here since re-opening as TQLA. 

The first round of drinks was a mess. The server could not get anything right. My beer was wrong TWICE! The bartender apparently mixed the wrong alcohols into two of my friends drinks. The server did not really do a great job of trying to fix the situation. He instead tried to say we were wrong and that the tequila they tasted was in the right drink. That drink was supposed to have mint leaves yet the other drink which didn't have tequila had mint leaves. Wow. Good job buddy. This guy couldn't even remember the four tequilas they had that were infused. 

By the way. The infused tequilas are awful. Everyone that tried the vanilla and hibiscus/mint almost vomited. For a bar that names themselves tequila it was a poor showing. 

The only bright point was the chips, salsa, and nachos. All were fantastic. I would not recommend this place for drinks or the service. It was awful. Now the food was actually pretty good. 

Overall I think this building is cursed because the last restaurant that was here closed and this one probably should as well.
