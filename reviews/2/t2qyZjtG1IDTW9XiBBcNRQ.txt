Sub par.  Too expensive for too little mediocre food.  Not likely to return.  Beans are soupy and taste like dish water, better suited for a straw than fork.  Salsa is horrible.  One small mediocre enchilada for $10.  Sat on patio which was very nice.  Staff not at all attendant, such as soda glass was empty for more than 5 minutes with them frequently walking by.  Finally after waiting almost 10 minutes asked for and got my check.
