I love chipotle, but not this location. Very small portioned burrito bowl and I had to spit out a few pieces of chicken because they were predominantly fat. Not the best guac either, great coke though. Will most likely go back, just disappointed. It could be because this is a newer location. Hopefully my next visit will be better.
