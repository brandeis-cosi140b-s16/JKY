After walking out of TC's Ribs today, this is the place we decided to go to instead. It's in the same strip mall, and looked pretty promising. 

We walked in and it looked reminiscient of Roberto's, though much cleaner on the inside. Dad ordered two Carne Asade burritos, and I decided to try the Machaca. We both thought it was strange that this place doesn't have rice, but we still decided to give it a chance.

The Chips and Salsa came first, and they were the best part of the entire meal. They tasted homemade, and the pico de gallo was AMAZING. I can't say the same for the other salsas they provided, which were just alright.

Both of our burritos were extremely bland. They didn't taste bad, but they definently had very little flavor. It was also a bummer that they put beans in the Machaca Burrito...the guy at the counter had even asked me if I had wanted them and I said no. 

I probably won't be coming back again, but I will say that the employees were really friendly and the food was cheap.
