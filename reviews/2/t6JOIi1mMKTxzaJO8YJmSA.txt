The food was ok, but it was definitely nothing special. We got their appetizer sampler as well as street tacos. My mom always says, you get what you pay for,and in this occasion, that clique rang true. I'm not sure what kind of steak was in the tacos, but that meat was so dry and flavorless, "fresh beef jerky" is a more suitable way to describe it. I was thinking there would be at least 1 winner in the appetizer trio... wrong again. The rolled tacos and mini chimis taste like they came out of a frozen dinner package from the grocery store. The 2nd star was earned because the decor was at least average, the servers were attentive and their AC was nice and cool.
