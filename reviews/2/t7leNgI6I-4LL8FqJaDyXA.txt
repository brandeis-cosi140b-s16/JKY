Let me start by saying that this struck me as a very white-washed mexican food restaurant. In other words, intended for the typical white American who is unfamiliar with quality mexican faire.

I appreciated the provision of chips and salsa, and the gentleman who brought them was VERY considerate and kind to have brought individual salsa cups for each of the five of us.

But it was like pulling teeth to get more.

I ordered the pork taquitos from the appetizer menu. $6.25 for six cigarette sized items that were undoubtedly frozen ten minutes prior.

The items that others at the table ordered appeared to be tasty, and one fellow patron literally cleared the plate.

If I were in the area with out of town guests who wanted mexican, and they were not well versed in the faire, I'd take them here.

Otherwise we'd go elsewhere.
