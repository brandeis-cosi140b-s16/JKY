I loved it when it was Gallo Blanco, but like all good things; it doesn't last.

I came here with a large group of one Friday night to now Cafe Tranquilo.  The place was pretty hip looking, but the crowd was nowhere to be found.  The place was quiet, too quiet for a Friday night.

As I sat I ordered a beer and like most Southwestern style restaurants chips and salsa was served with four different salsas; Pico de Gallo, Red Chili, Green Chili and creamy avocado.  My favorites were the Red and Green Chili; love the kick and the chips seemed like fresh cut tortillas fried...definitely nice start!  For my entree I shot for the Campechana Ahogada; a torta sandwich with ribeye steak, chorizo, avocado, tomato, cheese, eggs and a red sauce.  Definitely a larger dish then I expected.  The bun was nicely toasted, but protein ratio was definitely way off; maybe 2 cups of ribeye compared to a 8 inch bun.  The tomato didn't really add anything special except that is was there; if they were planning to give it some texture then that didn't help.  The egg was a nice compliment, but in the end it just wasn't enough.  I think a little more texture and something to compliment the red sauce would have made it work. - Enjoy!
