I have to edit my previous 4 star review down to two stars... it was purchased from the group that owns Mama Ricotta's, Bad Daddy's, Paco's Taco's and Plate Perfect Catering by some guy named Richard Campbell. Since this change in hands, the food quality has dropped off a bit. It's still good, but not as good as it used to be and for the price you pay there, that's not a good thing. The one thing that bothers me most about this place and will probably cause us to seek out a new Mexican restaurant in our area is the fact they have a "lunch" menu that's really just a shortened version of their dinner menu with no break in price. There are no "lunch specials" like you'd find at any restaurant, but especially a Mexican restaurant. We have one more "living social" type coupon we're going to use up there and then we're done.
