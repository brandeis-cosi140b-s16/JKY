my husband and i went here about a week ago. i ordered whatever special they had that day and he ordered a steak burrito. the chicken (something) special was passable... it was essentially a small piece of chicken inside a wrap and fried... bland and plain but OK. the beans i didnt touch since they didnt look fresh or good. and the rice just looked and tasted bad....
my husbands was much worse than mine, his looked like it was precooked i dont think i need to explain how a precooked steak burrito tastes lol.

gross.

the only thing i actually appreciated about the place is that the owner was there and did offer to refill our drinks.... overall though would not go back based on the food.
