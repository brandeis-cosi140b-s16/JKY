Corporate mexican food? Kill me now!

On our most recent trip to Vegas, my gf and I were looking to get a quick bite and we saw this spot. Here goes;

The GOOD: The decor is nice, pretty spot. I think that's what wooed us. We sat at the bar, so we were waited by the bartender, nice guy. Quick service.

The BAD: The food. It's as bland as rice cakes. 

The UGLY: The fact that in such an amazing food city...we ended up here :(
