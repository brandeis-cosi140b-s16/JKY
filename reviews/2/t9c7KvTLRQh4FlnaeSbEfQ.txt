This colorful decorated spot has a fun vibe to it!  The house enchiladas were okay as their skinny margarita.  (I was fairly warned by the server that this "skinny drink" may be "skinny" on flavor as well.  )  The complimentary chips were fair but the salsa was good.  Service turned more hospitable towards the latter half of our meal.
