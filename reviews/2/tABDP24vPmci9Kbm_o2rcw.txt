I really love this place the owner is outstanding , but...on a recent order and this is the second time now that my friends brought me back my favorite salad and i was not happy , they do tend to stinge on the chicken , for a big salad the chicken was barely there , just some dried out corners that probably was half of a breast chopped in tiny pieces , I will go back to eat there no doubt but I do have to address the issue because I do not have the time to run back during my lunch time , please make sure your order to go looks decent , thanks
