Everyone (including me) is reviewing the food, but you also have to take into account that the other half of the building is a small nightclub. With live music. I was confused when I rolled up, like "what's up with all these ladies in heels? It's just a restaurant?" Anyway, the paisa in your life will be happy with the tunes here. I just personally don't like the gigantic police presence. No, seriously...they're everywhere. In front of every entrance and chilling out in an SUV at the edge of the parking lot, actively looking for someone to arrest. 

Not a good feeling when you're just trying to grab a late-night bite. Not that the food was good anyway...as other reviews have pointed out, the carne asada can definitely taste old. We all know what something is like when it's sat in your fridge for a couple of days before reheating. I think it's gross to put up with that at a restaurant. Yuck.
