The lady making the food was kind, but when we got to the sides the elderly Hispanic lady made a big deal when I asked for a lot of cheese. She ended up putting the smallest amount and I had to ask for a side of cheese to make up for the lack of cheese. Everything began to go downhill after she began working here, before everyone else would be generous with the cheese. I will be filing a complaint to the company. The worker that was giving generous portions of the meat was being critiqued by the cashier and the elderly Hispanic lady. Every time she is working I always have an unpleasant experience.
