Not the greatest Mexican food.   Definitely overpriced for the quality of food served.    I ordered the "enchiladas" and I didn't think they were very good.  They seemed to be a bit tough when I tried to cut in half.  I didn't really think you could screw up rice and beans...you can actually screw up rice and beans.  

I'm sure you can find cheaper and inexpensive Mexican food off of the strip.
