I wasn't that impressed.  But we might have just gone on a bad night.  The waiter told us that their computers were down so they were doing everything by hand.  So our waiter took our order (and didn't write anything down).  We got one meal that was slightly wrong (ground beef instead of shredded beef) and our appetizer came out with our entrees.  

The food was just okay...I've had better.  Not likely to go back.
