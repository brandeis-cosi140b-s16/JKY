Saturday night at Sandbar was an interesting experience.  I'm not sure I've ever seen so many people who looked alike in one place.  Ok, maybe I have.  I have been to Axis & Radius. 

This place was wall to wall people.  There was an overabundance of girls with the same "edgy" hair cuts/colors, who looked like they had the same tattoo artist.  That comment actually holds true for the guys as well.  I lost count of how many Ramones t-shirts I saw, and then there were the "Keep calm and carry on" t-shirts some guys were sporting.  I see that saying on mugs a lot, so I was entertained that it was the shirt of choice for picking up chicks on a Saturday night, and was left wondering if these guys even knew the origin of that saying.  

Like so many others places, the bouncers seemed to be the hottest guys there.  I can honestly say this place is not my scene.  It almost made me miss the Sandbar in Scottsdale.  I never really liked that place, but I did have some hilariously good times there.
