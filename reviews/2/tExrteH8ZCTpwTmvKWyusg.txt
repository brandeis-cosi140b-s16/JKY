Well, I guess we got there too late!  We had a minor with us, she was 7 yrs old  So while we went in to go and get a couple of adult beverages,  they had to wait outside.  It took for ever and a day for the bartender to take our order. So all was good, we got our drinks, they were ok!  Pina colada   We were going to my hubby and the little one, someone tapped us and said come with me.  Ok, he also pointed out for all of us to come.  He set us up with a table....With the little one!  That was very nice.  It's not worth the price!
