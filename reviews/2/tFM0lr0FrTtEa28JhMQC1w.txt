This place has great food. Love the feel and look of this place. The outside dining area is a bit small. We opted to sit inside because there was a family sitting out there and their child was having a melt down and screaming and crying.  Service is fast, but our waiter has the interpersonal skills of a door knob. Work on it!!!
