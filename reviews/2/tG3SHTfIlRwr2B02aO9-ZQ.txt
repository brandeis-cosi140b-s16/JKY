BLAH is really all I can think of.  Blah, Blah, Blah.

Everything tasted the same.  Everything!  I got an open chicken burrito which is basically a burrito in a bowl, opened.  It had chicken, rice, cheese, peppers, onions and the shell.  

I ate a piece of chicken, tasted like the grill.  I ate some rice, tasted like the **Burnt** grill. I ate an onion, tasted like the grill.  I are a pepper, tasted like the grill.  I ate the cheese, tasted like a burnt grill with cheese on top. 

YUCK!  I ate about 4 forks full and was so disgusted I had to chuck it.

Fail of an airport dinner to the max!
