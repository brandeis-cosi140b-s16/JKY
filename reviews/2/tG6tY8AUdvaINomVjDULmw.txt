I m writing this review for the gilbert rd/ baseline location but it seems the complaints are similar from location to location
Their food is good but god help you if you go there when its busy like we did on friday night 10/16/14
You don't get a single second to decide what you want before they sling it in your aluminum dish. Then they slide 4-5 of the same looking burrito under the cooker with no ID to the customer. GUESS WHAT?? You get the wrong burrito and they throw your food around like its a jailhouse mess hall. I watched a female employee throw a cup of guac at the cashier who did not catch it.
Its cafeteria style and when its busy.....its a freaking zoo

So.... You get the wrong burrito and pay more at the register.  Watch out for extra anything because you'll pay for it.
Even though we had a free burrito coupon....it was a nuthouse and the employees are slinging so fast that you simply dont have time to decide anything.
So you get what you get and with 30 people single file in a long line...who's gonna listen to you??

Hey Cafe Rio- time to rethink your assembly line process and instead of upchargng for grilled steak and chicken, just have them be priced as separate burritos on your menu. Grilled meat is a mexican standard??? No???

Right now....Chipolte is my go to burrito for price and service...sorry cafe rio.
