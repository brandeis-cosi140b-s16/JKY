The drinks and food are cheap... But not worth it if you're sitting at the bar. 
The bartender (blonde female) made an extremely offensive and racist comment to me. Picking up one of those naked escort cards, she held it up in front of my face and said that there is a very close resemblance to me and the woman on the card. 

As a part-Japanese woman, I found it completely offensive that 1) she compared me to a woman who was Asian but looked nothing like me; 2) she compared me to a naked escort; and 3) did this completely out of the blue. There was absolutely no conversation prior to this comment and I have never met her before in my life. Regardless, it would've been offensive no matter who said that to me. 

I don't know if she was trying to make a joke or she was just absolutely clueless. I love this bar, so I'll likely return - but definitely not to sit at the bar... And definitely not to tip the bartender.
