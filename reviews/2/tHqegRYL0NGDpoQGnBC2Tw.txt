It is not even close to 5 Stars, in any category. Yes, the place is very clean, compared to other Mexican restaurants but that is not something that should be given any extra praise for. EVERY PLACE SHOULD BE CLEAN ALL THE TIME.

The portion sizes at the location are just average, nothing special. Fausto's, across the street is bigger and better in most categories. 

Roberto's does have a reputation for some of the best Breakfast Burrito's. However, this location is just borderline average. Every visit that I have sampled one, and this is in the 15-20 range, 90% of the time, the eggs are way overcooked and the taste is very bland, no seasoning what so ever.

When us Gringo's order French Fries, they ask if you want Ketchup, and then charge you for it. This is ridiculous and does not happen at every location. This is not ever 4-Star quality.

This location will have to make dramatic improvements to even be able to be considered with places like Pepe's, Fausto's or Carlito's.
