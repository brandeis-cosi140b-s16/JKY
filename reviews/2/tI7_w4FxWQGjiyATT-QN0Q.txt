Service is okay but the food is by far below-average. the chicken thigh is smaller than an actual chicken size thigh.  Unless el polo loco have started using free range chicken.
This isn't the first time I can here. Almost every el polo loco I've been too have reduced their chicken sizes from the actual sizes!
I wish there's a law out there that also watches out for these things. I'm sure there is, I just don't know if they're out there, if they are then they really aren't doing their rounds!
It is the same as stealing a penny here and there in broad day light!

The only el polo loco that impressed me is the one in Carson, California. 

Maybe I'll come back to El polo loco one day once their chicken is back to the size that I'm actually paying for!

2 pieces of chicken thigh for $3.00!?? I could get more at Von's or albertson a better deal!!!
