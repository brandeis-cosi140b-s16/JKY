Wannabe chipotle? Feels like cafe rio tries to be a more "authentic" alternative to chipotle by offering different meats and styles of dishes but falls a bit short where flavor and tastefulness are concerned. While the handmade and on-the-spot cooked tortillas is a nice touch, The barbacoa is way too sweet. Cafe Rio seems like a place that can't decide if it wants to go the more traditional Mexican food route or if it wants to lean towards "fusion" leading to a not so enjoyable eating experience.
