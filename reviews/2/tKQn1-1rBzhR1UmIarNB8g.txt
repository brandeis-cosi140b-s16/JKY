I will say that the Carne Asada is very good here but after that I am not a fan of El Taco Tote.  This is not to say that they are a bad restaurant.  I just don't like their food.

I will say that this location is always packed so they must be doing something right but as far as I am concerned.  Meh.  I've experienced better.
