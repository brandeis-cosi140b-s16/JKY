Unimpressed. I haven't been here in years and I wanted something better than Taco Bell but didn't want Chipotle. Well I should have chose of of those. Everything I ordered was bland including the salsa and guacamole. And my churro was cooked twice so it tastes like grease instead of cinnamon and sugar.
