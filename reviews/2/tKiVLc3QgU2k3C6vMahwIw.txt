Not what it used to be.  This was the third time this season we ate there. Not sure why we returned as we encountered many problems. 
On one occasion one of our group did not touch his entree after tasting. To their credit they took it off the bill. Other diners that night had just barely ok fare. 
On second occasion we were told a vegetarian request could not "be made tonight as it was too busy".  This waiter continued to be downright rude several times!
Just tonight (three strikes and you are out) I ordered the fajita taco salad and it arrived with cool steak not even warm. Had to send it back. On second attempt meat was hot if not good quality, shell was cold and not crisp and overall not good. The usually very tasty salsa seemed like overripe tomatoes dominated  very very disappointing.  It was Monday night and margaritas are only a dollar. First one was ok--half ice but as expected, second 3/4 ice and when tried from the straw was very salty.  Now I know it was salted on rocks but this was pretty bad.
