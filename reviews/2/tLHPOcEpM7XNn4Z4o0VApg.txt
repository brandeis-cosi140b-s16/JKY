I just moved to the area and had high hopes for this place. I ordered carne adada tacos and cheese enchiladas. The tacos were ok, but there was nothing special about them, and definitely not worth the price. The enchiladas were the real disappointment. The cheese was barely melted and the sauce tasted store bought. It is sad to say that I have had better enchiladas from the frozen food aisle.
