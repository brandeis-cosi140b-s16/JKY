Went here with my mom for Cinco de Mayo and was disappointed. There was no hostess at the front and we had to wait at least 5 minutes be seated even with many open tables. I asked for a blended margarita and was told they only do on the rocks. What kind of bar doesn't have a blender? 
The chips were bland and the salsa was warm (on purpose) which was not refreshing. I can't imagine eating warm salsa here in the summer! I ended up ordering the chicken street tacos and my mom got the steak street tacos. Both were tasty and fifty percent off which slightly made up for the slow service and lack of blended margaritas. Overall won't be coming back here.
