I've heard a lot of great things about America's Taco Shop so I dropped in while my vehicle was being serviced nearby.  Reading over other reviews it appears this location does not live up to the standards that people expect from America's Taco Shop.  I cannot attest as I've never been to other locations.

Oddly enough my complaint is not the good but the price.  I ordered the 3 taco combo and a drink.  With a drink it came in at just under $12.  When my order arrived I was shocked, for the price, to see that it was literally just 3 tacos.  No sides.  

I did enjoy the tacos but it was of no real value.  I can go to a hole-in-the-wall further south down 16th St and get great food, and more of it, for half the price.
