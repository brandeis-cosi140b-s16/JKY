The service is terrible. They don't listen to your order and they charge for every single side of salsa. My friend ordered a taco and got a burrito. She didn't say anything because it's the lunch rush and we had waited long enough. $1.00 for a side of pico that I wanted on top of the tacos. Another $1.00 for a side of enchilada sauce. $6.99 meal ended up to be almost $9.00! Go thing Taco Bell is in the same parking lot.
