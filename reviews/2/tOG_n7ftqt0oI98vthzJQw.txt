Sticking with Vida.  1900 Cantina ambience is comfortable & attempts to be higher end Azteca.  Portions were huge, they couldn't figure out how to change the syrup for the soda.  Menu offerings are what you would expect for any Mexican joint.  Service was non existent & was overall disappointed esp when it is situated in the company of Carpe Diem & Custom Shop expected more from what could be a gem.
