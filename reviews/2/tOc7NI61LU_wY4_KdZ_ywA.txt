I had such high hopes and was so excited to try this place. First experience was on a Monday night and they were hoppin'. Live music and all. Service was good but my meal lacked. I thought it was perhaps my menu choice so I gave it a second shot. Yet again I was disappointed in my food. Always love good chips and salsa pre-meal which they have. Good atmosphere, especially if you're with a group. But sad to report that I was dissatisfied with the taste of the food. I will say they have an amazing view.
