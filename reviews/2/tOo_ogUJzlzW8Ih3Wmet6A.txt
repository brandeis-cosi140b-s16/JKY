Ok the food is tastey, and the atmosphere is welcoming and very comfortable.

However here's the rub (for myself anyway) very little food for. I went to taco guild on a recent week nite along with two friends. We all agreed the food was tastey and the atmosphere very nice. Its 3.75 or 3.95 for each taco at first I thought it seemed a bit on the high side price wise but I thought well this is a gastro pub and the tacos are going to be special, so I went with it. I ordered 3 vegetarian tacos and one side I choose corn off the cob. My companions choose 3 chicken tacos withe the side of corn.  Now when the food arrived we were all surprised at how small the tacos were and they were small. The side of corn was tiny also. The chips and salsa were a nice addition however the small amount of salsa they give you means you need to continously request a refill. Now we ate our food and. Enjoyed the atmosphere.
We all had the same feeling we were all still hungry. 

There are so many fancy restaurants in the phx sctsdale area. And as always it seeems like the main foucus is on making sure the plates and the decour are posh and that there's expensive art. And the food may be delicious. How ever you pay for the atmosphere and the fancy art. And most of the time the portions are small and the prices are high or very high. So you pay a large bill and you leave hungry.  Taco Guild is one of thoses places. For ladies who lunch it may be perfect for a small business lunch fine. But if your  working class lot and are looking for a lunch or dinner. I don't think taco guild will satisfiy your hunger and your wallet will be empty at the same time
