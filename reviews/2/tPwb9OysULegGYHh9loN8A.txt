The family used to love this place, but sadly it's falling off of our favorites list. We visited last night for dinner. We arrived about 6:15p and was told the wait was about 15 min. 30 min later we were seated. 

The service was not good. My table had ordered their drinks, but I couldn't remember the name of what I wanted and had to wait for the server to get me a cocktail menu. 15 min after I finally ordered my drink, I had to ask the server where it was. 

The food has slowly gotten worse while the prices continue to rise. My favorite dish has always been the Camarones Sarandeados. It's my "go to" meal there. They used to serve 5-6 large shrimp but now you get 7-8 much smaller shrimp for $3 more. The sauce is very oily now and it lacks the flavor it used to. 

Everyone who lives in the Henderson area knows that this restaurant is very popular with very limited parking and long waits. It would be nice if they would accept reservations. Over all, I hope the service and food improves or my family will need to find another Mexican restaurant to frequent.
