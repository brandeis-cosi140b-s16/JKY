We stopped by here for dinner with our friend who lives near by. The place was fairly busy but were seated without a wait. Of course the first thing we ordered was the TCT Mexican pizza, essentially a huge tortilla crispy and covered with melted cheese. This was sent back, was lacking cheese. We also ordered the Trio Dip, this was good. I ordered the Grilled Salmon with Green Enchiladas. The Enchilada was tasty, the Salmon was a dry, over cooked wooden like slab of nasty. Wifey ordered the Carnitas Enchiladas and she reported hers were very good. The service was a bit hit an miss, and overall the place came over as a tourist trap. I would be hard pressed to return here or recommend.
