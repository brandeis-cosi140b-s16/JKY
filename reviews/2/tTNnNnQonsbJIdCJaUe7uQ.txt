There's nothing quite so disappointing as a drink that runs you $2 per sip. If I wanted a margarita that was mostly ice I'd have it blended. Five mouthfuls from a ten dollar pint is nearly laughable. 

Maybe if it were half price would I give this place three stars. Subpar beans and rice in tiny portions only serve to make the nearly average tacos seem nice by comparison. 

The staff seems to be trying to make up for the shortcomings of this place, but it's a shame it probably won't last long enough to make their training time worth it. Their enthusiasm gives this place one star above the minimum.
