Highly recommended by several friends, I found the food to be marginal. Nothing real special here. The service was great, attentive and friendly. The margaritas were excellent though. All in all, not anything I cant  find at my local Macayo's. Just remembered, the bathroom ( Men's) was a mess, also not handicap accessable.
