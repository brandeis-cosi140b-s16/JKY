Oh Sandbar I am sooooo confused. Do people come here to eat, drink, or dance?!?!?! It was Saturday night, the line was wrapped around the building which is a joke because you do not want to WAIT to be in this place!!! Security everywhere and cops in the parking lot just waiting for someone to get rowdy. Very welcoming as if the President were here with the Secret Service!?!? I did not want to wait!! Where theres a will, theres a way!! We walked up to the VIP line (Yes theres a VIP line at a "Mexican Grill") they let our group right in it helps if your group is no males and cute girls of course ;) No cover for ladies thank god I'd never pay to come here!!

So we get in and head for the bar theres a wait of course!! We get our first round and look for a place to get comfy for the night. We got lucky and found a large dirty table in the corner where we could watch everyone from afar. We also got the cute waitress that didnt know how to clean tables go figure. 

Do not try to get on the dance floor here it is the dumbest thing you can do unless you want to feel like a sardine in a can, then by all means dont let me stop you!! The music I must say is ghetto fabulous with all the rap and I can not count how many times I saw the Pussycat Dolls on the screen. Great dancing music if say this were in fact a dance club!?!? 

The grill smell I had to endure all night and bring home with me on my clothes does have me curious about the food here so I will return but only during the day when this place is not cluttered with security and is somewhat less amusing to my senses.
