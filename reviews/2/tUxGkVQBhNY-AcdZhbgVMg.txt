Decimos adios a La Piñata, We used to go to the old location at 19th Ave & Osborn. In fact we started going there in the mid-1970s. It was smaller and the bar was separate, and there was a dining room in back of the bar, I think, I never went into the bar, but the rest of the restaurant was in two separate rooms. It kept the noise level down to just the patrons in the room. This new place is one huge room, like a giant barn. It made me feel as if I were in an unruly crowd, as the noise level was incredibly loud. The sense of semi-intimacy in all those booths in the old place was gone. You're just herded in with all those people everywhere. The louder one talks, the louder the others talk to be heard over the noise until everyone's talking in a loud voice. On top of that the bar is right in this giant cavern of a place. Noisy, noisy, noisy and my wife's charbroiled quesadilla was not 1 2 3 to those she got at the old place. Needless to say, "mucho ruido" (too much noise). Sad to lose the old La Piñata.  Needless to say, we won't be back.
