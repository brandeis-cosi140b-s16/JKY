I hadn't been to this restaurant for the past 12 years but it's where my parents would always take us when we were in town. So I have good memories of my mom and I bringing our Bob and Cha Cha refillable margarita glasses here back then. We decided to take the kids there tonight to share the memories... Sometimes memories need to stay just memories. I don't think there has been one single upgrade to this place since before we used to come here. My chair was broken, the table needed refinishing and let's just say I didn't feel comfortable setting my purse on that carpet. Long story short, the margarita mix was bottled, the food was bad and the server was, let's just say quirky. Even my 9 year old daughter said her kids menu cheeseburger wasn't good...  Honestly the only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because the chips were good and the salsa didn't suck.
