The place was at quarter capacity. I sat at a booth between other customers and waited while a guy cleaned and set a vacant table. I saw the waitress come out of the kitchen and visit a table. She came out one other time and visited same table. Was she also the cook? I don't know how else to explain her absence. It was probably a good five but it felt like every bit of ten minutes before I left, never to be acknowledged. None of the other four peopled tables were visited in this time, just the one that the waitress visited.
