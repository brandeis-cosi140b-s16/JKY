Went for lunch and was very disappointed. We wanted a margarita but they only had the specials. The waitress suggested we didn't want the bar margarita as the tequila wasn't all that great. So we ordered the specials and they were not that great. My grilled taco was really boring. A soft shell with chicken and lettuce. That's it! For $10 I expected better. My wife has the fajita salad. Again, boring, mostly lettuce. Two drinks, two bad meals and $40 later, we won't be back.
