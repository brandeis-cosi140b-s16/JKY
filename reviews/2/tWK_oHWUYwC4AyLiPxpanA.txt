Maybe we went too late, but our "fresh made chips with salsa" were cold and stale. Our meals were both terrible, like they were frozen or made a week ago. I got the mango chipotle chicken. My husband got sopapitas. We just threw away our to go boxes because we didn't want the food. Our waiter was outstanding and we didn't want to offend him. He was so good! The margaritas were delicious. My advice is to go early. We went late at like 8:30...
