A friend picked this place when we were visiting from out of town. The parking lot is pretty torn up and we actually were afraid it might not be open at first. The place is HUGE, but pretty much empty when we got there. They sat us at a table, but the waiter seemed pretty annoyed when we wanted to wait for the rest of our party to arrive before ordering drinks.  They wanted to rush our dinner order also which I don't understand considering how empty it was and the more laid back vibe I had been told to expect in comparison to NY. I might have ordered appetizers had I been given enough time to decide.

I got a combo plate that had a cheese enchilada & chile releno. The sauce had a bit of a skin on it, but everything tasted OK for fast food Mexican standards. The corn tamale filling that they give a tiny scoop of is honestly the best thing on the plate. The rice was overcooked and hard. My husband had the same but added a beef taco that was just as unmemorable. One of our dining companions had a veggie fajita that turned out to be mostly potatoes and that seemed to be the most diet friendly thing on the menu. 

Overall, the food was edible which is more than you can say for alot of chain Mexican places. I was just hoping for a bit better considering we were vacationing in the southwest.
