This restaurant is fast becoming our neighborhood restaurant... let me tell you why.  First, you feel at home, always a smile, super super clean, the service is fast but the food is delish and hot.  The Blue margarita... is must have!!!! after one, you can't drink and drive... hahaha, sooooooooo good.  Bottom line is, we love it... we go once a week, the price is so good, we can actually afford to go once or twice a week.  I hope it stays the way it is... plus my hubby loves when the waiter call him "my friend" LOL.

Re-review

After over a year of loving this place, they change staff and the new people are horrible, the food change, sad but I would never go back.
