As hard as it is to give Salsarita's a bad review My experience today just topped it.  First let me say that this bad review is for this location.  I have never had bad experiences at the other locations, but this isn't the first time I've had a bad experience here.  First, I arrived at 1:30 PM which I would think would be after the lunch crowd, but the line was almost out the door.  At first there were only three people working the line, but eventually it got to five.  Also, when I ordered the taco salad (the Thursday special) they were almost out of romaine lettuce.  If this was my first experience at Salsarita's I probably wouldn't come back.  I think I'll be done with this location, cannot wait until the Quail Corners location reopens.
