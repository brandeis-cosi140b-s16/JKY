Not the best, not the worst.  Food was ok to good.  Went here thinking I was trying out a Mexican restaurant I had read good reviews for on Yelp.  The reviews I had read were actually for Taqueria Guadalajara, but we ended up here.   There weren't many cars in the lot but there were a few families there to eat.  We walked in and had to wait a while to be greeted.  The gentleman was pleasant and seated us.  The menu is too busy for my taste.  Prices were fair for the meals served and I would say moderate in price.  I had some Chimichangas which were pretty good.  They are the small kind, about 4 inches long and stuffed with meat.  The chicken was not as moist as I would like it but not dry.  (Dry chicken is a big problem at Mexican restaurants from my experience.)  The sauces and sour cream was watered down, runny, which I have also seen at other Mexican Restaurants.  Is this a way to make the salsa stretch?  Not sure.  Maybe they like it this way.  The sauce wasn't near enough either, had to order more.
The chicken burrito was large but mostly meat.  Needed more rice, beans etc.  We weren't too thrilled with this.  
The eating area is pretty large. It is like a large cafe.  It would be a good place for lunch if you had a large group and wanted something quick.  For dinner I would go elsewhere.
With so many other good places to go to I would say not to bother with La Hacienda.
One last thing.  I got the impression that the staff didn't really want to be there.  Like they were holding things together.  Not the best spirit to impart.
