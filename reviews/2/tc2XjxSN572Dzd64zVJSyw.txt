I'm writing this review from their premises. On our arrival the restaurant was empty. We ordered drinks and food at the same time. Unfortunately they arrived as we ordered them - at the same time, actually food arrived before drinks. Our cashier was our server - understaffed..??

Food is decent, but service at this location is really really poor!! Not geared towards keeping customers - no wonder this place is always empty at dinner time. We feel rushed to leave with impersonable and inattentive service. They always miss to deliver our roasted jalape√±os although we get charged for them. My margarita came after our food - please, is this a friendly neighborhood Mexican restaurant or a Mcdonald's  type of corporate BS..? 

It's the height of the Soccer World Cup and the tv inside is blaring a baseball game..?? That shows to me the complete detachment of owners to their franchisees. It's an American money making machine, not the family owned Mexican restaurant it was portrayed to be in their advertisements.

This place will be going down!
