After being seated I waited almost 30 mins for a waiter to come over to me. The whole time there were a group of waiters huddled trying to figure out who was assigned to me. Now I'm waiting an additional 15 mins for the waiter to bring me a simple glass of water. Definitely going to bail never to return....
