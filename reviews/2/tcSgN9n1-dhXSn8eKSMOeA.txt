Granted there were two large parties in our area, but service was extremely slow and inattentive. The food was ok, nothing extraordinary, but not bad. We waited 19 minutes after we were visibly done with our meal for our waiter to finally come back by and ask if we were ready, then it took probably another 10 minutes to get our check give him the card and get it back. I went in at 8pm thinking it could be a nice quick dinner and took almost 2 hours for 2 people..just seems ridiculous to me.
