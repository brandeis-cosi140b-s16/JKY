our server was Jonathan asked for the enchiladas de harina and much to my surprise i recieved a big burrito on the table-i told him i ordered the enchiladas and he said " this is what u ordered its in a tortilla-i didnt eat much of it at the time because i got full on chips and salsa-when i got home the next day i was surprised that the whole "enchilada " was a bunch of shredded beef not the 3 combo enchiladas that was supposed to be one cheese one chicken and ONE beef i ordered so in other words i recieved the wrong item-very disapointed in john
