I've been hearing about Tee Pee for years; it's considered a Phoenix landmark, I think!  George W Bush has been there afterall!  But it wasn't until my husband purchased a groupon for this place, that I was forced to go check it out.  

My quick summary:
*chips and salsa - meh, nothing special, kind of stale tasting to be honest
*guacamole - nasty
*Bud Light - A-OK
*Chicken Tostada - decent
*House Salad - decent but simple (it's just lettuce and tomato)
*Service - friendly and attentive although it did take awhile to get ice water, and when we finally did, we were handed a pitcher and 3 glasses.  I realized it was 3 glasses for the 2 of us because 2 of them were stuck together - classic!

Bottom line: I don't eat Mexican very often, but when I do, I'll likely go elsewhere.
