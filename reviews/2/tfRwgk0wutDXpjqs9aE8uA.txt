When I crave Mexican, all I really ask for is a good margarita, decent rice, and some cheesy meaty goodness wrapped in a tortilla. Unfortunately, salsa's disappointed me in all of these areas. The margarita was watery, the food was mediocre, and the only promptness I saw from the bartender was when she brought there check. I'll stick with taco bell next time I want crappy Mexican and slow service.
