Very dissapointed in service, although I believe they are currently understaffed..

I am a regular and decided to make the order over the phone and was placed on hold for 5 min. I decided to run errands while on hold... Still no answer. I walked in and there was no one in line. As I asked the lady in the front counter. She said that she had to take preference to the several customers that were there at the time and phone calls were not a priority. I stated she could of offered a call back or take a quick note, I was surprised at her comment and told her I'm so dissapointed since we have been regulars for so long. She told me to call the number on the menu if I wanted to complain... I decided to cancel my order and go elsewhere... The food is genuinely good, but the service is just very poor. Decided to drive over to the Mercado inside of Desert Sky mall to order the Tortas there, where the quality and customer service Is excellent...
