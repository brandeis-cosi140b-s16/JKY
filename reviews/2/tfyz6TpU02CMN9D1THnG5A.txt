Been here once. Doesn't shine but doesn't make me advise to never try. I personally went since we had a coupon and were feeding 5. With a coupon it may be fine but for the better tasting food this isn't the place.

The staff were very friendly but that was the highlight of our meal. Even the Mojito was barely good at best.

I'll be trying another local business in the future, but may be back for a second chance. They didn't completely drive me away...
