Soooo I ordered a taco de Barbacoa and a burrito and my taco was ridiculously salty which was sad and then I bit my burrito and realized it came with nothing but meat. If you want beans and cheese its extra. I've never been to a Mexican restaurant where you had to pay extra to eat an actual burrito when you order a freaking burrito. Don't call it a burrito. Call it a super taco cus thats basically what it is. But yeah the carne asada is decent and the place is really clean but I am genuinely upset about their so called burritos. I am writing this review from the Filibertos drive thru where I'm getting a real burrito.
