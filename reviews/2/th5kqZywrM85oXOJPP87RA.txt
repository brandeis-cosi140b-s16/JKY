Good food! Really slow service! 

If you like to linger this is a great place to chill at, but don't come here when you're hungry and in a rush. The servers here take their sweet ass time. It was so bad I even witnessed a family walking out and left their table because no one was assisting them for about half an hour! Either this place needs better management or you need servers that care.

Other than that this place has good food, awesome music, and a lovely location.
