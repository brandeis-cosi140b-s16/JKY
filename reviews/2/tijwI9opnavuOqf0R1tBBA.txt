Terribly slow at lunch time. No sense of urgency whatsoever!!!!!! This was the first time I have been to a Chipotle with no consistency. When you visit a chain restaurant you expect to have a similar experience each time you visit. This visit was enough for me to not return to a Chipotle. 
The employees didn't seem to have any knowledge of how each item should come. If there are certain items that come with a burrito for example, you shouldn't have to list every ingredient that you want in your burrito. I asked for a burrito bowl, however it's prepared,  and the cheese and sour cream were left off. The employee clearly had no idea what they were doing. I know that those should have been on my burrito bowl. 
The guest I was with asked for the ingredients in her burrito mixed together (before rolling), something that I have done plenty of times before with no trouble. Well they did a disappointing job of meeting that request. Just a completely pathetic and disappointing visit. Won't be back.
