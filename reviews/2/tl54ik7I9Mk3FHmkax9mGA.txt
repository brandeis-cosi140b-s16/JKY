I am not really reviewing the food per se...everyone has had Roberto's, and everyone knows you can find better Mexican food elsewhere.

But when Tacos El Gordo is closed at 3am, this is the first place some people think of when they want salty mexican food lol.

We ordered the old favorite, the carne asada fries...which come in a huge tub for about $7-8.  They are huge, and two hungry people can pound em out and not need more.

The restaurant wasn't busy, so the food came out fairly fast, but their was a little bit of food on the ground and the bathroom was a mess.  They probably run a thin crowd at night, but somebody trashed it and it wasn't cleaned by the time I got there.

It is a solid place to eat late, but if you are coming down here during the day time, you can do a LOT better
