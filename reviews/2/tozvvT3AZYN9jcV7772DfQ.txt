We were tired from doing tourist crap all day and came back to our cheapie hotel, the LVH, to cool the heels. By dinner time we were too tired to go anywhere else so gave this place a shot. Unlike others, we were actually greeted immediately and seated. From there on, please trust the other reviews and go elsewhere. At 6 on a Sunday nite the place was a ghost town with only 2 other tables seated and Motley Crue music videos blaring. I get the Vince Neil connection but this was over-the-top annoying. Our server was good, very attentive, which frankly we expected with the lack of other customers. Food was very blah. As others noted, chips and salsa were right out of the grocery store, fish tacos were fried/microwaved, and beef "machaca" tacos were just cold mushed meat. Ugh. We were tired, it was food and no one got sick so I guess it ended OK. Overall, stay away from this restaurant and more to the point, the LVH in general. New ownership is destroying the place, literally and figuratively.
