The best part of San Antonio's is the $1 margarita, but as other reviewers have said, make it a $2 margarita and get the extra shot.  

That, unfortunately, was the best part of the experience.  Not trying to be a hater, but....

I went there with my girlfriend at 8PM on a Thursday.  We were told it would be a 10 minute wait - turned out to be 20.  Not a big deal.  There is not a ton of room at the bar to get drinks while you wait (too many tables in the bar), so we opted to wait outside.  Again, not a big deal.  

We were seated and the waiter showed up in just a couple of minutes.  My girlfriend got one of their premium margaritas.  I got the $2 margarita.  Both were good.  

The guacamole is made table side, but was just OK.  I've had more flavorful guac at many other places.  Probably my biggest complaint was no salt and too much lime juice.  But, in general, it was fine.   The chips they serve are just not good.  They are slightly thicker than others and were either too cool or stale, so they crunched funny.  Just not flavorful.  

Now, the entrees.  In my opinion, really not that good.  I had the beef rib burrito with rice and refried beans.  The beef rib filling was way too greasy inside the burrito.  Every bite I took was just full of oil.  Not good at all.  The rice was bland, but I feel most rice dishes at Mexican restaurants are.  The beans were OK, but nothing great.  

My girlfriend had the combo fajitas - chicken and fresh vegetables.  It looked more like stir-fry than fajitas.  I had a few bites and while they were tasty, the plate still looked like a mess and I have enjoyed better fajitas at Chili's.  

All and all, I was not impressed.  I'll go back, but only for appetizers and margaritas at the bar.
