Every time I go to this location (only because it's close to my home) they act like the food is always about to run out. They give you the smallest portions possible of everything you ask for. I order chicken and am lucky to get a dozen small pieces in the whole bowl. Want sour cream? Hope you like just a tiny drizzle! They FORCE you to ask for reasonable portions in comparison to what they're actually charging you and then act like you're making their job harder. And god forbid if you order chips and salsa. They will give you HALF of a TINY little container's worth of salsa for a large bag of chips EVERY TIME. When I try to ask for a portion of salsa reasonable to what I'm actually paying for, they give me attitude EVERY time and either blow me off or give me another tiny half full container. They also always seem to run out of stuff quite often and early. (Ran out of forks? Really??) If I'm paying $30 for two people to eat there I'd like to be satisfied at least one time and not feel ripped off and I'm also just fed up with the tug of war with the staff. On the plus side, what food you DO get there is damn tasty.
