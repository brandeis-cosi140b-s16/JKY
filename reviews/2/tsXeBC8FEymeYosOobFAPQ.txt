I'm not normally one to go out of my way to share a negative review, but I feel like it's warranted in this instance. First, I'll say that the food was tasty and the server was as attentive as she most likely could have been given how busy the restaurant was. 

My grievance is with how much I was charged: I ordered a burrito, with no wrap and instead on a bed of mixed greens, and no rice substituting extra vegetables. On my bill was a $2 surcharge for a "side salad"  (the bed of lettuce equalled maybe half-a-cup of shredded lettuce ... definitely not a side salad) and a $2.25 surcharge for "extra vegetables." 

Now, I'm not unreasonable and assumed I'd be charged something for the substitutions but feel like the server should have discussed the charges with me beforehand since they were so outlandish. I wound up paying $17.50 (before tip) for what essentially was a deconstructed burrito minus the rice and wrap.
