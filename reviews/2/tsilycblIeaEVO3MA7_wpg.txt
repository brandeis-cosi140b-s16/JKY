In general our family really likes Rubios.  This location does not seem to have the same quality or consistency as the one we go to in Surprise.  The few times we have stopped in, it has been somewhat disappointing.

That said, we would still go back only because we really like the menu, and they have truly healthy options with some menu items.  Just wish the food looked as good when it comes out of the kitchen as it does in Surprise.
