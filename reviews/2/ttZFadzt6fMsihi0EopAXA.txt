The chips were good,but is that saying much? I will give them kudos on their service,because they were very attentive. I ordered the carne asada burrito (and you know that's the thing I check for first usually if you are a Mexican establishment) with rice and beans. The burrito was average but the thing that didnt set well for me was their rice. It tasted like it was out the box.  This place has a long way to go to beat Vivo Michocan, Fausto's, Super Mex,etc...
