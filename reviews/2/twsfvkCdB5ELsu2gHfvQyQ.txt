I've never been to an On the Boarder before- but I was in the mood for Mexican and I was at the mall shopping with a friend -so we didn't want to go too far. 

We started with a serving of guacamole - which was meh - it was basically mashed avocado. 

Next I had the tres enchiladas - one of each kind (chicken, cheese, and beef). The tortillas were very rubbery and the dish was way too salty. 

Not particularly cheap either for a run-of-the-mill lunch, I paid about $18 for my entree, 1/2 Guac, ...and a water. 


I wouldn't return here on my own accord.
