Let me tell you the food is very good but unfortunately if you're a white woman with a Mexican American husband you will be looked down upon. Now I have been there previously and never had this type of treatment but today there was a difference in the way we were treated. First we sat ourselves after waiting at the door for 5 mins there was no wait to be seated sign. So we assumed we were to seat ourselves we were given chips by some lady then we sat and waited as the staff did anything but come to our table they rolled silverware and talked about us as we sat and waited for 15 mins. Finally after deciding who was going to wait on us they came and got our order and I'm hoping it's as good as it usually is. I have been gone for a month in a business venture and wanted to have that as my first meal home I am hoping it won't have to be the last time
