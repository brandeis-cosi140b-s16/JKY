To celebrate our mothers birthday, we decided to take her somewhere special on 5/26/14. She loves seafood and we all know its not cheap. I started my search on yelp for a good place with good reviews. This place showed to be great in both pictures and reviews. Prices were high but I thought due to such praise on Yelp, that it would be worth it. 

We are a family from Mazatlan Sinaloa so we expected good food. As soon as we entered, there was no greeting and no seating. We brought a cake of our own so that was nice of them to store it in their fridge. Let me just say everything after that was pretty disappointing (service that is). 

It's Memorial Day and we expected ALOT of people eating out so we were patient but it took FOREVER to get our our order placed. I felt bad for BOTH waitresses. Yes only 2 girls who where running around like headless chickens. Sorry but 2 people to wait on a full restaurant was not enough. 

The food was very tasty but very pricy as well. I was shocked when I heard that one can of soda was $2.50! In our party there was 6 adults and 5 children. Our bill came out to be over $200 with tip included. Now I heard directly from another restaurant (olive garden) that it was no longer legal to include a tip on a bill of 6+ people. Is this true and if so why did they Include it? I was ok with food taste but not with the service. I don't believe they should tip themselves!

I think next time I feel like eating seafood, I will deffinately try out a different place and don't plan to go back to La Mojarra Loca. I tried it. Didnt like the service. Moving on...
