Okay so you are in the mood for some great Mexican food.  You want to head out to Charlotte International Airport and give this place a try.  Right?

Of course not. The reason you are eating here is because your flight was cancelled and suddenly you have five hours to kill at CLT airport.  That's why I ate here last Friday night, and that's the only reason anybody eats here.  The place is full of tired, grouchy travelers, with their luggage stacked all over the floor and on the seats, and all that anybody just wants is to get the hell out of that airport and go home. It's depressing.   Don't try to compare this place to a good local Mexican place in your own neighborhood.

Anyhow -- I ordered chicken enchiladas, which were revolting. They tasted like fish, not chicken, and they were swimming in a watery green sauce.  The refried beans were like wallpaper paste.  I ordered a draft beer, which tasted slightly suspicious.  The water does taste a little funny here.  The lady next to me ordered a shockingly expensive premium margarita that seemed to be mostly water.  You can't get out the door for much less than $20 per person.  In other words, it's about what you'd expect.

To his credit, my waiter was working hard and trying to make the best of a bad situation.  I wouldn't want his job.

Whatever.  At least I got home eventually.  The food here may be terrible, the prices high, and the atmosphere depressing. But I'm sure I'll be back some day and so will you.  The good news is that CLT has free wifi, so at least you are able to check the YELP reviews and know what you are getting into.
