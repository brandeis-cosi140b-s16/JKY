I know this place is on the strip, but $55 for 4 drinks??  You've got to be kidding me.  I was here with a group of people celebrating a friend's birthday.  The table service was pretty good considering that we had a party of 15.  Seating was quick and the food came out quickly.

I had the pork burrito and it came with beans, rice, and salsa.  I swear it was comparable to Taco Bell and more than 3 times the price.

It's a pretty restaurant and conveniently connected to Monte Carlo (I won $67 waiting for my friends).  I don't think it's worth the price.
