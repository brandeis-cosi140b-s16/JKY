This is the Slowest Chipotle I have ever been to. They always have a line wrapped around the store but that does not seem to encourage the 6 employees behind the counter to step up the pace at all. Minimum wait time on average is usually 20mins. I have been to Numerous Chipotles in my day and this is by far the slowest moving one I have ever been to. Super disappointing because it is close and convenient to my house.
