everyone loves this place except me. seriously, have you seen all these reviews? people rave about this place but i think it blows. 

we went there later one night after thinking about getting some fish tacos and we were basically ignored by our waiter all night, which in retrospect was probably a good thing because he looked like he was about to set the place on fire anyway and we didnt want him to start with us.

i got blackened mahi fish tacos and they were pretty bland, i didn't finish it and then we waited around to get our check for a while longer wondering if we were about to get our faces burned off by our unhappy server or our check so we could get the hell out of there. when we finally did leave (faces intact) i asked some friends if they had been to cabo fish taco and they said they loved that place. 

moral of the story: i hate this place but you will probably love it forever.
