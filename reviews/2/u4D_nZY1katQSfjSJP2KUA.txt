When will restaurant owners learn that great service is as important, perhaps more important, than great food?  Just left Los Sombreros North ... first visit .... was looking for a late workday lunch.   OK food, high prices, no chips (extra charge), no water,  no ice tea refill.   They weren't even busy.  $14.05 plus $2.00 tip for me.   Still hungry ..... think I will go to Costco for a $1.60 hot dog + soda.   Never again.
