Stopped in here for lunch on our first day in Phoenix.

Ice cold Corona's at $4 a pop. Nice.

A bowl of fresh and warm nacho chips with two types of salsa was served with the menus. Nice.

My other half had the shrimp cocktail. She said she liked it. Nice.

I had the shrimp with a butter/lemon sauce that came with a salad, rice and beans, and a flour tortilla. It tasted great, but they lose a star because they did not deshell any of the shrimp. Not nice......
