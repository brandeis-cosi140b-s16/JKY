I missed the lunch buffet and went for dinner.  The hostess could not recommend anything at dinner and told me lunch buffet was the best.  Anywho, I ordered the texacana beef, chicken and shrimp with peppers and onions over a bed of lettuce.  The hostess said that would be good for me.  When it came out, I was unimpressed.  It tasted bland and I asked for some dressing over it.  They returned with green salsa.  The hostess said I knew you wouldn't like it and you should not have ordered.  hmmm.  Still not tasty, I took it To-Go.  The only good food I ate at dinner were the chips and salsa.  I will return for the lunch buffet for another review.
