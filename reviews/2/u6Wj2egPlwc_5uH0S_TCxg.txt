Im not one that turns to yelp once I've experienced sub par service. However today I am. 

Cashier was very mildly polite, not too much well known english. The premises was clean, and smelled good. The only down side was that the cook was not wearing gloves and touching meat that was going into my order. (2 sets on 3 rolled tacos.) Very unpleasant to watch all of that meat being contaminated by unprotected hands. I made a comment about it to another employee, whom had directed the cook to apply gloves afterwards.
I went on to ask that my food be re-prepared with gloves and he obliged that it would. However the food came out more than promptly (which would imply that it wasn't made right.) 
Being in my hungry, man up, fuck it mindstate I ate the contaminated food anyways. On that note however i won't be returning for any future purchases, and wouldn't reccomend that anyone does.

How's the health department gonna' give you an "A", but your cook isn't practicing safe food handling?
