Only reason I come to this place is for my wife. She enjoys their beef fiesta salad. Chips and salsa are pretty good. Otherwise it's your typical food chain. The takeout area is dirty and so are the main doors exiting the restaurant where people place their hands to open. Sounds like a nice job for the hostess when she's standing around doing not much. Food otherwise is average. Won't become a favorite.
