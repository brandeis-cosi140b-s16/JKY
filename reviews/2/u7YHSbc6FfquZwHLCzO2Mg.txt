Good food. And very big portions. But too pricey. I had the chicken fajita and it was definitely enough for two, but $16 plus tip for lunch is way too much for Mexican. They also charge the same as other places for sodas, but do not have refills. They give you the can (but they didn't have my preferred Zero even though they had coke products). Get a lunch menu!
