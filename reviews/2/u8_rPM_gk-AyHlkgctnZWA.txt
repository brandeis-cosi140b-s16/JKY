We ate there last night sitting in the lovely spot inside under the big tree. The food was for the most part, delicious!! My lower rating is because of the service. We sat for 15 minutes without anyone approaching us. When our server did approach there was no apology just biz as usual. We ordered a bottle of wine which took another 15 minutes to get. We saw it sitting at the bar just couldn't get it to our table. It was lukewarm at best which is not the way a good Pinot Noir should be . The server then explained that all the foods are small plates, tapas-style. So, we ordered four things. They all came fairly quickly except for the tacos which were comped by the manager for being late. Different servers as well as ours brought the food out but often left completely empty plates from the last dish sitting at our table. It got so bad that we actually put one empty plate on the floor by our feet.Several of the  dishes were not explained as is AND were fairly sizable, leaving me to feel like the server either doesn't know the food well or didn't wan to tell us we had ordered ALOT of food. 
I think better server training protocol would certainly eb in order for this really good restaurant.
