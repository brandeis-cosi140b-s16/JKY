Dear Escobars Management -- If you are listening. . . I have been a loyal patron of your restaurant for years. You've been up and down, HOWEVER. . . 
   Yesterday I came in for brunch with visiting family on Easter, and our waitress was an embarrassment.  The food was good, but what strange service. 
   She was clearly on a diverse mix of prescription meds, because she had a hard time communicating with us.  The food was cold, because she brought it out one plate at a time for a group of 6, and proceeded to talk our face off as we were about to leave, despite being cold and indifferent during the rest of the meal. A little training might be in order here. 
Maybe you had the B-team on staff for Easter - but y'all need to check yourself before you wreck yourself.
