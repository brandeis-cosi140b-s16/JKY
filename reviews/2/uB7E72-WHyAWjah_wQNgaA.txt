We have been going here for years. Late night was the final straw. The screwed up on my meal twice. Soda was bad also (no syrup). Service was soooo slow. Kids get deserts with there meals and we finally left after waiting forever to get them and went to McDonald's for ice cream. At least that didn't take forever to get it. Too many great Mexican restaurants in this town to chose from to mess with a mediocre one. Done and done.
