The favorable perception of food positively correlates with the person's alcohol level regardless the actual quality of the food.  With this in mind, I proffer Del Taco as the prime example.  Nobody with a sophisticated palette would enjoy Del Taco if they were actually sober.  And, even when drunk, I'd much prefer Taco Bell over Del Taco.  However, options are limited at 3am and after downing nearly a 5th of vodka, anything sounds divine - even Del Taco.  When you've just finished hitting the clubs at the MGM, rest well knowing that Del Taco is right around the corner.  [Original Visit: November 6, 2010]
