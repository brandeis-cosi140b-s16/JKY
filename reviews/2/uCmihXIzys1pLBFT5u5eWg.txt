It's ok far from great. I got two varieties of the tacos. $3.25 plus each. Should be no more than $2 each. They were nothing to write  home about. The salsa has a funky taste to it. I think they put sugar in it. The margaritas are cheap and weak. I would eat here again if passing by but it's not a place I would suggest  to go to. The service needs a lot of work had to flag down the server for everything including salt.
