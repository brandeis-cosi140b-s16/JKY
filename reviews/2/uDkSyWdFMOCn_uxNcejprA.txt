Several friends had eaten here and said it was pretty good. I ate dinner here this week. It's very clean, which I liked very much. They serve chips and salsa and those were good. They gave my son free rice and refried beans, which were pretty good. I thought this was a very nice of them. I ordered the pollo fundido which was chicken breast covered in melted cheese.  I did not care for it. The cheese was waxy and tasted like white American cheese, the square Kraft kind I haven't eaten since I was a kid. My husband got the carne Asada quesadilla and he didn't like the flavor of the meat, but it was pretty big and had a lot of meat in it. I thought it was a little pricey, but I probably feel that way because I didn't enjoy my food. My plate was $15.50 and my husband's was about the same. The staff was really nice and friendly though and they checked on us often.  I don't have any plans to return at this time.
