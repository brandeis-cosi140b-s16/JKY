I wasn't impressed by the food or experience. We had a long wait but not enough room in the "lobby." It's a converted house so I like the character of the place. However, our service was extremely loud-for no reason-the food was just bleh, and my husband's fajitas was saucy (why, I don't know). His meat was over cooked. The highlight? The margaritas were amazing! I may go back for happy hour but probably not for food.
