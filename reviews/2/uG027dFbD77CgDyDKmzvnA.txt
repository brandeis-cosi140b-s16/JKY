Besides having to wait 10 minutes to place my order via drive thru, repeat my order 4 times & the lady having a huge attitude, I guess this Taco Bell location is okay. Two stars mostly because the lady's attitude sucked & having to repeat what I wanted so many times made me cut my order short just to avoid the hassle of ordering additional items (or trying to) with this overwhelmingly joyful employee.
