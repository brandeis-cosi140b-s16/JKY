Our experience was contrary to some of the previous reviews.  The atmosphere was hopping and a mixed crowd.  We were on the patio where it initially was pretty comfortable considering it was 110 outside.  Unfortunately some nitwit decided that since the sun had gone down it must be cool outside so they raised the shades.  This unfortunately raised the temps to the level that I guess enough people complained and they lowered them back down, but the damage had been done.  Our waiter busted his butt to work our table of 6.  But there was definnitely disconnects between him and the rest of the staff.  It was nearly 15 minutes between the time we got the first entree and the final one.  We had wrong drinks delivered, other table's dishes placed on our table, and when you pay $25 for a few slices of carne asada and some grilled onions, you would at least expect it to be cooked to order.  Instead, rather than the medium rare I ordered, what I received was pretty much well done and had a burnt char taste to it like the grill hadn't been cleaned in a month.  At this point we were pretty much ready to leave the inferno and get the hell out of there.  Might be the place to be seen but if you're looking for cuisine, look elsewhere.
