After seeing this on The Food Network, I was super excited to try it. It was not great! 
I had the Mahi Mahi tacos both BBQ and blackened. Too much seasoning and salty. The crab and shrimp dip appetizers were ok, they tasted like a sour cream and onion potato chip. 

Service was awesome! But I will not be back:(
