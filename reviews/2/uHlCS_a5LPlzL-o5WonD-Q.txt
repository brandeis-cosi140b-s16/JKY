Pros:  good home made salsa, plenty of
Chips, especial margarita, fun dido dip 

Cons: service - had to ask for a drink, asked to order and get the check. Waitress acted as if we were a hassle.  Food turnaround time was extremely long. Plates came out super hot but the food was luke warm at best. 

Overall:  still on a search for decent Mexican food in Phoenix. I do not recommend spending your hard earned money at this establishment.  I wish I would have picked up a burrito from a fast food joint instead.
