There's a large, beautiful painting on the inside of Frida's if you sit to the left of the hostess station.  Only, the painting is too big for the wall and it was hung sideways.  This is a good metaphor for Frida's.

The food is so-so.  The carnitas quesedilla is typically smothered in cheddar cheese and grease, so it's tasty.  But there's no spice and it's soggy.  The chips and salsa are average, unless you ask for the hot salsa which is actually hot.  The service is below average, even if you go when it's not busy.  Even though I go there probably twice a month because it's close to work, I've never had the same server twice which leads me to believe the turnover is high, even for a restaurant.  

Frida's has potential.  The inside is beautiful, the menu has enough variety.  But everything is a little sideways.
