We had  a gift card from a friend, so we used it to towards a birthday outing.  The service was great, our waitress was top-notch and friendly.  They had great drink specials ($3.50 margaritas, $2.50 beers), and we loved the chips and salsa.  The Queso, however was so salty and watery.  We should have returned it immediately but we were all pretty hungry.  I got the Try 3 - with the fish taco being my favorite.  I was surprised at the tiny tostado.  Hubby got the steak burrito, and while it was huge, the steak itself was pretty chewy and the flavor was boring, too.  I'd return to Don Pedro's or Azteca or any one of the local Mexican eateries next time.
