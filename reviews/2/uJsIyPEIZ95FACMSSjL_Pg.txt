I wanted to fall in love with this place, I really did. Unfortunately, I found the food to be seemingly inadequate. I ordered the guacamole as an appetizer, and it was....okay. I mean, it was good, but nowhere near the pedestal people have placed it on. For my entree, I settled for tacos. Weirdly, I found them to be bland. The ambience was lovely and romantic, although a bit noisy. Overall, I'm too lazy an individual to make concerted efforts so as to try a restaurant the second time after it has disappointed me the first..so I will not be returning.
