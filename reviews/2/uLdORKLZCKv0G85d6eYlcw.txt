I found a 2/1 coupon in the print edition of the RJ.  We dined at the Tropicana location approximately 4 years ago, but this was our first time at this location.  It took awhile for anyone to wait on us after being seated, but we eventually were served industrial taco chips and two bottled salsas.  Our cheese enchiladas were accompanied by the usual refried beans, dried out Spanish rice and iceberg lettuce salad.  The enchiladas were tasty, but everything else was very mediocre.
