I've tried a few items from their menu like the fish tacos, Carne asada tacos and their chorizo burrito. I was pretty dissapointed each time in the flavors. everything is fresh but it just isn't very good in my opinion. my dad loves the tacos here though and I do admit the salsa is great but there just isn't anything that would make me go back here.
