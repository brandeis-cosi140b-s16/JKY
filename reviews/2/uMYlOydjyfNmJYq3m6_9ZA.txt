Everything looks nice, but a lot of the aesthetics are holdovers from when this was Agave. Like a lot of other Yelpers I was excited about this place opening up off the strip, but unfortunately it failed to live up to expectations. I would give it a one star except the employees were nice! Unfortunately the happy hour menu is unclear, the point of sale system doesn't seem to like discounting anything correctly, the drinks aren't great and the food isn't any good. Everything we ordered came out without key ingredients (like.. chicken..) or just plain tasted bad. Probably not coming back, not with so many other happy hour options in the area.
