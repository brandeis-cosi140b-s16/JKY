I am pretty upset with Burrito Drive this evening. After spending close to $40 (with tip mind you) I did not receive my chips for my chips and guacamole. I called immediately and was offered a coupon for free chips and salsa. I said that I really just wanted my chips and could I please just get those, 

The young woman on the phone said they were pretty busy and she would have to wait till the delivery driver got back to even see if that was possible (I have worked at restaurants that deliver, why couldn't she call the driver to see if that could happen? don't they have a cell phone? it's pretty hard to be a delivery driver without a cell phone) She said she would ask the driver as soon as they got back,

 I called 40 minutes later and it was pretty clear the driver had not even been asked yet. She said the driver would bring some to my house quickly, It is now 55 minutes since that second call and almost 2 1/2 hours since I first placed my order. Still no chips. :(

 Why would I want the chips and guacamole without the chips? Super disappointed in the service tonight. Don't know that I will be spending my money again any time soon. May seem like a simple thing, but I really wanted chips and guacamole and I paid for them so I should have received the chips or if it wasn't possible to deliver then take the chips off my bill.

The point is, I was in the middle of doing homework that was time sensitive and I couldn't leave my house. Thus the reason I got delivery. So yes chips are a simple thing to go get, but I shouldn't have to when I already paid to have chips delivered.
