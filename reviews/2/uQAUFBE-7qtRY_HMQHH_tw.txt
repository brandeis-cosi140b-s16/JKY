So Garduno's is now Camarones and from what I can tell the only difference is the name. 

The building itself is very nice. Multiple seating areas, a cute patio bar as you enter and even an sun room (where we sat) that looks like you could open the windows and let fresh air in if desired. The menu has the standards on there fajitas, chimis, enchiladas, combination plates, etc. They even have steaks, some seafood options, and the standard hamburger (that all chain Mexican restaurants feel they need to have for our out of town company from the Midwest that is not used to the "spice"). The prices are a bit steep for what you end up getting in my opinion. The portion sizes were large, but the flavor was lacking. I shared a "fiesta platter" with my mom trying to get a feel for the food and other than the red chili pork burrito, ever thing else was bland. The chicken in the quesadilla was just boiled chicken. I would of liked some chile or onion laced within to try and amp up the flavor but no such luck. The rolled tacos were just as bland and not much different from the kind you find in your freezer selection. Was it the best choice off the menu? Probably not but I was feeling cheep and not incredibly hungry so spending 20 bucks on fajitas didn't sound appealing. I thought my meal would be redeemed by service and sophapillas- but our waiter was just OK and my drink sat empty for a while which bugs me and the sophapillas, while hot, lacked cinnamon, sugar or powder sugar, and despite my generous application of honey where still bland in comparison to other places.
