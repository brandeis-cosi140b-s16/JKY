I usually like Rivas and have ate there frequently but today KILLED it for me!!! I buy 4 entertainment books a year because my family and I LOVE to eat out, so being extremely hungry my sister and I went there today to order some food and went to use our Internet coupon from Rivas that we had JUST PRINTED!!! Some rude ignorant lady tells me that it's a fake coupon and she won't take it. I tell her we have used them before and there is a validation code on it and if she thought it was a fake call the number and validate it. She basically called me a liar and refused to do it.... THEY HAVE LOST MY BUSINESS FOR GOOD!!! Juanita you need a better attitude and you could use a lesson in English as well!... My husband is hispanic and I am no where near a racist but if your going to conduct business you need to be able to properly understand and listen to your customers!
