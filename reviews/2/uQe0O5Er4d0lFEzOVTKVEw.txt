Great selection and quality for fast food.  Poor service, ridiculously left their front door broken for many months on end as a slap in the face to customers, and closed hours early and opened hours late many times.  The restaurant has an absurdly tacky interior.  A shame, really.  The food, menu, and prices are great.  The last time I was there, the guy almost screamed your order number when your food was ready.  I wanted to attack him.  There is a sign that says "Welcome to your new addiction".  What an insulting experience.  Save your pride and go to QDoba or Pancheros to be treated like a human being.
