I have mixed feeling about this place. I saw so many four star reviews so I decided to try this place. 

When we walked in we were seated right away by the host. The place was decorated very modern with dim lights. Lots of large tables for big parties. The host told us that our server was too busy to help us so he was going to serve us. First time I've ever heard if this. The host was able to tell us about the menu and was very helpful. The place had lots of people but wasn't that busy. We were the only table being served by the host. I thought this was strange and we saw the server. I didn't think he was that busy to take our order. Oh well so be it. 

So I ordered the Carne Asada Street Taco Plate. This came with 3 tacos, black beans, and rice. I wasn't too impressed. I thought it was pretty bland. No taste at all. My son had the Grilled Chicken Burrito and it came with rice and beans. The Burrito has huge. I tried a portion of this and it was as bland as the Street Tacos. My wife had the Ensenada (fish) Taco Plate and she was not impressed either. At first I thought it was just my dish but after trying everyone's dishes I got to say the food was just bland. 

So since our server was our host, it seemed like we were ignored a lot. The server bypassed our table and filled all the other tables except ours. We all recognized that and thought that was very rude. After we were almost all finished then the server started to take care of us. Filled our cups and gave us more chips. Little too late. 

I don't understand why the host had to serve us. There was a table after us that got seated and their server helped them out. Why were we targeted only? This didn't help make our meal enjoyable and the food just didn't seem up to par. 

All I have to say is I'm very disappointed at the service and food.
