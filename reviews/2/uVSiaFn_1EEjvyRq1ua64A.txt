Out of pork, out of guac, slow service, order arrives incomplete. Wait, wait, still no corn. Oh look, girls behind counter are too busy chatting to notice food is ready to be served. Too bad, really wanted to like this place. And now that I think of it, they were apologizing to a guy about his order as we walked in.  No surprise.
