First time visit.  

Service was terrible. We had a trainee that was entirely too inexperienced to be left alone with customers. We waited 15 minutes from the time we got our drinks to order food.  He would set the food on the table with NO comment. No utterance. Who does the hiring here? You might want to hire people with personalities.

The food was just okay.  Is there any management presence in this place?  Are they tasting the food? Are they requiring any kind of standards in service, food temp, and overall experience at all? I did not see any sign that anyone was showing leadership in this place.  It seemed so promising. They are sorely in need of a detail-oriented leader. 

I would not return her for anything other than drinks.
