Ok here goes: I love Chipotle, not his location.

There is always ALWAYS  line of epic proportions here, especially between 11:45 and 1:30.

The parking lot, which is shared with a CVS, Aj's and about 10 other places in close proximity makes the parking situation a mess. 

The people who work there are suck-ish.  They try to be nice as they slop your food together, always annoyed and skimping on the portion sizes, especially the meat.

The food is the redeeming factor, which is why anyone goes to a Chipotle and endures the misery.
