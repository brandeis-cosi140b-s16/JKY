There are a million of these stupid burrito places, and they all taste the same. Unfortunately for this place, they always screw up my order, and don't really seem to give a shit.

I always order the cali burrito, which is a carne asada burrito with french fries in it(use sparingly, kids). Its always wrong... still tastes good, but something is always missing.

anyway. 2 stars
