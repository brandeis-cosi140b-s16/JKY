Working-class Mexican food with an atmosphere to match.  Their building and it's environs are unkempt and shabby, the meat is often dry and overcooked.  Nevertheless, I continue to go there occasionally for lunch simply because I live very very close.  

I don't believe there is really anything here that is noteworthy.
