Mixed experience for us on a Saturday night dinner....we were served water and chips quickly and then waited 10+ minutes for a waiter to show up to take our margarita orders (Ultima and Prickly Pear were both fantastic).  When the drinks arrived another 10 minutes later, we ordered our appetizers and main courses, which then quickly arrived literally 60 seconds apart.  The waitress knew it was an issue immediately - she said that she had placed them as two separate orders to allow time between courses.  So, the service was the worst we have had in a while.  The chicken & rice soup, guacamole, shrimp tacos and chicken burro were all pretty tasty.  The chips were tasteless, some were soft (flour?) and others were crisp (corn?) - or were some just fresh and others old?  I have rarely been to a Mexican restaurant with tasteless chips and canned tomatoes in the salsa.  Bottom line - after the memories have faded in a year, we might return for lunch sometime but never again for dinner as this isn't a place for date night due to poor service and family atmosphere.  Keep your expectations low and simple and all will likely be ok.
