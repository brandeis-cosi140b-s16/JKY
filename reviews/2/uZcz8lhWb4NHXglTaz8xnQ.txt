Well, I have been here twice.  The first time was delicious, and we were sooooo excited to go back and get the same exact thing.  (Mixed Fajitas with chicken, beef, shrimp, carnitas and chorizo).

The first time everything was delicious ,and the carnitas were to die for!  It was my favorite thing and I honestly couldn't stop eating it.

The second time, we were served some strange cut of pork that honestly made my stomach turn.  It was very fatty and honestly tasted spoiled.  We mentioned it to our server, stating how it was very different our first experience, and she just looked rather confused.  We both got sick to our stomachs and could not finish our meal.  And honestly, I couldn't fathom eating Mexican again for a few weeks, when it's my favorite kind of food!

The portions are huge and prices are fair there, but this meal ruined it for me.  Maybe just a bad experience, but we won't be back.  :(
