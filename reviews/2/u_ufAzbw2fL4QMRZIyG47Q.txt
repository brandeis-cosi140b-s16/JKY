We've been here many, many times. Mostly for the same reasons everyone goes here: the gorgeous patio, the margaritas, and the warm homemade tortillas. That being said, when we were here last night and my husband "checked in" he was surprised to see only two stars. So we discussed and realized that what really kills this place every time is the service. Which is unfortunate, because they usually have a good product. 

Until last night the food has been pretty good, not spectacular but again we go for the 3 reasons mentioned above. Last night though, I think I'd had it. We had our trifecta but it simply wasn't enough. The service was awful and my meal was served cold and tasted like it had been sitting around for 30 min. Which is probably the case because it took a rather long time to come out. I ordered the tesoro del mar which is basically a salad with jumbo shrimp. I've gotten it many times and the flavors are usually good. Last night the shrimp was stone cold and hard--I had trouble cutting it with my knife. 

Our server was MIA most of the evening, and when she did show up it was to try to get us to order more drinks after we told her we had our fill at the bar waiting for our table. We had to request the tortillas because she didn't automatically bring them out, she was delayed with our check and with taking our bill after I was clearly fed up and wanted to leave. 

I think I'm done. After I work all day, going out to eat is a treat. Going here again is not worth my hard-earned money or my aggravation.
