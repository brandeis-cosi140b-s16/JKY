This place was really lousy and I'm frankly shocked at the high reviews it receives here on Yelp.  The only reason I tried it was the solid average rating it has.  That was a mistake.  As this was my first time eating here I decided to order numerous items and sample as many items as my stomach would allow for one meal.  I started with the rolled tacos and they weren't too bad.  Not overly crispy and a good amount of cheese and guac accompanied them.  Not great but not bad.  

Next I tried the fish taco.  This was awful.  The sauce was slimy, the fish has no crispiness, and the tortilla was lousy.  Other than that, it was good.  I then moved on to the carnitas taco.  Again, the tortilla was lousy.  Think cheapest store bought corn tortilla you can find and nuke it for 10 seconds.  At this point my wife and I started the following conversation:

Her: "I'd rather have Los Taquitos."
Me: "Or Espo's."
Her: "Or Filiberto's."
Me: "Or even Rubio's...."

This went on for about 3-4 minutes. 

Lastly we tried the Chili Verde burrito.  It was no better than anything prior.  The meat wasn't good and the sauce was funky.

This is not good food.  I don't care how you slice it.   Maybe the breakfast burritos are good but I'll never know.  There are too many other good Mexican restaurants in town where I know I'll be enjoying my meal.
