Was waiting on a movie so my husband and I stopped in for some beers, appetizers, and chips & salsa. 
We ordered the cantina platter- Tapatio Shrimp, Chicken wings, mini beef taquitos, and Elote. I would say the Elote was the best part. I've never had it before so it was interesting- grilled corn smothered in sour cream(?) and spices. Apparently it's a very popular Mexican street food. 

Chicken wing- my husband bit into one and it was still very pink on the inside. Looked very under-done or almost raw. That was a little unsettling. 

Fried ice cream- just skip this dessert. All you taste is oil! the ice cream was plan vanilla and the crust... was inedible. Just very oily and should be removed from the menu.
