Not sure if this place is "jinxed" but the last two restaurants to occupy this location on went out of business. Having tried their other location at Pinnacle Peak and Scottsdale, we thought we knew what to expect. However, I must say we were disappointed. While the ambience was nice and the wait staff was friendly, the food was a miss. It was similar to eating at a Mexican restaurant in the Midwest. The food was bland and just lacked any sizzle.
Best to stick to the other location.
