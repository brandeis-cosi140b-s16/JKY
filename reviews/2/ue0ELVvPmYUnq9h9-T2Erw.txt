I am disappointed because the sight of the pool really intrigued me. It was a nice environment, decent crowd, but I was pretty upset when I went to pay for drinks. We were charged $15 for two WELL vodka and diet cokes in short glasses.... A bit pricey but I was willing to go with it. Then we decided to take two shots of fireball, you know, the cheap stuff. The bill came and it was $16 for two fucking shots of fireball?? They get that for free and other bars literally give it away. On Mill they charge maybe $2 a piece for fireball. It is complete bullshit. Not even a real shot and they charged us almost $20. Will not be back for that reason. Such a rip off!
