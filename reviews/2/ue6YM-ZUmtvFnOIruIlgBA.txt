Let's get to the good stuff, first... the chips were good.  My experience peaked there.

It certainly is a matter of taste, but the hot sauce they served with the chips, I found particularly disappointing.  Was looking forward to a good salsa, and I don't mean to play the definition game, but the sauce wasn't salsa...perhaps blame it on my American upbringing.

I ordered the enchilada's with the green sauce, and rice.  Again, may be personal taste, but I did not like the taste of the rice at all; totally could be "real" Mexican, but didn't dance well with my taste buds.  The enchiladas were bland, thankfully I still had some hot sauce from the chips to pour them.

What kind of ANY restaurant can last these days without serving alcohol?  What kind of ANY Mexican restaurant can survive these days without serving beer and a good margarita.  Knowing that a significant percentage of revenues for restaurants come from liquor and not the food, curious to know how long this place will last...

Anyway, for me, I was very disappointed.  Had gone there while I am in the area visiting because of the close proximity to where I'm staying and the reviews here on Yelp, but this time, wish I had gone with TravelAdvisor instead!
