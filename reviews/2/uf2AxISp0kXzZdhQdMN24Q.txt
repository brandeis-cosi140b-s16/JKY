We usually go to this place as we work in the area. We went there on a Friday, we stood in the long queue, got our dinner, as soon as we sat to eat, saw that a lady was just going to each table handing them over bags and boxes to pack their dinner and whispering to them that there is an emergecny or something... the thing to be noticed here is that nobody came to our seat to inform us of anything (seeing that we had a child with us). 
We do not know if there is a shooting outside, or a fire or something else
We just got a hint and pick up our son and bag and got out leaving our dinner, well nobody gave us the boxes or bags, to pack our dinner.
we got out, so we realized there was a fire...a lady took our number and said she will take care of everything. We then went to another chipotle, as my son just wanted his beans and rice (kids are particular like that, he knew he was going to eat  his beans and rice and he just wanted that). 
Manager called us told us please come in anytime and and say at the counter that you were part of fire incident and your meal will be on us. I said I'm sorry but i'm not comfortable doing that (asking for a free meal at the counter). I told her I spend this much if you could send me a card that is well and good. she took our address and said she will definitely mail it to us.
we never got anything in the mail. 
It does not mean i stop eating at Chipotle, we love it. But till the time our issue is resolved we will not go to This Chipotle, even if it is inconvenient to us.
