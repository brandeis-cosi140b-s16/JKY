Food was pretty okay.  Good rice and beans.
Service was lacking.  Took her almost 10 minutes to get to us the first time and she wasn't very pleasant.  If you can't handle a 6 table section (1 of the tables had 1 person 4 of them had 2 people and pretty sure one had already paid, plus our 3 people and then a table of 4), you shouldn't get one.  Thought some of the prices were a tad high for MExican food but it is at a resort.  Not sure if would go back just because of the service.
