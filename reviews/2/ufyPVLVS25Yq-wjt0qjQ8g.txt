Not feeling it.

While there's something to be said for a restaurant that can turn a lunch table in less than 30 minutes, the sheer mediocrity of the food has me hesitant to return.  If you have a need for speed, this place is so fast even ol' Jimmy John would freak.  My server dropped off a my complimentary basket of chips and salsa before my rear end hit the seat of my booth and within five minutes of my arrival, my server took my order and delivered my food.

While not freshly made, Laredo's takes the time to warm each basket of chips.  In addition, the consistency of the salsa allowed me get a healthy dose with each chip. .And better yet, another basket of chips magically appeared each time my previous serving ran low.

I ordered the half chimichanga off the lunch menu for $6.49.  When I opted for the beef, I had visions of deeply seared, marinated steak, like many of the taquerias in the area (Los Gemelos, Habanero's, Guadalajara, Sabor Queretano).  The beef in my chimi was grainy, dry, ground beef - massive fail.  Also disappointing was that the exterior fried tortilla had absolutely no crunch, probably the result of the mountain of moist guacamole and sour cream heaped on top of the smallish half chimi.   The dish as a whole was under seasoned, I wish my table had a bottle of hot sauce so I could kick up the heat of my food. I would have requested some had my server checked back after he delivered my food.

With so many more worthy local options for Mexican food (see above), I'll probably avoid Laredo's.
