First off, the food was fine.  Nothing I can't get at the other two made-to-order burrito places nearby, but good.  But in a world with so many burrito choices, I won't be going back to Pancheros.  The service was kind of slow but they did just open so we'll give them a pass.  They didn't have enough food prepared which forced us to wait while they made small quantities that they were bound to run out of again soon.  They said "that's what happens when you cook fresh".  I dunno, maybe I'm in the minority here but I don't really mind if my cooked veggies sit in a warming pan for a few hours.  

Another thing about the food-they are VERY skimpy on the scoops!  I've never noticed this at Chipotle or Q'doba, both of those places ladle it on like they're fattening you up for market.  But this place was seriously measuring out very scant scoops of rice, beans, cheese, everything.  I got a burrito bowl and it was...maybe half full.  And yet I paid the same price as my husband who got a burrito which has a tortilla that the bowl doesn't include.  What's up with that?

The parking here pretty much sucks if the place is at all busy and you enter through the Jimmy Johns drive-up lane so have fun maneuvering around the cars waiting in line.  The shared building with Jimmy Johns is just odd,  the signs for entering and exiting the parking lot only say Jimmy Johns, so it makes it seem like this place is a little tacked on.  Nope, won't be back.
