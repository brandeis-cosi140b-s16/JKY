Pretty much exactly what one would expect from a taco joint like this one. Visited here at 5:00am due to minimal open restaurants and a slight craving for some tacos. I ordered their breakfast burrito and a few carne asada tacos. 

The meat quality in the tacos was very poor and bland, the cilantro/tomato and other veggies inside the taco tasted like they were left in room temperature. The lack of fresh veggies and grade F meat combined for a mediocre taco at best. 

The breakfast burrito which consisted of steak, cheese, and eggs also disappointed on the same level as the tacos. The taste was extremely bland and the steak had qualities more align with rubber than it did beef. One pro is the size of the burrito which was bigger than a burrito from chipotle. Although, it's a bit ironic because who wants to eat more of something they don't enjoy...

This would be a 1 star review but it is 2 because of the good service that was provided by the single man running the entire place. The order also came out surprisingly quick given that one man ran the register and prepared the food. 

Unless it's a lack of options, I will most likely not return.
