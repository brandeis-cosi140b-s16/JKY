This is supposed to be the place for drink specials for UNLV students, but the night I was here I ordered the mango margarita and it was too sugary, watered down, and barely could taste or feel the alcohol in it. While their margaritas were cheap enough, I would pass on getting a drink here because either their margarita machines need a tune up or the staff (which might I add is friendly despite the poor quality of food/drinks) doesn't know how to properly make them.The chips and salsa were bland, as well as the enchilada.

Try it for experience, but other than that, Chipotle is only but a minute away.
