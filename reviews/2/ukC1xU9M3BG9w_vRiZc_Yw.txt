The chips and queso were good and the beer was cold.  

Our meals were disappointing.  Chicken fajita nachos with jalape√±os were flavorless and bland.  

My wife had a seafood fajita plate which was equally bad.  Flavor was lacking from all our meals - not a good experience.  

El Toro needs to step up their game to be on par with the quality other Mexican restaurants in the area offer.
