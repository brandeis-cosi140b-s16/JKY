came here with my sister and her boyfriend for a late night crave for chipotle. yes, we're huge fans since i was a fetus. its my home chipotle, just down the street from my casa. we came when they were closing t minus 30 minutes. we were set to pay, when i asked for guac. they had less than an ounce left, so they said they were out. bummed. that guac is the icing on the cake. no biggy, just like they didn't apologize for it. couldnt leave because they already prepared my bowl. but as i was grabbing some napkins, the customer that was behind us also wanted guacamole, but the manager apologized to them offering a free side of chips and salsa. what?!  i don't know if they were too lazy to make a fresh batch. where's the customer service at? luckily i love their food, but i dont feel like dining in here ever.
