Sorry, this place has really gone downhill.  Food is still just average, but the drinks are almost worthless.  Went yesterday for a late lunch and tried three different Margaritas and none were any good,  Sorry, Top Shelf, after 7 years or so of regular visits, you're off our list.

The average food just doesn't make up for the lousy drinks
