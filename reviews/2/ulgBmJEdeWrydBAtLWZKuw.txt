Easily one of the sketchiest places I have ever been a patron at.

You order through bullet proof glass.  The clientele there range from pimps, hookers, gang-bangers, and old folks that will ask you for bus fare.

This is not my favorite of the Roberto's that I have been too.  The food quality and clientele is better elsewhere, and I'm not being bugged by people for money or food, or feel like my life is endangered just by ordering food there, but of all the Roberto's, this one has the most character, and it's close to Nellis AFB.
Here I had a chicken taco (it was only 99 cents on Wednesdays!) and a pork torta (forgive me, there is a proper Mexican name for this, but it slips me, and is not worth the time to look up),  The meat in the torta was almost non-existent.  I have had it in another location and it had plenty of pork in it.  The chicken taco was great though.  Crunchy taco shell, just the right amount of cheese on top, and messy.  You can't beat them for the price.
Come for the experience.  Hope you don't catch VD, a bullet, or a bum asking for a hand-out.
