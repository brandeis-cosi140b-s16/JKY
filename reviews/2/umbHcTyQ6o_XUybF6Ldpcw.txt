Really just depends on the time you go in I guess, dinner time food seems to be better than in the day. The food didn't seem so fresh, the guacamole was turning brown and the tomato salsa I love was all soupy and the tomatoes were all see through which made it not so great. Very chincy on the chicken, I'll stick to the Santan mall location, the foods always fresh there.
