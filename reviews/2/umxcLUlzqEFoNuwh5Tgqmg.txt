I love Cafe Rios food, but I've been dissapponted just about every time I've been to this location. I keep giving them a shot only based on the fact that they are newly opened and I understand that there are bugs to work out with training employees and such, but now that they've been open a couple months, there's just no excuse. Besides messy food assembly line, and poor customer service, the guacamole I got on my salad was brown and the lettuce wilted. And don't bother calling in an order. It does nothing. They wouldn't acknowledge that I was standing there waiting for my order and when they finally did, it was "sorry." THEN.....I had to go stand in line. Ugg! Skip this location and just drive down to Eastern or Stephanie. Seriously.
