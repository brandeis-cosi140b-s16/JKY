Ordered Cheese Enchilada combo meal to go, it looked better than the Korean place next door. Service was hella slow. I think I waited about 25 minutes for the order to come out, and it was still cold by the time I got back to my room.  

The rice and beans were straight up nasty. I have had better beans from cans, and rice from the microwave. The cheese enchiladas were not that bad. It tasted like low quality cheese because there was a lot (and I love cheese) but it did not have much flavor, and was a bit chewy. This could also have had something to do with the fact that it was not hot. The red and green sauces were both good tasting. 

Portions were average to small based on Las Vegas standards.
