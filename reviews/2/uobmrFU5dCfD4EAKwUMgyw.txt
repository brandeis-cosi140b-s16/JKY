Came here because of the reviews. I ordered the ceviche de Camaron chalupita. It was pretty much aguachiles instead of ceviche since it was so spicy, but it was still good. My bf ordered a coctel... I think it was called la Reyna and it had pretty much everything in it but he had to add ketchup because he said it lacked flavor. Unfortunately it bf got sick and was up all night throwing up. He was sick all weekend from the food. I guess it wasn't such a good coctel after all. Hopefully no one else has gotten sick but be careful when going to
This place.
