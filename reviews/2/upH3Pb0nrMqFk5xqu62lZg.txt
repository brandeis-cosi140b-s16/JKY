The building, and it's a nice building, does not make you think anything approaching "authentic" (whatever that means) "Mexican Restaurant".  Skipping to the chase, service was slow, Margarita's were "ok" ($3.95 at happy hour), chips were "ok", salsa nothing special.  I had the Albondigas Soup and it was better than average.

Can't really think why I'd return, the experience was underwhelming.  Am posting a pik of the soup.
