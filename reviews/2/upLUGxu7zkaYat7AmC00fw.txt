I love a good hole-in-the-wall joint more then most, I will concider and overlook alot of things for good food too! One thing I cannot overlook is bad service.... Took the folks out for mom's birthday, Things were slow to get moving and just never got better.... The chips and salsa were good, I had the fajita's and they were good, Deb was doing soup app and soup entree', the tortilla soup and "Mexican meatball" soup...... sorry.... Should have been mexican onion soup! A bowl of onions with 2 meatballs!  My Dad had a taco salad, her Dad Chili con Carne and the birthday girl had green corn tamales. Nobody was impressed with their food.... Like I said, I liked my fajita's but they were just good, not impressive...Now, I beleive that everyone is entitled to a bad night and is worth a second chance but the reason I wont go back, After dinner I excused myself and asked the waitress if they could bring mom a flan with a birthday candle and sing happy birthday. Sure, no problem. She comes back, takes our dessert order, I ordered two coffee and baileys, which is ONE THE MENU and was told let me check on that. After about 10 minutes the dessert shows up, no candle, no happy birthday, no coffee with baileys and no did you want anything else!!!!! That was it for me...... Go to Taco Bell!
