I went here for lunch wasn't impressed at all. Looked over the menu which I found really small ordered a burrito on the menu was 7 something, it comes out, nothing major kinda on the small side wasn't to worried about it was lunch anyway. Tasted just fair, too many onions for my taste, I go to pay my bill is like 12 dollars, I got a burrito and a tea, WTF. Ofcourse the girl who waited on me couldn't understand nothing but her native tounge, ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. I wont be back
