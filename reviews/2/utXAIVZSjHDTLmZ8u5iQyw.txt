4 stars for the food.
0 stars for the service.

on a busy friday night, we called before going to see if we could get a reservation.  we get one for 8pm, arrive on time, are seated right away and given our menus.  (the restaurant inside the palms is huge and had a bunch of empty tables.)  it took seriously at least 15 minutes for anyone to come check on us.  the guy takes our drink order, but he's not our server.  15 minutes is a long time at a restaurant!

then the chips and salsa finally came.  

then another 10 minutes later, our waitress comes, with the most unpleasant attitude i've experienced at a restaurant in a long time.  she took our order and went on her merry way.  the food took longer than i'd expect for a mexican restaurant, but the way the meal was going so far, it didn't surprise me.  

maybe our waitress just didn't like a table full of 7 girls, because she also had the two tables next to us and checked on them frequently.  she just avoided us.  came to us only once.  wouldn't even make eye contact over our way.  

we all liked our food and our fruity margaritas.  i had the tamale and taco plate and it was quite delicious.  it even had the hole-in-the-wall home-made feeling....not the artificial el torito type.  now if only they could work on their service.
