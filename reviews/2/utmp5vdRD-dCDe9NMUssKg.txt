Food was good.  But happy hour prices will only be honored  for patrons sitting at the bar or hightop tables.  So if you want to go to happy with more than one person,  it can be a problem.  As there are only a few hightops.   They need to reduce the size of their plates so the table isn't so crowded.  Why use a dinner size plate for a few appetizers???
