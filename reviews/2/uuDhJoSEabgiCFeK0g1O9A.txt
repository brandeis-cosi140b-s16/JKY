Though I've always been pleased there in the past, tonight  was most unpleasant.  It was incredibly hot and stuffy which they blamed on the "humidity."  What happened to air conditioning?  It took a half hour to get chips.  Our orders took even longer and were not correct.  We didn't send them back simply because we didn't have the time.  I hope this is an isolated incident.  I would hate to lose a favorite restaurant.
