My coworkers and myself decided to come and enjoy our Christmas get together on Saturday night.  The reason we chose this place was because of all of the great reviews we saw. I, myself am a food critic and love to try new places around my hometown. As I walked into the place I loved the decor. Very 1920s mexican art deco, Frida inspired. Loved it. Reminded me of one of my favorite restaurants in San Francisco.  Walked in greeted my hosts and friends, sat down and waited at least ten minutes until my husband decided to walk to the bar and grab some drinks. I asked my coworkers if this place had servers? " they laughed and said "yes". So, waited for about 3 minutes and a lady came to take our order. She seemed to be the manager due to her behaviour and persona. Very nice and seemed with a sense of urgency.  Finally!! After the "server" showed up. "Scully" the only reason I know it's because of the ticket. Extremely unprofessional.  We asked for drinks and he took the order just as if I were taco bell. Brought the drinks and as the food arrived only part of the group had their food.  I mentioned after  minutes if the rest of the food was coming, his response " well I can't carry ten plates at one time"  of course I understand. I have worked in the food and beverage industry for a very long time. It is of a modest gesture to ask and be concern. I have worked for Daniel Bould and Wolfgang puck. Their blueprint on great service whether it's tacos or Foie Gras it is paramount for their name and company. The food was excellent and to a great taste unlike the service.
