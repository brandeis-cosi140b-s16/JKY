For a brief time, this building was occupied by a different restaurant (if memory serves, it was Johnny Carino's, but it was gone so quickly, I don't recall). Regardless, shortly after building, they were gone, and not too long after, Mi Pueblo came in, remodeled and opened as a generally Mexican-themed establishment.

Though overall the place looks pretty - not really Mexican, but not horrible to look at - you are probably best off if you look around, perhaps snap a few shots for Instagram if that's your thing, and leave.

There is plenty of room here on just about any occasion, and that could be one of their downfalls. I don't know if they are ever properly staffed, but when we have been, they just don't seem to be able to provide particularly good service.

Their web site says they have eleven locations (one coming soon), so I think they would be pretty good at this item if they have so many, but what I have personally experience, and seen in other reviews? Not so much. You get your requisite chips and salsa and everything else goes downhill fast. Take a trip to New York and practice hailing taxis, as that skill will come in handy when getting someone back to your table.

When you eventually get your food - not what most would expect at a "Mexican" restaurant - it's decent enough, but probably not enough to merit a return trip. Something out of the ordinary, and perhaps more than enough to decide to avoid Zaxby's across the parking lot? Sure. But to detour from Azteca or La Unica, not too far away? Probably not.
