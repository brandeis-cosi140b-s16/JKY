The food was okay, but quite expensive for what it was. The service, however, was awful. We had to stop 3 separate servers multiple times just to get our drinks. Half our tables food showed up 20 minutes prior to the second half. We had to ask for napkins and silverware. To add insult to injury we had to walk our check to the hostess after waiting over 10 minutes for our server to take it (she must have walked by 4 times).
