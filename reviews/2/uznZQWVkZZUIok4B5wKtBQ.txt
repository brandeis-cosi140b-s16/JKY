This place has gone downhill in the past two years. When I went in in 2012, the food was acceptable, and there was table service for lunch.

This time, I ordered at the counter, the food was delivered to the table. I'm not good at cooking Mexican food but probably could have done better.

There's a funky smell in there, too. It didn't feel clean.

The man at the counter was nice, but I won't be back.
