I'm not the type of person to grade on a curve  or give reviews for places like Denny's. It's either pretty good, or a pretty bad experience...

Caramba's has been a quick, consistent stop for years to get a good fix of moderately priced Mexican food. Well things have been slowly sliding downhill for the last couple years.
It's getting a little run down. And, the owners are not very attentive anymore.
The consistency is now completely out the window. The portion size is hit or miss.
About 40% of the time I am very disappointed. Some part of the order is either wrong or not made properly. As long as I stick with things like taco's, cheese crisp, or salads where I can see everything I ordered when I pick it up. Things are somewhat ok..
I just ordered a fajita burrito and counted 7 layers of tortilla over the whole top of the wrap. all of the way across and 3 layers on the bottom. I kept hoping somewhere in there I was going to find some meat. Well there was very, very little. And at over $10 wet with guacamole. (which comes with it if you don't order enchilada sauce) it wasn't cheap. The way things are now with consistency. The quirky things like charging for soda refills, having to ask for napkins, and the bland salsa bar are annoying. Remembering how things were years ago, I keep wanting to give them another chance. But, it will be a long time before that happens again..
