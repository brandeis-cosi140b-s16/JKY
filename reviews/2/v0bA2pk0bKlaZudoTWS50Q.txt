Really disappointed with both of our experiences here.  We live in one of the historic districts by the restaurant and like to give local businesses our support, but we certainly won't be coming back to Margaritas.    

Yesterday, we encountered the rudest manager (or at least he claimed to be the manager), he clearly did not want our business.  And our group of 5 would have been profitable for the restaurant. He told us there was a 5 minute wait, which is no big deal, but he was super frazzled and irritable.  He told us that they were understaffed and seemed annoyed that we showed up.  PS- I'm sure they knew about the festival downtown, so I don't know why they weren't better staffed.  A man at the bar told us that he had been waiting almost an hour for his food, and recommended we go elsewhere.  So we left after waiting 10 minutes and went to Nunthaporns for Thai food instead.  They were 10x busier than Margaritas but sat us right away with smiles on their faces.
