Let me start with the good stuff: the grilled corn appetizer was delicious. The server was polite at the start. 

Now on to the disappointments: Two of the folks in our party were brought cold entrees. When they told our server her response was, "no they weren't" as if she didn't believe us. The entrees were remade and took a very long time to receive. The rest of our group had finished their food by the time it came out. 

The bill was confusing and even after the manager explained it to us it became apparent that communication is a skill they lack. We had been charged for chips and salsa even though we gave our server the yelp check-in incentive for free chips and salsa (btw, what Mexican restaurant charges for chips and salsa?) we had some bar drinks that were $5 and some that were $11 (server didn't tell us about happy hour when we ordered or that some drinks would be discounted and not others), we had charges for sauce even though the ladies who asked for queso instead of red or green sauce on their enchiladas weren't told it would be an additional charge, and of course there was the surprise charge for extra rice for the guest who asked for only rice, no beans with her meal. 

I have never been charged so carelessly by a restaurant. Although the the manager did comp the two meals that came out cold, this experience was so awful that I can not recommend this restaurant.  The icing on the cake was the booth were were seated in had dirty seats, food on the floor and was situated by a high top table that two of us knocked into getting in and out of our seats. 

Don't bother trying this place. It's over priced, offers poor food quality, isn't clean and the staff isn't trained in guest service.
