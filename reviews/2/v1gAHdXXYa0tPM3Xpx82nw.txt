Seriously disappointed. First time here about a month ago and I was underwhelmed across the board. We were seated immediately on the patio and water and chips/salsa appeared quickly but everything after that was missed. Took a long time to be greeted by a server and even longer to get our appetizer-shrimp ceviche. App included full size pieces of shrimp that should have been diced up. Tables that arrived after we did received their food first. I ordered the machaca burrito served enchilada style with red sauce. My boyfriend got The Beast burrito. When The Beast is smaller than a Chipotle burrito and contains less meat, the name should probably be changed. I tried both & wasn't impressed with either. Everything was just okay. Which would have made this a three star review except for one problem. They never cleared any plates or glasses. Every time they would bring us a fresh drink or the next "course" they would leave the former dishes on the table. It was a small table so we were running out of room. We asked one of the many servers (they work as a "team" -a concept I still don't understand because it doesn't seem to work, at any restaurant, and the tip likely gets split but what if one person is excellent and another on the team is terrible?) to clear the table, he said he would "be right back"...he never came back. Walked past us a few times but clearly had forgotten our request. They still weren't cleared when we paid the check! There must have been 10 used dishes on the table when we left. I don't plan on returning to Joyride. Too many other great restaurants nearby, Windsor and St. Francis among them!
