Just not a huge fan of this place. The food was very mediocre, especially for the price, and if you go on a weekend service is quite slow. Everyone is nice enough but there are better places to eat downtown now albeit none of them mexican food. I'd suggest trying to choose a different cuisine if you have to eat downtown or if you have to have mexican then eating before you hit downtown.
