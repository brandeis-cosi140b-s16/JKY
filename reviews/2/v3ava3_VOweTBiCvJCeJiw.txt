We (5 of us)went here on a Saturday afternoon for lunch. There were probably 4 or 5 other tables full besides us. The hostess was very friendly and sat us right away. The waitress was also very nice and took our drink order right away. We all ordered tacos... All of the tacos came out cold, so cold that we almost thought they were supposed to be served that way. We let our waitress know and she had new tacos out for everyone! The problem was they were still all cold! The manager was nice and didn't charge us for anything, but the food just isn't good!
