Like Stacy, I wanted this place to be good. I like the outdoor vibe, the patio, the dog friendliness, it seems like a really cool place to drink. Big, too. Service was great too.

However, I find the prices here outside of happy hour to be outrageous for a dive bar. $17 for a pitcher? $17 for a fajita plate? No free chips and salsa? Those are almost Vegas strip caliber prices! I mean, if it was gourmet food ala Joyride, it'd be one thing, but it's typical bland Mexican bar food that you can get on every street corner in the Valley. Don't get me wrong, the food wasn't *bad*, but it was nothing special and certainly not for the extortional prices they charge.

That all being said, I'd definitely come back during happy hour or for a late night drink. I would not come here to eat.
