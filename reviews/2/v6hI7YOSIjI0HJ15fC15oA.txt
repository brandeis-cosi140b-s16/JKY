I thought I finally had found a decent Mexican restaurant in my new neighborhood but this place is seriously bland and makes me miss Mexican food in the mission. 

I tried the super burrito and my man had the soft tacos both were so mild with no real flavor. 

Maybe I'll try something else soon but for now Los Burritos, 2 stars.
