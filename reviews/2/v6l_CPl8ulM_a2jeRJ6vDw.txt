I'm a little bummed today chipotle.... The first thing I said in my old review was that I liked your consistency. Today's serving sizes were kids portions. And conveniently the guy behind me has an overflowing bowl. No I do not want "extra chicken". I want a proper amount. I want a FAIR amount. For $11.65, I expect a solid meal from chipotle. Not a child's meal. I'm unimpressed. I'm your second best guest according to yelp. Fix this crap.
