The food here is delicious. We frequent order from an office building next door. The score is low because the delivery is SLOW. The charge for delivery is $4.00 and it takes sometimes an hour to show up. Please take note managers...your delivery sucks...good thing the food is so good :-) it almost makes up for it.
