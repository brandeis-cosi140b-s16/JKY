Boo.... I was super excited to try this place because it is near my house and it got good reviews, but was unfortunately disappointed.   First off, they need to update their website, they do not have delivery. I ordered cheese enchiladas with rice and beans and my boyfriend ordered a red chili burrito and chicken taco.   We both had the red sauce and it was burnt... so bad that I had to scrape it off to even have a few bites, then I gave up.  His burrito tasted burnt too, which meant it was the sauce not the entr√©e itself.   Their beans were pretty dry and nothing to get excited about.   BF did like the chicken taco, he said the shell was crispy but not greasy. Their chips and salsa were good, spicy but good.    Overall, I had a bad experience because the only thing I ordered was burnt, I think I would try it one more time, but next time in the restaurant, that way if it is bad, I can get my money back!
