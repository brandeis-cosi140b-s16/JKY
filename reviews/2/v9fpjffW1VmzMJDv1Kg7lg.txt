Good ambiance, great service, comfortable enough, and the prickly pear margarita was delicious! So what gives with the two stars?

The food was abysmal! I've never had worse mole sauce. I wouldn't even call it mole sauce. It was more like "black bean paste." Another member of my party had the same dish as I, and we both only ate about half and turned down the offer of the box. And I love almost everything! It was just bland, which is really bad in my book. A person orders mole because they like flavor! No one else in my party complained aloud about their food (but neither did I since I was eating for free), but I heard few compliments about anything except the wonderful margaritas. Stick with happy hour at this joint.
