ok. so i've been eating at the location on 7th ave my whole life.  decided to try the northern location.  hmm...upon entry, it looks like it used to be a chinese restaurant.  knowing los compadres isn't exactly upscale, the food is what i expected and i love their beans as i always have.  the salsa is different than the 7th ave location (at least it seemed to be) and i found that a little disappointing.

the service...was less than stupendous. "are you ready?"  "do you know what you want?"  oh and my favorite..."do you want your check now or what?".
not, would you like dessert, are you ready for your check, would you like a box or anything like that.  completely rude.

so. i'll eat there again, but i'll get it to GO.
