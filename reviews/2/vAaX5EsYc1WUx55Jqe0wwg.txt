I live almost across the street so I've been meaning to stop by for a while. Brought my nacho obsessed bff w me and we gave it a try.  They brought out really yummy corn muffins. Warm and soft, they were slightly sweet w whole kernels of corn mixed into the batter. Great start. 
They have a ton of really unique nacho options but honestly none really sounded that great. Settled on this one w shrimp and some spicy cream sauce. We also shared the coconut chicken tenders. Both were pretty mediocre. Chips looked homemade but were kind of hard and I didn't notice any kind of cream sauce on top so it was very dry. The nachos were pretty much just chips w a fair amount of shrimp sauteed in I'm assuming the mentioned cream sauce and some kind of white cheese melted and hardened onto the chips. 
Coconut chicken might've been good if they had seasoned the chicken before coating it. As is, it really had no taste and the Thai citrus sauce was bland as well. 
The meal did at least end on a positive note - nacho sundae was awesome! Cinnamon sugar tortilla chips w coconut coated fried ice cream w strawberry and chocolate syrup. Yum! Service was also quick and friendly. Too bad their entrees aren't better.
