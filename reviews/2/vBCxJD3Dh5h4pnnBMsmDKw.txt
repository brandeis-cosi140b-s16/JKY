I'll start with saying the chicken fajitas were REALLY good. And our food came extremely quick.

However, the service was bad, and my $7 "peach margarita" tasted nothing like peach and EXACTLY like the mix you buy at the local grocery. Also, my friend ordered a virgin strawberry daiquiri and instead she got some weird smoothie with whip cream on top.

Also, while the waitress was fairly nice to us, we waited 10 minutes just for her to bring water and ended up having to ask another server. They seemed really busy, but why someone couldn't even bring water, I don't know. Also, she was horrible to a girl that was at the table next to us. The girl was gluten intolerant and stated this and asked instead for corn tortillas, and the waitress said "WELL THEN, you'll just have to wait." So rude. 

Anyway, I will NOT be going here again. If I want chain-restaurant mexican food I will stick with Chili's fajitas.
