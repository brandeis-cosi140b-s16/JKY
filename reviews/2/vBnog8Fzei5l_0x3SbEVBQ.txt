I purposely made a yelp account so I could rag on this particular restaurant and how frustrating they are. I hope the owner sees this. 
Notice two stars and not just one? I love their food. They get an extra star for that. The chips salsa is the bomb. Enough compliments...
But the service is terrible! If I could curse up a storm about them, I would. They deliver only on occasions.. it seems like. They close up early, it's a college town... What college town delivery restaurant closes up shop early?  We asked for delivery at 830 and they said "We close at 9". Well it's not 9 yet wtf?! 
The service sucks. It's so bad I'm no longer going to order from this place again. After they denied our money.. We drove to the one on Horne and Broadway, which was still open, placed an order to go, and the guy couldn't make a salad. We asked for just a dinner salad with no cheese or dressing.. And somehow they were incapable of doing that. They took sooo much time asking how to make the salad that every time I gave them clear specific instructions, they would come back with something like chicken on there. A regular salad... With lettuce tomatoes onions. Did you hear me say Chicken? The sad part to this is that they left a menu for delivery Anyway, you should join me in boycotting Moreno's. It's a horrible experience every time.
