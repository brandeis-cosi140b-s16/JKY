Felipito's I write this with a heavy heart. For we had many good meals together. Lately though, you have not had your heart in it. My food has not been what I ordered, or if it was almost right, you still managed to mess it up.

It would appear there were some serious changes with how this place was run in the last year or so. My last few visits left me with many-a-wrong orders and disappointing food.

Last night was the last time I will order anything but rolled tacos from you. The 'cheese enchiladas' were nothing more than shredded cheese wrapped in a tortilla with some red sauce poured on top, hidden beneath a salad worth of shredded lettuce. When I order an enchilada, i do expect the cheese to be melted. Call me crazy, I just do.

The crunchy chicken taco that used to be the subject of many cravings has been ripped away from me as well. The shells used now seem like they come from a box and by the time I could make it home, just a short drive up Tropicana, the taco that was already broke was so soggy it just disintegrated as soon as I attempted to pick it up. My heart was so broken, I could not bear to put Humpty back together, just to consume that broken mess.

If you can get the good food back that I grew to love from your drive through, I would love to eat there again. Until then, looks like I am back on the market. Any taco shops that have a delicious crunchy taco and enchiladas with melted cheese, hit me up, I'm available.
