Ordered a breakfast  burrito
Egg was overcooked 
Potato was undercooked 
Bacon was old 
Cheese was not even melted in to the burrito 

Horrible horrible 
The burrito at Mc Donalds is way better 

This particular branch of Robertos is probably one of the worst that I have ever been in to; food and service. 

Stay away from this place
