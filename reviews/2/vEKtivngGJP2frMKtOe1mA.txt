The 2 stars are only for the customer service, which was great. The waitress was prompt with refills and the food came out surprisingly quick. On the other hand, the onions and peppers were not grilled well enough in the Shrimp Fajitas. The shrimp was thoroughly cooked, but was also not grilled/blackened like I would expect of fajitas. The fajitas were ridiculously plain and lacked flavor. I wont be going back when visiting Charlotte.
