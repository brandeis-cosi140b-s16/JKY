The rockport was our favorite between the redondo and the rockport. The redondo didn't really appeal to our taste, but we didn't want to waste it so we took it apart the day after to eat only the fish inside. Sadly we found hair pressed into the rice. It probably got there when one of the guys was pressing our rice onto the soy paper. Maybe they should wear hair nets instead of hats especially when they have 5 people working in a small station.
