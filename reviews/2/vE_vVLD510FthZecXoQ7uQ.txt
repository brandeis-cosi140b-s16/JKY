I love chipotle! However the service at the new Venetian location is terrible! The workers are rude. It's really loud in the food court and you aren't able to hear them very well and when ask them to repeat them self they have an attitude portions are small compared to other locations. When the girl was wrapping my burrito majority of the guacamole came out! Didn't offer to add more or apologized mind you I paid 12.00 for a burrito alone! I love their food but I don't think I will be eating there again!
