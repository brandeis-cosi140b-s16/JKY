The host greeted me with a friendly smile and the food tasted good but that's where the good news ends, which is sad because I really used to like this place. 

My table was sticky when I came in, the chips and salsa were about half the portion they had been in the past, the waiter was short with his answers and didn't seem very happy to be there, and half way through my meal I saw a dead fly sitting on the edge of my plate. Appetite gone, couldn't finish my meal. I don't like causing a fuss so I didn't say anything with the other guests there. It might not have been in the food since I found it on near the edge of my plate, it could have just fallen from the ceiling or something but it doesn't change the fact that I couldn't finish my meal. 

I quietly showed it to the host and he was really apologetic but still made me pay full price even though I finished about half before I saw the fly. Not sure if I'm coming back after this, we'll see.
