It's not totally bad nor totally great--just okay.  Our first visit here was pretty good, so we decided to come back. Even after horrible service and entree mix-up on Cinco de Mayo, we came yet again on Monday night.  I asked the server if there were any drink specials and he began telling me about the margaritas. Had the peach and it  was just not very flavorable... waste of almost $7.   The server was decent.  Luckily we had a LivingSocial deal to help with the bill. We think we take an extended break from the "Fiesta"  ;)
