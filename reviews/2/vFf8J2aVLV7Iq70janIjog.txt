We checked out this place because we heard about their bottomless margaritas, and my wife was in the mood to get her margarita on.  We were very optimistic, but were ultimately disappointed in our visit.

Drinks:  The margaritas were fine, but the refills on them were VERY slow to come.  This was a Sunday night, and not very busy, so I was disappointed at this.  


Food:  We ordered a queso fundido for an appetizer. It was fine, but not as "dip-py" as I was expecting -- I was hoping for more of a cheese dip, not just melted cheese, which quickly congealed, and was hard to get on the chips after five minutes.  I ordered fajitas, and they were pretty tasty, standard, no complaints.  My wife ordered a chimichanga, one of her Mexican favorites, and was very disappointed to find it not at all crunchy/crispy, but more soggy.  Very disappointing.

Overall Service: Aside from the margarita slow down, the rest of the service was also very slow -- timing of courses lagged, and for a slow night, the food came out very slow.  Most Mexican places we've been to are MUCH faster.  The water lady was VERY prompt, and came by many times, and that was great.  My wife drinks VERY fast, and we rarely had an empty water glass. It's too bad that lady wasn't in charge of refilling margaritas.

We would give the food 2.5 stars, and the service 2 stars.  The price isn't that great for a Mexican place off-strip in Vegas, and there are a lot more authentic places with reasonable prices and better service.
