This is my 4th time coming here, foods great service is TERRIBLE!!! Sat on the patio and within 10 mins we received our dog which was delicious! Love love love spicy food and boy were my taste buds happy! Unfortunately after we ate flies started to sworn our table to get the left over uneaten food, server never checked on us, eventually because we were so full we just switched tables our original table never was cleared and after we got the bill at our new table server never questioned why we moved or apologize for not clearing the table...so will I come back? I'm not sure, terrible service can most defiantly kill a potentially great restaurant
