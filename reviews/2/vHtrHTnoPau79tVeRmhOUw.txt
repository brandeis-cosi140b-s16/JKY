Some friends and I were staying at the Hilton Charlotte University Place just on the other side of the lake and walked over to Zapata's for dinner on a Saturday night, around 8 PM. The restaurant was busy, but there was an empty table right inside the back door. I walked over to the station at the base of the stairs and asked if we needed to wait or if we could just sit at the empty table and was told to go ahead and take a seat.

Fast forward a couple of minutes and an employee approaches the table to ask us why we're sitting there. I explained that I was told it was okay, and after a short conversation with the person who told me we could sit there, the employee went about his business. We were given chips and salsa (chips were slightly stale and had no salt on them at all; salsa was AMAZING but served in horribly inconvenient bowls that caused a mess every time you dipped into them) and ordered beers and waters. The beers arrived quickly, but we had to ask not one but TWO more times before we finally got our water.

Food-wise, I ordered the Enchiladas Suizas, which were extremely bland. My friend enjoyed his Pollo Borracho, mostly because of the sauce, but overall the food wasn't impressive. Getting our waitress to come back to our table to refill anything (salsa, chips, drinks) or to bring us our check was next to impossible. Honestly the only reason I'm giving Zapata's two stars instead of just one is because I know they were busy (and obviously that affects the quality of service) and because my friend enjoyed his meal, though I didn't like mine. That said, if I was to end up back in this area, I doubt I'd return to this restaurant.
