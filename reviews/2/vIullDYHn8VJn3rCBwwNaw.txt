I agree with a lot of reviews on here-the chips and salsa are off. The salsa taste like a chipotle ketchup and the chips have a weird bad oil flavor. I ordered the stuffed pork relleno pepper and pork tamale special. The pork in the relleno was hard to identify as meat and everything tastes bland. The tamale was just okay, very dry and I've never had one with cheese on top before. The refried beans were very bland. The rice was okay. My wife got the chicken fajitas. The meat tastes okay, but everything else was bland. The only reason I give two stars is for the friendly waitress.
