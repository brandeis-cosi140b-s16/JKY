Yikes. This place is cool looking, and has nice service- but the food is totally lacking. 

My friend and I went for lunch and were seated within a few minutes. I saw there was a free chips & salsa with Yelp check in. I requested that, with a side of guac. I was told that the guac would be $5. Seemed kinda steep but maybe they make it super well- so I ordered it. 

Guac arrives and it is in a small cup- that could fairly be priced at 2-3 bucks- if it's quite good. This stuff was like a movie prop- it looked right but had 0.0 flavor. It was so odd. In addition to being a small serving, & having no flavor - there were also two golf ball sized chunks of underripe avocado. Like you couldn't cut then with a knife. So weird. Literally no flavor. How do you fug up guac? It's avocado, garlic, salt, lime, onion, some type of pepper. Not here though. 

For lunch I had the red chilie chimi. Again- it looked nice- but really lacking in flavor and crispness of the tortilla. That came with rice and beans- both passable but that's about it. 

Throughout- our server was sweet and did a nice job, without which I could only leave one star. Oddly when the bill arrived our chips and salsa were on there. Our server told us she would take them off when we pay. It's weird because if you're planning your tip off the total- but the total is off by nearly four bucks?..... Also the $5 guac was now $6 on the bill. So our chips and salsa were "free" but a small side of anemic guac was $6?  It's sad when the guac at Chipolte crushes this restaurant.  

So buyer beware- cool atmosphere, weak food. In the future when I'm seeking New Mexican cuisine I will hit up Richardson's in Phx.
