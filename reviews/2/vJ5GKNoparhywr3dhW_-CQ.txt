I liked this place till we just witnessed two colored males be denied access after driving a long distance for a friends birthday because they had Jordan shoes !!!!! Really.... Unbelievable they did bag their pants, no color claiming, they were better dressed then us... I could not and will not recommend this place for the casual dresser who wears BASKETBALL SHOES!!!!
