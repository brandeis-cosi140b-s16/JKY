Today they lost a couple stars from me based solely on the glaringly obvious problem of having a huge takeout business and only one cashier for dine in customers & takeout.  In the past we've waited while she checks out the walk up takeout customer and it wasn't a problem although the line behind us was really backed up. Today only one young woman assembling the food and working hard at it but there were many employees there doing nothing? Then, the apparently "only" person who could check us out was on the telephone with her back to us while at least 8 others walked past and not a single one would make eye contact or speak to us. So freakin weird & our food sat there getting cold and the line was crazy backed up? I finally said to no one in particular, "someone better get their ass over here and take my money or we're going to walk!" She gets off the phone and steps over not making eye contact or giving up an I'm sorry and checks us out with a sarcastic, "have a wonderful evening". Not cool on any level, made me have a bad "psd off" lunch. Now, I GET the negative comments from others in the past.
