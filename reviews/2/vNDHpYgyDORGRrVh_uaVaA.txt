My thing is Rolled tacos, but this place won't saisfy anybody's craving for that food item. THey were undercooked and limp in the middle and never contained any of the promised cheese. They were quite skimpy on the Guac too esopecially considering their $4 pricetag. Horchata was also the wrong color - suppose to be white, but it was brown here. Beware. Owner is freaky nice, but he kept saying, "nice to see you" but I was never ever there before. A little strange. Longshot any of the other stuff is good, so its onto the next one.
