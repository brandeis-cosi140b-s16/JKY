Stopped in last night for dinner and did not have a very good experience.  First, the dinner took a very very long time to arrive.  It was only 4:45 so not very many people were seated and we could not figure out why it took so long.  My chicken dish was not very warm on the inside.  It did not have any flavor, it was like someone mixed up some chicken, salted it, wrapped it in thick tortillas and poured a little sauce on it.  I didn't even finish it.  Boyfriend likes his #42 which is why I agreed to go there again.  It's a hot metal plate with some meat and cheese he likes.  My 1 drink was $8.50 and much too sweet, maybe sprite was added or something but I did not drink even half of it and it made my stomach hurt.  No wines listed, and no draught beer, only bottles.  The bill before tip was well over $40.00 and our original waiter didn't even stay to collect his tip, he walked out off the clock as we were leaving and someone else gave us the bill.   Had I known he was not going to finish our service I would have left less. The wait staff is always courteous there, but the food just took much too long.  They haven't changed the menu in so many years.  I think they should make some changes, work in something new, and expand the salads, fajitas, and taco options with new/unique ingredients.  Chips and 3 salsas are always delicious.  The d√©cor and location is so good, the place has potential but I won't be back for a long time if ever.   Prices are too high, menu is old, they need some specials.
