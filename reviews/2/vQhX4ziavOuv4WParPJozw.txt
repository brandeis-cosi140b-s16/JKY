WHAT are you thinking Gardunos????  Used to enjoy the enchiladas, tamales, etc.  Were there on Saturday, group of 8....we've raved about the yummy tamale especially.  Orders are brought to the table and WOW, the red sauce tastes like someone slipped and put in an extra 50 hot peppers.  WAY too spicy and most of the table likes their Mexican food with a little kick.  This was SO SPICY, you could not taste the food that it was covering.  Had to sip tea/water after each bite to calm the "heat".  The man in the white coat walking around asking how things were came by.  When I asked what happened to the red sauce, he said the chef wanted to spice it up a bit.....Sure hope they forget this idea and go back to the milder red sauce (which had a pretty good kick to it already).  Not sure if or when we will try it again....it was not a pleasant meal.

On a brighter note, Tony D did a great job of taking care of our out of town guests!
