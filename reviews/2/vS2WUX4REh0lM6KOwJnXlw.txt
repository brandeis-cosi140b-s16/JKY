I had heard a lot about how great and authentic Los Dos Molinos is. I finally gave it a try and maybe my expectations were too high because I wasn't impressed. I grew up near Mexico and even lived there for a short while, so I have a pretty discerning taste for Mexican food. 

Mexican food does not only equal spicy. Sure, spicy flavors are a common part of Mexican foods, but there are so many other delicious flavors involved. I felt that if Los Dos took out the "heat", there'd be nothing but bland food remaining. I can handle spice, but give me some flavor in my food! 

Also, the margaritas were not very good. They tasted like they were straight from a really cheap margarita mix. 

Yes, we did have good laugh over several of the people at our table who broke a sweat while they were eating, but would I call the food and flavors delicious? Definitely not. The restaurant has a festive decor and is perhaps a good place to take out-of-towners to laugh at them while they eat spicy food, but if you're looking for  flavorful Mexican food, I wouldn't recommend Los Dos.
