Love the food but hate the service.  The service employees preparing the food are to busy socializing with each other instead of paying attention to customer.  I had to repeat my order 5 times before they got it right.  The staff needs to slow down, give eye contact to the customer and quit talking to each other about who is dating who.....what their plans are later tonight....and stop bitching to each other about who is not working their stations.  Bad customer service!!!
