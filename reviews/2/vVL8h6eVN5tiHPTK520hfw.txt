Paying $5 to the sketchy dude for parking in a dark lot didn't even phase me.
I'd had tacos from this place before and they were amazing.  

My friend and I both ordered beers from the menu, they didn't have either.  Fine, no big deal.  We then ordered the pimento cheese rolls... SORRY,  I meant the "CABO ROLLS" that were filled with nothing but cheese and mayonnaise.  This set a bad tone for the rest of the experience.  

I ordered the blackened Mahi tacos.  
All of their signature tacos are "finished with white cilantro sauce" which did nothing to enhance the flavor and just made the whole thing soggy.  There was a low amount of cilantro accompanied with a low amount of flavor.  

Under-seasoned and soggy are the only words to describe the tacos I had there.  

I feel I am expressing very "first world problems" writing this review.  But for $60+ this meal sucked ass, so here is the review.
