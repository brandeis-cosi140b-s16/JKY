Probably the last time I will eat here.  The food is tasty, but the portions are small  compared to other hip Mexamerican spots.  Prices are a bit steep, also.  One would think, being a stone's throw from the busiest campus in the valley, that you'd have some less expensive menu items.

Far and away, the most significant reason I'm not in a hurry to go back is the service.  The ordering process is generally quick and easy, but every single time I eat here the person at the counter seems so put out and agitated about having to take someone's order.  And not the same person either.  I know people have bad days, but now it seems like a pattern.  Everyone's struggling to make a buck these days, and it's that little shred of hospitality that makes the difference.
