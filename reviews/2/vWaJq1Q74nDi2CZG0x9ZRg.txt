We had an Entertainment Book coupon for this place but when we presented it they said they didn't sign up to give coupons for them. When we mentioned going somewhere else they honored the coupon but said they wouldn't again. 

The location is in an old Arby's and the remodeling job was poor. The place is looking dingy too. 

The food was subpar. The taco shells and chips weren't fresh and the guac way too spicy. There are way better choices in the area for Mexican food.
