I eat at Chipotle 3-4 times a week, which is a little ridiculous, but I love Chipotle. I normally got to the location on Bell and 83rd, or 67th and the 101, and sometimes the location off Northern and 59th, which are all great. I'm just echoing the other bad reviews here; the service was terrible and they were incredibly slow! They also burned my quesadilla and it was inedible. It was so burned that the cheese inside was burned, too. The guys weren't able to keep track of the orders (the guy in front of me ordered two things, which was confusing I guess) but most of all, the customer service was just awful. I can forgive them for being dense, but there is no excuse for not providing basic customer service.
