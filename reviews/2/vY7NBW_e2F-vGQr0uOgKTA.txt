Very disappointed. Order a  diet pop.  The glass had tons of ice.  Then the pop has a very flat taste.  I wondered if it came from a bottle that had been sitting for awhile.  Again I am wondering, but the pop was strange. My lunch was average, if even that.  I generally leave a large tip at places.  Here I only left 20%.  This place is filled with ugly gossip.  The owner joins in the conversations.  There is an awesome man who sits at one of the window seats.  I think his name is Bill.  Very sweet guy.  I think he is borderline mentally challenged.  He always has many kind things to say.  This place is a couple foot steps from the transits to downtown, breakfast are okay, but not worth a trip of going out of your way.
