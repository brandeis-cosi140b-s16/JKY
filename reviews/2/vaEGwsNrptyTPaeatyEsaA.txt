I give this place 2 stars because the customer service was very friendly and great! other than that the place is kinda dirty (grungy) and the food was over priced. The food was not horrible but nothing to brag about either. I felt like i could have made the same in my own kitchen but probably better. drinks are over priced as well. they have a happy hour but not really happy hour prices. Personally I wont be going back.
