I agree with the notion that there are simply too many mex joints in charlotte. Most of them are carbon copies of each other. 

This place is honestly well below average. The ambiance is non existent, prices high and food quality is low. 

I ordered a chicken quesadilla but received one with just cheese. It wasn't a big deal for me. I tried to eat it anyway but the cheese was very poor quality. The cheese had a sticky consistency and the flavor was non-existent. 

I also ordered a guac and it was decent. 

It surprised me that such a bland looking restaurant would mark up their food so much given the terrible quality. Carne Asada for 15?! 

Lastly, this place charges 2.75 for soda. This is the highest price drink i have seen in any mex or even casual restaurant. I'm a business guy and I understand profit margins but this figure is so out of line with the competition. 

I won't be back, there are better options out there.
