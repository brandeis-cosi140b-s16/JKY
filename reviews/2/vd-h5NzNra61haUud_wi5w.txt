Swinging through here during a march through Old Scottsdale, it seemed like the perfect place to pick up a quick desert. 

As for the desert itself, that was acceptible: a brownie with ice cream on top. Nothing too exotic, but I thought that the brownie itself would be worth three stars.

But lousy service drops this to two stars. It took a while to find a waiter and the one that I did was pretty bad. Despite there only being a few people here, it took a pretty long time for him to swing by for an order (15? 20 minutes?). When he did, in the middle of the order, he got distracted by one of his buddies who showed up and he wandered away. He actually only came back to deliver the bill; another server actually noticed his wandering and came by to apologize and take the order.

I'd consider giving one star, but the food is respectible. Thus the average of one star service and three star food quality makes two. Realize that I'm considering the service one star based on a single server; other patrons, hopefully, may have a better experience if they got someone else.
