If there's one thing I can conclude from eating at the Mexican places that are most highly rated on Yelp, it's that white people have very bad taste for Mexican food. With the endless Mexican food options in Phoenix, it is this place and Santos Lucha Libre that are listed in Phoenix's top 5 restaurants. The latter was terrible, but PHX Burrito House seemed promising. Would this be the most disappointing week yet in my still-young Mexican food tour? 

Unfortunately, yes.

PHX Burrito House is situated in the former digs of the also-overrated Fry Bread House. I will admit, the idea of burritos in an old converted house is pretty cool (maybe that's why this place has such rave reviews?). I looked at the menu, and it was sparse. Great! A place like this should have a sparse menu.

The list of ingredients in the burrito, however, concerned me a little bit. Rice, choice of pinto or black beans, meat, sour cream. Guacamole extra. What? Rice? Really?

I trudged ahead anyways. Got the carne asada burrito with guac. With a bottle of Fanta (no Jarritos?).

Almost $11.

Everything was just OK. The chips were OK. The burrito was just OK. Sorry, but it's hard to get excited about a burrito where 50% of the mass is rice and 40% is beans. I think there was a piece of actual carne asada in every third bite. Guac was relegated to a little vein near the outside of the burrito. Sour cream was only noticeable when I got to the bottom, where all the liquids inevitably end up.

It's pretty disappointing when I leave a place with the feeling that I could have gotten a better burrito at Filiberto's.

I've probably said this before, but if you want a sure-fire way to ruin a burrito, put a crap ton of rice in it. It's just filler. Would I eat here if I live in there area? Maybe.. But probably not, there's a Filiberto's across the street, and if I want a bad burrito, I might as well only spend four bucks on it.
