The two stars are for service.  I love Mexican food and looked at yelp for recommendation in the area.  The food was less than mediocre.the chips weren't good and the salsa was bland and watery.  Determined to give it a try, I ordered the mini changas.  Just barely okay.  I wanted fish tacos but wasn't going to subject myself to more bad food.  Would not recommend
