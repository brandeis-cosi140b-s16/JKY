The food was not bad but the restaurant was just weird.  The employees were two pimply faced teenagers.  The food is on a counter staying heated in silver containers and then they put together what you order.  My kids got nachos.  It was chips with fake cheese sauce.  I ordered a bean and cheese burrito, it was just okay.  The guacamole was in a plastic store bought container.  

I won't go back.
