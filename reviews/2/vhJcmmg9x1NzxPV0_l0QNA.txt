Ok, I'm going to keep it honest. This place let me down. Big time.

I started by ordering a couple drinks. I had the La Bomba & my boyfriend went for their Lowrider. My drink was eh good? His tasted like pure tequila. I mean it was top shelf but still.. He wanted a mixed drink not shots of tequila. 

Their complimentary bread and salsa was odd to me. I kept an open mind and dived in. Just wrong.. The salsa had an extremely unique taste. Honestly it shouldn't even be considered salsa. We ordered they infamous guacamole, BLAND. I'll just stop there with the apps. 



I ordered their camaron tacos w/ a side of spicy papas. Pretty tasty. But nothing life changing. 

The atmosphere.. Where to start. They had a band? that night which had the volume on waaaay to high. The gentlemen sitting at the table behind us was literally yelling at the top of his lungs to converse with his company. It was ridiculous. Our waitress even rolled her eyes towards the direction of the music and made a comment which of course I couldn't hear over the noise. 

We skipped dessert.. Unfortunately. Due mainly to the fact that during our entire meal we were waited on by our waitress maybe twice. Once when we ordered and second to drop off the check. Pathetic. If it wasn't for her 20% gratuity that they so gracious added on themselves, she would have received close to nothing for a tip. 

And that concludes my Barrio Cafe review. I really looked forward to dining here but that was the first and last time I will be visiting this restaurant.
