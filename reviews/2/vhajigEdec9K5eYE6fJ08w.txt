If you are going to serve New Mexican food, then serve it, don't water it down and serve things up like they do in the real state. I spent a month there and nobody in hell would use a whole Green chile in making the Chile Relleno. You use either a Poblano or an Aneheim and then cover it in your green chile sauce. The guy next to us eating his meal was complaining alot about how the sauce wasn't hot at all. 
    Chips and salsa were free at the bar - they were decent with two salsa's. Also noticed like another Yelper did that the food comes out like 2 minutes after ordering. This can only mean one thing, nothing is made to order and that means you can do alot better than the food here. The fake Chile Relleno was enough to send my running.
