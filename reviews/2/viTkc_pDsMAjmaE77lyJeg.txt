Really confused by all the 4 and 5 star reviews. This was atrocious food and service for the price, even at happy hour. 

Went during happy hour at 11pm. This is a place that thinks happy hour means "serve half size orders at half the price." You're not getting a deal by ordering the $5 margarita, you're just getting half a margarita. 

Additionally, the Mexican chili was nothing to write home about, I had no desire to finish it. The street tacos were definitely worse than Tacos El Gordo or Los Tacos. The carne asada taco was so rare that I wouldn't even call it cooked. The medium and mild salsas were ok, the habanero hot sauce tasted like it came from a grocery store bottle.

I did not eat the fajitas but my girlfriend was immediately sick from eating them and spent the next morning queasy with stomach pains.

$20 a plate for this? I'll go to Roberto's.
