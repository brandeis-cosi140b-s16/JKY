Boring.  This place was recommended to me by several people.  And I want to stop talking to them now.  It was a complete let down.  

First, of all, the prices?  What?! Three tacos, rice and beans $9?  No thank you.

Second, the tacos were $1.50 extra if you wanted cheese.  Then it was mozzarella cheese?  Gross.  If I wanted mozzarella, I would eat Italian.  

Third, the food was ok.  Nothing special.  Nothing amazing.  The salsa they put on the table was sweet and hot.  No one wants to eat that.  I had chorizo tacos and they were just ok...just ok.  

This is what Mexican food is for people who know nothing about a good taco.  Harsh?  I know.  But the truth is the truth.  And my tacos were terrible.  I have used "ok" probably about twenty times during this review.  It got two stars because the service was friendly.
