I normally really like El Pollo Loco for their grilled chicken thighs and sometimes I get a salad as well.

Even though the place only had 3 customers inside at 11:30am on a Sunday, I passed up 3 dirty tables before settling on one near the back door.  Um docking a star because of that.

Our food came out quickly which was good, but the chicken was too spicy and so was the medium salsa.

Its OK to have a local flavor for a local restaurant but chains should be consistent in their recipes.
