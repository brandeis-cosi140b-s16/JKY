Our waitress was pretty cool, but they didn't even carry Coronas bc it's too expensive. We should have known by the NAME of the place...Carlos & Charlies! I tried to look this place up on Yelp right before we walked in because we weren't too keen on it, but I couldn't get service! Our foolish selves were so starved we didn't feel like walking any further...so we ate there...the other person is right, if you don't know any better about Mexican food, you will like it; but if you do know Mexican food you will be disappointed. Your stomach will regret eating here later :/ This place only survives because it's in the casino and there is heavy foreign traffic who don't know any better (or are severely hungry like er were ) . Never again will I eat here...if this place was in a neighborhood, they would be out of business so fast. Go to HASH HOUSE A GO GO instead!!! ...if you can even read this before you enter
