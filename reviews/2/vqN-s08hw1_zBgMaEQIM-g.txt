Let me start out by saying the food was great.  It was the service that was the big issue.  I was attending a large conf. at Mandalay and have eaten at Border Grille and its sister restaurants in LA and always loved it.  Yesterday felt like I was in a rest. that was poorly run by a staff who was not centered on great customer service.  I sat on the busy patio at a dirty table and with furniture that has seen better days.  It took over 10 min. before a server ever addressed me and the table seated next to me that had arrived before.  Long story short--my drinks were never refilled without me having to chase someone down even though they were nearby and even after my meal arrived I had to ask for utensils/napkin - the waiter never noticed.  Table next to me some situation.  Waiter never asked me about my meal.  SO....whilst I love their food someone in mgmt. at the rest. needs to consider a serious training day to push customer experience...otherwise, there are many other choices in Vegas.
