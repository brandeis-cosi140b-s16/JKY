Not terrible... EXCEPT- I called in an hour before arrival and STILL waited 30 min for my food. I saw people who just showed up and got in line, get their food before me. REDIC! I suspect that they didn't even start making it till I showed up. I gave it 2 stars for lack of process. Food is 3 stars...
