I wish I could give this place a great review because it's in my neighborhood.  I've been a customer since not long after they opened.
In the beginning the food was very acceptable.  Not great but good enough. Then the quality started to slip.  Burritos were sometimes too greasy, not every time but too often. The consistency in quality is nonexistent. One time the beans are super and the next time they have no seasoning at all.  More often then not the beans are in the bottom and everything else is in the top. Their Carne is of poor quality with a lot of gristle. The chile relleno tonight was not lightly battered and deep fried like usual. There was a big gloppy  mess of  batter in the bottom of my burrito not even attached to the pepper which was of course in the top of the burrito. 
I had to return while my whole family was eating at home to get my money back and the cook felt he could justify why I was sent home with a really poor quality burrito instead of just apologizing and saying that the issue would be corrected in the future.
