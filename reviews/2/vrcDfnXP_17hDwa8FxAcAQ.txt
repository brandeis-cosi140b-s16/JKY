The family and I were looking to grab some lunch at Chipotle, but we got lost and came to Kokopelli instead. It's similar to Chipotle - made to order burritos and other typical Mexican food - but Chipotle it is not.

To tell you the truth, I wasn't too hungry to begin with so I ordered a chicken quesadilla and I got exactly that - a tortilla with cheese and chicken. Nothing else. Even though it was what I ordered and contained all ingredients necessary to live up to its description, I just felt like the whole thing was "meh". I got some pico de gallo on the side which helped a bit, but I was only given a little to-go cup full (there is no salsa bar) and given my salsa usage, it only lasted a couple bites.

The burritos ordered by the rest of my family didn't seem all that interesting either. I didn't get to taste anything but, from first glance, the bean to burrito filling ratio was wrong (too much beans, not enough meat - what can i say, I'm picky about my burritos!) and the burritos seemed as "meh" as my quesadilla was. 

I wish we had gone to Chipotle.
