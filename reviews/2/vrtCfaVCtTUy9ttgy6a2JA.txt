A neighbor couple recommended this restaurant to us and our friends so the four of us were looking forward to dinner there this evening. We had read that the service could be lacking so we didn't expect four star service. We ordered a pitcher of the house special margarita's which was good but nothing special. You could do better with Jose Cuervo mix. We all enjoyed the warm tortilla chips in three colors which were very good as was the spicy salsa. The entree's were disappointing and not very appetizing in appearance. Our two friends ordered the carnitas tacos, I had the steak and chicken fajita combo and my wife had a tostada salad. The carnitas were made with cubed meat that resembled dog kibble. The fajitas were tasteless. All three came with dried out rice and crusty beans. My wife thought her salad was good but mostly cut up lettuce. The four of us shared an order of sopaipillas which were tasty. The service was pretty inattentive given that there were only three tables of guests including us. Overall the food was bland and tasteless, the service poor to fair. None of us will return nor will we be asking the recommending couple for more dining suggestions.
