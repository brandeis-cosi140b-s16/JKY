Not sure what is going with this place but the quality of food is going downhill! Ordered a taco salad and got a half-full bowl. By the time my girlfriend got to this half-full bowl the undrained juices from the chicken had turned the shell into complete mush. She couldn't even finish this half-full taco salad. Not sure if you got new staff or are just trying to cut corners, but this is not the quality of food I'm used to getting from this place.
