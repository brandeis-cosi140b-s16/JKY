Atmosphere is great. Food portions for the Tacos is extremely small.  More like an appetizer.  Waiter seemed disappointed that we only ordered water and iced tea for drinks instead of an alcoholic beverage (at 11 a.m.!).  Can't believe a Mexican Restaurant charges for chips and salsa with the prices of the food. No extras come with what you order - no rice, no beans for expensive lunch. Won't be back.
