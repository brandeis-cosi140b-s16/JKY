I come here about twice a year when friends make the choice of where to meet up. Other than that, I'd never have a reason to come. The feel of the restaurant is really cool and trendy. The margaritas are also pretty delicious. But that's about where my positives stop. 

The food is extremely overpriced and in my opinion not very good. For happy hour I usually get the street tacos. Nothing to write home about. Off the regular dinner menu I opt for something new every time hoping to discover a "good dish". So far I haven't found it.

I'm from AZ and I know my way around Mexican food, so maybe I'm biased. I'm all for culinary diversity but I really feel like their food is pre-made and heated to order.  I think the people that like this place probably don't like traditional Mexican fare which is just fine with me. They can eat it all up cause I won't be there to fight them for it!!
