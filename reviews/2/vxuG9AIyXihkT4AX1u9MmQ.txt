After a late night flight into Vegas, I wanted to pick up some food, drink a couple brews, and plop in front of the tv.  I was starving but wanted something good.  But when you're hungry, you are willing to settle for almost anything.

I almost did.

Then I saw Roberto's.  It was fate guiding my famished self to somewhere good.

This is an awesome place that's open 24 hours! ! !  The nachos were fantastic: tasty meats, fresh guacamole and chips.  It  was a lot of good food for super cheap.  And at the end of the meal, I was Happy.

I know where I'm going for my next post drinking/early morning meal.
