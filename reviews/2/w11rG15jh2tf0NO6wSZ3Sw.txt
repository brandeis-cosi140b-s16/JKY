Ate here twice last week. The first time there were three of us, good experience with very fresh food at lunch. We liked it so much, that we brought a party of 6 back for dinner. We were excited to show our guests the great items we had experienced previously. We ended up having a negative experience, with some of our guests saying they won't eat there again.
Overall, the portions are truly too small, especially for a business that is just opening. A few of us ordered the full rotisserie chicken, which the waiter said served 4. They brought 5 tiny tortillas, a smattering of corn that did not cover the bottom of the dish and a small serving of beans that were undercooked and therefore hard, for four of us. When we asked for more tortillas, they brought us two, so we asked for more. We noticed when the bill arrived, they charged us $3.50 for the "extra" tiny tortillas. 
We ordered chips and guacamole before the meal and were brought a cereal bowl of chips, again for six people and a tiny side of salsa. We had two teenage boys with us, so the rest of the group chose to forego the chips so that they could eat.
Our party of six was seated at one of the long tables in the center of the restaurant. Halfway through our meal, the waiter came over, told my son to move over on the seat bench and to pick up my purse, which was next to him, because they were going to sit two people AT OUR TABLE for dinner. The waiter didn't ask, just announced a party of two would be joining us. It was literally bizarre. The couple started heading over to our table and then refused to sit with us, as it was obvious that that would be totally weird.
The service was mediocre both visits. Hoping they really get this figured out as I would like to see a good restaurant succeed at the Shea 14 plaza. Start with generous portions, consistently fresh food, better service and go from there.
