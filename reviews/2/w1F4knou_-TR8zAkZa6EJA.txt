Short and sweet:  a local restaurant with a poor selection of beer, why don't they offer some of the outstanding local craft beers? Not just the crowd pleasers, but some good IPAs and stouts?  If only some good beer, I would be in once or twice a week.  And, it's in poor taste for a "Mexican" restaurant to charge for chips. The authentic places provide chips free of charge. 

I'm disappointed, but not a lost cause ... hope these guys come around to better beer and I'll become a regular.
