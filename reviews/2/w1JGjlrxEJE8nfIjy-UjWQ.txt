Okay shrimp cocktail. The ceviche was better.  In fact if I return, it will be for the ceviche. I've had better elsewhere, but in a pinch, it'll do.  Curious to taste the shrimp Culichi.  The waitresses were pleasant.  I did not like the fact that there are no free refills on the soft drinks.  I will say that I did feel like I was transported to Mexico, which was kind of cool. Loud music, but that's how they do it!
