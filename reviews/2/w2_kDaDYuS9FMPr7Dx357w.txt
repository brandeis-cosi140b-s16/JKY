My wife were in town from Denver and are both Celiacs so finding a place with decent gluten free food is tough while on the road. Vitamin T was one of our few options. Phoenix needs to step it up with GF food offerings. 

First, the positives: I wasn't expecting much, but the food was actually pretty good. The carne asada and barbacoa tacos were very tasty and weren't heavy and greasy like a lot of Mexican food. 

If it weren't for the service, I would have given Vitamin T 4-5 stars. My wife was here for a conference and we decided eat here on a Saturday. The place was packed with people from the conference and when we walked in they were 20 orders behind. There were four guys working but only one was working his ass off. Another wasn't helping with the orders, one was moving very slow and left while we were waiting, and the third was totally clueless. On top of that, they screwed up our order by giving us flour tortillas (which we can not have), even though we requested corn several times while ordering. 

By the time we got our food, we had waited an hour. If they aren't busy, I would recommend it. Otherwise, just go to Chipotle where they're much more efficient with four people.
