I came here with some friends after a long day moving furniture. The quality and cleanliness of the place was pretty good, it definitely had lots of rooms for a good fun night along with a gated outside area where you can smoke and drink. The staff here was friendly and no offense but the person who took my order spoke really great and formal English which caught me off guard. I ordered a Caramba Nachos with beef and I have to say it was alright. I have had better, I believe the reason why it wasn't so good was the cheese that was put in, which was super watery and kind of ruins the whole dish. I do like however that they do give you a bowl of chips to enjoy and have a bar of salsa you can pick from.
