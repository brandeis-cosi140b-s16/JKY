Lame experience began at the order window when the young woman spoke so quickly, in such a high pitch as to be incomprehensible.  Food (pork taco & empanadas plus chips) were okay but unremarkable. (Pineapple was different & fresh)   $12 with two waters.  Won't be back.  Gotta be better Tacos somewhere around here.  Hint:  avoid taco stands patronized only by gringos.
