Have wanted to try this restaurant for some time. Finally went on a Friday night. It was loud, but expected that on a Friday night. Had a 30 minute wait which seemed strange as there were at least 4-5 tables open. Whatever, there were two seats at the bar and we decided to eat there. Ordered a Yuengling and a margarita on the rocks, no salt. Bartender came back quickly with what looked like watered down lemonade. WORST MARGARITA I HAVE EVER BEEN SERVED!!!! What the heck? It came out of a can?!?! And this is supposed to be a good Mexican restaurant? Anyway....ordered seasonal chicken tacos. Described as being served with butternut squash, Brussel sprouts and cauliflower. Yum! Served and presented nicely. And it was ICE COLD!!! I mean cold to the touch. Didn't even get time under the warmer. OK, SO bartender takes plate, gets a new order and honestly it was pretty tasty. Have never had fall vegetables in my chicken taco and that made for an interesting and flavorful taco. Although I ultimately enjoyed my dinner, I did. It drink 1/3 of my margarita. Glad I tried this place but won't rush back. Sorry, bummer.
