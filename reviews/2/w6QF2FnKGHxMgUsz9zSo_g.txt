I would rate this place four stars on the burritos, but other factors make it necessary to give two stars.

Remember back in the day when you got a heaping mound of chips with your burrito? Today I ot exactly 5 chips... No joke. And don't think of this place as a Mexican joint, it's not. This is an American style burrito place. With that said, I would appreciate it if they didn't blast the Ranchero music. I would venture to bet there was not one Spanish-speaking person in the restaurant outside of the staff. I have nothing against the language, but Ranchero is THE worst music ever. 

As usual, the burrito was good, but the company needs to seriously reconsider what they're doing.
