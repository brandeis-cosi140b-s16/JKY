Maybe I'm just not knowledgeable enough about Mexican food or something, but I really don't understand the hype about this place/chain. Everyone is always talking about how great and "authentic" it is, but it just seems like standard, uninteresting Mexican fast-food fare to me. Plus, from what I have always heard, although Americanized-Mexican dishes rely on mounds of cheese, real, authentic Mexican food is rarely covered in a cup and a half of shredded cheddar. I don't know, though The food was okay and the service was okay and the prices are okay, but that's really all I can say about it...it's okay. I will say that, when I was in, their salsa/veggie bar was absolutely wrecked. Maybe some quality salsa would've somehow elevated my rolled tacos to another level, garnering another star in the process, but there was no way I was going to pick through that mess to find out. Hell, maybe I'll try it again and it'll knock my socks off. If so, I'll be sure to update this review accordingly, but as of now, I'm in no real rush to go back and see.
