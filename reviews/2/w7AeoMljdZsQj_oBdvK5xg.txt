Typical bar food, not very impressive. Husband had wings, they were average, I had shrimp basket, basic frozen fried shrimp with fries/coleslaw. Not sure what is in the coleslaw that makes it spicy or why you would want spicy coleslaw, however if you do this is the place for it. Also kind of expensive for a few fried shrimp. Also the kitchen closes at 9:00 not 10:00 as the website leads you to believe. They would not serve a party of 4 who came in at 8:58, (though I understand ) even though the party went by the website times. Will not go out of my way to eat here again.
