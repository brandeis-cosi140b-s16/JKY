Several years ago Sylvia's was a decent, not great, place to quench my desire for Mexican food? Since then the quality has gone way down. The sauces taste canned, the food is greasy but somehow still dry and the seasoning is limited to pepper. The service leaves a lot to be desired. I gave Sylvia's another try recently and was really disappointed.
