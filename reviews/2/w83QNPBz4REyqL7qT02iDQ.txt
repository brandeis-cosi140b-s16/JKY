Met a couple of friends for dinner prior to the Todd Snider/Kevin Gordon show at the Visulite Theatre.  Apparently our friends had quick service from the minute they arrived, but once we arrived, it took forever in between visits.  We realized next time we ordered a drink, we should order two at the same time.  Horrible.  And we ended up being late for the show.  The food was okay.  I much prefer Don Pedro or Azteca, though, especially for the price and service.  Oh, and watch out ordering the Low-Carb Margarita.  The prices aren't listed on the menu and we were stunned when we got the bill and they were $10 each (served in a lo-ball glass!)  Luckily I only had one to try as my friend was enjoying her 3rd, only to wish she hadn't either.  She wasn't feeling any effects, so they made them pretty weak, too.  On top of that, we thought we were getting a great deal with $3 drafts, but they were short-poured and served in very thick glasses.  Deceiving.  Ahh well.  Live and learn.  The show was great, though and the drinks at the Visulite more than made up for this unfortunate experience.
