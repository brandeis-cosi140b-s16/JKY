Okay, we visited this place on 5/21/15 around 10:30am. The interior was okay, our table was lopsided, but we sat there because of its location. 
The young lady who was our server was sitting in a booth with her significant other, she got up to bring us a menu, I ordered water and my sister in law ordered a coffee. She was brought a cup of hot water and instant coffee; price $1.95. that was a bummer. 
The complimentary chips and salsa was very good. 

The waitress took our order and went back to the male in the booth and stayed there until our food was ready and then served us. 

I ordered the green chile chicken chilaquiles plate and my sis in law ordered the red chile chilaquiles plate. The food was good and the chile was spicy.  

Our server never came back to ask if we needed anything until we were finished. Then we waited another 10 minutes to get our check. 

We were there about 45-60 minutes and there never wasn't more than 2 tables occupied besides the significant other of the waitress, but the service sucked! I was disappointed, especially considering the price versus the service and food. I will not return.

I give the food = 3.5 stars, cleanliness= 3 stars, atmosphere = 3 stars, service= 1 star.
