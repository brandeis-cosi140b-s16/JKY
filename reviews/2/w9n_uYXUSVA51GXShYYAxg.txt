Tijuana flat falls flat for me.  
They have some cool things/ideas going on but as a whole, they are not very good.  I hate to say that because I wanted to like them. 

I will say the service was super friendly but that is pretty much where the good things about this place stop.

The salsa is gross.  The cheese dip is melted cheddar and nothing great, the guacamole is bland.  I ordered the chicken bowl and the rice was so dry as well as the chicken.  They were both pretty flavorless.  I added black beans and there were about 3 in there.  

Overall, just a waste of calories and time.  I was 2 feet from Moe's which would have been a better option.  Seriously.
