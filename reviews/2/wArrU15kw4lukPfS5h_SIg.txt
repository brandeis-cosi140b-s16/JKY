I've never understood the popularity of this chain. My GF loves it so she gets it all the time, I think I've had it 5 times in my life, and only been inside twice, the last eat in experience was dreadful, the long long line, the tables were ALL dirty, the soda area was closed due to mechanical issues, so the soda orders were filled behind the counter, My GF was kind enough to wait in line while I sat down, after cleaning my own table, I dread to think about the germs at these tables since they are rarely cleaned, yuck. Another observation, everyone in line just stays glued to their precious cell phones, no communication with other customers, no interaction between even other family members, just a bunch of cattle moving along to the trough of average tasting food while attentive to only the dribble of whatever that little device is providing them. Sad day we live in folks.
