I go to this location almost weekly because its near my house and my other half loves the breakfast burritos they make here. I have had good experiences with the food served, its the condition of the store- cleanliness wise, that I have an issue with. The floors are usually sticky along with most of the table tops. The windowsills are dusty. The salsa bar is in need of more ice and a good wipe down. The soda machine is a sticky mess and dusty on top as well. If the place is open 24hours, there should be some down time to clean the store. So, I will still continue to eat at Roberto's but I hope the kitchen and prep area are not in the same condition as the dining room.
