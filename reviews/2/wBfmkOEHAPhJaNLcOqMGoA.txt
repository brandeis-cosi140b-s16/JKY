If you love coconut shrimp please avoid the Sandbar. Is like eating a donut. There is no shrimp flavor in this sweet sauce shite cake battered, think it may be shrimp proto-meat?  And what is with the sugar sauce?

I do like the black beans. Scotty's fish tacos are okay. A bit dry.  

Sorry about the skrimp left-over pic. Just to show what a tragedy.

Sweet beers..no good IPA.
