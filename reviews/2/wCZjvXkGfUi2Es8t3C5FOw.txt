This place has good food but they have begun to fall short in a couple of areas. They no longer have a CCSD teacher discount. They also had to repeat one order three times before it came out right. In addition, they rung up the order wrong this charging us incorrectly. The size of the queso has been diminished also. They were accommodating about their mistakes, but to many downers for us to return.
