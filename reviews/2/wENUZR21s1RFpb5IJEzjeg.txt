Don't get me wrong, I love Chipotle. This location, however, has gone way downhill. The customer service leaves a lot to be desired. I have noticed employees on the food line ignore customers, forget tortillas in the warmer and burn them, turn their backs on customers they are helping, wipe their noses on their sleeves while preparing burritos, jabber back and forth instead of communicating with the customer in front of them, and even hold hands (apparently a boyfriend/girlfriend pair work there). The food used to be good but is now sadly inconsistent.  I hope that they can pull their act together, because this used to be one of the best Chipotles in the East Valley. Not anymore.
