Ok, I dont want to be the bad guy here, because everything tasted delicious. We went for lunch and I ordered the pozole and the taco de barbacoa. My honey had a breakfast burrito. The taco was outstanding. He kept picking out very fatty, almost raw looking pieces of bacon out of his burrito. He thought that was odd, as raw bacon is a big nono! I was enjoying my pososle and it was a huge bowl, so I had to get a to go container. As I was packaging it up, I noticed a blue bone in the soup. At the time, I didnt think about it and just removed the weird bone from the soup. When I came home, I was very nauseas and threw up like never before. Be very wary of what you order here. Their taco de barbacoa was out of this world, but I would be careful on ordering other menu items.
