Previously reviewed but removed for lack of content. I visited the restaurant with my son this past week during the afternoon. I felt that the establishment is more of a bar atmosphere than a restaurant. The tacos I had I felt were marginal at best. Arizona is full of mexican food restaurants and I certainly would not recommend this establishment for food, but perhaps late night the bar appears to be a place to meet.
