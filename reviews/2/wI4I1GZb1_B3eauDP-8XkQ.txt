According to the menu, the ancho-chili bbq sauce is slightly sweet, but it's not, it's very sweet, cloyingly so.  It works however on the slow roasted pork burrito primarily because the pork itself doesn't have much flavor at all. 

Major additional complaints are that the rice they put in the burritos is too mushy and their chips have a pre-packaged taste and feel although I'm sure they're made fresh in house. 

All in all it's a mediocre experience for made to order Mexican food at a fairly reasonable price.  Wouldn't recommend it compared to other options around town, but I wouldn't avoid it if friends wanted to go...
