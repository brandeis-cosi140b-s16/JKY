On 7/29 at 10 pm i pulled up to the drive thru and the employee asked if i could wait a moment and i said yes. 10 minutes later and nothing. I asked the drive thru guy if they were still open and he said yes and what can he get for me. He didnt offer an apology for forgetting me. I gave him my order and drove to the window.  He didnt say anything to me but what i owed. I paid they guy he gave me my soda without my receipt.  He asked if i wanted any sauce threw it in the bag and didnt wish me a good night or thank me for coming in. He must not of wanted me to have my receipt so i didnt know his name. But for those out there he was white, balding blondish hair with glasses. This guy should learn what customer service is about. I go to this place at least 2 times a week and have had great service in the past but this employee has made me want to switch places. How do you just forget your customer and i made sure to talk loud so he could hear me. Plus there was 2 cars behind me. Your lucky  i gave you 2 stars because your other employees are nice but this guy sucks.
