My wife and I went to the SunCoast today to play a round of bingo. Afterward, we decided to get a bite to eat. My mom has told me that she really likes Senor Miguels, so we decided to give it a try.

They had a 2 for 1 fajitas deal so we went with that. We got one shrimp fajita and one steak and chicken combo.

We started with the requisite chips and salsa. We were also given bean dip. The chips and salsa were average. I did like that it came with bean dip, as most places don't give you that so it was a nice little surprise.

Neither of us were impressed with the fajitas. They seemed very Americanized. There was meat, onions, and peppers with little to no seasoning. All of the flavors were very muted. The fajitas were served with flour tortillas and even there weren't that good. They  were barely warmed and didn't seem to be fully cooked.

A couple of weeks ago my wife and I had a fajitas throw down. Neither of us are professional cooks (though I do enjoy cooking; my wife only cooks if she has to) but we both agreed our fajitas were better and more authentic (I'm Swedish, she's Filipino) than these. At least because of the two for one deal, we only had to pay for one order.

The fajitas came with re-fried beans, rice, sour cream, and guacamole. All of it was average at best.

The star of the meal was the Mexican banana split. I'm pretty sure it's a gringo dish and not authentic, but it was still pretty good. It consisted of a banana wrapped in a tortilla, deep fried, and sprinkled with cinnamon. In the middle were three scoops of ice cream with whipped cream on the side. It was not overly sweet and the deep-fried bananas were really good.

I doubt I'll ever be back, but if I do it will be to get a Mexican banana split.
