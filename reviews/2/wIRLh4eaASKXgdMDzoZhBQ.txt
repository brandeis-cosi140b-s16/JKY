Everything is awesome except the food.

Interesting menu, nice staff, fun concept, but aside from the beignets(which are only passable as something other than beignets) - the food is somewhere between subpar and plain ol terrible.

Ordered a burrito, a quesadilla, some nacho-tots, and the beignets so felt like we tried it all.  There were 2 issues with every single thing we ordered.

1) the ingredients weren't very good (Kinda like someone emptied out microwave burritos instead of making rice, meat, veggies, etc...)

2) The food is poorly prepared.  The kids that work there are very nice but they put so much buffalo sauce on the quesadilla that it was inedible, and the burrito was layered like a parfait so that each bite was a single but different ingredient.

Might try again some day but doubt it.
