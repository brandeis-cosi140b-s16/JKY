Me and my wife are debating whether to give one star or two stars but either way we agree on one thing...

Save your money! 

The place is overpriced and the food is not very good. My wife had a Chili Colorado burrito and it was very underwhelming with tough beef in a very plain tomato sauce. I had a Chili Verde burrito and it tasted heavily of vinegar. The service was rather bland as well to go with the food. We didn't even consider dessert given how disappointing the entrees were. 

On the plus side, the food came out rather quickly and my wife enjoyed the spicy salsa.

We both agreed we won't be going back to Fiesta Mexicana. We suspect Fiesta Mexicana will have the same fate as Table 49.
