If you got the late night quasi-authentico mexican craving, then Pepe's is probably the place. Not the greatest or the tastiest, but for being OPEN INSIDE 24 hours, the night crew sees plenty of action. I usually get the Carne Asada Tacos, about a C+, and sometimes a Chile Rellano Burrito (tonight was pretty good, a B+, but usually a C-). My roommate loves this place and frequents it often: me, once in a while. To me, it is one step up from a taco truck.
