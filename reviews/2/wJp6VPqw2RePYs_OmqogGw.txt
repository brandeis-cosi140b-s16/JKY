My friend and I went to this place over the weekend. We ordered nachos, taquitos, carne asada and a combination plate. The servers were very nice, but the service itself was quite slow. It took about 20 minutes from the time we ordered until we got the apps and then another 25 minutes from then for our meals. 
The food was very bland. It made me sad because the presentation was nice, so I was sure it would  be flavorful, but I was disappointed. 
I would recommend this place only for drinks and maybe chips and salsa. Everything was kinda boring.
