If it weren't for the chips and salsa we probably would have starved. The size of the portion for the fajitas reminded me of the samples they dole out at SAMs clubs on Sundays to entice you to buy the real thing. The drinks called "swirls" came out plain... What a bunch of false advertising! AND don't ask for extra cheese, because they will charge you a dollar for about a spoon full! Total rip off! There's hardly any music in the place, felt like I was in a cafeteria... Clank clinkity clank!!
