Went to Rubio's on Easter Sunday.  Originally we were going to Chipotle but they were closed for the holiday.  My wife tried to switch to Paradise Bakery which is right next door but I was already in the mood for a steak burrito.  The restaurant was nice and the service was friendly.  My wife asked for a cup for water and they gave her a plastic cup not much bigger than a shot glass...Insulting!!!  At Chipotle, they also give you a smaller cup for water, but it is still a respectable size and is uses the same lid as the normal drinks.  

The food was actually pretty good and I would go back but it will be hard to get my wife back which is frustrating.  They really need to step up their game if they want to compete with Chipotle.
