Meh. I was really excited to try this place out.

The inside is a lot bigger than I expected and the decor is lovely. The service was really good too!

But the most important part, the food, just lacked. The chips and salsa/guacamole were good. Oh and the sangria.

We started off with the crispy quesadilla which was good. Maybe serve it with a side of sour cream?

I had the lunch special with chicken flautas and a pulled chicken taco. I didn't like the flautas, plus I expected them to be crispy... Didn't care for the rice and usually I love Mexican rice. The taco was alright. My boyfriend had the enchiladas. He thought they were alright, nothing special. For this, plus a beer the total was $44, probably won't return unless it's just for drinks at the bar.
