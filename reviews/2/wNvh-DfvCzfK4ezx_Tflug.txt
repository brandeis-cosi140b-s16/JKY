Los Dos Mediocrity. Soo Easy to find better. It was a disappointment from the beginning. The beans and the salsa were not very tasty. That is a big indicator of the quality of Mexican food. If the beans and salsa are good normally everything else is on point. Los betos or Super Burrito are easily better. Service was decent. Won't be back.
