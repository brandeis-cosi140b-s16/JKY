While having a good bit of time for a layover, we were looking to shift it into a Latin-American gear a little early before our flight to Puerto Rico out of the Charlotte airport. 

The tables were clean, and the server was extremely pleasant and attentive, but the food was really not the bee's knees. We had chips and salsa, with the salsa tasting pretty much like Pace (not my fave), and a triple side of quac (since the order is actually quite small our server was kind enough to combine three orders into a larger bowl). The guac was pretty flavorless, and we heard the same from our buddies that ordered the quesadilla. 

They did have Tecate though, and limes, and again our waiter was great and the bill wasn't a total punch in the gut since we didn't order that much. I would say if you're in a South of the Border state-of-mind at the Charlotte airport, a Tecate at Tequileria will do you right, but maybe try and spice up the food with some lime juice and/or an unmarked vile of house blended spices (like the one my mom gives me and expects me to carry around to season my food).
