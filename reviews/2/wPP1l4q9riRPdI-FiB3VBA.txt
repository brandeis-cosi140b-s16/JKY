Well I just got wind that this place is closing, now. Apparently the family is going to call it quits sometime shortly.
I've been here a few times with coworkers and I'm not a fan, either. Too cheesy, too flavorless, etc. I think maybe this was the type of "Mexican" food that white Americans liked eating 30 years ago... that's the impression I've had of it, anyhow.
