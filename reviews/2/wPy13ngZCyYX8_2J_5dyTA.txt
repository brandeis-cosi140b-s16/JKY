Don Pedro's is not a place I would really recommend, but could do in a pinch if you're out and about and don't want to go to McDonald's. Just don't expect too much or you will be disappointed.

The food was okay, but not what I'd refer to as authentic Mexican by any means. Not fast, and not spicy like I look for when I hit up a Mexican joint. The chips were good (can't really screw those up) and the salsa was decent, but not the best I've had.

The actual food we ordered wasn't very flavorful, and all of the shrimp was precooked frozen shrimp, not the fresh stuff you'd expect at a restaurant. 

We were one of three tables filled in the entire restaurant. The waitress was friendly but it was nearly impossible to get our ticket paid for. We had to wait for about 15 minutes to get a cashier. That was unpleasant.

The prices were a bit high for Mexican food. Usually the joints we visit are super cheap, which I love! So, that was a bit of a let down.
