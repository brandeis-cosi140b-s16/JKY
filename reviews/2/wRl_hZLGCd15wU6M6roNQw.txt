The good: unique, lively decor
The bad: so far, all of the food. Went for lunch Friday with a friend. The wings were over cooked and lacked flavor. My friend gave the soup and salad 2 thumbs down. 

In addition they make flour tortillas with a hint of corn, and the server claimed this was the authentic way. Never seen this in a South American restaurant operated by South Americans.  They make their chips the same way, and thus more closely resemble pita chips than tortilla chips.  No es bueno.

Near-average for American-Mexican food but needs work.
