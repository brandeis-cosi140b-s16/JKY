I wish a there were 1/2 steps to the review stars.  We order take out from this restaurant about once a week.  I have only a 50/50 shot of getting what I ordered.  Today a sub black beans in lieu of rice came with neither, so I walked back across the street to fix it and was met by the take out person telling me "that's not what the ticket said". I'm sorry that the guy answering the phone didn't enter what we repeated back and forth three times, but I'm not sure how that is my fault.  I order, he repeats back, I repeat as confirmation.  It's usually a good method!  When did an apology for screwing up my order get left off the Customer Service check list?  Once I dumped the black beans into my mahi bowl it was edible, but too salty.  (That's saying a lot, usually I crave salt after a jaunt into the AZ heat.)
