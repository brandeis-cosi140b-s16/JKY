Don't worry be happy. 
The poor waitress seemed so depressed or moody better yet said. 
I didn't want to ask for anything, I didn't want her to go all psycho ninja on my ass.
I didn't receive 1 smile from this lady. The whole time I was there I just wanted to leave.

On with the food. I had a Caldo de albondiga, honestly though it tasted like it was from a can. It wasn't all that great. Even I could make this soup better. 
The cheesy salsa was bomb.com  It was a spicy salsa with cheese melted inside.

$2.00 for a canned soda because they don't have fountain drinks. 

Speedy service is a fact at this joint

Solicitors are welcome

Beer is served cold

Overall this place is clean

For now this places doesn't meet the standards for Mexican, perhaps Salvadorian.
I wouldn't recommend this places at all.
