I can't believe I'm having to write this review as most of my encounters at this location have been nothing but pleasant.  Well not today!  I come in around 2pm to pick up a late lunch for myself and a co-worker.  Line is fine, no issues there.  I order a burrito bowl to go with white rice and black beans.  I know the drill.  Then I get to the barbacoa.  It's the bottom of the barrel only the fatty pieces left, so I say you know what, I'd rather wait for the next batch.  She looks at me like I'm crazy.  She's like what do you mean.  Again, I'm like I'd rather wait for the next batch than get what's left.  Now here's what pissed me off.  She turns around and laughs and says something to the other dude in Spanish. Oh no she didn't.   I should have left right then and there and I wish I had.  

Look, they're going to have to bring out a fresh batch for the next person anyway and I said I'm fine waiting.  I don't get what the big deal was.  Haven't any of you ever gone to a pizza place, saw the last dry slice all by itself and said you'd wait for a fresh pie?

So then she calls me over with some dry pieces that they brought from the back in a new bowl.  Seriously?  I'm not dumb chic.  I'll wait for the next batch.  As I'm waiting a couple minutes later another guy walks up and says the same thing and she's like, no problem it'll just be a couple minutes.  Oh really?  I see how this goes.  I mean, come on.  How hard was that?

Like I said I've been here before, made small talk, joked around with the other staff and walked out with a smile.  It's the end of an era 7th Ave and McD because I won't be going back in there again.
