Let me start off by saying our server was great and very attentive. However, the food does not meet the quality expectations of what it cost. The cheese con queso seemed just like regular melted cheese that cost $6, we didn't care for the taste. And the chimichanga we ordered cost $12, it was barely warm so we took a bite and decided to forgo eating the rest. Honestly, if I am going to spend a lot of money in dining out I want the food to taste good and be enjoyable, and sadly this just wasn't the case for this establishment.
