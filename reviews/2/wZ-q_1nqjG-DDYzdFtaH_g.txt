I was excited about a close New Mexican style Mexican restaurant close to home. 

Sadly the food was less than average. How disappointing. 

The kitchen clearly does not understand how to make an enchilada. The chicken was poached and in large chunks and very dry. The dish had less than 1/2 a teaspoon of green sauce. 

Try shredding the chicken and soaking it in broth to make it tender. 

The service was ok. And the atmosphere was good. Too bad the food was mediocre. 

I would be hard pressed to return. Reviews all say great things, but clearly there is room for vast improvement.
