If you're hangry and you just can't hold out there food is good.  The nachos were tasty and my friends enjoyed the empenadas.  
In my opinion it's not worth the price and it's definitely white-mexican food.  To boot the service is non existent.  Seriously, our plates were never cleared, my beer was served with remnants of head dried on the inside of the glass (that means it sat for a very long time on the bar before it made it to me) and I had to flag down our server to get our check, a good 25 minutes after we were done eating and still staring at our plates.
It's definitely not worth the price of admission.
