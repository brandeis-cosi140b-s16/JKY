The manager was the one adding my final ingredients (salsas, cheese, guac, lettuce) and was skimping on everything. She rolled her eyes when I asked for more. 

The cashier was so delightful and the food was great as always but I am disappointed in seeing a manager acting like that.

The food itself was good but the experience really ruined it for me - especially from such a great company like Chipotle.
