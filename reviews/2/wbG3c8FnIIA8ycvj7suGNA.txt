La Salsa has been a safe bet for vegetarians and folks looking wholesome fast-food. But this La Salsa Catina inside a mall was dire. The service was fairly ok. But the food was poor. The pizza veggie with black beans tasted as bad as it sounds ;) My sizzling chicken fajitas were ok, but overall we left feeling we should've gone somewhere else.

Damn those vegetarians - it's sooo difficult to take them anywhere! Please eat eggs, fish or seafood...else bring a picnic of straw :)
