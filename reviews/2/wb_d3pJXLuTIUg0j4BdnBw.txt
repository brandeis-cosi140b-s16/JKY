Ocho Locos does not participate in Maricopa County Environmental Services Restaurant Ratings -- beware.

Do NOT order a martini here. I asked for mine dirty and it arrived filthy! It tasted like 50% olive juice. Disgusting. The spinach enchiladas are truly stuffed with spinach, which is great. Tortillas chips are out of a bag. 

I've been here three times and service is lackadaisical.
