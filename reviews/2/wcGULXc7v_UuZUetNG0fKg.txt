Outdated decor and kind of musty smelling, but who cares.  I came for the food. Ordered the taco and enchilada lunch special. Surprisingly pricy for a basic lunch special. $9. 

The cheese enchilada was PERFECT! Gooey cheese and yummy sauce. However, the shredded beef taco was very disappointing. The meat itself was ok. A tad dry but I've had worse. The fried taco shell was extremely tough and chewy. Typically the shells are crispy. Not sure if I got one that was sitting for a while or perhaps they use extra thick corn tortillas? I only got halfway through the taco before I gave up. 

2 stars for the price and the taco. 5 stars for the enchilada. I wont be coming back.
