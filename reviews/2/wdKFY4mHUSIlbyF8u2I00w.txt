Service- The girls there are always nice and friendly, the food comes out pretty fast, but sometimes the breakfast burritos aren't always what you order so make sure you check your bag before you leave or else. It usually stays clean inside and out.

Food-I've tried everything, but nothing really makes me want to come back, I only go back for my grandparents who seem to just accept this place as a mexican joint near the house. Id' say if the hot sauce went to the tomatoe type hot sauce and they had chips, it would help as well as a smaller choice of tacos with "homemade tortillas" it would separate themselves as an acceptable mexican restaurant.

As you can see I don't have much to say about a certain type of plate because they are easily forgettable. STEP UP your game a little my friends. Although, I'll still come back with my grandparents. This is my review.
