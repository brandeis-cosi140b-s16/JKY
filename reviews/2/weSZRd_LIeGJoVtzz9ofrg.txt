My review:

Please understand that I am a hard rater.  I rarely award more than 3 stars.  My definition of 3 stars is a good, solid meal with good service. 

The food here was just okay and the prices are high.  The staff was friendly and attentive however my entree arrived 1 minute after my soup arrived.  Poor planning on my servers part.

Tonight I had the three enchilada plate and corn with chorizo soup.  I am not a fan!

I haven't been here in several years.  Now I remember why.
