horrible service, I live near this place and have prob been at least 10 times, and not once have i EVER gotten speedy service. The girls have never been rude to me, but Ive never seen a sense of urgency from them.

Foods ok, decent enough for me to return :)

Honestly the service is so bad on the inside that I will usually opt for the wait in the drive thru, saves me from tipping for less than stellar service.
