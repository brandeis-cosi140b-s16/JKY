This place is all right.  Just all right.  Bordering on whatevs.  We were there in middle afternoon so it was probably a little more quiet than it gets on a Saturday evening.  The spinning wheel for drink specials is okay.  Though it didn't really work for us.  When we came in, specials on Dos Equis.  Sweet.  Refreshing.  Good with the nachos et cetera.  Next was Jack Daniels.  I love whiskey, but not a great combo.  And certainly not appreciated by my table mates.

Fun gimmick, but I've been to these places where . . like, several choices are on special.  Maybe if each section of the wheel included a beer and a liquor selection. 

The guacamole wasn't unholy, but it also wasn't great.  We were pretty sure it was that fairly decent stuff you can get in the frozen section of Costco.  The nachos were fine.  The chicken on there was nicely seasoned and not too dry.  The empanadas were good, a little less so for the price.  

It is big and wide open, has a nice view of the strip.  You can have fun here.  You can also probably be slightly disappointed here.
