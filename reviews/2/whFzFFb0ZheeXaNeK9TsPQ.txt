Based on the mixed reviews by other Yelpers, I knew my experience would be a gamble. And sure enough, my experience at MM was eh, just ok. 

All started well. My two friends and I were greeted and promptly seated in a booth. The decor is really modern and the booth was comfy. The perfect size for chatting with friends...if you can hear them!! The music is SO loud that we all noticed it. We had to yell to be heard. Some songs were louder than others and it became unbearable. Finally, we asked them to turn it down and they did. Whew!! 

Now for the food. Ordered the salsa flight, guacamole, vegetarian tostadas, chicken skewers and steak skewers to share. I wondered if the tortilla chips were from the bottom of a bag. Half of the basket consisted of small, broken chips. No bueno! 
The salsa trio was great. I particularly enjoyed the salsa verde. The guacamole was average. The chicken and steak skewers were really delicious and the sauces that accompanied them were very nice touches. Vegetarian tostadas were fantastic and very flavorful! 

I ordered one wine and one Mexican beer. Can't go wrong there. 

Service: our server was friendly but she wasn't consistent in asking us if we enjoyed our food or if we needed anything. Had to ask someone else to bring the bill and after 15 minutes of waiting for her to pick it up, I got up to walk it to the bar to cash out. 

Verdict: their happy hour makes it worth going back but I won't expect much else.
