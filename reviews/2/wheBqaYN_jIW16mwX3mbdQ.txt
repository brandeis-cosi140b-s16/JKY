I ordered the carne asada fries... I usually can't finish cuz they give you so much at the other locations... Thus location gave about half of what the other filibertos give. They also wrapped my rolled tacos with cheese in paper?!?!? So the cheese got smashed and stuck to the paper! I won't be going to this location anymore...
