I really do not like anything about this place. The inside of the building is depressing with horrible little tables and chairs. I do not even remember the folks working there so they must have been ok as they did not doing anything wrong. The food to me tastes like it comes out of a TV dinner, yet folks eat here and it stays open year after year so someone likes it.
