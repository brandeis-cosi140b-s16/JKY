The location is the only special thing about this place. They have a great patio and nice interior. The drinks and food are just average, at best. Beer selection isn't great and our waitress couldn't even tell us half the draft selections. We got a, "Uh... there's a pumpkin beer. I'm not sure where it's from." All the food was very bland.
