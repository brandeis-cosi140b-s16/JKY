All this items were very basic without any interesting or complex flavor combinations except for the dessert.  The flavor and presentation of the food was unremarkable. I think we might have ordered the wrong stuff but there shouldn't be any wrong stuff at a good restaurant.  Also, they bring you bread instead of chips and salsa.  I don't mind the bread but it should be freshly baked bread at a James Beard nominated restaurant.  This was some store bought bread from Safeway or Fryes.

The guacamole  had cranberries not pomegranates as advertised.  It was fine but the whole guac show at the table is really unnecessary.  Plus, their show is lame.  They just mix the crap in a bowl in front of you.  They don't even have a mortal and pestle made of stone where they mash it up.  If you're going to go through the trouble of doing something like that, I want to see stoneware from an ancient mayan temple.  No theater whatsoever.

Service:

Our waiter looked like a cross between a pirate and a convict.  He had the vocal expressiveness of a mime.  When we asked about the food, he told us exactly what was written on the menu.  He was also irritated that we asked questions since it was clearly written on the menu. Corpses have more passion about what they do.  

Decor/Ambiance/Location:

Overall, the decor and ambiance of the place is simple, comfortable, and unpretentious .  The tables are covered with tablecloths and the lighting is dimly light.  You can definitely bring a date with bad skin here. There was a good Mexican band playing live music.  The bathroom has more Crucifixes and Mother Mary iconography than an Italian grandmother's house.  The restaurant is located in a neighborhood that earns the designation "barrio".   I was pleasantly surprised that my hubcaps weren't missing when I returned and was happy that nobody stabbed me. I like an adventure but next time I want to put my life on the line I will be going to Beirut not Mexican food.
