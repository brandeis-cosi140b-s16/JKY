I love fish tacos and although I do enjoy coming here, I don't think their fish is that fresh.  Well, let me rephrase, I don't think the oil they fry their fish in is that fresh.  It went past the due date of how often oil should be changed out when frying food.  Don't skimp out on this step Rubio's!

Other than that, the service was good, the salsa was good and the experience as a whole wasn't too bad.  They just really need to work on changing out their oil more frequently.
