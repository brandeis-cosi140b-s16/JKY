Oh airport food, always sad . . . .

Plenty of seating in this colorful cantina.  The sports play on the big screens and the waitresses are pretty quick and friendly.  A simple menu makes it easy to order - we decided to split the big blue burrito.  It really is huge!!!  The steak was dry, not very flavorful, the tortilla seemed dry too and overall it was a sad bland burrito.  Comes with light fluffy chips and a bland salsa too.  Tons of food for about $8 - so it's a good deal but just not very good food.  

Our waitress was fairly attentive and made sure we had what we needed.  Overall the service was nice but not amazing.  I don't blame her though.

I also didn't like that they had the super cheap plastic cups and plastic utensils.  Eh .. . . .
