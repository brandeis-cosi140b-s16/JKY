After eating mind (and ass) blowing Mexican food at numerous Phoenix area eateries, I was totally DTG (down to gorge) at Tacos De Juarez. Unfortunately, I was rather disappointed by the food, which was relatively bland and uninspired compared to some of what I've eaten even at some nondescript roadside taco joints in Arizona. The breakfast burrito was particularly boring. I think I could have made a better one myself. I really hate to be all negative, but I had very high expectations for Mexican eating in AZ, and a bad meal is a substantial chunk out of a very small handful of meals I was able to have while there. I'm afraid I have to recommend giving this place a miss, unless you're hungry and happen to be in the vicinity, though I can't imagine that description applying to any location in the greater Phoenix area whatsoever.
