My friend and I stopped here for a light dinner before going to a movie at the AMC theater in the same plaza. Not sure why we picked this place. I think we just both realized we were kinda hungry after we'd already parked and walked in. 

Mi Amigo's was never really on my radar as a place to try. I'm more a fan of the hole-in-the-wall "real" mexican food place. This place kinda felt like a mexican-themed, or mexican-inspired restaurant but it lacked something... almost felt like a food court with table service. 

The food was fine. It wasn't bad. The service was fine. 

My friend had the shrimp and garlic platter, and enjoyed it. I had a small tortilla soup. We probably over-did it with the chips and salsa. And even those were just fine. I would have liked for someone to just leave a pitcher of water (no ice) on the table because it felt like an eternity between refills and each refill succeeded in mostly adding more ice to my glass. No bueno.

No dessert, no drinks. Wasn't really feelin' it.

I wouldn't say I'm jumping at the chance to eat here again. It's serviceable. If I find myself at the AZ Center and other people want to eat here, I will do my best to make suggestions to go elsewhere, but I won't encourage it. But I won't fight it if the majority rules.
