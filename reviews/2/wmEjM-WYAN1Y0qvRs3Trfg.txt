Overall I was underwhelmed by this experience. My friend has the chicken caesar salad which as he described was "anemic" in that there was a small sprinkling of chicken for $12. I was drawn in by the 99 cent tacos. You can choose flour or corn. The sign said barbacoa, chicken or bean & cheese. I got two barbacoa and two chicken. It was not barbacoa but it was ground beef. Seasoned ground beef. This is not their barbocoa as another friend got a barbocoa burrito which did not contain ground beef. Strike three was that there was price differences between what is listed on the electronic menu and the written menu. My friend ordered sweet potato tots listed on the electronic menu $4, they attempted to charge her $5. She pointed out the issue and they said that it was listed as $5 on the paper menu. Ultimately they gave her the $1, but just be careful about this. There was at least one other item that had a difference between the price listed on the electronic menu v. paper. 

The positives were fresh brewed ice tea ($1.99), habanero salsa was good and no extra charge for getting it (which there should never be  but  alot of places seem to charge for sides of dressing etc.).
