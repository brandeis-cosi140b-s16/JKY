we saw this place while shopping next door at the Indian market.  I was excited to see a Mexican restaurant that was going to be differant.  When we sat down and looked at the menu the only thing that looked interesting was the Indian taco.  so we got that and nachos.  Every thing was good but nothing was speacial or different from any other mexican place.
