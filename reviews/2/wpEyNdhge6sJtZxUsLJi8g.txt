Tastes just like all of Chipotle, but the service is much worse. On numerous occasions I have counted 6+ workers directly behind the counter with only one or two on the line. 

Other Chipotle restaurants can get through a long line pretty quick. Don't expect that here.

Oh and the cashier shouldn't have time to go and clean off multiple tables between the time that another person can check out... That's just proving that the line isn't fast enough.
