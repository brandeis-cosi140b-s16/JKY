My friend Keri and I visited for Taco Tuesday in hopes of some excellent tacos. The salsa was mild with little to no heat, but we anticipated it with the name of the establishment. I ordered a ground beef taco that had an abundance of onions in it. I ended up not being able to consume it, since I generally do not care for onions. Tolerating a little for added flavor is one thing, but when there is more onions than beef then it becomes a issue. The server just cleared the plates without asking if something was wrong. I don't anticipate us returning in the future, there are far better Mexican eateries out there.
