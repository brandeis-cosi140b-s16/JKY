Stopped there for happy hour, the food was great and the price was even better (lotsa tacos and 2 beers for under $20). The service was slow and very very bad! Just about everybody that worked there looked like a teenager, but the waiter must have been older since he served us our beers.  The waiter didn't bring us water, and it was HOT out and we were sitting on the patio; AND he took a LONG LONG time to get us our drinks (I think we went thru 2 servings of chips and salsa before we got our drinks) - not a good thing in AZ! The wait staff would look more professional, and you would know who they were if the restaurant had restaurant shirts rather than having staff wear whatever out of their closet. They had a band playing, White Cloud (?), that night; they were great but a little hard to hear and the view was not good (all the tables near the band area were "reserved"). Not sure if I will go back! If you want to try them out be ready for some long delays in  the service!
