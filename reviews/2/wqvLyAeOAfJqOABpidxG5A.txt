Chipotle if you were a child and I your parent I would have to say " You really disappointed me this time" 

I felt like your prices seemed so reasonable $5 for a burrito and then BAM you screw the Guacamole lover...come on $1.75 for freaking Guacamole on your burrito? Really!? When I balked at the price I was told "avocados are expensive" - ok, yes, they are about a dollar a piece- so I am buying the equivalent of two avocados??? I don't think so. 

You do not have ground beef? Wow...what the heck so now I am paying $8 for the same burrito I get at Salsaritas for $5 and now I cannot even have the type of meat I prefer? Man. So I went with the marinaded chicken. Lets just say I am glad I went and splurged the almost two dollars for Guac because that chicken was way overly seasoned - and way too spicy. 

I will say the burrito was very large - so if you don't like Guac then $5 is a rocking deal. Also, I preferred the rice to other establishments. Unfortunately due to my preference for all things Guacamole I wont be coming back. 



Please Salsaritas- invest in an uptown location ...(they do not have frivolous upcharges : ) )
