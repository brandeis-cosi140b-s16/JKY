Food was pretty good. As we were leaving, we handed the guy $60 cash, our meal was around $45, and he came back and said that we only gave him $40. He then left and came back with the $15. It was pretty clear that he was trying to rip us off. The music is a little loud but the service was quick. All in all, I have had better Mexican before.
