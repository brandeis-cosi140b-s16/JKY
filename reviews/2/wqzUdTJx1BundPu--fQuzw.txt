Food is not good but service is awesome. I was hoping that's since Arthuros restaurant use to be there it was going to be tasty but no it was not. It's a little expensive too. Sorry guys I'm a huge fan of chips and salsa and they need some major work in the area salsa taste like red devil sauce was added to it. The shredded beef taco I had was pretty good though. I may go to tryout there breakfast menu but I don't ever plan on eating dinner there. Staff was very friendly curious and service was fast. If only the food was just as great.
