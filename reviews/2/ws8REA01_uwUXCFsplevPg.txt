Mediocre tacos. 
I'll have to come back for the baked goods and see if they can earn more stars from me. Ended up there for lunch because some colleagues and I had a break from a training class and it was close. I was hoping to make a great find, but alas, they didn't impress. I figured a classic carne asado taco dinner would be a good barometer for gauging the place. The corn tortillas - now those were 5-star. the carne asada was so-so seasoned, not bad flavor, but somewhat bland, and quite tough. The mass of shredded lettuce on the tacos did nothing for it except make the lovely tortillas a bit soggy. Same for the blob of guacamole on the tacos. OK, but but so unpromising that I won't bother coming back for another meal. The baked goods on the other hand, I'll be back to try.
