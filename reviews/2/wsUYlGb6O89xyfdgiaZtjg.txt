Nine dollars for one TINY carnitas taco and a medium order of jalapeno rings. What a rip off! The rude lady working the drive through hit the wrong button on the register, cursed, then grabbed a calculator to total my order of two items. I should have questioned the nine dollar total, and had I known how minuscule the carnitas taco was going to be (seriously, it was one bite, that's it) I certainly would have. Now don't get the wrong idea, this place has problems beyond just the price and point of sale issues. I usually don't complain about price and I'm willing to pay if the food is good, but there was nothing about the food to redeem my experience. The taco was dry, like it had been sitting quite a while, and flavorless. I live less than a mile from this place and will never be back.
