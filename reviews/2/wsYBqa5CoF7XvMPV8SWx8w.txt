I have visited Barrios twice. The first time I met my friend for happy hour. Happy hour is OK nothing spectacular. 2 different wines $4 a glass, domestic beer 3, and house margaritas 4. The first visit I had a glass of wine and ordered one of the happy hour appetizers. The chips and salsa were very good. But when I got the appetizers I could not believe how small the portion was. I was not expecting anything huge but it would have been nice if it filled me up. I ordered ceviche and it was expensive and not great.

Visit number 2 was disappointing. The waitress was cranky and did not keep our drinks or salsa filled. I had a happy hour margarita and it tasted like there was NO alcohol in it at all. We had to flag the waitress down just to get another beer, really. I once again ordered an appetizer from the happy hour menu and there was a problem with it so I sent it back and had it removed from my bill. 

All in all for the price I am not satisfied. Each time the bill was $50 and the food nor the drinks were that great. Darn, it is so close to my house to.
