My boyfriend and his brother seem to love this place. They get the steak burritos and find them amazing. I decided to visit one day, and I must say that I'm not too impressed with this place. The decor and inside of the restaurant made me feel uncomfortable. I ordered a burrito with chorizo and it was very bland. The chorizo lacked any good flavor. The burrito as a whole was unsatisfying. It's very greasy and runny and even the sour cream is like liquid. I don't recommend this place for "authentic" Mexican food because if this place is truly authentic then authentic Mexican food must taste like cardboard. I would much rather get my authentic Mexican food at Fiesta Ranchero in McMinnville, TN.
