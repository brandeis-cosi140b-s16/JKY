Sigh... I'm done with Rosa's.  Went there on Thursday and ordered something I am very used to ordering.  It was bland and uninspiring.  The salsas - forget it... you'd be better off smuggling in a bottle of Herdez.  Chips?  Bland and stale.  The waiter was very quick, though - gotta hand it to them on that.
