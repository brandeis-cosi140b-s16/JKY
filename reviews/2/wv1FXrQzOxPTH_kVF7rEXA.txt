We'd always been curious to try this place since we're regular Cosmopolitan guests.  Suffice it to say our first visit to China Poblano will be our last.  Unfortunately we didn't read the Yelp reviews before going there. When the average is 3 stars, and people seem to say the guacamole is the best thing about the place, it should be avoided.  

All we had were two Salt Air Margaritas, which our server told us were 'amazing' house specialties.  They were different for sure, but not amazing. Ours arrived in small glasses with nearly half of it covered in a salty foam.  Some may view this as culinary genius, while others may view it as a way to get away from using alcohol.  It tasted like lime and salt and that was it.  They were gone in three small sips ... no joking.  All that was left was foam.I seriously wonder if there was any alcohol in it at all, and they came to over $30 with tax!  We ordered the margaritas right off the bat (big mistake... I know), and the server said, "I'll be back with your drinks and then I can explain our menu to you."  It was a little weird that a place has to explain the menu, but China Poblano does, apparently.

He said the fried rice was featured on a Food Network show, and then added some tidbits of info about certain dishes.  Nothing seemed all that great, and we looked around and observed other guests who were either confused or unhappy.  It's not so much a fusion menu as a confusion menu.  And guacamole for $15?  Seriously?  The waiter tried way too hard to sell the menu, and it was a complete turn-off.  

The Cosmo has some nice restaurants.  This isn't one of them.
