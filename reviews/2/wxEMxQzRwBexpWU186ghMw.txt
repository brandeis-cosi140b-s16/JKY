Only tried on beef taco, but not too great. The shredded beef didn't seem shredded, it seems more mushy and chopped. The taco shell was crispy, but outlandishly greasy at the bottom, which is typical, but this was too much grease. The taco was big and worth the $2.55, but the chicken option sadly is dark meat. The free chips and salsa (mild) were probably the best part of the this snack. Salsa was in small cups, but fresh and chips were hot and tasty. Big negative is not having horchata, even the counter girl questioned the manager on this big oversight. Decent lunch special - will give the place one more try for the tamale in the near future.
