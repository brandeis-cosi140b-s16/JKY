After reading the reviews, I decided I had to check this place out. The hostess  had me sign a waiver as I entered providing my phone number and email address. This is to release Spanish Fly of any liability with the pool use. I gave the nice girl a fake number and email address because I wasn't dressed for or planning to use the pool. 

Okay- so now that I've made it past the front door, I seated myself at the bar next to a good looking gentleman visiting from New Jersey. We chatted it up...too bad he was just visiting. How much does it cost to use the daybeds and cabanas on a weekend, you ask? Ready?....$300 for one bottle with a two bottle minimum. Do the math. Why is a potentially good thing always ruined by $$$? I was told they make $40K on one Saturday. I guess so! They can have it for that price.

The pool area is very small, but a pool inside a bar area is a cool concept, so that's a good thing. By pool area, I mean the tiny 12 inch space surrounding the pool.

The music playing at the indoor bar during the day is lively, beachy and upbeat. That's a good thing.The draft beer was reasonably priced, another good thing. The pool closes at 7 PM.

I had high hopes for this place. Like I said, a pool inside a bar is way cool. But, the small deck area with virtually no where to sit, is a turn off. I should probably come back at night to see what the crowd is like, but I'm really in no hurry to experience that. After all- it has been over 30 years since I was 21 and don't choose to spend my time surrounded by kids with fake ids.
