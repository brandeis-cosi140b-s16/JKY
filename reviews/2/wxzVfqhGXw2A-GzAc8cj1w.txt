I was excited to try this place. 
1. Because I love nachos/Mexican food. And 
2. Because they have vegan options! Yay! 
Well we got there around 9pm and the place was empty other than the one other table that they sat us right next to. Which is whatever. Looking at the menu, we see that the vegan nachos are $16, which is retarded, but we figured they MUST be good for that price so we ordered them, along with the Mexican corn. The corn was good, I have had better, but it was a reasonable price so that was a plus. The nachos came out and it was literally mostly dry chips with toppings only on the first layer of chips. Such a disappointment. Why are they charging so much for such a poor excuse for food? And to top it all off, our waiter was walking around in the dining room texting on his phone?! 

I wouldn't recommend this place and won't be back.
