I visited Maria Bonita last night I read the reviews some good n bad.  But I like to see for myself sometimes, I was disappointed. First  they were not busy when we arrived at all and we had to wait while they cleaned a table. That was okay, we sat upstairs, they told us that they had a big party upstairs and hadnt cleaned up yet!!  They cleaned a table for us and we were the only ones upstairs, through our whole meal they never cleaned any other tables!!!    I had the chicken Quesadilla, Queso dip, my friend ordered a margartia and the chicken Mole.  The margarita had to much salt and had more sweet n sour mix than tequila.  My Quesadilla was okay the sour cream that was suppost to come with it and guacamole was on top of some skippy lettece and some rice.  The chicken Mole was bland with no kick or flavor.  There were no drink specials or special dishes of the day.  As we were waiting for our bill my friend looked over and saw a check laying on the table beside of us of which still hadnt been cleaned gross.  The person had left their credit card we told our server so they could call the person or put it in their safe.  Now how long would that have sat there or what if a dishonest person sat there and took it!!  I was not impressed with Maria Bonita at all, nothing beats Don Pedros so far :)
