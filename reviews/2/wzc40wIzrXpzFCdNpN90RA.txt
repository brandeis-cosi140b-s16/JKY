Not too sure what's going on with OTB these days. I used to order and receive hearty, platefuls of delicious Mexican food, but now, it seems that those days are gone. OTB was pretty bare when I went in with my mother today, so service shouldn't have been an issue, but it was. She ordered a chicken fajitas plate which had an insanely small amount of food on it, especially considering what we were paying. I ordered the Dos XX fish tavos which were plentiful, but different in taste compared to what they used to be, and not in a pleasant way. The refried beans on my plate were runny and the black beans that my mother ordered magically turned into refried beans by the time they hit our table. We were inside of OTB for about an hour and we were offered a refill on our iced teas ONCE. Our cups sat empty for quite some time. The one time someone did refill our drinks, it wasn't even our server. I don't think I'll be venturing back to OTB any time soon. Whatever you guys have changed... change it back.
