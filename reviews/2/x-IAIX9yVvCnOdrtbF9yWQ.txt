I come to this location at least 2 times a week. I usually use the app on my phone to order ahead because it's always so busy at lunch time. Today I ordered the same thing as usual, a chicken bowl and when I came to pick it up, I sat down to eat it just to see that it was half of its normal portion. I'm not sure if it's because they are busy or if they don't care as much about to go orders, and I'm too nice to go up and complain because I don't want to be that customer. But I'm paying 7 dollars for a meal that usually fills me up (and I can't eat the whole thing) and today I finished it in under 10 minutes due to the size. I will come back to this location but don't think I will be paying ahead, would rather wait in line and make sure I'm getting what I pay for before I actually pay for it. 

My only regret is that I didn't think to take a photo of it before I ate it. I was going to give 4 stars but I'm giving 2 because I'm not at all satisfied with the meal I paid for today. They also lose a star for the size of the location, it's too small for a mall location that is packed all hours of the day (not the employees fault). 

If my meal would have been its normal proportion I would have given at least 4 stars. Maybe my next visit will be better.
