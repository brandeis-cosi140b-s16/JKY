Queso dip was good and I loved the thin crispy tortilla chips, but everything else was below average as far as food goes.  Service was alright, atmosphere and fun and lively, but it also wasn't terribly clean.

The parking is a royal pain to figure out for the first time, or if it's been awhile since your last visit.
