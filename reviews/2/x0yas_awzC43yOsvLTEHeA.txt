I really liked this place when I visited the one at Red Rock. The bloom is off the rose now, though. The food is average pseudo-Mexican, and the cheese dip I was so enamored of the first time I tried it tastes less interesting now. I'm somewhat  underwhelmed now.

I think this is a great spot for a get-together or as a place to eat when your real goal is to hang out with someone, but I wouldn't come for the food in and of itself.
