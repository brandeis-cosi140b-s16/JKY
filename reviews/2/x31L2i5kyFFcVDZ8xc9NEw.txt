I was here yesterday for dinner.  The food was good as always.  I mean you can never go wrong with el pollo loco, but this one the floor was really disgusting and sticky and the seats at the booth were sticky and torn.  The management really needs to work with their employees in the up keep of the restaurant.  I have been to el pollo locos in worst areas that kept their facility nice and cleaner than this location.  Overall, I rate this restaurant 2 stars.
