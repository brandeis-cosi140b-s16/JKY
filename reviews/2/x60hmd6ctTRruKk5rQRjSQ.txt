What is the big deal about Roberto's? I just don't get it. Perhaps I need to venture further into the menu and start sampling something other than the tacos and nachos? The food is ok, but I don't find it particularly flavorful or yummy. In fact, I typically wind up throwing most of it away (no matter how hungry and/or drunk I might be). I do appreciate, though, that this location is open 24 hours a day.
