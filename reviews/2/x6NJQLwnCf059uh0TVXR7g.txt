We couldn't believe this place. A tiny taco costs u $6. Come on, PLEASE. I ordered the noodle that the bartender recommended, It's so small that i thought "it's gotta take 4 of these to fill me up". When we wanted separate, he gave us a weird look. Come on man. you never asked us if we wanted separate checks. 
Save your money, take a cab to Chinatown (2 miles from the strip). and get some real Chinese (or Vietnamese, or Korean).
