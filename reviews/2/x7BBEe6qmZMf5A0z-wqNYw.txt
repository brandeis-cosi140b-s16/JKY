Had a burrito, but it wasn't very good.  The first half of it tasted like all beans.  The 2nd half was better, but still left a lot to be desired.  I was really hoping I'd like this place because it's so close, but I don't think I'll be back.

When I went, the place was packed full, but I was still served quickly.  Friendly staff.
