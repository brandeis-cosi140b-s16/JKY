Started with a $10 margarita with little to no tequila in it. My husband, son and I ordered three different dishes, only to be told they were out of all three!  We re-ordered. My husband had the beef, I had the pork and both of us thought they were overpriced and flavorless.  I couldn't find my "grilled  vegetables" as the portion was hidden under the meat and teeny.  It consisted of one small slice (1 inch diameter) of yellow squash, 1 smaller slice of onion and two tinier slices of something else I couldn't identify. 1/8 c.., max. The meat was tough--needed to have been marinated or at least cooked in the sauce in order to pick up the flavor.
Very disappointing.
