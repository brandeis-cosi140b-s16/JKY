Soup  and chili were adequate for upper Midwest pretensions to Mexican food. Those who ordered the tacos plates seemed to enjoy them. 
The sliders (from the bar menu), on the other hand, were obviously a tribute to another Madison institution -  the UW hockey team.  Hard, dry, and tasteless. First reaction of one who ordered them - this tastes like a hockey puck.  If I were a betting man, I'd wager the line cooks pressed down on the ground beef while grilling, a sure way to squeeze out the flavor.  Amateur hour. Not a food that would encourage me to linger and have another drink.  If you want sliders, go back to White Castle.
