For a few months I frequented Mexi Casa every Tuesday for $1 tacos, but I've not gone in a while. Something terrible must have happened. My boyfriend and I ordered takeout from them tonight and I was very very disappointed. 

I ordered a steak burrito with black beans and added peppers and onions. For the burrito it was $9 probably $10 with tax, and I have to say I like the steak burrito from Chipotle better. First, it tasted like it was made with Kraft singles American cheese, and the "steak" resembled steak-ums. My boyfriend ordered a buffalo chicken quesadilla and was very disappointed by its size. Very small. We also ordered chicken quesadilla soup. It was mediocre at best. 

I really wanted to like it since it's local and right down the street, but we probably won't be ordering from Mexi Casa again any time soon.
