Everyone giving this place more than 2 stars,
 I pray you are either super drunk and you're going to vomit this once you get home or you're high out of your mind and you have the munchies. I ate here sober...  Wow. Ordered the carne asada burrito. The tastiest thing was the frigging flour tortilla. Carna asada literally means grilled steak but culturally, it implies to all Latinos that the meat is seasoned and grilled. This meat had to have been boiled in peppered water and over-boiled might I add.  Lol. My jaw hurts from trying to chew this poor cow. I gave them 2 stars because the staff is nice. I had to find something positive. Oh and the pickled carrots were good. Don't get the boiled meat! Adios and never again. Unless I'm drunk.
