Birthday dinner at El Zocalo - very lovely patio, not very good food.  My husbands chicken was burnt, my carne asada was tough.  Although the margaritas were tasty, they were $10 a piece, which none of the prices for margaritas were printed on the menu.  Spending over $60, we expected higher quality food.
