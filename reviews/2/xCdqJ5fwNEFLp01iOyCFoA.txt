Went there the other nite for dinner because we frequent the Matta's on Dobson. I thought it would be the same, however, it just wasnt the same experience!! I will not go back to this one again in the future. The menu is hugely shown when you walk into the restaurant, however, by the time i got up to the counter to order, I'd forgotten what it was I wanted. and with the line forming quickly behind-I felt horribly rushed and uncomfortable. It just doesn't seem to be a very easy system for ordering. Also, by the time I was done ordering for 3 simple items from the menu with drinks, it was over 35 dollars( and this was without the tip)

The lady at the counter was extremely friendly and helpful!!! That I appreciated! The restaurant was very clean. It was busy, however, I just don't feel I got what I should have for the price. I will continue to go to the Matta's on Dobson. :)
