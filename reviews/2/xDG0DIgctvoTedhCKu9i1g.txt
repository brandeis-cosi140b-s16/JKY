The only time I've ever seen guacamole the Ocho Loco's shade of dark green/brown was once when I left some guac in my fridge for 4-5 days.

It doesn't take a CSI lab tech to see that the Ocho Loco served us tasted and looked like it was at least several days old. Which is completely disgusting and 110% unacceptable.

Can't say much for the rest of their food...

The chicken in their chimi is the most bland, flavor-free anyone in our party has ever had. Anywhere. And the fact that it was dry did not help.

I could go on and on about how much everything else we ordered sucked. But I'll spare you. I'll just say that after 4 years and at least 2 dozen different Mexican restaurants in Phoenix, the food at Ocho Locos was the most disappointing.  

I'd give them 1 star but the service did not warrant it.
