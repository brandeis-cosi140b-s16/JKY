We got pretty bad service. We spent a total of two hours there and were only eating for 15 minutes, tops. The margarita was gross. The food was pretty standard Americanized Mexican food. I'm not really sure why this place has such good reviews. I'd try again, but this was my second go at it. Meh. Just, meh.
