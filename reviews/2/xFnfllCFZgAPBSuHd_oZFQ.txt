I really want to like this place because it's the closest Mexican food place to my house. First what I like about it; certainly the location. The interior has also been updated nicely too. The owners of this place are completely new; this location had previously been 2 other Mexican places before; one was good, one not so good. The women working the counter were very friendly and the menu is clear.
Where it needs improvement; the layout inside is sparse, they can not accomodate a family eating a meal here. A few small tables is all they currently have. I'd like to see a chips and salsa station; waiting for your food isn't as bad when you have a snack.
I've ordered breakfast burrito's here twice; the first time I ordered an egg & cheese. I got egg, cheese and potato (I'm not a potato fan). The menu does list potatoes in all the burrito's and I didn't specify "no potato" so I really won't ding them for that. So I decided to give it another try and this time I did specify "no potato" and I did get what I ordered, however, my tortilla is overcooked with several burnt spots (meh, I don't like a burnt taste to my tortilla). I do like the green and red salsa they serve (I mix them together). A good kick but not over the top.
They are open M-Sat, closed on Sunday. So overall, currently they have a "meh" 2.5 rating from me, however, I will give them another try and will update my review accordingly. I have to try some of the other foods as well. I think this place has potential to be a good one so give it a try; they are new and perhaps they will use the feedback they are getting from customers to make improvements.
