Friday night, no wait.  Our server was adequate, with other things on his mind than finishing his shift.  We god served, but boy did he exude how much he REALLY didn't want to be there!
The chips and salsa came out very quick.  There's some heat to the salsa, so I was content.  A lot of interesting things on the menu, that I think if they were executed well I would be willing to try.  But I got a combo of a "burrito" and a soft taco.  The taco was decent and unmemorable, the burrito was boiled flavorless chicken breast meat, wrapped in a tortilla (not the monster sized ones people generally expect with burritos, the regular size) and some kind of brown sauce on it.  Sort of looked like a crappy enchilada to me, but whatever I was hungry and yummy salsa and chips were not going to cut it.  Again no flavor to the side of rice AND I thought I was getting beans with it.  When he was placing our order, HE asked me if I wanted beans and rice as my side.  I asked if I could have black beans and he said yes.  My meal came with just rice.  I'm not really sure why he asked me if I wanted something and then didn't serve it...  I stole food from my mealmate and his refried beans (that no one asked him if he wanted or not) was definitely from a can... but flavorful.  The chile relleno I also stole a bite of was not very good either.  
If you want flavorful and filling Tex Mex, message me and I'll give you some better suggestions than this place.
