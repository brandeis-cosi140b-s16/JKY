I am so dissapointed in this Macayo's! I want to love it because they have a great street taco special on Thursdays (and it is within walking distance from my house) but service in their bar area does NOT exist! We went there twice and waited for at least 10 minutes before even being greeted by a server. Staff looked at us and most tables around us had food and drinks but for some reason both times we had lousy service. One of my friends with us made two trips to the bar to get drinks before our waiter brought our first one we ordered!  I won't return.
