Let me start by saying, I have never had a problem with Cafe Rio. Also the 2 stars are only because my dinner was good. However tonight I was at this location and the sign says they are open till 11:00 on Friday nights. However as we were finishing our meal at 10:05 the staff rudely yelled "get out" to us. Yes. I am serious. Funny that they kick paying customers out 55 minutes before closing and basically shut the restaurant down. Also saw a couple try to come at 10:15 and the door was locked and staff was in the process of cleaning up. If your sign says you're open until 11:00, then be up until then. I won't be returning to this location after being yelled at to get out.
