Work closet to here so I come here a lot and do a lot of my co workers.  I talked this place up.  Of course that was before they charged my $81.16 for carne asada fries that where not worth the ACTUAL price of $8.16.  I understand they messed up and the guy was really nice but the girl who was the cashier was very rude and condescending. She treated me like I was trying to steal the money they over charged me. Eventually I got my money back. They used up all my break and still charged me for the less then adequate meal.  WONT BE COMING HERE EVER AGAIN.  Also watch them they like to forget your drinks and special orders.
