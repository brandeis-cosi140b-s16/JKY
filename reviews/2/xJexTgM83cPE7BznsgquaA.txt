Called ahead to see if they had a roof top bar and to see what happy hour specials they had.  We were a large group meeting for drinks.  Well, no roof top bar but on the 4th floor you can take your drinks up just no bar service.  Not a bad view.  No happy hour specials but they had $4 beers & $3 tacos...everything else was a little pricey.  They had a decent selection on tap, our server was little clueless, the patio was kind of small, all in all nothing special.  

So now we are ready to leave and our friends rode their bikes to Tapacubo and when we were ready to leave one of the bikes was STOLEN.  The bike rakes were on the side of building in the parking lot.  NO CAMERAS someone came and cut the cable and took off with one of the bikes.  Our friends have been calling the hotel for a week to speak to the manager and not return phone calls.  

It's safe to say.....do not ride your bike here and we will never be back.
