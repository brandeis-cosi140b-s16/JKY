This place sucks!  Ordered some beers at the bar waiting on a table to open outside, bartender was rude.  Get outside, waiter ok, but guy who brought our food was rude when he threw it on the table.  Waiter never came back to check on us after the food was ordered!  Love this place in the Bahamas but not in Las Vegas... No fun here! Stick to Senor Frogs in the Caribbean ...
