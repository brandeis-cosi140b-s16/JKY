Not for large groups. We didn't get half of our drinks. Asked several times. We asked several times for silverware. We ended up getting it ourselves. Our food order was all wrong. Half of our group didn't get what they ordered. Good for those who got theirs right. Women's restroom had no toilet paper and no paper towels. While some in my group may go back, I will not.
