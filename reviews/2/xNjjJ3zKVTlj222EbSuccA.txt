I ordered the steak, chicken, & fried pork soft tacos (one of each), & a chicken quesadilla with fries. The tacos were tiny. They had the meat, cilantro, one piece of lime for all 3 tacos, & sliced radishes. Meh meh MEH! Out of all of that, the only thing that had any flavor was the fried pork taco. If a Mexican cooks a Mexican dish then yes I would consider it authentic. However, that doesn't necessarily mean it automatically tastes good. I've had better at a taco fresco.
