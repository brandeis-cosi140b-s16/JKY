This Roberto's is located on Rancho between Lake Mead and Owens, across from the Fiesta Rancho, inside the Sinclair gas station.  

Went today 8-12-15 at 11:15 AM for some takeout.  

 I've eaten many different menu items at many different Roberto's and they have all been a let-down.  I hate the mexican food in Las Vegas for the most part.  Where I grew up it is just completely different and better, IMHO.   

My co-workers drag me here every Wednesday because every Wednesday Roberto's has 99 cent chicken tacos.  They were pretty awful today.  All of them were greasy, bland, and the tortillas were like chewing on shoe leather.  Even dousing them in tomatillo salsa didn't help.  The lettuce was full of inedible stalk pieces.  Even the guy who cuts the lettuce there don't give a f**k.  

My co-workers will continue to make me go here every Wednesday so I'll have to find something edible here soon.  Maybe they have french fries.
