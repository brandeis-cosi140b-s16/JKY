This has been our favorite place to eat for the last two years but the few times we have been in, the food has really taken a dive.. Did you lose your chef?? The chicken enchiladas used to have nice big chunks of white meat... Last night's was the worst... Barely any meat & EVERYTHING IS TOO SPICY. My son could barely eat his beef tacos the meat was WAY to spicy... Even the beans were too spicy. Ridiculous! Please fix your chef ASAP or you are going to lose more very loyal customers!
