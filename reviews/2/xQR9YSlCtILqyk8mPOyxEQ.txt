I've driven by this place several times since it opened, and tonight I finally stopped in to give it a whirl.  

This place is located in the old Pancake Cafe building, which was a dine-in Pizza Hut before that.  The ambiance is pretty ok, and someone is definitely a talented painter when it comes to the murals.  

The staff is comprised of some young people who seem very friendly and are working hard.  The prices are average, nothing too outrageous.

However, none of these simple pleasantries make up for the incredibly mediocre food.  Our dinner was VERY underwhelming, and VERY small portioned.  They used melted Monterrey jack on all the dishes, which was oh so creamy and disgusting!  Yay!

Sun Prairie has yet to acquire a really good Mexican restaurant.  The sad thing is, I didn't even really care all that much for Taqueria Guadalajara down on Park St in Madison, however, in terms of flavor and presentation Taqueria blows El Patron away big time.
