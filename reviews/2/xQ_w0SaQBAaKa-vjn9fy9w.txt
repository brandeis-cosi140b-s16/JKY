Visit was 12/06 for lunch.  Upon walking in the place smelled like a backed up sewer. We almost walked out but were hungry so we just ordered.  We ordered a carne asada burrito, tacos and the cilantro fries with carne asada.  Tried to order fish tacos but they were out of fish?!?!  So we ordered the shrimp tacos and a chicken tamale. They serve complimentary chips and salsa.  The salsa is tasty. The carne asada burrito and tacos were good, the fries were soggy and overly greasy.  The shrimp tacos were nothing spectacular and the chicken tamale was flavorful and very, very spicy.  Last and the deal breaker on going back to this place. There is a salsa bar and we found a hair in our salsa. We told the gentleman who took our order and delivered the food about it and he was very non caring.  He didn't even ask which salsa. I had to give him the container that we served the salsa in to get it off the table.
