First of all, I love Chipotle, their ingredients, food, quality of food, etc. The people who work at this particular location were not unfriendly, although there seemed to be a major lack of communication between the first and last person in the assembly line.
My step son and I came in to get dinner to go for us and his dad. We explained to the first person that we had two free burritos or bowls of our choice with these little baseball card sized coupons. OK. So we get all the way to the end, the guy first doesn't recall me ordering my son's kids meal, then figures it out. Then he informs me I can only use one of these freebies  per transaction. Nope, doesn't say that, not even in the fine print,  but if you insist, then please just split it and we'll be on our way. They figured it out and we were on our way.
Fast forward to eating our delicious meal at home and my steak in my burrito was uber gristly, and then to top it off, I BIT into a piece of plastic. Someone clearly wasn't paying attention to what they were cutting and let a piece of some kind of plastic into my burrito.
Do mistakes happen? Yep. Am I likely to go to Chipotle again? You bet. This one? Not very likely.
No it's not the people, no it's not the food, it has everything to do with how complicated they made us redeeming the coupons, and the foreign piece of plastic I bit into.
