I've been to Laredo's three times now, and it just doesn't do it for me. The food is fine, but nothing to write home about. 

+ pretty cheap
+ lots of combo platters so you can easily mix it up
- chips/salsa not that good
- food is only average

Tonight I ordered the chimichangas. Instead of one big one, you get two smaller ones. Since you get two and your choice of chicken or beef, I asked for one of each. 

They brought my platter, and after I took a bite of beans I noticed our waitress hovering over me with another platter. She explained that "this one" had one of each, and that she was going to take the one they gave me and "just throw it away." 

A waste, because it wasn't really that big of a deal if they'd brought me two of the same; there was no price difference and I wasn't dead set on having one of each. 

As it turns out, I think they had originally given me what I asked for and took it away, because my replacement plate was two chicken chimis*. Food trashed for no reason, and potentially the correct order (or they plated it incorrectly, twice). 

*Their idea of chimichangas are really just bigger-than-average flautas; they were open-ended and have no filling aside from the meat. They also offer flautas, I wonder if they're just the same thing.

Other blips in service:
- served everyone but one person at the table, and took forever to finally bring them their food (soup)
- we had three kids with our group, and their parents explained they were going to split a meal between the three of them; the waitress didn't bring any extra plates, so we made "plates" out of napkins

So, yeah. The food there is fine, but the atmosphere (dark) and service (lacking) make it pretty low on my list of Mexican places in Madison.
