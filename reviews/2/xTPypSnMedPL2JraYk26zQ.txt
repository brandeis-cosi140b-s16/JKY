Definitely a "meh". The location is meh and the food is meh.

I used a Restaurant.com gift certificate here. I got it because it was so close to my house. Beware, this place is hooked onto a gas station. Although, I was not deterred from the location by that, some others may be though. It is also on skeezy Boulder Highway.

Their menu is huge including things like seafood, al pastor, chimichangas, nachos, carne asada fries, etc etc... you get it. Like most Mexican places around town they offer the full gamut of choices. 

I went with the tamale plate... the tamales were dry, meat was okay. Beans and rice were... beans and rice.

For my husband I ordered the carne asada plate. Your choice of flour or corn tortillas. Comes with a heaping mound of carne asada, guac, salad, rice and beans. Overall I'd say just okay. The amount of food is tremendous. This meal could be shared among three people.

I also went ahead and ordered a plate of nachos. Decided to go with the carne asada. It was a waste. There was so much guac and junk on it I couldn't even SEE any chips when I opened. Trying to get through to actually get a chip was pretty much impossible. I threw it out. Partially because I didn't care for it, partially because the serving was so huge I knew my husband and I would never finish it and it would be very doubtful we would reheat and eat it again.

There are a lot of Mexican places in Las Vegas.... I'll be heading elsewhere for my cheese/tortilla/meat fix.
