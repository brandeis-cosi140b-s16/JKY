So sad to see this place going downhill. Over the last year the hostesses and servers have really been downgraded. From waiting over 40 mins for a patio table with no one in front of us. We sat outside and watched another group simply walk right onto the patio, we asked the hostess about it and she stated they sat themselves. Once we were finally seated it took a server 15 mins to even greet us. They had brought chips but no drinks. After nearly 15 mins of waiting again we got up and left. It was simply ridiculous! I should mention too, this was middle of the week and we arrived a few minutes before 5pm. 
A time prior to that I had to ask a server twice for a refill on my water. After 10 mins or so I went to the bar myself to get my refill. Any time we sit on the patio the servers there are miserable! This is our draw to the restaurant too so it is rather disappointing.
Onto our food, it seems I can never get what I order. I ask for two enchiladas, one white sauce and one red sauce. One of each, not to complicated, I have NEVER been served exactly that. Then I am waiting on my food while the rest of my family eats. 
It seems like there is extremely high turn over for patio servers as well. Which would explain the bad service.
The only reason I gave two stars was the food. While it isn't right, it's always good and so are the alcoholic drinks. 
So sad to drive here from San Tan Valley for such disappointment.
