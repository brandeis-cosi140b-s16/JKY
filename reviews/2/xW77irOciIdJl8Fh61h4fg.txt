We started off with Mango Margaritas, the obligatory salsas and chips and a delicious (complimentary) tortilla soup.  Our entrees were Red Snapper Coscina - saut√©ed red snapper filet with a zesty tomato and cilantro sauce accompanied by rice and homemade refried beans. A picture of our entrees may be found in Webster's Dictionary under the page heading "Mediocre". We concluded the meal by sharing a caramel flan that was too dense, but very tasty.
