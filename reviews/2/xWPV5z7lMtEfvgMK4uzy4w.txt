I am a HUGE Zabas fan and have always liked it much better than chipotle.  I was so excited that this location was opening as it is less than 5 minutes from my house! I went there very often at first, but it quickly started to decline in quality. The chicken is very fatty and the beans rarely taste fresh. The lettuce is commonly brown and chopped way too large. I was beginning to be turned off towards Zabas completely. Until I was in Henderson visiting a friend and she suggested we get Zabas for dinner, so we went to the location on Silverado Ranch Pkwy and Maryland. It rekindled my love for Zabas! It was so fresh and the chicken had no fat! It was heaven in a bowl. 
So this leads me to believe that the Durango location needs to pay more attention to detail and to ensure that their ingredients are fresh and of great quality like the other locations. I really hope they start getting better because I would love to have Zabas back on my regular list of restaurants!
