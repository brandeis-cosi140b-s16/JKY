The burritos are ok. We had a chorizo burrito, a shredded beef burrito, and a carne asada burrito. Mine (shredded beef) was loaded with too much rice. The others were a little more balanced. For $9 a burrito i was expecting a more. I brought some Mexican friends with me and we all thought the restaurant was so-so. The place has seating but it's better suited for takeout.
