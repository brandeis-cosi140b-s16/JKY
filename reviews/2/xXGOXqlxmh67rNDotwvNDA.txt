First time here, but I had to write something.

-o- Carnitas, a little bland & on the dry side.  Good sized for street tacos, but, at $5.50 each, they should be big.  BTW, it is 2 to an order, so, $11 for an order.  I did the math.
-o- Salsa, a little too Old El Paso, heavy on the tomato, light on the, well, everything else. 
-o- Chips were decent, but not sure if from a bag or fried in store.  Not very salted which could be good if your blood pressure is high, or bad if you like flavor.
-o- Shot, a perfect Don Julio Anejo, but for $19, it had better be perfect.

I like the cantina look of the place, but not the mason glasses or plastic chairs.  Also, no draft beer. I did take a picture of my food, which had fairly decent presentation.

I typically am not harsh with my ratings, but $30 for 2 tacos & a shot while sitting in plastic patio chairs does not seem like smart restaurant-ing.  I suppose the truth hurts; it hurt my wallet for sure.
