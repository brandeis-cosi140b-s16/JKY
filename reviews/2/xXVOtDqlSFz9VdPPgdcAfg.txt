The ONLY reason this location gets 2 stars is because I love Chipotle.  

The ONLY reason I come to this location is because it's the closest one to my house.

Typical Chipotle assembly line of workers and food.  The service is horrible and they don't put much food in the bowls. I don't know how many times tonight I had to say "Corn, Sour Cream, Cheese, Guac and lettuce" Needless to say, after the worker put the to go lid on my bowl, I had to then tell her AGAIN she didn't put the cheese on.  Every single time I come to this location, I have to say at least twice "extra this, extra that" because they always put less than a spoonful in the bowl. Who knows, maybe at the other Chipotle's I've been to they're just generous. 

I understand that it's fast food, and I understand they need to get people in and out as quickly as possible, however I don't see a need for that considering every time I'm there, it's EMPTY.
