Ah, carne asada tacos... food of the Gods! Even Jennifer Lopez thinks so as she references TACOS in her song "Tacos y Burritos." The lyrics go something like THIS: "Burrito. Taco taco. Burrito. Taco. Taco taco. Don't think just because I got a lot of money, I'll give you taco-flavored kisses, honey. Fulfill all your wishes with my taco-flavored kisses.Taco taco. Burrito burrito." 

And taco flavored kisses you shall have in combination with an intense bout of watery diarrhea after you eat at Roberto's. No need to go camping for an episode of Giardia induced diarrhea... or are you a fan of vibrio cholera? Mmmm...rice water stool... kinda looks like the horchata in Roberto's most likely cockroach infested drink mixer. 

You know there's a medical school just down the block from here. I'm sure the med students would love to practice on you if you can't make it to the closest urgent care center! This place tastes okay if you're into lard flavored lard with a side of atherosclerosis. Definitely NOT weight watchers friendly. On second thought, maybe the colon cleanse might help me fit into the plus sized black dress that I recently got from Adele's Thrift Shop.
