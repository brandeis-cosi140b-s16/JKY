I visited the Old Town Tortilla factory about five years ago with fond memories so when back in Scottsdale tonight I decided to give it another go.

I should have read the Yelp reviews before going, my experience was nothing special. My waiter was friendly enough but the food was just OK. I ordered the Grilled Mahi Mahi Fish Tacos. Upon my waiters advice I order the "sauce" on the side because I was concerned about them being too spicy. What I received was three "chunks of fish" on three mini tortillas with four small condiment bowls containing the black beans, jalape√±o sauce, guacamole and a white cucumber sauce? It just looked kinda strange and the fish wasn't all that fresh. I didn't complain because my waiter only asked if I wanted dessert. 

Maybe it's me but it just wasn't what I expected. I think there are a lot of other good choices in Scottsdale.
