Service was very sad. I was ignored for 10 minutes when I came in, ignored for 10-15 minutes after being seated and had to find someone in order to pay the bill.
The food itself also left a lot to be desired. My chimichongas were over cooked and greasy and my friend's steak burrito was bland. Quite a disappointment, i doubt that I will be returning
