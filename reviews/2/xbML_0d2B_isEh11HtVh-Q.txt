I am a HUGE Cowfish fan so I decided to try out Chuy's next door as Cowfish was a little busy on a day when I was in the area. It was definitely just okay. The service was also just okay but I probably would go back if it had been better. A group of servers decided to sit at a table next to us and gossip for a while and none of them ever came over to check on our table. When the tortillas came out they were covered in flour. I inquired about them and was told that 'that was the way they were made" ...so when I went to eat the flour got everywhere. The flour definitely took away from the taste of my taco making it sticky in my mouth. I also had issues with the 'nacho' bar which was dirty and dusty so I passed on it. I went once and that was enough for me.  If you  do go I would suggest a sangria (It was sweet and Delicious) but there are definitely better places in Charlotte to go get food like this where you will get better service and a cleaner atmosphere.
