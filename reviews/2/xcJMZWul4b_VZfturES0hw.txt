You know Mexican food isn't going to be very authentic when you enter a restaurant and all of the employees are Caucasian.  Our server was friendly and bubbly, but she put my order in wrong and they forgot part of my wife's order.  The food was less than average, watered down Americanized Mexican food.  If you've had any of the similar chains in Charlotte like Azteca or Zapata's, those are much better.  The food at Charanda didn't taste much different than Mexican food I've made at home, and that's not saying much.
