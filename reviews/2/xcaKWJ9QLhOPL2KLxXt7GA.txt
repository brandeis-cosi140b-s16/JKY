My family's first experience here was WAY less than stellar. Table and booth were sticky and gross. Service was slow (waited for drinks, waited for order to be taken (a LONG time - at least 20 minutes) and waited for the food). We were the ONLY people in the restaurant at the time, and we had kids with us, which in most places, means that they try to help you quickly (if only to get you out before the kids start to whine). Two of our four glasses were dirty, smeared with something on the inside. 

Then, when the food came, it was lukewarm and my enchilada sauce was like colored water. No flavor at all, no body to the sauce. The waiter (owner? chef?) was VERY indignant and rude when I gave him my opinion and told him I didn't want the enchiladas. He insulted my taste and my experience with Mexican food (which is extensive). The rest of my family felt their plates were so-so.

I hope my next experience is better. Maybe I should try their food truck instead...hopefully that nasty man won't be there.
