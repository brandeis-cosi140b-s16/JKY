Like an old woman in North Scottsdale, this place has too seen its best days. 

This place was one great, but around the beginning of this year it started heading towards a slow death spiral. I had been consistently coming here near weekly for a few years. The staff and food were great. Always very consistent. Over the past six months or so, the familiar faces started disappearing and food quality went down hill. I kept saying "let's try it one more time, maybe it was a fluke."  However, it just keeps getting worse. The meals were once prepared neatly, now sloppy. Ingredients once in the salads, have now disappeared. 

I really love this place and I hope they pull it back together before it's too late.
