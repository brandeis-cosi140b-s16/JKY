We walked into this place to see not 1 but 2 hostesses just walking away from the hostess stand. It was several minutes before we were acknowledged despite the appearance of them being adequately staffed considering they weren't particularly busy. The chips and salsa arrived immediately -- salsa was good but chips were the greasy, stuck together variety. When I asked the waitress for recommendations (the menu is quite extensive) she replied, "I don't really like mexican food but...". Against my better judgement I ordered the arroz con pollo per her recommendation. I ate some of it, it was "fine", but I left about half on my plate and I NEVER leave food on my plate. It was also accompanied by steamed cabbage & other veggies which I found odd and have never experienced in a mexican restaurant before. 

I'm glad I tried it .. but am glad I didn't have to go out of my way to get there & I won't be going back
