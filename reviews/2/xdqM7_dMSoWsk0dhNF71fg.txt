You really, really have to watch what you order here.  In my experience there's been a 75% chance the food will be just short of inedible and a 25% chance it'll be awesome.  I had bad food twice at the Monroeville location.  Here I tried what Mad-Mex calls 'tortilla soup.'  It was tomato glop.  Then, just the other day, I tried the gobble-rito.  That was pure bliss.  I've been craving it ever since. Oh the paradox.
