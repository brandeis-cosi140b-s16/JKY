My girlfriend took me here on her suggestion and neither of us were very impressed. I got the green chile burrito and the meat was cold and tough and the lettuce was really wilted. We got take out, and I obviously didn't notice until I got home, so I called and spoke with the manager and he offered to make me another one and also gave me a free dessert. When I got in my car, drove back down and was made another one, it was also less than to par when I got back home. The red velvet cake I got was not very good either. The icing on it was like glue and the cake had a reminiscent taste of coffee grounds. Bizarre. I will say the customer service when I went back in was excellent, and the manger Will was great, but I sadly can't say that for the cooks in the back.
