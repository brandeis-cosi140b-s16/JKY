They are quick, well as quick as a Mexican restaurant can be via a drive thru window. I really enjoy the burritos here. I had the Fajitas once. A little disappointed that you pay so much and you don't even get a drink.. Only main issue I have with this place is every time I have gone here I get a side of Guac, just hoping that since its a Mexican restaurant it will one of these visits taste good. But it never does, Its almost like they keep it to long or use bad avocado's to start with because it always taste rotten. Has almost completely turned me off of Guac all together. But if you just get the steak burrito you should be good to go!
