Based on the reviews we were excited to eat here.  It's in a sketchy strip mall, I probably would have passed on this place if it was dark.  
The inside is tiny and seems not dirty, but not clean.  The gentleman taking our order was very nice.  He was interested in how we found out about them.  
We ordered and then waited and waited and waited.  I guess it's good the owners kids were watching the disney channel so my kids didn't get antsy. After a good 25 minutes wait (at least we know it's freshly made) we got our food. The kids mini burritos were just that,  mini and the 8 year old wanted more food.  But I certainly wasn't going to order another and wait and wait.  I got a chicken taco that was boring,  I could have made it at home,  and a vampiro that was the best thing I ate here and it was just okay.  My husband had Carne asada tacos and was not impressed as the reviews that brought us here implied we would be.  We also ordered chips and salsa, which was the most disappointing part of the meal.  I'm pretty sure they were bagged chips (the broken bottom of the bag chips at that) and store bought salsa.  
After the meal though was the worst.  My 4 year old daughter needed to use the restroom.   It was marked out of order, but one of the owners sons just came out.....and when a 4 year olds gotta go, well she's gotta go! Yuck! It was so dirty!  The floors were filthy and the toilet had a string hanging out where the handle should be to flush it. This is actually why I changed my original 3 star rating to 2.  
Over all,  not impressed at all.  Actually quite disappointed. We won't be going back there again.
