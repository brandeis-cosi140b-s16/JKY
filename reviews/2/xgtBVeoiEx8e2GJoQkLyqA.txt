Since this is a chain, there's no need to go into their food. Food is the same, like all the other locations.

There are still issues this location needs to work out such as the tortillas being dry. I don't understand why a worker would leave their post in the middle of line orders to restock items when there is a long line of people waiting and there are clearly enough workers in the back doing nothing who could handle this task, including what resembles managers who just stand and gawk at customers. There is no need to keep coming over every 2 minutes to clear tables. You guys watching us like a hawk to see if we're finished is creepy. Let's get with the game and shape up Hendotucky Cafe Rio!
