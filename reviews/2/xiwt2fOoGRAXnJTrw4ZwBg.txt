What a disappointment! After reading all the wonderful reviews and having eaten at the Phoenix location, I have to say this Chandler location is lacking. Had the Jade and Jerk chicken with jerk fried rice. Jade chicken wasn't horribly bad. It has an OK flavor but expected it to be 'more' I guess. The jerk chicken you can taste the spices and overall was ok. Neither will make me come back. The jerk fried rice was kinda hard. Maybe I got the last of a batch. My husband had the machaca and carnitas plate with refried beans and fried rice. DO NOT get the beans! I think the canned ones I had had more flavor than those. The machaca and carnitas were ok. May be good for a burrito or tacos, sadly we won't know as we won't go back. The snickernoodle cookie was good. I give it 2 stars for effort and because 2 out of the 2 meats we tried were Ok. Not sure if I just expected more from this place after reading all the good reviews, but then again they have a sign at the register that they give you free chips and what not if you show a good review on Yelp. Hmmmm
