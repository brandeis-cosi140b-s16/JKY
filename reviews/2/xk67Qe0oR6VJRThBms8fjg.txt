Disappointing.  The staff is great, the wait staff was very attentive, and the hostes sat us right away.
The food is bland and uninspired.  The chips were great but the "salsa" was chipolte like flavored red sauce.  It tasted strong of smoke with a little heat to it.  The table side guacomole was not very tasty and even though we ordered it with everything included, it didnt seem to help.  The tacos were wrapped in an oily shell and the meat was barely seasoned.  When I ate them the oil from the shell coated my tounge and sapped  flavor from the rest of the dish.  There should have been a acid to combat the oiliness, a fresh salsa would have worked well.
The restaurant had 4 separate familys with kids and two were extremely loud and obnoxious with the parents ignoring their precious offspring so the whole restaurant could endure the piercing screams of the  children.  This is no fault of the restaurant, however I have to ask, when did it become  acceptable to not take the kids outside when they act up?  Why do some people think it's ok to subject others to their poor or nonexistent parenting choices?
