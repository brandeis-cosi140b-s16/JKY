I've pre-ordered from here several times, and dined in just once. Just about every time we order ahead, our food is messed up in some way-- we paid for chips and didn't get them was the most recent mistake. It's not an earth shattering error, just annoying when you don't get what you pay for.

I can't quite figure out what the difference is between this location and all the others-- maybe the age or experience of the staff? It just seems a little inconsistent.
