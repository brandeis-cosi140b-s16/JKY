I had the three taco combo plate.  I was so excited because the tortillas were home made.   However they fell apart and were not that great.  The carnitas were NOT good.   The meat was not cooked all the way. Carnitas should fall apart and be well done not chunks of meat.   I Am a white girl and make better carnitas.   The beans were not good either.
