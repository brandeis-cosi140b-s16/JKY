Totally disappointed in the quality of their nachos. Their freshly made tortilla chips and salsa make this truck a 4 to 5 star establishment. The chips they serve as nachos are anything but fresh and homemade. They're cheap round chips that you can get from the dollar store. And within minutes they don't even resemble chips, as they turn into mush. Especially when they're slathered with gooey processed cheese sauce. Step up your nacho game and use the chips you actually make; THEN they'd be worth the $8.50!!
