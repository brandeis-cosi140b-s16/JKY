I give this particular location a 2 star, because of the service. The people aren't friendly and it seems to be poor management. Also the food didn't seem to be as well seasoned as other chipotle. 

Usually I like chipotle, and so does y boyfriend but if the people aren't friendlier next time we go we will leave, before we purchase. The service almost felt like we were checking out at a run down gas station. However we loved the outdoor seating, we brought out small dog out there to dine with us and it was nice.
