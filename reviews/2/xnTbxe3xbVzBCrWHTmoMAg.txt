If it weren't for the excellent service this place would have 1 star. The food was awful, the soda was watered down, and the restrooms stunk like sewer. I have eaten here years ago and it was very good, i'm very very disappointed in Bonito Michoacan. Also, the mariachi band, AWFUL and ANNOYING!

Note: try Frank and Finas on Grand Canyon and Flamingo instead, best Mexican food in town, IMO. And guess what, no mariachi band:)
