So this was my first time trying Baja Fresh with friends. It probably could have been a whole lot better. We went at around 8 pm I ordered a veggie nacho burrito with pinto beans and apparently if they run out of rice and hour before they close they don't make anymore. Plus they don't tell you that they don't have any more till after you get your food and ask why there was no rice in your burrito. 
Like I said it probably could have been better if I was not so upset with the lack of rice and the extra black beans that apparently make up for not having rice. 
But from now on when I want burritos I'm sticking with Roberto's or a not so commercialized restaurant.
