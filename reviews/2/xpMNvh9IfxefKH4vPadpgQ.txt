We have been coming to Gilbert's restaurants since back in 2008 when he had Tres Banderas.  The food and service has always been good but today the food was a disappointment.  It was apparent that the cooks had mixed leftover spaghetti sauce in with the salsa and the result was neither Mexican or Italian.  We saw a table of four get up and walk out as soon as they tasted it.  This is a poor way to save leftovers.
