Always on the hunt for a good Mexican restaurant. Elvira's is in our backyard so I figured I'd try it. Probably been better to go someplace else. Food and service was so so.The server never picked up any empty plates off our table and didn't refill the drinks. Not worth the money spent. Unless your car breaks down in the parking lot, I wouldn't recommend.
