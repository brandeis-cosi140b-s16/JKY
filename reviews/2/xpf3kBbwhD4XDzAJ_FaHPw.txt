I really wanted to like Qdoba. The place was pretty empty right off the bat, so bad sign there. Decided to go with the grilled vegetable burrito with black beans, brown rice, habanero salsa and guacamole. 

The first thing I didn't like was that the same employee who was preparing food was also ringing up customers. This is *never* acceptable. I don't care if you put gloves on, you shouldn't have an employee handling both currency and food. It's disgusting. Where was the manager? 

Secondly, my burrito was poorly wrapped. I ended up with more of a sphere than a cylinder. Furthermore, the foil didn't cover the burrito, so of course it fell apart as I ate.

Thirdly, I didn't order any dairy (lactose intolerant) but there was definitely a taste of sour cream in my food. Not sure if it was some sour cream that got spilled on the lettuce (noticed that on the line) or if sour cream was added to the guacamole to stretch the amount, or if that's just how Qdoba's food tastes. Concerning to say the least, but at least I didn't get sick.

Finally, the thing that bothered me the most, was that the food was SO, so oily. My mouth was coated with oil for an hour afterwards. I can only assume the oil was from the grilled vegetables, but it could have been from something else. Truly, I don't mind cooking with a lot of oil but this was over the top. I almost get the feeling they had an accident and drenched the veggies by mistake. You really don't need much if any oil to cook zucchini and squash. The water will release and keep from sticking.

The grilled vegetables were the thing I was most excited about at Qdoba, but quickly became the aspect I liked the least.

TL;DR oily food, poorly wrapped, gross handling practice. 

2/5 will not return.
