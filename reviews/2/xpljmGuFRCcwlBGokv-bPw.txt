Very average and generic food. Cheap and fast but honestly qdoba is better and right down the street. I was really looking forward to this place based on some friend's recommendations but at the end of the day it was not superclean cheap Mexican food. They also forgot half of my order for takeout. So I ended up with a couple of rolled tacos despite paying for a platter.
