I just want to start off by saying that I am not excited to be writing this particular review.
I was super excited to find that a new Mexican restaurant had opened RIGHT next door to my condo and even more excited to have received an awesome BOGO coupon. My fiance and I headed right over as soon as we got the opportunity and that's when the excitement was over.

First of all, with a name with "chips & salsa" in the title one would think that they would be wowed by the chips and salsa, but nope. The chips were average, similar to Fresh & Easy's brand and the salsa was not to our particular liking. I never expect to like everything, but a variety would be nice... none of that though. Moving right along to the entree stage... my fiance ordered the nachos and I, the steak fajitas. The nachos were sad, cold, the cheese was not melted and the chicken, flavorless. The fajitas were beautiful and the steak was tender, BUT the tortillas must have been bought at Albertson's and the rice and beans were blah. 

Overall the staff was super nice, but the food was not great and seriously lacking in flavor. I truly hope that things improve and the food gets better. I would love to have a close Mexirant that we could frequent, but for now I will keep looking.
