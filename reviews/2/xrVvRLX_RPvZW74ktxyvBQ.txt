I recently went there because I absolutely love Mexican food and I am always up for a new restaurant, especially Mexican!

I don't know if they are still figuring out their kinks or not, but the food wasn't that good. The meat was really dry and there wasn't too much flavor. Our table tried 6 different dishes and we all felt the same about the meat and flavor. 

The chips and salsa were really good but as someone said before in their review, they don't really give you a great amount verse other places that I have been before. 

The staff was friendly, but there was a good amount of errors which is completely normal for any new business. With time, they will hopefully get better. 

One thing to note is they do not serve alcohol, so if you are looking for margaritas this isn't the place. 

Overall, cute place and nice staff but pretty disappointing.
