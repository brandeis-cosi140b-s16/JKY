I'm not impressed with this location. My chicken bowl was still good though they were stingy with the quac (for $2 extra there's no need to be stingy). My biggest problem is that the restaurant eating area and bathrooms were dirty. There was no soap in the bathrooms and that makes me wonder if the employees are even washing their hands properly! I'll stick to the Chipotle on S. Eastern/St. Rose.
