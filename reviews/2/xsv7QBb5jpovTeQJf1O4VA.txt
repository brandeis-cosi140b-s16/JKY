First off I need to stay the service is awesome and the waiters are very nice. The gluten free menu is why we went. Daughter has Celiacs and the staff is trained and the menu is very well done in regards to gluten. that's is the only reason they get 2 stars. Im not going back however.

O.k. down to the food. Its awful, the food is OVER SALTED, its plain salty. The chips salty, the queso has to many sweet onions that overtake it, same with the stake quesadia,  the burrito and tacos are non edible. I ordered the steak burrito and did not eat it. picked the meat out, packet with undercooked rice and stale cold tortilla.. My wife ordered the enchiladas swissa verde and the chicken was boiled and dried out. It had a disgusting taste to it. I tried to take a bite but the smell made me gag.The beans are undercooked and so is the rice I'm sure to the casual chain eating diner they may be o.k. with this place but if your a foodie. stay clear. Oh and the beer is really cold which they got right. Summary staff great, food awful, beer cold.
