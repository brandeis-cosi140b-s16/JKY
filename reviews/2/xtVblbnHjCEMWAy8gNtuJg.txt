I had only been living in Scottsdale for a week or so and I wanted to find a decent Mexican restaurant and Tacos Jalisco looked like a cute little restaurant, and I decided to give it a try. The customer service is horrible; the cashier is less than professional, slow, zoned out, uninterested, and she doesn't even look at you. The salsa bar is a bit of a horror-taste wise and not to mention that the area doesn't look very clean. I give it two stars because I enjoyed their rice and I have to admit that their  breakfast burrito had juicy savory meat.
