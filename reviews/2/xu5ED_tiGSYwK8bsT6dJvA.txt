Entirely different experience than June's meal with my family at this restaurant.  We were the only people seated in the restaurant and it was clear the take out customers who arrived after our order was placed took priority.  I regretted adding gratuity on prior to receiving our order.  
After what seemed like a long wait for a two burritos, I bit into my shrimp burrito only to taste the cabbage and hot sauce.  The shrimp were fairly well distributed further down but the guacamole was isolated to one bite somewhere around the middle. The tortilla itself was one of the best I've had but who was constructing the burritos last night??
My horchata was just meh.  Mostly ice and the guy had to be reminded to bring it all.
I like the location close to our home and the fact that it is a small family restaurant.  It is clean with nice decor and a good menu but with so many other options in the area, after last night, I doubt I'll be back.
