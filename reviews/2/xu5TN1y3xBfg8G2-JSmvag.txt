Ordered a chicken burrito here and the gristly dark meat was so salty I practically went blind. I saw a huge bottle of liquid hickory flavoring behind the counter and I'm pretty sure they used the whole thing on the chicken. The black beans were good but all of the other ingredients were meh at best. Hot salsa looked like it came out of a Pace jar and had about as much kick as the lid. My fiancee had the fish tacos, with about the same luck. The word "inedible" came up.

Probably won't give this place a second chance.
