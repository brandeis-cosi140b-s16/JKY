The correct address is 20020 N. 59TH AVE .

I note this place is very new and still working things out and has potential so it's worth a try.

We tried several things here and I think some things are better than others.

From what I tried on my visit I think the Beef Asada and the Chile Verde are much better than the fish here. The meats were flavorful but terribly dry when we were here.  The fish from the fish tacos might have been a frozen product that had little flavor and it was kind of dry for fish.

They have a selection of house made sauces and a few condiments to add to your dish.

Customer service is not the best.

I ordered a side of Hot Carrots (.99 cents) before I noticed they are a free condiment. They should have told me it was on the sauce bar. But it made me a little more mad when the woman working there runs me an empty cup and tells me to fill it up myself from the freebie bar. If they are on freebie bar why charge me???? 


Like I already said they are new and still working things out hope your visit is better.
