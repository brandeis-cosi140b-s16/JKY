Ugh I really wanted to like this place. Unfortunately it doesn't work that way. My girlfriend and I have driven passed this place a few times and since she loves Mexican food and it was our anniversary, we decided to give it a try. Initial impression of the place was good, great music, nice atmosphere, we walked in with smiles. After a 5ish minute wait we were seated and received our complementary chips and salsa. Chips were good, salsa was meh. This is where the experience went downhill. To make it short, horrible horrible service, we probably read the entire menu 5 times before anyone showed up. Anyway, on to the food, we both ordered carne asada tacos and carnitas tacos. Let me say, I enjoyed the pork tacos, good flavor, nice and juicy, very good. The carne asada on the other hand tasted like I was eating a burnt charcoal piece of meat. Once our mediocre meal was complete, we decided to take a nap since we had plenty of time before our server checked up on us. After giving us our bill twice (really?) we finally paid and left. Ugh this location is close and we had high hopes but alas another restaurant bites the dust.
