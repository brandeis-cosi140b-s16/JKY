Let's be real. You're only here because 

-You don't really have options late at night in Terminal 3, but you NEED tequila.

-You're not from the southwest, so this is the best Mexican food you're gonna have.

Beer prices are off the charts, even compared to many other airports, AND the selection blows. I get margaritas because I feel less bad paying around $10 for those, and they're at least decent. 

Even the chips and salsa are lame...you don't get enough salsa and the chips are ice cold. I've endured the tacos as well and weren't impressed. 

The options are WAY cooler in other parts of the airport. I swear, Phoenix has better than this to offer.
