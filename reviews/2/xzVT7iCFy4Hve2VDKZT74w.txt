Our waiter was friendly, but very scatter brained. I had to flag him down for a soda refill. He forgot the side of sour cream my friend ordered. We had to ask THREE times for the bill. We were there for lunch so it was frustrating when we needed to get out of there and we couldn't get the bill.

As for the food....the salsa was bland, bland, bland. No spice, no heat. The chips were good though. Not too greasy. 

My lunch combo came with a taco. I couldn't eat it. Hard to explain, but the ground beef tasted off. The rice was good though. The refried beans were AWFUL. They were almost runny and did not look the right color at all. 

The decor is nice. It seemed really clean, too. 

I really don't think I'll be back. Maybe I'd have a margarita there. The reviews have mentioned that they are pretty good. It could be that the waiter was having an off day. He was friendly but the lack of flavor in the food was a real disappointment.
