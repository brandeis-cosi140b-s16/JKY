Qdoba is a pretty decent fast-food Mexican place. They care a nice variety of burritos and nachos and everything is pretty tasty considering it's a chain. However, sometimes their burritos are made very sloppily and they leave their nachos out too long and they get stale. If a burrito tears the really should re-wrap it instead of giving it to a customer and no one likes stale nachos. But the killing blow came when they got rid of the Molé burrito. It really set them apart from the competition and their molé sauce was amazingly tasty. Even the more "authentic" local restaurants in the area have not made a molé that tasted as good. They replaced it with a rather disgusting BBQ burrito that pales in comparison. Without the molé burrito there really is no reason to choose Qdoba over Chipotle unless you're looking for nachos in particular. Worse yet they keep very inconsistent hours when students are away. I made a trip to campus town especially to try them again and they were closed... so I went to Chipotle instead.
