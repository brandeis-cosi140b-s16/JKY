The service is ok, I usually go through the drive thru, always friendly. However, I live 15 miles away, but was the most convenient, and EVERYTIME I get home without checking the order, half of my order is wrong. I began to check my order before I leave and it's been helpful. But I shouldn't have to check their work. I am highly allergic to onions, I always order no onions, and they always put onions on my food, most of the time, it's looks like extra onions. Whenever I get tostadas (figure I would be safe with that), the beans are cold, not cooled off, but actually cold like they took them straight from the fridge. 
Long story short...I won't EVER go back to this location. I will drive the extra 5 to 10 miles to go to somewhere else. On average, I spend $20-30 every time I go, I'm feeding a family of 6. Their loss of my money...so sad!!!
