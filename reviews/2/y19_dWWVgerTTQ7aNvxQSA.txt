Because my family is pescatarian, we'll only eat vegetarian or shrimp/seafood Mexican food.  El Toro doesn't have much for us, and what they do have is standard rice and beans (meh) and gluey cheese stuff (ugh).  Much better choices for us in town are Maize (fish tacos!), Huraches Moroleon, and Wedge.
