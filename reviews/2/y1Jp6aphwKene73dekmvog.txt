I love Chipotle. The reason for the 2 stars is because of the staff. They seemed unorganized, inefficient, and unprofessional. Most of the other locations are very efficient and organized, especial around a busy lunch time. Before starting down the line, I saw 2 containers we empty (veggies & cheese). When it was my turn I had to wait about 5 minutes for them to make veggies. Normally, when you see an item getting low, it is being prepared and then placed in a clean new container. They were preparing the veggies and then poured them in the old container that had been empty in the filling station. Then one check out it seemed the person asking what else you'd like had to told a few times what you wanted because he seemed kind of spacey and not there. Overall, my first uneasy and weird at a Chipotle.
