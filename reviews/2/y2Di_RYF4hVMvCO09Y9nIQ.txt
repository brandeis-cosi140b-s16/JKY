Food was good, but service wasn't comparable.
The alcoholic drinks took a long time and the margarita was too thick (hadn't melted the entire time we were there), then the Bloody Mary was "eh" & I never got my extra olives. Seemed like they were under-staffed for the lunch crowd. No one appeared happy; they were polite, but not much enthusiasm. 
Probably won't go back.
