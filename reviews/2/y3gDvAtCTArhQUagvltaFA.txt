I came in for lunch with two co-workers. It's a darn good thing we weren't in a hurry because lunch took FOREVER. We sat at a booth in the bar area, the bartender came up pretty quickly to get our drink orders but didn't bring menus. I asked him if they had watermelon margaritas and his response was "I don't think so". So I asked if he could find out, his uncertainty immediately changed to "nope, we don't have that flavor".
I ordered my drink, which was supposed to be a normal size, not the world's largest margarita. Oh well, what's a few more dollars, right?
We sat without chips/salsa for quite sometime. 
Our lunch took forever and when it finally came, I wasn't impressed. It was probably the worst taco salad I've ever had. The chicken was luke warm at best. It lacked flavor. 
I had to ask for the guacamole I ordered when I ordered the salad. 
My friend's burrito looked NOTHING like the photo. It looked like it had those kraft single serve cheese slices melted on top. 

All and all. It's not worth coming back since I value my time and my taste buds. 

The peach margarita was fantastic though.
