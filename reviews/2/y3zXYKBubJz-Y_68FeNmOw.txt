I had just arrived to Las Vegas with my friends, and decided to eat at Diablo's Cantina. My wife and I had ate here before, the food and service were good, and we thought our friends would like it too.

This time the service was awful. We ordered chips and salsa, and never received it, the waitress never came by to check on us, we had to track her down instead. It wasn't busy either a lot of tables for vacant.
