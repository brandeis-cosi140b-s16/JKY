Sat down on a Tuesday last night around 6 not crowded outside. When the chips came I ordered a side of guacamole for my chips 10 minutes later the waitress starting taking are orders I said I am still waiting on my guacamole she said it was coming so I also ordered a side of jalapeno sauce for our dinner so 10 minutes still waiting on guacamole after 20 minutes I went inside and told them to cancel my guacamole I had already eaten my chips. Then 35 minutes later they brought out the guacamole and sat it on the table after we had already canceled. When my dinner came she brought out a side of sour cream not jalapeno cream sauce. And that point I did not say anything yes they charged us for the guacamole and sour cream. Then the manager brought a beer over to r table not to me someone else and said i thought you might be ready for another he said i did not order another beer. Which would have been great if were not getting ready to leave.
