I stopped here because another reviewer mentioned the tacos were "authentic." I'm from Austin and have traveled down to and eaten in Mexico, and I've never had such a greasy mess of a taco. Mexican food doesn't need to give you a heart attack to be good. The polite, fast service and very clean tables redeem it one star, but I'd certainly look elsewhere for authentic Mexican tacos.
