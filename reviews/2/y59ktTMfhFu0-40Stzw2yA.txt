Not much good to say about this place. 

House margaritas - tasted like diet lemonade and cheap tequila (and not much of it). 

Patron Perfecto - this was closer to the mark. Still a little light on the liquor. 

Chips and:
Guac- bland
Salsa - too ketchupy 
Cheese - can you say velveeta?

Nachos - hamburger meat, need I say more?

By far the worst Mexican food I've had in a long time, and the worst food I've had in Vegas ever I think. Service was good although a little on the slow side from the bar.
