We've tried this place out twice now. Great ambiance and location. Food is ok. The burrito is served naked. looks weird and uninviting to eat, but taste ok. They do serve large portions, but would be nice to have lunch size options and pricing. How much should you pay for Mexican food? Less than what they charge is for sure! They follow a long line of unsuccessful restaurants in that location and will might be jinxed! I would not recommend this place. Many other choices in the area! Save your money!
