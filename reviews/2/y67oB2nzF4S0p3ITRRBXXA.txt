Interesting asian/mexican fusion theme but taste is just ok. Great place to go if you just want to fill your stomach for a cheap price.

Best part about it is the snicker doodle they give you with the meal.

Ordering is kind of odd but nice that you can make anything a burrito, quesadilla or just eat it alone for all the same price.

Place is bare bones, with cafeteria type tables/benches.
