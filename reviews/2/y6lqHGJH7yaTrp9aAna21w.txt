We were the first to arrive at dinner time. We ordered the kids milk. 10 minutes later I got up and had to look for a employee.  They were out of milk  so had to go shopping to get more. Didn't tell us, didn't bring us chips id take our order. The meal didn't get better from there.

This is the second time we tried here, last time we said we'd never come back. Should have listened to ourselves.
