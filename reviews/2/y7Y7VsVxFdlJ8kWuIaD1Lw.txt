I am only giving an extra star cause our waitress was very friendly and helpful but I was not happy with the food. The plates came out super hot like couldn't touch hot but the food was lukewarm. And I also didn't like that we ordered our food and a few minutes later it was brought to the table like it was sitting under a lamp or something. I will definitely not be back here again.
