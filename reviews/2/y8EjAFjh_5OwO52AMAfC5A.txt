Came here based on the decent rating. Disappointed...I do have a slight shellfish allergy so didn't try and shrimp dishes but got the combo fajitas and they were at best mediocre. The beef was suspect. I did really like the salsa that came when I first sat. That was the highlight. 

The live music was IMO way too loud and unfortunately not good at all. I can appreciate a live band but unfortunately I just didn't feel it.
