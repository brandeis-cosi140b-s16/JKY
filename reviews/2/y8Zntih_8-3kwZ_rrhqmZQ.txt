I've been eagerly awaiting the arrival of this new restaurant, as it is in one of my favorite areas of town. All I can say is it conveniently located on "Bland Street" for a reason, because that is all my experience was: bland. I will note that all we got were margaritas, queso dip, salsa and chips, but I'll stand by the fact that you can usually tell a good Mexican food restaurant by it's drinks. 

The drinks were weak, and watered down. The queso dip tasted like something I would buy in the chip aisle at the grocers. The chips were cold, and the salsa had no kick. After such a disappointing first course, we didn't feel like we wanted to try a second course. 

The reason I'm giving it a three star review, is because I didn't try the food. It wasn't so disappointing that I would never go back. I would be willing to give it another shot in a few months when it isn't freshly open. 

It has such a good location, and a fun decor, I still have high hopes that this place will turn itself around!
