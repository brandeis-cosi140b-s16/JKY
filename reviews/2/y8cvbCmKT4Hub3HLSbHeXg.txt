Normally, this is one of my favorite restaurants to visit when I'm visiting family in Phoenix. Tonight was an exception. The mild salsa was very hot compared to how it normally is. Normally I almost drink it an put it on everything. Tonight, I couldn't finish one of the cups, and my mouth was left with a lingering burn. My mom who only eats mild salsa couldn't even finish a bite. The waitress said she had received several complaints about the salsa, but there was nothing she could do.  We asked for a Pico de Gallo which was available for an additional fee. The manager ended up comping the Pico de Gallo for us after we mentioned to him the extra spiciness of the salsa.

The waitress then forgot the best part of the meal, the cheese crisp and brought the food out. Granted, it did come out quickly and the goods was good. I am hoping this is an anomaly on the normally good food and service at this restaurant.
