I actually love Chipotle, especially when they're "attempting" to phase out gmos. BUT this location needs to have more workers on the Fridays and Saturdays when it's late. It gets busy and feels like I'm iniatially being pushed by the workers to order fast, but then made to wait at the 'second' station, while they help the next people. 
I mean geesh, at least get a decent number of staff. The place is certainly getting enough extra money out of us.
The one by my work is a lot more generous. The manager of this place can also be rude. I once went in unsure of what to order and decided I did not want anything as my boyfriend stood in line to get his own. The manager went from extremely helpful to suddenly offended and too important to notice us once I decided not to order. How childish. I used to go there all the time, he could have  remained courteous to regulars. But his flip flopping attitude isn't the whole problem.
What I loathe is this location and a few others are price gouging for guacamole. I ALWAYS get the veggie bowl with guac at no charge. But this place is suddenly charging (while the one by my work isn't), so I definitely feel gipped. Especially, when I have no interest in their new Sofritas -which are meh. I feel like the new tofu option is just a way to justify the extra charge for veggie bowls and frankly, it's not adequate. I tried it and I go without it. To make this particular Chipotle seem even more stingy, they now claim they are "not supposed to"  give out a side of cilantro. Really! I just gave you the extra $1.59 and now the cilantro is suddenly valuable too!? Puh-leeze. But I'm sure they will charging for herbs soon. I will not go to this location anymore; I could ignore the manager but not the attempt to nickel and dime us for every bit of food-even freaking seasoning.
