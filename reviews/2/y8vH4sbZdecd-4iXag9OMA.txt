I am from the SF Bay Area, hence, i have lots of excellent choices in CA.  This place is ok.  I probably wont be back although not bad.  I  had the Mexican salad and that was good.  The beef taco was good but nothing special.  I guess that somes up the restaurant good but nothing special.  Chips and salsa ok at best.
