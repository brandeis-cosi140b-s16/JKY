I suppose it depends on what you come here for. I enjoy coming here for an alternative to mexican for something a bit more healthy. i like the grilled mahi mahi with a side of fresh fruit. If I'm going to really eat mexican out I would not come here as the fish tacos are a bit on the bland side. Nothing is really spicy.
