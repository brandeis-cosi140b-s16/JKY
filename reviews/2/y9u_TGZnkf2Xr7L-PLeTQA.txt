I've come to realize that I like Frank and Lupe's patio atmosphere far more than the food.  The food quality is average. The service still, as Cartman would say, suck balls.  If anything, it's gotten worse.

Went there for dinner and watched the bartender/server oscillate between watching telenovelas (in 5-10 minute stretches), chatting with the busboy (in 10-15 minute stretches) and picking his teeth with his bare fingers (in solid 5-10 minute stretches).  When he wasn't busy with any of those productive activities he occasionally remembered that he had 4 tables with guests waiting for service . . .

I think we're going to start looking for a new great patio that has mediocre Mexican food.
