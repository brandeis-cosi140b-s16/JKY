Well where do I start?? I am a huge fan of pretty much any good Mexican food, but this place was a huge let down. I went with my fianc√© she ordered the street tacos and I decided to try the burrito because I was a little hungry, we also decide to order some chips and guacamole. The portions were small and overall very over priced. 

Here is a breakdown on the food. 

Guacamole and chips- the chips were stale and the guacamole was not that good. Not to mention the portions were small. 

Burrito-very small but had ok flavor 

Street Tacos- very small with a very limited about of meat on each of them not to mention that the meat was cold and lacked real goof flavor. Only one taco was good I don't remember which one other then it had pink meat. 

Don't plan on going back.
