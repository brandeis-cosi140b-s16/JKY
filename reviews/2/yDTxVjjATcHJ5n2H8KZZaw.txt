The first visit was awesome. The service was alright, but the food made up for it. I ordered their shredded beef soft tacos and couldn't get enough. I craved them for a few weeks until we finally went back. 
Our second visit was nothing like the first. The waitress recommended crunchy tacos, as it was a new option, so I took her up on it. We waited over an hour and a half (not an exaggeration) outside, while being ignored by our server. The restaurant was slightly busier than the last visit, but there seemed to be adequate staffing. A very large party arrived 30 minutes or so after we were seated and long forgotten. They were seated outside next to our table and tended while we were ignored longer. 
The food finally arrived and tasted awful. It was a tasteless, flavorless fried mess. The freshness of the soft corn tortillas was burnt away with the new method. 
We weren't offered an apology for the long wait and left without tipping our server. I personally didn't want to pay for the meal at all. After waiting over and hour and a half to be served a simple meal and then having it taste the way it did, we haven't been back. 
I'd like to think it was a fluke because I'd really enjoy those soft tacos again, but I've found that Filiberto's Soft Shredded beef tacos are very comparable and just as inexpensive.
