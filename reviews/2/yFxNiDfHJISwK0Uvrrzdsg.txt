I really love this place, their food is sooo good.  But the service last night was not so good.  It took them 5 minutes to seat us, then another 5 minutes to wait on us by the time we ordered our food we missed happy hour.  We asked the waitress if we could still order off the happy hour menu and she said no.  It took her forever to bring our drinks finally out and then when our appetizer came out we asked about the cornbread, she said she would go get that.Then when we were finished we didn't get our bill in a timely manner either.  Ughhhh!!!!!

Normally the service is really good but in this case it just wasen't.  Really disappointing last night.
