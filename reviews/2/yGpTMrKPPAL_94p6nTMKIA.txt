I'm a huge fan of this place I used to go two or three times a week. Now that they have expanded their restaurant the food does not taste the same the prices have gone up and the burritos have gotten smaller. Very very disappointed I would go as far as to say heartbroken  definitely one of my favorite spots in the valley and I don't know if I'll ever go back.
