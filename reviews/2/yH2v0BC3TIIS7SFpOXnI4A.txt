A few of my family members really like this place.

I'm not really too keen about getting food there again.

The food there is heavy.. and when I say heavy, I mean HEAVY.  I'm pretty sure it's that way because it's so damn oily.

Don't expect to be productive after you eat there.  My wife brought me lunch from there and afterwards, I felt like I ate an anvil.  That food sat in my belly like a couch potato.

It's kind of like Filiberto's.. you take a couple of bites, and then something in your mind clicks and suddenly, you feel the urge to locate the nearest bathroom.
