Man, the food has really fallen.  We have been here a number of times and loved the food, left very good reviews and wanted to go back.  Went today and talk about dry bland shredded beef tecos.  Polite young guys running the place but no freakin salt or seasoning and over cooked.  Whoever made the shredded beef, wake up and add salt and pepper.  Didn't even finish my food and am disappointed.  Won't be going back anytime soon.
