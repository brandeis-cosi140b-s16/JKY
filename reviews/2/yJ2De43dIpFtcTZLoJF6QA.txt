Why close far before your listed hours? So frustrating....they have a sign on their door that clearly says "NEW HOURS" mon-thur until 9 pm, fri-sat until 10pm and sunday until 8pm. We showed up at 8:15 pm on a monday and all the lights are off, chairs stacked on tables, totally closed. We like the food but if you are unreliable and don't even stay open during your listed hours it's so frustrating and unfortunate. We've been more patient about other shortcomings other people have mentioned that we have also experienced (mopey employees, soda machine being out, cleanliness issues) because there are always going to be growing pangs and a learning process with any new place, but at this point it just seems like bad business practices, especially for a newer establishment.
