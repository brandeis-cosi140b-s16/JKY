This store is in the old Churches building close to home on the SE corner of Power and McDowell.  Had a breakfast bacon burrito this morning and had good service through the drive through.  I added potatoes to the burrito but it stilled lacked flavor (did have a lot of bacon in it and that didn't help either).  I added two of the hot sauces and it was enough.  This location has been open for about 2 years now, seems steady busy.  Food and a drink for $7, wasn't worth it.  Had no taste...
