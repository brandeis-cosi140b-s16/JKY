I guess I'll never know from personal experience if Maria Maria worked out the kinks.  We stopped in this evening and were told it would be 10 minutes for a table.  Not a big deal, but why a wait at all?  There were at least 10 empty tables in view that were ready for seating.  During our wait, we noticed the other couple ahead of us finally get seated at a table that had been empty from the time we arrived.  What the hell is this about? Make your customers wait so you appear busier and more desirable than you actually are?  No thanks, we left.
