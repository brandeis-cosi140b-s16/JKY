I have to say I agree with a couple of the other reviews.  I SO want to like this place - the atmosphere is amazing, but the food and service will keep me away.

Went there once again the other day and sat at the bar as it was still early enough to get a seat.  Waited about 10 minutes for someone to take our drink order - not a huge deal as we were there to relax and in no hurry - but at Hillstone someone would have taken our drink order in 1 minute. 

Could just be me, the music was too loud and too catering to a 20 something crowd.  Doesn't fit the cool vibe of the space and sounds like the bartender or dishwasher selected the music.

Ordered 3 small plates.  Calamari was cold.  Shrimp dish with toast was best and toast with mushrooms could be SO much better.  Overall, below average.  Ordered desert - chocolate torte - which was impossible to eat as it felt like it just came out of the freezer.  It needed one hour of defrost time.  To his credit, our server took that off our bill (without our asking, so good job there).

Overall, atmosphere is great.  But, that's it.
