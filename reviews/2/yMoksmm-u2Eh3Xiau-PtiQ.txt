Ive had experiences at different locations that vary greatly
This store, closest to where i live, let me down tonight

I love Wednesday Chicken Tacos but the customer service, or I should point out, LACK of customer service is reason for less than good rating

The whole point of being in the restaurant business is to satisfy the customer 

Tonight, after ordering, one of our items was made INCORRECTLY . So I take it to the counter and what does the cashier say?? "You ordered it wrong, next time you'll know better..." Seriously??
And these are the people that want $15/hr??? Sadly, a statement of whats wrong with this entitlement society

At least Taco Bell will remake the item. Guess you lose another customer, Roberto
