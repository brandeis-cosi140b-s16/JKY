Saw this place on Triple D and decided to try it because I had just moved to the area. I had chicken enchiladas and it wasn't great. They were very bland and just not as good as other enchiladas I've had over the years. The rice and re-fried beans were average. The prices were average but considering how bland the food was, still overpriced.
