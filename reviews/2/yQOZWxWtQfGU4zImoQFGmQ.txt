Not really feeling this place. Went for a Friday happy hour. Firstly, I'm not a fan of the "order at the counter, we'll bring it to you" thing. Am I at a sit down restaurant or a Cafe Rio/Chipotle? The menu felt confusing and was ridiculously limited. It basically is a Chipotle with booze, except the food at Chipotle is way better. 

I had the carnitas salad, which consisted of romaine lettuce, pickled onions, carnitas and some awful pork rind thingies. Nothing particularly interesting, inventive or good about it. The food came quickly and the margarita was fine. 

Another thing that bugged me was one of the giant TVs was tuned to a network evening news program. I don't know about you, but when I want drinks and fun evening out, seeing various dramas/tragedies being broadcast doesn't exactly add to my experience. This was a one and done for me, I won't be back.
