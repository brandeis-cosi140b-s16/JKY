We went with a group of eight on a Saturday night. I expected the service to be somewhat slower, but we were there for THREE hours!  It was one of the worst dining experiences ever. The staff was not knowledgable, and management was apathetic when we expressed our concern. Two of the three hours, we sat waiting for our food from the kitchen, and filled up on chips and salsa. Their menu is extremely limited, and not that flavorful when you get your entree. There are definitely better Mexican restaurants nearby that I would highly recommend that are not overpriced and sucky on service!
