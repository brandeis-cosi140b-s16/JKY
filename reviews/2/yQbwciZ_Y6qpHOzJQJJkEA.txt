The free Chips and salsa were the best part of our meal. Ordered the tortilla soup and Pollo fundido and everything came out room temperature.   Twice our server asked is if we would like more chips and salsa, twice we said YES and we never did get them. And dont sit on the patio, you will have to fight of the flies.
