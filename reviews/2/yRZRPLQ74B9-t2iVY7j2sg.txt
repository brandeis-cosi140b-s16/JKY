This would be a 1 star place but I'm rating them in comparison to other airport spots so they get an extra star.  

My flight got delayed and I was looking for a place to get a beer.  This was the closest option.  I sat at the bar and ordered the chicken quesadilla.  The tortilla was not fresh and there wasn't enough cheese in it.  

Oddly, they don't serve chips and salsa so there's nothing really to snack on if you just want an appetizer.  Overall I'd say, get the tequila and a beer. Avoid everything else.
