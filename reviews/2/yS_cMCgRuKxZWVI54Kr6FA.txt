Went to Villalpando's with some friends because they like this restaurant.  I had no idea where it was, until we got there.  It's located at Chandler Blvd just east of I-10.  Years ago, it was a sports bar filled with TV's, but they are long gone.  I don't eat anything green (except peas), so finding something to eat there was a chore.  I normally have a red chili beef burrito when I go to a Mexican restaurant, but they only had green chili.  I ended up eating a bean and cheese burrito, which was very good.

I agree with the other reviews of this place... it's not bad, but not great. I'm sure my friends would disagree.  They love it.  The prices are fantastic.  For the beer drinkers, no beer on tap.  Only bottles.  Unlike the sports bar, I hope they survive, because the place was dead on a Friday night.
