El Hefe looks like a good place and the decor is fairly hip... Although it does seem out of place on Mill and better suited for Scottsdale. At first glance the menu seems tasty and original, but upon first bite you quickly realize that it's all about appearances because the portions are small, expensive and aren't huge on flavor.

The bar is lame because they aren't even trying to highlight our amazing local breweries here in phoenix... The wait staff however is nice so that part is good.

Overall, it's better to check out a real pub like Rula Bula.
