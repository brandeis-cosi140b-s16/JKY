Maybe it was better when I was a kid.  Ultimate burrito was just a few slices of steak and sliced bell peppers and onions.  There are better places and maybe theyes need to update menu.  I would rate chipolte burritos better and filaberto tacos better.  They need to update something.  Espos two miles south has little decor but much better food.  I wish Garcias luck.  I want to be a fan again.
