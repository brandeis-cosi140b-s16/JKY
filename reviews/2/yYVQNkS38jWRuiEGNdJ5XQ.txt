I like Chipotle, but they've got to make some changes for my tastes.

First, the salsas are lacking.  Can a brother get a salsa selection without red onion?  Red onion smell like Sasquatches cornhole, I cannot STAND those things.  Maybe lean back towards more traditional salsas like tomatillo or perhaps roasted Hatch.  Oftentimes, I'll order a burrito sans salsa and just add my own at home.

Secondly, what the hell is this, Subway Sandwiches at lunchtime?  I know speed is of the essence but haste makes waste, baby!  If you arrive at Chipotle at a busy hour, they're going to make a murderous mess of your burrito.   Split tortillas, tortillas soggy with the liquids from the beans, cross-contaminated filler (ooh!  Look!  It's a chicken-barbacoa fusion!)

Fast casual, I can appreciate.  Food made screamingly fast can really wreck the end product so please, I know you need me at the cash register and out of your way for the next customer, but for the love of Grog, take your time and let's work on "First Quality".

And let's have some traditional salsa options.

Red onions suck.  Even the guacamole has an overabundance.
