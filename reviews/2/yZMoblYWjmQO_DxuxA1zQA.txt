I don't know why so many people are raving about the food at Dos Reales. My roommate are crazy about this place! I think the food is just ordinary. For some reason, their food tastes the same to me, whether it's chimichanga, burritos, or tacos. I had their temales and they were overly cheesy to a point where it felt gross eating it. Yuck!
