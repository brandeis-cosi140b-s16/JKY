Over priced and everything costs extra. I ordered 2 enchiladas for $10 plus $1 for sour cream and I decided I couldn't afford the guacamole.  I asked for a side of chips - $5?! No thanks. The manager (older Hispanic man) was aware of my request for a small side of chips and pretended not to see or hear me.

For a food court, not a good deal. On a more positive note, the food tastes good.
Older Caucasian woman was the only nice server.  Ugh!
