I recently ate here with my old boss from many years ago.  Food was ok and margaritas were "different" as expressed by my former boss from Austin, TX.  My margaritas (and I had several different types) definitely tasted different than any of the many margaritas I've had all over the place (not bad but maybe just weak and lacking tequila with certainly a "different" kind of flavor than I've ever had before).  

The food portion size was very large but the wait staff got a bit irritating with constant upselling (we had a new wait staff being trained by a manager and the manager was over the top exaggerating the upsale).  We had ordered queso but thankfully with all the focus on training the upsale they forgot about it and my old boss and I were full to bursting.  The menu descriptions also seemed to be a bit different than what we received but we just drank more and let it slide.
