Go for the brilliant graffiti art on the rear exterior, and stay for the churros for dessert. Everything else in between is luke warm mediocre. 

It's been a while since we last ate here, and now remember why. Food and drinks are very expensive for what you get. $13 table side guacamole is ridiculous. They used to actually cut open the avocado in front of you, now someone puts a bowl of chopped avocado and the waiter adds toppings and barely mixes. Really? $13 for this?

The $13 margaritas were not that great. More ice than anything. 

What I failed to remember up until the first bite was how items were luke warm at best. The squash veggie side was barely warm, as if heated in a microwave. The enchiladas suiza was hotter, but I could tell the ingredients weren't just made. The chicken was dry. Flashback to the two previous visits. My dinner companion's potato side was also barely warm, and the poblano plate was luke warm. Considering you are paying high prices to sit in what once was a store front in a mini mall, it adds a sour and queasy note. 

The churro dessert was delicious. I feel that once you order, the service drops off. As the hype built over the years around this place, the owner and management have figured out how to exploit it. After $120, had diner's remorse when leaving. 

Suggest going for HH and dessert. Then go somewhere else for the full meal. Sorry Barrio!
