No thank you. I'll tell you straight out I will not be back here again. When it comes to mom and pop taco shops like these, it's all in their meat and how well they marinate it.

My boyfriend and I ordered 3 carne asada tacos and carne asada fries. The meat was tasteless...even when I drenched my taco in the red AND green sauce.

The carne asada fries was nothing worth mentioning. It was boring and tasteless.
