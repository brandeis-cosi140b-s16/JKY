My first review for this restaurant, although I've been eating here for the past 2-3 years. They took over from an Italian chain. When they first opened, everything was cool: attentive, friendly, even enthusiastic servers, good food and beer, good prices. Gradually, it appears that the managers/staff who originally opened the place have moved on. The result has been (in general) inconsistent service and food. 

There are still a couple of great servers there, and if you get one of them, you'll have a pleasant experience. This past week, I ordered a chicken burrito for part of my meal; the burrito itself was fine but the sauce tasted disconcertingly like Ragu spaghetti sauce. (it should be noted, though, that they have the best salsa in town that I've found so far!) To top off the general decline, they raised their prices a couple of months ago.  As time passes, I'm finding fewer and fewer reasons to go back. Aside from hiring more enthusiastic servers, the one thing they could do to get back on track would be to get a little inventive with the menu. There's really nothing there that's different from any other Mexican restaurant in town, and what is different does not taste distinctive. How about getting back to basics -- street tacos, tortas, tlayudas, tostados?
