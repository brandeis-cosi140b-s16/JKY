I was pretty displeased with service here during lunch time the other day. While I know it gets hard to keep up with orders when it is so busy, the worker barely put anything in my naked burrito bowl and nothing looked fresh. It tasted bland and made me never want to come back to Qdoba again. The tortilla soup was alright, but it's pre-made, so that's a given. Meh.
