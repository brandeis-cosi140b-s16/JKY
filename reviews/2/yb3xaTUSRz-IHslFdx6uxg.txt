This is not Tex-Mex.  Being from Texas, I judge this type of cuisine rather harshly.  Regardless, Moe's Southwest Grill would fall short in the mouths of many yelpers.  I ordered the Joey Combo, which included a Joey chicken burrito, queso & chips, and a drink.  The chicken and rice in the bland burrito was so dry even when combined with salsa.  The queso was a big solid lump of white cheese.  The salsa station was a mess.  When I picked up a to-go salsa container, I did not expect it to be all over my fingers.

You are better off going to Chipotle if you want a better burrito.
