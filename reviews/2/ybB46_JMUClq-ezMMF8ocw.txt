I have come to Manuel's multiple times over the last 5+ years, as it's conveniently close to home. Not our 1st choice when seeking Mexican, even though it's nearby. The food is OK if you are looking for your basic, inexpensive Mexican fare- it is not highly seasoned and many items taste over-salted like they are fresh out of a box/can. The margaritas are so sweet we don't even order them anymore- tried them a few times over the years (disappointing, as the pricing is good!) - just tastes like your typical pre-mixed margarita with flavored syrup. The carnitas here are pretty good- a huge portion of food! All of the food portions are very decent sized. My biggest issue with this place is how DIRTY it is...way too much crap "decorating" the restaurant, and most of it is caked in dust...gross. WHY?? Management, please know you have customers wondering: if that's what the restaurant looks like, how clean is your kitchen...?!?! No bueno.
