As a Californian I feel it's unfair for me to review El Toro, which may be just fine for Champaign but would be utterly crushed if it were located anywhere near San Francisco.  The food wasn't very authentic and I'm not even sure this was as good as a Chevy's.

THE ICKY:
- The salsa was barely better than salsa you get out of a jar from the supermarket.  Where are the tomatoes?  The chips taste similarly store-bought.
- The guacamole had no personality... maybe they couldn't get fresh avocados?
- The cheese inside the quasadilla tasted really off.  Were they using American cheese or something?
- The tacos from head-to-toe were just not great, from the shell to the meat.

THE GOOD:
- I did like the horchata.  :)
- Despite the ickiness, I left pretty full, so large portion sizes with reasonable prices.
- It had the ambiance of a taqueria, but was cleaner.
- Service was fast and efficient.
