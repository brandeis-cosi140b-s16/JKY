This location really is below the standard that chipotle is known for.

This place frequently is out of chicken steak etc at random times. Poor management. 

Tonight they were out of brown rice and chicken. I didn't care but several customers did. 

My burrito was ok, but the steak was dry and a bit tough. I would encourage others to avoid this location.
