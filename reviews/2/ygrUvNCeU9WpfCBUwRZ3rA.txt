Just ate here last night..The food is ok. The environment is nice, however, the food is not up to to par with the environment, much less the price. If you are looking for real good and tasty Mexican food, this is not the place. I had Veracruz enchiladas and were not quite what I expected or was looking forward To having. I will say that the chips and salsa are really good!  If you like a sweet taste in your food, I think this is your place. Personally, I have experienced way better Mexican food, in other restaurants here in the valley at a much more less price :)
