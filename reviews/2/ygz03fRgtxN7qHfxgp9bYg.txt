Is it Authentic? - yes.

But...I wanted to like this place and I can't. Maybe because I'm not a fan over-salted greasy sonoran food with the loud speakers from an over-amplified one man band 5 feet from my ears while I'm trying to hold a conversation. The indigestion was not a pleasant souvenir.

If I want very loud music, I'll go to a concert but it's not appropriate at a "family restaurant".  Put it this way - my (almost) 4 year old was on the edge of tears because her ears were hurting from the crappy music.  

Next time I'm here and want Mexican food, I think I'll just go to Teakwoods Tavern in the same parking lot and order Nacho's and a bucket of Coronas instead.
