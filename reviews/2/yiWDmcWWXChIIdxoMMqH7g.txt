Just 'okay' is the word that comes to this restaurant.  I tried it for the third time over the weekend and I told my neighbor that I would never go back.
Lacking spice and just good food overall. The service isn't stellar either.  If you're looking for good Mexican in Charlotte you're better of heading to Don Pedros.
