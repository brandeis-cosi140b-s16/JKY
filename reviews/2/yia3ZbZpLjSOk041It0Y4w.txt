The drink machine was broken which is no big deal, but when we got bottled drinks the coke was expired. The kitchen didn't look like anything had been made in it recently which made me question if my food was fresh. I also noticed a couple staff members being unclean in the kitchen. Overall just felt like the place wasn't well kept and I already don't feel well. Not sure if I would go back.
