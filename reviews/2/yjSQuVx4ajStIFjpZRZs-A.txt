First of all I think it is extremely amusing when the whitest people in Las Vegas rate a mexican restaurant and use the words "very authentic" as if they knew what that meant. This place is arguably one of the worst mexican restaurants that I have ever eaten at. I ordered the Camarones Empanizados (Breaded Shrimp) and I could instantly tell that they were frozen bite sized shrimp. The place is extremely small and covered with tacky "mexican" decour, which if you are really mexican you will find very clich√© and untrue. They also don't take debit/credit, oh and half of the things that we tried to order were unavailable.
