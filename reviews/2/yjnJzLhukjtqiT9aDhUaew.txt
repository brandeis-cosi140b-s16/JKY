Food was Meh. Didn't really think anything had much flavor, but I choked it down on the plane as a necessity. So kind of pricey, even though it's a big burrito, cause it's a big mound of flavorlessness. I didn't even finish mine, couldn't choke it down. Just ate enough to not be starving on my flight home.

But what I absolutely hated was the rip off of "Seinfeldisms" on the menu. What the hell does Mexican food have to do with Seinfeld???? I don't think I ever saw them eat Mexican food on the show ever!! 

But it was really the STUPID names of everything that made me really HATE ITt!! SO MUCH THAT I DIDN'T WANT TO EAT THERE. If our flight hadn't been delayed an hour+ I would have not bought food, I only did so out of absolute desperation.
