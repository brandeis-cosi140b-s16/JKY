I was invited to this place for lunch and they were serving a lunch buffet. The food buffet didn't look so good or fresh. At the same time, it wasn't really a buffet either because there was a lady serving it. Anyway, I tried the chili relleno, enchilada, rice, bean and a carne asada taco. All of it tasted like frozen food being microwaved, not to mention the cheese on top of the enchilada was burnt and had a weird taste to it. 

My tummy hurt as soon as I finished tasting these items. So gross. I should have eaten just the chips and salsa only. Don't know how much the lunch costs but really, who'd pay for this?
