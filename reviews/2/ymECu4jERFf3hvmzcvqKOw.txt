Not too impressed with this place.  First of all, the prices are too high.  $3.60 for a taco that has guacamole?  And for the amount of guacamole I did get, I can't believe I had to pay extra for it.

The menu was incredibly limited.  Other than beef, they offered no chicken or shrimp dishes.  Very odd.   And no fountain drinks.  And they were slow.  Don't believe all the 5 star reviews.
