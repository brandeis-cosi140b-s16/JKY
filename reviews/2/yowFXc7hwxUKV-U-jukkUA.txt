Went tonight for a quick dinner which turned out to be over an hour.  Nice decor, very clean but the very slow service (40min wait for our entrees) was way too long.  Never saw the waitress again after we placed the order until it was time for the check.  When the food arrived, it was only lukewarm and despite my attempt to flag down a waiter to refill our drinks, we were basically ignored.  Can't see this place lasting any longer than the other places that have been it this location, will not return.
