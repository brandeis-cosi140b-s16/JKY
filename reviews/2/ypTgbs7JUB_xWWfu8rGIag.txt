So we arrived at around 7:30 pm on a Thursday night with my family of 8. 

We were the only ones inside the restaurant from what I could tell. 

The food was actually really good. Not great and I have had better but it was still pretty good for being the end of the day and almost closing time. 

The reason I won't return? Their wait staff. Our waitress was horrible. It took forever for her to keep coming back to our table to refill drinks, chips and salsa. She was sarcastic and snotty when my father asked her about the one of the dishes. 

Had to pull our chair out and stare in her direction for a good seven minutes for her to stop talking to the other 4 co workers and bring us our check and boxes. 

This place has the potential to be really good, just need to find some staff who want to make it that way is your problem.
