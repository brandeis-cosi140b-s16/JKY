Was a fan until a bad experience. Attempted to call in an order for pick up, no answer. Placed order through drive thru. Was told that they're out of rice. Really? Mexican restaurant out of rice? Got home to find out that my order was incomplete (they forgot to include order of french fries), one of the combos was ordered no lettuce (lettuce was not held), and the side of nachos were old, stale, and cold.

Will not risk this place again.
