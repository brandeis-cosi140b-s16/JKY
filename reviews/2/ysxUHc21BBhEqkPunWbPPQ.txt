Second time here, lunch buffet, traveling through the area.  The place was very busy, so someone was enjoying their food, right?

I was not so lucky.  It looked like Mexican fare, but tasted like bland food.  Soon after I finished my meal, an uneasiness set in my stomach.  Ill hours later as I type this.

Just wasn't worth it.
