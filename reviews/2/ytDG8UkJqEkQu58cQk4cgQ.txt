I love Mexican food, but I don't like Mexican food that is overloaded with salt.  In fact, writing this and thinking about my meal a few weeks ago is already making me feel dehydrated.  Perhaps, I ordered the wrong thing.  Perhaps it was a bad batch.  My husband and I shared the Pastor Burrito and after the first bite, the saltiness was too much to bare.  We also ordered a couple of tacos (carne asada and chicken) and those were both OK.  

We also ordered a chicken quesadilla for my toddler daughter, and once I got past the greasiness (which is to be expected), it was OK too.  The only item I actually enjoyed was the Horchata.  I shall continue my search for a great hole-in-the-wall Mexican joint.
