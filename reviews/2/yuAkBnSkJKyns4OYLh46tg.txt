A visiting friend and I gave breakfast here a try before heading to Sedona back in April '08.  The salsa was very good.  My friend said that the chips were awesome.  I had a breakfast burrito (eggs and ground beef) that wasn't very memorable, while she had something similar with chorizo wrapped in a soft corn tortilla and smothered with a sweet red sauce.  She didn't like it very much.
 
I liked the wooden furniture that reminded me of the furniture found in every home back in the Philippines- dark, heavy, and many are engraved.  I thought the Native American theme was a little-off, but she found it charming.  

Service was very slow- we sat waiting for more than ten minutes before someone came out of the kitchen to greet us.  Lunch menu items are rather inexpensive, so I may visit again sometime in the next few years...
