We had the Queso Fundido with Taquitos for an appetizer. The dip was great and the chips were great, but the taquitos were dry and boring. For entrees, we had the mole, which was good, but not great. We also had the mango, chipotle chicken and the sauce was great, but the chicken was dry and overcooked. None of the flavor was soaked into the chicken, so it tasted bland.

As others have said, the entrees are very large, so that is a plus.

We would like to come back and try happy hour and some "safer" entrees such as the chimichanga and hopefully they will be better executed.
