The food is decent, with both a passable Mexican menu and a better "American" menu. The prices are reasonable, and the facility/location is pretty much the only decent thing about the otherwise stabby "Heritage District". The old school force is strong in this one. 

The service is awful, though, especially if you have no "old Maricopa" in you. The place is understaffed, and the staff often seems inconvenienced by your mere presence. We've given this place numerous chances (wanting to have a great local place to bring visitors), but been disappointed one too many times.

This place has tons of potential though, if they can get their act together.
