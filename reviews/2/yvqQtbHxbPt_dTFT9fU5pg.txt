i'm a HUGE fan of the restaurant and the menu.  i've been eating at various locations in Phoenix, Tucson, and other cities.  This particular location keeps getting worse with servings and if you ask for an extra scoop you get attitude. Management is nice, but they need to work on their employees and serving ammount. my burrito bowls i've gotten lately are for babies.
