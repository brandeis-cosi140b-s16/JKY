1 star for basically the worst Mexican food I've ever had. 3 stars for a super cute and friendly waitress and decent margarita. Pretty disappointed the one time I don't check Yelp before dining somewhere happened to be with my boyfriends parents. 
The chips that came with the chips and salsa were warm but killed with way too much salt. My bfs mom and I both ordered the chicken burrito. It came out with no sauce, cheese, Guac or sour cream on top. It was basically Luke warm chunks of chicken with chopped ice burg lettuce and what I think was ranch inside of an old tortilla. 
None of the employees (except for our waitress) seems to be interested in smiling and our encounter with the hostesses was very awkward as well. I would definitely avoid this place at all costs. Even with the discount on food offered here. Not worth it.
