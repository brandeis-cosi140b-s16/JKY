Total disappointment. A few weeks ago I went here with my cousin thought the service and food were great. Tonight I went for Cinco de Mayo at 8:30 it was packed like a mad house and my husband and I wanted to sit outside. We were willing to wait and understood that they were busy. My husband and I sat at the bar to wait. It took 15 minutes before someone finally served us. My husband asked for the tab and it took another 15 minutes before they tabbed us out because we were being seated. We waited almost 40 minutes to be seated, again busy, so we understood. What I am most upset about is how after we got seated 5 minutes went by, 10 minutes went by, 15 minutes go by no one had come up to our table to provide chips or asked us if we had been helped. To offer points we had plenty of servers look at us and walk by. I mean I could have said excuse me to one of them, but it shouldn't be the customers job to ask for service at a restaurant. Super disappointed, so we left without any service or food.
