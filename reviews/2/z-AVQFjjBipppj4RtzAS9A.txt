Not awful, but I'd expect better in the area.  The food was too salty, and she puts ice cream in the licuados because the Americans who come in don't like their "shakes" made the authentic way.  The guacamole was clearly pureed, not mashed.

Seriously, though, if you're jonesing for horchata or authentic Mexican lemonade, this is the place.  Their horchata is the best I've ever had (made with brown rice, too), and the lemonade is everything it should be.
