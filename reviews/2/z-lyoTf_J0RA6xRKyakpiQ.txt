Barely mediocre food and wildly unfriendly service earn this place two stars.  They have a captive audience in state government workers given the lack of restaurant choices in the Capitol area and perhaps that explains it.  The food is generally fresh but offers little in the way of taste.  The red sauce they use has a distinctly "off" flavor.  Everything is very greasy even by the standards of Mexican food.  This place is a cut below the Isbertos, Rolibertos etc. that are everywhere in the Valley.  The staff  seem to resent your presence.  To call them unfriendly wouldn't do it justice.  I've waited forever for the food to come and then had the barely warm food almost thrown at me.  Give this place a miss.
