This place is pretty much the bottom of the food chain.  I just stopped by the drive through counter and ordered lunch.  First off, the gal at the window was REALLY RUDE and condescending.  Not sure why, I was just there to buy lunch and support the place and give it a try.  When I got the food home, the order was wrong, and the taco salad was tiny.  At any rate, I would recommend this place only to people I did not like!  Hahaha.  Seriously, would NEVER go back.  Don't let me forget, food was not very tasty, the taco shells sort of have that greasy taste.  Not for me.
