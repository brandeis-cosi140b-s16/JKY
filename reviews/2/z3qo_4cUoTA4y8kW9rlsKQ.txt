We went to ricos today for lunch... My boyfriend had been to the one in QC and didnt remember much about his experience, so we decided to try again.

When we walked in I noticed the AWFUL paint peel off the bare walls... I know for a fact that the paint was there from the previous restaurants... Let's change it up a bit. It obviously worked out for them. The building it self was hot and sticky like the AC wasn't working/turned on. Gross. 

For just the two of us it cost us $30 with no booze (tip included). Normally that doesn't bother me, I don't mind playing for quality. However when i have to walk up to a counter to place an order like I'm at McDonald's it does. Right off the bat i had a bad feeling about this place... From this point the food better be good. I got the chicken chimi and the boy got the combo with a taco and a steak burrito. We sat down and were given chips and salsa. Not bad. In my opinion it was bland and I like a little kick in my Mexican food. When our food arrived it looked awesome, so we dug in. My boyfriend said his shredded beef taco was delicious. Unfortunately the rest of the good fell flat. Everything was bland and by no means authentic. I think what i was most upset about is the store bought guacamole... It was obvious and disgusting. Guac is sooo simple to make!! I was actually really disappointed in this place. This is a white mans Mexican restaurant. I recommend the filibertos  in the next lot over. Better price and better flavor. 

The only saving grace for this place is the staff. The man behind the counter was incredibly helpful when we were ordering and lady helping us on the floor was very attentive and accommodating. It's not her fault a Mexican restaurant is OUT of their hotter salsa.
