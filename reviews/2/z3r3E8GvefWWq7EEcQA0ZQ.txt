I visited Macayo's because I heard that they had a gluten-free menu. 

We sat outdoors on the cute, pleasant patio. The environment was somewhat marred by the presence of cigarette smoke. I know business owners can accept smoking on patios, but they can also choose to make patios smoke-free, and I find the latter much more pleasant. 

Service was pretty good, but our server did seem in a hurry to get us out of there. Although it was 3 hours before close, she started asking if we wanted to-go boxes about 15 minutes after we got our food.  

I had beef fajitas and my partner had a burro. We also ordered guacamole. The guacamole tasted kind of gummy, and the chips were too dry, papery, and flavorless. Also, we found cucumbers in the guacamole, and later in the pico de gallo. Who puts a freaking cucumber in either of those things?

My fajitas were very bland in flavor. The meat was cheap and had been chemically tenderized, with the result that the texture was pulpy. Instead of seared, it was just browned. It looked as though it had been steamed in a microwave, to be honest. Also, they used too much tenderizer, and it took the top skin off of my tongue. Gross. 

Refried beans tasted kind of cakey. Otherwise ok. Again, guac was gummy with a strange taste. 

My partner said his burro was boring and had not much flavor. 

We asked about flan, but learned that it contains gluten. There is ZERO reason that flan should contain any gluten, so I am guessing their flan was made from some kind of mix. Again, gross. 

I won't be returning to Macayo's.
