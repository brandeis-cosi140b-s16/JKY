This is typical American-Mexican food.  Many items are thrown into the microwave for heating (cooking). I sat in direct view of the kitchen. I will agree that the food is good, not great, although my take out order was missing the black beans. Take out is charged an additional .50 on your order. So if you're going to charge more for take out make sure everything is included in the order. Also, portions much smaller on take out.
