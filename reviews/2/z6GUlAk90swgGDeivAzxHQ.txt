I ate here because a co-worker had recommended it. I ordered it online and had my co-worker go pick it up for me. I got the chicken salad and asked for the lime cilantro dressing and extra pico. When I opened it up, it had no dressing and no pico... It literally was a bowl of lettuce, chicken, rice and beans. No flavor and really dry. I doubt I will ever go here again. I would rather spend $10 on a bowl at Chipotle. I will say that the chicken had some nice flavor, but not enough to make up for no salad dressing or pico. I didn't go in, so I can't attest to the customer service.
