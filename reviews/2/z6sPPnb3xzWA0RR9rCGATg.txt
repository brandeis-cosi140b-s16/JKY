My girlfriend and I love Chipotle, and come to this location weekly for an easy and delicious lunch. Today, however, was much different. First, let me say that I have worked in the food and beverage industry for over 10 years, and customer service plays a big role in this environment. We order our usual meals and find a place to sit; my girlfriend immediately notices two black hairs in the cheese of her meal. She takes her taco plate back to the cashier, points out the hairs and that she believes it may have come from the cheese. The staff begins to show each other the plate, and laugh about the fact that there was hair found in a guest's meal, in front of more guests standing along the assembly line. They begin to make her meal again, but continue to use the same products as before, regardless that any may have human hair in them, even the cheese that was specifically pointed out to be the most likely culprit. I give this place 2 stars because normally, the standard of service is very high. This time,  I did not recognize a single person on the line, so I'm giving fault to inexperienced employees. Very poor customer service, not even an apology or offer to pay for the meal was given. I will now be driving to other locations as this one has lost its luster and appeal from poor management, food quality and customer service.
