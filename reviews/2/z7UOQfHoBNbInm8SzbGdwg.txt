Manuel's is better than your Serrano's or Garcia's but that's not saying much.  The chips and salsa are good. I usually get any variation of their Chimichanga, which is good but I've had better. This place use to be way cooler when they had the green chili costume and they use to dress up and dance for you on your birthday by request. WTF happened? It was the only thing I would look forward to when my wife's family would take me here. Try Cantina Laredo or Cravings before this place.
