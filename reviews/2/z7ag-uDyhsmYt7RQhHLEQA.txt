Service was okay,  food was HORRIBLE though. We stopped by as hubby works construction down the street and passes by ajos everyday so were curious and wanted to try something new. I got the polo blanco enchiladas,  he got tacos del mar and DD got the kids chicken tacos.  Everyone's meal was BLAND meat had no seasoning what so ever,  i found myself drenching it in the salsa just to find it half way decent.  This place has to be the worst Mexican food I've had.  Cute atmosphere and service wasnt as bad as some reviews suggest but needless to say we will not be returning.
