Wow, what a differance in locations. Notice the Charleston location has a 4 star rating with the exact same food. I have to agree. I went there twice, so I just didn't land on a bad day. They were disorganized, unfriendly, too feww waiters serving too many people. It was slow service. A take out order was also overcharged on side items, I'm sure of it. Was in a hurry & couldn't persue it. It's the closest one to my house & I'm willing to go out of my way to another one.
