We're surprised to see so many good reviews for this place, so maybe they were just having a bad day today.  First time there and all our food was way overcooked, nearly charred (not in a good way).  The chips were dripping with grease.  Nothing tasted authentic, which would've been okay if it at least tasted good.  This 1st impression was just too bad for us to go back again.  Bummer!
