I ordered a chorizo breakfast burrito and fish taco, my coworker had 4 carne asada tacos, and my other coworker had a barbacoa beef plate. The fish taco was great. But at over $4, quite pricey. The chorizo breakfast burrito was ok. Light on the chorizo in my opinion. There's no salsa bar nor did my waitress give me any type of salsa/hot sauce with my meal. Actually no one asked if I wanted green or red or anything. My coworker got some red sauce brought out with his tacos. He said his tacos were ok, but nothing special. My coworker that ordered the barbacoa beef said he would have rather eaten at qdoba. So that says a lot about his meal. Given the reviews, I expected a lot more from this place. If you're charging $3 a taco, it better be a pretty damn good taco. In my opinion, taco y taco is much better.
