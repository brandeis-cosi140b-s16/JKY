After having lived in New Mexico I'm always trying to find good New Mexican food out here, and I was excited to try this place based on the reviews. Unfortunately I was sorely disappointed. I wasn't a fan of any of the trio of salsas, but salsas can be a very personal taste. The blue corn enchiladas with shredded beef, christmas style were extremely bland. I kept thinking if I ate more they would get better, but they got worse as I became more disappointed in the lack of flavor. The beef was moist but I couldn't seem to find a hint of flavor. I also expect green and red chile to have a kick to it and I didn't notice any spice. The atmosphere was great and they appear to have live music. The sangria margarita was delicious. I wouldn't come back for the food but it seems like a fun place for happy hour if you're in the neighborhood.
