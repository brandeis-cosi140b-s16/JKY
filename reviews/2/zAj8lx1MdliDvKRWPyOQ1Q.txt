I was really happy to find a 24-hour Mexican joint nearby.  The service was friendly, the ladies there really nice, the food tasted like just about all the other Mexican places nearby (Whateveriberto's, El Favorito, Rivas'), but was really good and filling.

Why two stars?

Well, it started with my  wife getting up in the wee hours afterwards having to spend a considerable about of time on the loo--it was the food she ate at Amado's--right through her, and quite painfully.  I wasn't happy about this, and was even more upset when I began to purge myself--from the other end. . .

I know this is TMI, but I can't sufficiently express the agony involved in vomiting up ANYTHING containing chili powder.  Oh my God. . .

It really is too bad.  I would have really liked to come here again.  The food was delicious. . .the first time around only.  Unfortunately, we are going to avoid Amado's in the future.
