Nothing out of this world... 1/2 of our 10 piece meal was pretty burnt and undersized. The other half of our order was cooked properly and we enjoyed it.

However, the cashier was very unprofessional during our visit and spoke to me and other customers as if he was hanging out with his buddies, rather than serving paying customers.
