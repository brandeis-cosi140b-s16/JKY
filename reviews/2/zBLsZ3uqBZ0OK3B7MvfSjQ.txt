Overpriced for what it is - a Taco shop.

Pros:
Ambience is kind of cool.
Large patio.
Above-average cocktails.
Good place for a large group if you want to hang at the patio and enjoy some drinks / nice weather. 

Cons:
Food is sub-par.
Expensive for the quality (not the freshest ingredients).
Certain items were way too salty and over-seasoned.

In summary, unlikely to return unless food quality improves drastically.

What we had:
Cocktails 
Fish tacos (mahi mahi) - ok.
Calamari tacos - above average.
Veggie tacos - salty and unimpressive.
Chips - stale and not fresh.
Salsa - above average.

Service: above average but certainly not as good as other similar restaurants in the area.
