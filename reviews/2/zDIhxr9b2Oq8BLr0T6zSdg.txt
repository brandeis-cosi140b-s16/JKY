This place was just ok.  My boyfriend loves their chicken enchiladas.  We were with a party of five and were given our choice of seating when we walked in.  However, I should have known that I wasn't in store for a 5 star experience when the server who was "seating" us just walked away when we chose the table we wanted.  I was left standing there wondering if he was going to go get menus and then seat us or if we were supposed to just go sit down.  Kind of awkward.  

Food was also just average.  The bf still enjoyed his chicken enchiladas.  I should also add that he initially ordered the wrong enchilada plate and when it came to the table the server was very accommodating about taking it back and getting the correct entree.  I had the carnitas taco special which was two tacos with rice and beans.  I specifically asked about what kind of tortillas the tacos were made with and the server said they were hard shell tacos.  When they arrived the tortillas were corn, greasy and soft.  Not so good.  My mom's soft tacos were strangely served upside down.  I was also the only at the table who was served refried rather than whole beans.  Not sure if that was part of the special, but thought it was kind of strange.  

I loved that they served sopapillas with dinner.  Prices are reasonable and service was fair.  It was an ok experience but with other better places I don't know that I would choose to go back.
