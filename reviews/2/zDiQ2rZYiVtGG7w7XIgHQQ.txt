I used to come here all the time because it was open 24 /7. But the last two times I went, I have decided I won't be back because my burrito was so wet and watery that it totally soaked through the wrapping and dribbled all over the place. I do believe they have a different staff who works there at night than before. Someone needs to show them how not to make a burrito not so watery and to drain the ingredients . It's a shame because it was a great place to stop at at 3 a.m. on my way home from a late night. Prices are reasonable and service was always very fast.
