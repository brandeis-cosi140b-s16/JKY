We walked in to dinner at Verde around 6:30 slightly before the evening rush.

To start we ordered the Elotes (grilled corn) which was absolutely amazing. So good in fact  we ended up scooping up all the butter and seasoning with our chips.

Sadly this was the only great part of the meal. 

@Julianne M had the Tacos De Camote which was a sad attempt at a vegetarian taco. While the sweet potatoes and chick peas were a good start, the ice berge lettuce and the sub par flour tortilla (if Verde reads this, go for the corn tortillas) ruined it for her.

I had the Chiles Rellenos De Hongos which was the better of the two meals but no where near great. Soggy and a bit over cooked in my opinion.

I might come back but only for Elotes and maybe a few cocktails.
