Won't be going here again!    This place is somewhat like Roberto's.   First time ever eating here and will be our last.     Walked in and went right up to the cashier and he was not friendly at all.    Very rude I must say.     We ordered 3 bean & cheese burritos and 3 beef tacos.    My bean & cheese burrito the tortilla was burnt all over the place which tasted horrible.     The red salsa was horrible and was drowning in cilantro and other unknown floaters and the green salsa wasn't much better.
