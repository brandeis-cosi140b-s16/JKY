Well as usual the rolled tacos lacked the quality of my first visit.  They were mushy in the middle and some parts of the tacos appeared maybe to not even been dipped into the fryer. The guacamole quality also not impressive this time and the cheese on the rolled tacos was not melted at all. Very concerned about prices for this item too as in most places you can get 5 of these for under 5 bucks always,  but they are 6.50 here with tax. Not worth it based on quality and not even a healthy dose of alcohol helped either.
