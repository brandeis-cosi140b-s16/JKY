Both the cab driver and the hotel recommended Los Olivos, so I was expecting an authentic Mexican dinner. What we got was poorly flavored food and disappointment. All 8 members of my party thought their meals were sub-par. However, the bartenders were outstanding! Go for the margaritas as Miguel makes his without mix the way they should be and with fresh lime juice!
