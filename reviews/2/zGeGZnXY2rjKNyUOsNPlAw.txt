Boulder Station's poor cousin to the restaurant bearing the same name (but virtually no other similarities) at Sunset Station.

Where Sunset's Guad features a relaxingly lit, thematically decorated restaurant area, this one is a glaringly bright, cramped quarters affair with a cafeteria feel about it. There's a self-help salsa bar that gets extremely messy and unsanitary looking, with significantly fewer options than the other location's extensive array.

The restaurant can get very noisy and kid-tastic also. 

Food quality isn't up to par with what we are used to from the Guadalajara name either. I'll be sticking to the Sunset location.
