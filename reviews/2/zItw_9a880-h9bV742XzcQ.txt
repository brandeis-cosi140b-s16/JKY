Not sure where to start on this one.  

We came in here a few weeks ago for some dinner before catching our show over at Gammage.  When we got there, there were not many people there but the place looked pretty cool so I was excited to check it out.  We were there with another couple who were also headed to the show.

Our server was very friendly and certainly did her best to keep up with everything so I am not sure where the disconnect is as far as management or the kitchen.  The place started to fill up and it was clear that she was the only server for the entire place which made for a longer wait time for our checks at the end of the meal.  Apparently her manager was behind the bar working so I don't know who messed up the scheduling that night.

Let's move on to the food.  It wasn't bad but it wasn't great.  We tried a few of the tacos - I liked the cod and the short rib, but the pork and the chicken were kind of plain.  We had the guac to start which was pretty good, except that it took a while to come out.  My girlfriend ordered the adult horchata drink which was not very good in that it was way too strong and not very tasty.  It tasted like a whole lot of rum in a slushee and it didn't come out until halfway through the meal. 

All in all, it could have been worse, but it could have also been way better.  Free advice to management from someone who has a lot of industry experience: work on the ticket times for the kitchen and work on scheduling more people during happy hour because you are only hurting yourself by trying to run a skeleton crew.
