Was looking forward to having a great Mexican neighborhood restaurant in this location. Extremely disappointed with our huevos rancheros. So so salty couldn't even finish. Beans would be excellent  if salt were reduced. Rice okay but again salted to the max. And my hubby felt the same, and he is one to always reach for the salt shaker.
