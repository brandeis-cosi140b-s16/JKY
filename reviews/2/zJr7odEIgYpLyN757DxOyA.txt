I was here a few months ago and I really wanted to give them 3 stars because our waiter was very friendly. Shout out to that guy, whoever you are. I did appreciate you doing your best to accomodate our group, but it just wasn't enough to make up for the rest of the experience. 

The girls working at the front barely looked old enough to be there, and were about as knowledgable about the happy hour policy of the restaurant as a german shephard I had seen walking outside earlier that day. I think they were paid to stand there and look cute because that's about all they were good for ( no offense girls, whoever you were)
I suppose if I were rating this place solely as a bar, then I wouldn't have to be so harsh. I had a happy hour priced Stone beer for about $4. Not bad I guess. And the interior looks kinda neat and tropical and what have you. I suppose you could double your fun by showing up in a hawaiin shirt.

Unfortunately, we did try alot of the food here and I certainly was not impressed. I suppose the most tolerable of the food we had was the beef tacos. Kinda tasty and bite  sized. I really did not care for the ceviche?? [Is that how its spelled?]. Well I have tasted it before and had much better. The chips were very mediocre and the guacamole--I have serious doubts about whether that was freshly made. It tasted like the stuff that comes out of a packet in the refrigerated section at the supermarket. The value of the food wasn't bad but if you are in the mood for happy hour eats, there are so many better options out there. Sorry coconuts...you just didn't do it for me.
