My family have been going to the original one on Indian School since before I was born, I noticed this one opened not to long ago so today my brother and our friend went to eat here, I know it's the Holidays and waiting was a bit longer, that was understandable but we got seated after a hour of waiting, which we just got seated no one came up to us till about 10 minutes after just because a man was walking by, he saw we didn't have drinks so he offered to help. Then our actual waitress came and she gave us chips and salsa we sat and munch on those for a while I mean a GREAT WHILE, we sat and ate all the chips and waited again for about 30 minutes for someone to come up and ask us if we are ready to order. So we put our order in my brother got the exact same as me and our friend got two little things. We waited almost another whole hour to get our food and when we got it MY BROTHER'S FOOD WAS COMPLETELY WRONG! he was very upset and the waitress that dropped it off just took off so we all waited to see where she went so he could get it fixed about 20 minutes later she comes back finally and asks us is everything okay? My brother explained to her how she gave him the wrong thing and she just rolled her eyes and then tried to play it off like laughing and said oops. That's all, she was going to grab the plate but my brother told her never mind since it might take another HOUR to get the RIGHT food even then it could still be WRONG. So we just decided to stick with what we had since it might take another hour or longer to get food. She didn't even offered to take it off the bill till my brother explained that it should be since it was wrong and he didn't want to wait again for another hour. So she rolled her eyes and just said okay I'll do that. After that no one came to refill our drinks or ask us how our meal was NO ONE. She only came back to hurry and get our bills and get them done to move us out. I know at the original Popo's this would have never happened.
