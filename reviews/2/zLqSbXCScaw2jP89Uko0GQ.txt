Tried to go here at 10pm on Saturday night the night before the Super Bowl. Cityscape was literally so packed you could barely walk for blocks in every direction. Downtown was literally the busiest district in America that night, almost Times Square on NYE level. Full of tons of hungry people with few food options. Chipotle has a line inside, and a mob of people standing outside. I go up to the door to pull it open --- Locked. Are you kidding me? You are sitting on the most desirable piece of real estate for a business in the whole US tonight, with literal mobs banging on the door to give you money, so you shut it down and go home?
