I went to this place with family. The service was ok and food was ok but I had a rice water in a large sized cup. The beverage was full of cinnamon at first I was really thirsty so I thought nothing of it. When I got home about 3 hours later I thought I was having a mental breakdown. My head felt weird like I was losing my mind... In short I did some research online and it says that cinnamon is a mild hallucinogenic like ecstasy. So I don't know if it was the drink or the food. I will not be going back to this place ever.
