I have always liked Filibertos. When this one opened I was pretty excited. Sadly it has gone downhill. The machaca burrito is now a little bit of machaca and more onion and green pepper. Also Bertos was known for its complimentary salsa bar including carrots and jalapenos. Now the carrots are extra and they are horrible. Go across the street  for better food. Also the girl at the counter was about a surly as could be.
