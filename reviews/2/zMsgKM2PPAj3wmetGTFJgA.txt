I've been to the restaurant twice before, 1 for a large industry work event and second time with my family. This would be considered my third visit and probably my last. We came in with an open mind and a craving for Mexican food. Ordered our appetizers; nachos and shrimp taquitos. The nachos were so dry we might of as well just ordered chips and salsa, I will give them a gold star for the shrimp taquitos they were amazing and they are served with plenty of guacamole. 
After the appetizers we ordered our meals; I had the carnitas tacos which had so many dry pieces it felt like chewing on beef jerkey. My other half ordered a chicken burritos chimichanga style, it looked and tasted like a giant hot pocket. There was no exquisite flavor in either meal, I asked for the salt and pepper to add some pizzazz to the meal. No love was given to making the meal
