I went here last week for lunch.  I wasn't real hungry so I just ordered two shredded beef tacos without any sides.  The service was fine and my order came out fairly quick. The tacos were average at best.  The meat was very greasy and flavorless.  I like greasy food,  but not puddles of grease.  I could over look the grease if the meat had some flavor,  but it didn't. I will eat here again, but will try chicken next time to see if its any better than the beef.
