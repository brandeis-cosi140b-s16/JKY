The PRICE of drinks!  You have to be as rich as Bill Gates to afford the dang drink prices.  THAT is my main "beef" with Aunt Chilada's. $4.50 for a bottle of mexican beer?  Hell, it should be Japanese beer for that price!
What ever happened to $1 a bottle, especially for mexican beer?  Mexico is not far from this place, I can see if it was Germany, or Ireland. Come on owners, you're already "rakeing us over the coals" on the mixed drink prices, lower the dang price on beer at least!  The cowboys that used to frequent this place back in the 1800's would "turn over in their graves" if they knew how much this place is ripping us off for a dang beer.
