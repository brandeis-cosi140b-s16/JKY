Stopped in on a Saturday evening and the place was pretty full. A couple entered the same time as us and were sat and greeted with chips and drinks. After we sat,  we were kinda looking around wondering why nobody was greeting us. Two more couples came in and were given chips before us. I told my boyfriend that if they didnt come over in two minutes we were leaving.  All of sudden they greeted us so we were stuck. 
We ordered an appetizer and waited  for it to arrive while everyone who came in AFTER us was finishing their entree and waiting for their bill.  We were beyond frustrated. The appetizer was nothing but thick melted cheese on a skillet. We thought it would be more of a thick dip.  After everyone else left we got our  food.  The people that came in 20 minutes after us got their food two minutes after us. 

I asked for sour cream with my order and when i got my plate there wasnt any. Considering they Charge $1 ud think they'd remember that.  Portions were kind of small. my burrito was soggy and i couldn't eat the ends becuz they were so doughy. 

The reason we came here was becuz the pollack cinema had an ad that u could get $2 off per entree with ticket.  I tried to use and girl said it has to be used the same day as ur movie. The ad at  the movie does not say that. Total bait and switch. Like perfect definition of it. Girl heard me complain and came back saying she would take it. I told her it was ok and not to worry about it
(Becuz another table was staring at me and i didnt wanna seem cheap or like a baby.)
 
We had three different people wait on us so maybe that had something to do with our poor experience
