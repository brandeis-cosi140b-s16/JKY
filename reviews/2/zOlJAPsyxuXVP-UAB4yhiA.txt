We've been to the Spotted Donkey a few times, never very memorable. Cute typical Mexican restaurant decor, nice outside patio. Fun to go with friends for drinks. Pricier than your average Mexican restaurant but of course it is in a high-end shopping center at the Boulders in Carefree. Most Mexican restaurants you fill up on chips and salsa prior to your meal but you won't have that problem here unless you want to purchase your chips and salsa. The Sangria and Margaritas are are good and they do have a great selection of Tequilas.The food is typical Mexican fare, good but nothing spectacular.
