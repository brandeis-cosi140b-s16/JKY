I struggled with this review because the food was great but the bartender was more interested in the football game and flirting with fellow staff members than she was her customers.  Pretty sure I tip you for services not your fellow servers. She made a great Bloody Mary but if the manner in which its severed is terrible, what do you say!! Be more attentive!!!
