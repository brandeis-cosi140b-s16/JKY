* Hipster hangouts don't impress me in the least. And I'm sure not paying you extra for atmosphere. You can style and profile all that you want, but I want to eat some delicious food when I go to a restaurant. I do like the Goth girls, but then.....I always find stupidity amusing.
 
* Flavorless whitefish tacos. There are literally dozens of Hispanic restaurants, featuring superior fish tacos, in and around CLT. 

* Weird Cold Corn Salsa with Stale "Cardboard" Blue Corn Tortillas. Creative? Yes. Tasty? Mmmm, No. Give me chunky, freshly made at one's tableside, pico de gallo guacamole any day of the week and twice on Sunday. (Served with hot tortilla chips, which doesn't happen here!)

* Difficult parking. YMCA parking lot, and we're walking there.
 
* Expensive. There's no reason for fish tacos to cost this much, and to be so effing mediocre. If the fish were freshly caught that morning off the coast of Charleston, or served somewhere along the PCH, yeah, maybe I could see their prices as realistic. Here, you're just paying for the cool factor of dining in NODA, and screw that.

** Their location nets one star, and they usually have competent waitstaff, which procures the second star.
 
PS: I like Guy Fieri, but he's not always right.
