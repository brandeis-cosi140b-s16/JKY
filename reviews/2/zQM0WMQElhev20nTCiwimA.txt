This was my first time eating here. The food was very bland and uninspired. However, the drinks were very tasty. Our server was not the worst. But, definitely not the best. However, the manager was excellent. She came and asked how everything was. When I replied that it was just OK, she wanted details. The manager was very appreciative of my feedback and even took my fish tacos off of the check (something I did not expect). Also, they accidentally charged my card too much. The manager that I spoke to was very concerned and understanding. He even went to their accounting department to verify that their records only showed the correct charge. Although my first experience with the food was not great, I am considering giving them another shot thanks to the excellent managers.
