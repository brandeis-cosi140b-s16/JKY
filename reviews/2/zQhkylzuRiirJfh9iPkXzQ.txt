If you're really into Del Taco and this is your best location to find it, look upon it and despair!

The $1 strawberry lemonade is excellent -- it contains actual frozen strawberries in their defrosted form -- and I don't regret trying the bacon mini-quesadilla because bacon. I appreciate that Del Taco has salsa verde.

I don't appreciate waiting 10 minutes for a $2 order, only to discover it had been never been started. The dude in charge hated his life and wasn't trying to hide it. The dude on the line appeared terrified into utter confusion. I understand that the smiles at McDonald's are merely masks for tormented  and oppressed souls, but I appreciate the effort to fake it, y'know?

The combination of $1 menu, strawberry lemonade, and prime location means I probably will eat here again, but I'm not proud of this.
