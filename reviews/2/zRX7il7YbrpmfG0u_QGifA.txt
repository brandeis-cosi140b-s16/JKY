Cheap margaritas, good service but 0 for the FOOD!!! Salty, salty, salty and not good. Horrible Mexican food. Enough said. The chips were good though....green salsa, red salsa and BEANS!!!

It wasn't the waiter/waitress' fault for the taste...they exchanged my friend's meal twice free of charge! Thanks management!
