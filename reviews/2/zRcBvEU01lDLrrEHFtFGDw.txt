Still willing to drive to tacos el gordo after eating here. Super slow service. And the guy making our tacos kept dropping meat and couldn't stablized a damn taco. Then the cashier was having a beer. And the two guys mopping were counting their tips out on the floor. When they were done they didn't wash their hands, put gloves on, and went back to plating food. If that's the case then I'll go to the ghetto and gett better food for faster service. At least I  know what im getting myself into. The food itself was not bad, I like that they actually season (salt and pepper) food well. As an overall experience it was not very good.
