Good Mexican. But the service leaves much to be desired like waiting for the waiter to finally return when they place you at a booth out of line of sight. Proprietor is kinda fake acting and insincere. The quality of the food which is good does not make up for the shoddy service.  The patrons there are usually loud and obnoxious or undisciplined children.
