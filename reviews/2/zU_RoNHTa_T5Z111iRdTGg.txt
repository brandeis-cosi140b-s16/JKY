I was really hoping to like 1900 Mexican Grill based on the great things Ive heard about it.

Went in Saturday evening after finding out that Cantina had a two hour wait : ( . 

Started with the Sangria which was a little to sweet for me. I wouldnt have believe there was red wine in it- and despite its large size and my empty stomach id say they were on the weak side. 

We first asked for Guacamole and our server asked us if we would like it table-side and if we wanted one avocado or two. We gave him our answer but we were never given our Guacamole. When our meals came out I assumed he must have forgotten so I asked for it again and he came back and asked the same questions as he did previously, almost acting like we had never originally asked for it...no apology either. I will say once we did receive it I really enjoyed it. 

My enchiladas were nothing special - it was quite a sad dish really. Nothing tasted fresh nothing was exciting about the dish.

I am not sure that id go back. I love Cantina and La Paz and this restaurant cannot compete in my opinion.
