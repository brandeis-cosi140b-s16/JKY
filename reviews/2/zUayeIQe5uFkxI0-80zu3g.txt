My wife and I have been to a couple of Serrano's in the area and our favorite is in Queens Creek. The Mesa is like a whole different restaurant. It was not busy when we entered today at 3:38 pm. The hostess acted like we were ghosts waited for a bit and eventually asked if we wanted a table, we decided on the bar area and seated ourselves. We waited 7 to 10 minutes for a bartender to finally get back to the bar area, no wonder no one was there in the bar. Had one diluted down margarita each and left. Won't be back to this one at all. It's amazing what good help can do for the sucess or failure of a business.
