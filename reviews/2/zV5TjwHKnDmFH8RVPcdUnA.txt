Was disappointed when the owner closed Cocomo's and decided to go Mexican. I use to love getting the street tacos and Pittsburg wings during happy hour and maybe watching some sports at Cocomo's. Came to Asado specifically for the wings since they were always outstanding at Cocomo's, so I can't speak on the Mexican food part, although, the chips with the chips & salsa looked like somebody had stomped on them earlier as they were broken into tiny pieces. As for the wings, instead of 8 wings you now get 6 which are overpriced at more than a dollar a wing unless you do Happy Hour. No longer served in the kinda cool little bucket, they were wet and caked with spice, not crispy and lightly spiced like they use to be at Cocomo's. They weren't served with the good Wasabi sauce like they use to be so we had to ask for some. The waitress then brought out some sauce that was so watered down you could barely taste any Wasabi, looked like green water. Needless to say I was very disappointed that they would take one of their most popular items from Cocomo's and then proceed to ruin it. Not giving up on Asado yet, but the owner needs to address some of these issues mentioned in these reviews soon.
