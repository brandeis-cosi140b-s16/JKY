My bf and I arrived in DTPHX early for the Dbacks game so that we could grab a quick bite to eat. After realizing that our original destination, Alice Coopertown, was on the other side of the stadium, we talked by Vitamin T and decided to try it out. They have a pretty basic menu, tacos, tortas, tamales, carmelos, 2 hot dogs, and 2 salads. I was torn between a sonoran dog and tacos, but opted for the tacos.

I had the chicken tacos (roasted chicken w/chipotle and lime, pickled onions, asadero cheese, and salsa verde) and my bf had the barbacoa tacos. I got a margarita, he got a beer, and we shared some chips and salsa. We had a seat on the patio and it didn't take long to get our food. #1 - If the food had been hot, I would have been significantly more satisfied, but it seems that they finish cooking  when it gets to slightly warm, which made it less satisfying. For all the items listed on the tacos (I considered asking for no pickled onions but didn't want to be difficult), you would have thought they would be bursting with flavor, but they were just alright. I will say though that the margarita was good, and the salsa they serve with their not-warm chips was also good. 

Can't say I'll be back.
