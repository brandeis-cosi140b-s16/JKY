Would have given them a higher review but now recently they start measuring their ingredients and now charge for extra salsa which quite frankly annoys me and is not called for when the customer is always right! Their food is good and the flavors are good but the last time I went here really irritated me so much that I will not be back. Too many fast food Mexican places out there to choose from! Can't wait for Pancho's to open in September at Downtown Summerlin!
