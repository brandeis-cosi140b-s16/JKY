Just don't bring yourself to do it. There are better Mexican restaurants within 30 feet.
Service is terrible. Good luck getting drunk refills, sides of anything, the check, silverware, or a drink delivered in under 20 minutes. 
The food is halfway decent but nothing to search out. 
With all of the other Mexican places around Chandler, just drive the extra 2 minutes and look for something better.
