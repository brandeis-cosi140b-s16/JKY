I wasn't going to write this review as it has been a good seven months since I have gone here and maybe ... just maybe they have improved. But when I searched Yelp for mexican recommendations and saw this came up as highest rated I almost fell out of my chair. So of course I have to put in my two cents. Luckily, I have an excellent memory when it comes to things I care about i.e. food. 

First off, we went there right after they have opened so I will say maybe they were still working out the kinks, at least I hope they were.  On the positive side the dining room was clean, and it had some ambience (more than the typical taco shop would). Also, the owner attempted to rectify the situation, explained below, unfortunately it could not be. 

So I got the carne asada fries. Typical gringo mexican dish - maybe that was my mistake and I should have ordered something more authentic. The fries were not cooked at the right temperature, they came out greasy and undercooked. Not to mention for the price, I believe around the $7 range, the portion was rather skimpy. Took it to the counter and explained the issue, the person who I believe was either the owner or manager, cooked the fries again. Same exact issue. Which tells me that it was not a mistake but that they were unaware what temperature oil should be to properly cook fries in. Ultimately, they refunded our money and we went elsewhere. 

The service is the only reason that I am giving it two stars - to be honest I can't remember what my husband got, my guess is carne asada tacos and I tried some as I was starving due to having to wait for the re-fire of the carne asada french fries, but the tacos were not memorable.  I truly hope for their sake they improved, and from the sound of the other reviews, maybe they did. I suppose to give it a true review I should go back and try the food again but with the amount of taco shops in Vegas there are so many other place to try!
