Visited this place last week when my folks were in town,

It's an older style family restaurant, I ordered some carnitas tacos and a Chile relleno. The tacos were ok, the Chile relleno was good, and their rice was excellent, really enjoyed it. 

I was terribly sick about a half an hour after leaving the restaurant and it lasted a day and a half. By sick I mean making sure a bathroom was within running distance.

Wish it didn't happen, but that's life. Won't be going back. :(
