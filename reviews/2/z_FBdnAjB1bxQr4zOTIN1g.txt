About a year or so ago, this place was great to go. It's not like there were or still are a lot of Mexican place in Laveen to go. 
The green chile was the best thing in my opinion, the rice and beans were good. The taso's were good. 
However now I would rather drive a little farther to get Mexican food. Before the green chile seems to be made fresh with real meat and now it seems like they have gotten lazy and they use canned meat. I don't know you can just tell by that mushy texture in your mouth. 
If you don't want to drive far to get Mexican food. I would atleast give this a try once to make your own judgement, however I would not suggest to get the green chile. 
The breakfast however will hit the spot.
