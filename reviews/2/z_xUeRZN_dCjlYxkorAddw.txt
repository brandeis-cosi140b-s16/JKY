I have tried giving  Filiberto's three chances for improvement, each in a different location. Yet, with each visit I am more disappointed. I have to say that the one on Guadalupe Rd is the worst I have ordered from. Not only was the customer service a disaster, almost borderline rude, but the tortilla for my shredded beef burrito tasted old and crispy. Flour tortillas are not supposed to taste like that. The next time I want some quick Mexican food, I am going to stop by Moreno's Mexican Grill, even if it is a bit farther away than a Filiberto's. I gave it two stars, because they do have complimentary chips and salsa bar, and so that does deserve some merit.
