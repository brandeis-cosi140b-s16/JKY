Went there last night for the first time with a group of 9 for taco Tuesday night. We were immediately welcomed by a friendly server, who cleared a table for us, then we were seated after 5 min short wait.

Our drinks were taken and delivered in a timely manner, and our orders were placed. From there it went downhill.

Four of us ordered shrimp tacos, we all got shredded beef tacos instead. We all had to wait for them to fix our orders. Once we did get our shrimp tacos, I must say they were quite tasty, even though it was on a flour tortilla and not corn like I asked. My side of guac never came, even though I asked twice. Aaaand of course I was charged for it.

So they stumbled through their service to us, and I have no clue how they could screw up that bad.

Throughout all this, our server remained very friendly. Because of this, perhaps I'll go back since it's so close to my house, only this time I will sit at the bar with a +1 only. Hopefully their margaritas will be redeeming.
