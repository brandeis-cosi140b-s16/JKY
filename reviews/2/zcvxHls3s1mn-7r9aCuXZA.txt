We live across the street from this location. If I was scoring their "food" only- they would get a 4-5 star. However.... Let me start by saying the only reason we are NOT weekly regulars is the fact that they have HORRIBLE service. We know that a dinner at Ketzal is gonna be a long drawn out process- filled with "can we get the "..?." that we have asked 3x's for?  But really. tonight took the cake!

Setting the scene.
There were 2 people at the bar.. 1 bar tender. (only 2- one of which I would have cut off long before he got up to stuble out to his car)
6 seated tables.. 1 waitress. 
The "1" waitress in the joint had to jump behind the bar to make margaritas! Really?! I know the bartender had her hands full with her 2 guests, oh and her CELLPHONE! No joke- bartender girl was on her cellphone serving drinks, processing tabs, and telling people all about the friend she is trying to track down at tent city!! 

I wanted to grab her phone and throw it in the margarita machine.
Our waitress was SO frazzled trying to keep up with in coming traffic, and bartender was of NO help. No team work at all. A resturant can not function on the back of one employee. 

Tuesdays are great with their kids eat free deal. (dine-in only) Which is the ONLY reason why we bother. (ok you got me.. their burgers and fries are the BOMB!) We decided tonight no more!! Our time, and sanity is worth more than $5. If we really have a craving for Ketzals we are ordering TO-GO! 

We have been going here for over a year and a half and the service always stinks. GUARANTEED!!  Time to clean up, and set some higher standards of service.
