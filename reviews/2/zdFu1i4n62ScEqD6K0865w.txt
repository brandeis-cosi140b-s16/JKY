Usually this place is awesome and we have no problems, but this time was different. :( We sat outside because it was a beautiful evening. First, they told us we couldn't get the fresh guac cart outside, so that was a bummer. Then, both of my parents ordered their meals without onions, and they both came completely loaded with onions. My mom sent her dish back and it came back with onions still on it. My dad wanted to order something else and asked for the menu and they never brought it out. My mom finally just ordered a different dish and it took forever to come out. By then my dad was practically filled up by their complimentary chips and salsa. I even had to wait quite a while just to get a refill on my water. My mom's third and final dish was good, but they forgot the queso it was supposed to come with. At that point we didn't even bother pointing it out. My boyfriend and I had already been done eating for 20+ minutes. Our food was good, and we ate it while it was still hot. The manager came by, but he basically just told us that the meal my dad had ordered earlier was prepped with onions prior to being cooked, so they couldn't take them out. One would think that if someone requests for their entire meal to have no onions that they would tell them that it already has onions in it that cannot be removed.? When my mom finally finished her meal, it took another 15 minutes for them to come back outside to check on us again and clear the table. After all of this, we still ended up having to pay $79. It even took forever for them to pickup the check so we could pay and leave. Hopefully next time we come in the food come out right the first time and the service will pick up some speed.
