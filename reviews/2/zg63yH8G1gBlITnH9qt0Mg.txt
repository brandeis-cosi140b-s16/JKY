I'm all about realistic expectations. That said, I'm fairly certain for a 70+ dollar bill I got Filibertos food and service. Hell, I kinda like Filibertos to hit the spot sometimes, but at least they charge me accordingly. I've had better food at Taco Bell to be honest.

I suppose if you're stuck in Ahwatukee/Chandler and don't want to Lyft it somewhere decent, this place will give you tiny margaritas and you can get your suburban rocks off. That's about all I can recommend, though. I'm pretty sure management counts on your inebriation to rank this place any higher than two stars. Just remember when you're picking the fake beach sand out your hair the next morning: this place is shyte. 

Our orders: beef chimi, queso, cheese enchiladas, kids menu, various mixed drinks. Beef chimi was ok, rice and beans standard bland fare. Queso is an embarrassment (personal best: Salty Senorita on a good day; Roaring Fork)

Our service: took too long on a really slow day. We could see food sitting under the heat lamps which turned out to be ours, had to call out service to get it. 

That One Redemption: Moscow Mule.
