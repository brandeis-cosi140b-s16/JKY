Ok, if you like canned chicken, no spices and little flavor, this is your place!

The chicken Tortilla soup was good, and the chips... The salsa and everything else was processed, canned, pre-made garbage!  Fuck this place and it's food!

Miguel was very nice and the bathrooms are clean, but beyond saying hi to a nice waiter or pissing on clean porcelain, don't bother!
