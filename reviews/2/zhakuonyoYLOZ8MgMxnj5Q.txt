No restaurant review should ever have to say, "Where you start getting into trouble with this place is when the entrees come out." But that's exactly the case here. This food is hot garbage wrapped in tortillas. The fish tacos are nauseating. The incredibly dry meat in the green chilli burrito gave my brother in law food poisoning. The beans taste burnt, and they've apparently decided to season their rice with dust. Failing at the basic, I can only imagine the nightmares happening on the deeper items on the menu. Also it's overpriced. The chips and salsa are very good (especially the green salsa), and the staff is very friendly. Those things are important enough to squeeze out two stars. But if you're near downtown Mesa, I don't know why you wouldn't go to Mango's instead.
