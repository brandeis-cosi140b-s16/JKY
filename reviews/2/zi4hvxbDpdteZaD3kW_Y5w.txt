Went here with the entire family.  We got seated quickly and the then had to wait for some service.  The chips and salsa where good, but we where hungry.  My enchilada style carna asada burrito was great, but the 'Mexican rice' here is down right horrendous.  The bean queso dip was very good.

Also the water staines in the ceiling tile was kinda gross.
