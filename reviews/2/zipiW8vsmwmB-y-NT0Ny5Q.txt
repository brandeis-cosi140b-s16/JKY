My coworkers wanted to eat at Nacho Daddy for annual our work Christmas dinner & after hearing so much hype about the downtown location - I decided to give it a try.  (I figured Summerlin location would be just as fun as downtown). I tried to make reservations for our larger party in advance twice, each time my phone number was taken and they said a manager would call me, which did not ever happen. I finally called again a few days before our planned outing and just made a regular reservation, no manager approval needed. I realized it's probably a lot more casual than I was picturing.

After we got there the servers and hostess were super nice and accommodating however the food itself was not great (I'd rather eat nachos from Robertos or KoMex) and I am not sure if it is because of where we were sitting or the fact there were other large parties there, but half my party ordered extras (like sour cream or guacamole) and it didn't come until the end of the meal, after they had eaten most or all of their food.

The name Nacho Daddy is cute and the thought behind the food and menu was better than the food itself.  The prices were reasonable (my bill was half of what I had budgeted on spending on our party) but I do not plan on returning there again.  After hearing feedback from my staff in the office the next week their sentiments were the same.
