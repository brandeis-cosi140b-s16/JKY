After having been back multiple times the food isn't as good as it was initially; the rice doesn't seem fresh, the chips aren't good, the ground beef taco is alright but it is also simple. Other people in our party got other things which they didn't like. There are a lot of problems when ordering with a huge party and orders get mixed up. Service is slow and not everybody gets their food at the same time which leaves half our party eating and the other just waiting.
