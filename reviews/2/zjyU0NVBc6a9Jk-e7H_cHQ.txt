I finally got to Mi Amigo Ricardo's, last night. I had been looking forward to going after a friend recommended it and after noticing the full parking lot on many occasions.  But as it sometimes goes with anticipation and high expectations, I was disappointed.

Chips and salsa to start...I've honestly had better salsa from Target. My four year old daughter ate it, and she can't eat anything with even a hint of spice. My friend ordered the guacamole and it was ok, needed a little salt and a squeeze of lime.

I ordered the Fiesta Plate which starts with a cheese crisp.  There was so much cheese that there was no 'crisp', but the kids sure liked it.  The highlight of the Fiesta Plate was the enchilada, which was actually quite good.  The beef Flauta wasn't bad either, just on the tough side.  The taco is where this rating went from an edible 3 to a 2.  The shell was a commercial hard taco from Old El Paso or some other such brand! Seriously, that's the best they could do?!  Every taco my Irish mother has ever made was better than this one.  They could have at least added some Old el Paso taco seasoning to the bland ground beef (yep you heard me right).  Head o Xavier's Casa Reynoso in Mesa if you want a good taco.  Order the Machaca Taco and tell them Tara sent you.

Thank goodness for the good company!

Sorry Ricardo's you're a 'no-go'.
