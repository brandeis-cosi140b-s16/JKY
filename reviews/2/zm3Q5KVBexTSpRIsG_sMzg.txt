The word that stuck in my head was 'pedestrian'.  The food is pedestrian.  Its ok.  

Its your basic, mid-tier city Mexican. Space is cool as they have a lot of colorful, handmade Mexican art.  

Pork tacos were ok.  Beans were meh.  Rice was ok.  Salsa tasted like a jar.  Chips were bagged.  

If we were in Marshfield (from whence they came) this would serve fine.  But in Madison there are better options.
