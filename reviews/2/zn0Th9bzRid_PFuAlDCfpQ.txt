Good mexican fast food.  Not special... But definitely better than the other shit fast food options that are around.  Fresh produce, decent guac, meat seems to be fresh too...

It's just nothing special.  I won't be craving Roberto's, but if I'm looking for a quick bite and they're around, it's a done deal.
