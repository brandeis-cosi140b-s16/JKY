Qdoba started out fairly well but has gone downhill in our opinion.
The portions are unpredictable and more often small.
I would like more information about where their beef and chicken comes from.
The meat is usually cold.
The people behind the counter are distant and uninterested in me being there.  I would just like a smile and some friendliness.   They probably need to pay a little bit more and nurture some happy employees.
The atmosphere is cold and uninviting while the view at this place isn't half bad.
It is very clean so they get a good mark there.
We stopped going here and opting for locations that have hot food, larger servings, nicer environment and friendlier people.
