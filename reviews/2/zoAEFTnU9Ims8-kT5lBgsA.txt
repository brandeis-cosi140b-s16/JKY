This was my second visit to the establishment. My first visit I ordered a special they were running; carne asada & shrimp burrito. It was delicious! It was the unexpected surprise that every diner wants to have when they take a risk on a new special!!! $8.95 +tax is bit much for just a burrito though. I understand it may be because of the size but let's be realistic cut the size down and make the price more reasonable. 

My second visit had me quite excited to try something I hadn't had. Since the first trial went so well I had hoped the second would go just as smooth. I ordered an adobada plate. Maybe I should've stuck to what I already knew. To say I was disappointed would be putting it mildly. The adobada was burnt and full of fat. It would've been seemingly edible had there been any pieces of meat that weren't charred or full of fat. The beans tasted as though they were from the can. The rice was disgusting and not just because it was cold but because it was tasteless and bland. The lettuce was about the only thing that was consumed in its entirety.

What a disappointment. I would have given them 1 star but because my first experience was well I decided to give them another star.
