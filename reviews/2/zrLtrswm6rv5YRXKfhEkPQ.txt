The service here was so terrible that everyone in my party was extremely annoyed. They took so long to bring our check that we seriously considered walking out without paying (we had already asked the server for our check). The food was good but nothing impressive. Overall I will not be eating here again. Oh and they have this "club" attached to the restaurant and it plays this obnoxiously loud music. Yeah, no thanks.
