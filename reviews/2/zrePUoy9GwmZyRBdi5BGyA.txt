The theme and decor from outside is what lured us in.  It looked like a killer place!  But once we stepped in, I was not impressed.

-$9 for HALF a bowl of guacamole - the other half are chips camouflaged by the top guac.  Come on!

-Can't bring in outside drinks?  Every other place would allow it.  We had to toss them before coming in.

-Slow service for a strip bar...and it wasn't even crowded! 

Next time I'll probably just stick with Hardrock or something safer.  Hopefully Diablo's has stepped up their game!
