So I come to this location often, maybe twice a week. But as of late something has seriously changed in the management. The serving sizes have became so small it's quite sad to say the least. 
They still have a great quality product and the staff is pleasant for the most part, but these portions are a joke. They seriously need to take a look at what's going and change it back to how it was.
