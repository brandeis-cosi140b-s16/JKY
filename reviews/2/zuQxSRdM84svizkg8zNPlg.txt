I really wanted this place to be good. Tried it three times. Today I had a chicken California burrito. Mushy rice, bland beans, flavorless chicken. The frozen tortilla wasn't warmed up all the way. Chewy and dense. Friendly staff, fast service. The chips are good if you can overlook them being stored in a dirty looking trash can. This place is not for me.
