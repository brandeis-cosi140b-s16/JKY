We've had Chipotle catered once or twice where I work for store meetings.  That's definitely the way to go as they are skimpy with their portions if you actually go there.

The menu is limited and, yes, I know all about their "food with integrity" which comes with a hefty price tag.  The salsa and chips are a joke as the salsa is in such a small plastic container reminiscent to what you'd expect butter to be served in with a to-go meal with a baked potato.
