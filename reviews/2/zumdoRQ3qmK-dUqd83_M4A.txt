We decided to check this place out because we wanted to bring our dog somewhere with us. The only reason I am giving this less-than-mediocre spot two stars is because of the first host we met (she was incredibly friendly and helpful with our dog) and that the service was decent by our waitress.

I would like to give a heads up to anyone who is thinking about coming here. The second + basket of chips and salsa is an extra charge, so you may want to think twice about coming here with a large group. Any Mexican food restaurant who charges for extra chips......red flag initially up. 

The scene was decent, but the drinkers were obnoxious. The environment was very loud, which is okay...it is a bar. The service was prompt, almost too prompt from the time the waitress knew we were only ordering one drink each. The food was horrendous. I ordered chicken fajitas....extremely bland, rice tasted like it popped out of the microwave, and it was a little bit pricey for what we got. $5.00 extra if you wanted shrimp. 

Obviously, with our dog, we were situated outside. The misters were on, awesome....but a man came while we were in the middle of our meal to "put the umbrella down" since it was sunset. Well, the water accumulated from the misters on top of the umbrella came down. The man was careful, but come on, DURING our meal? He decided to wait until later to situate the umbrella after about 10 minutes of fidgeting with it, and it continued to heavily drip water on my boyfriend. 

I would absolutely not recommend wasting your money here. We could have easily gone to a much nicer restaurant for about $10.00 more.
