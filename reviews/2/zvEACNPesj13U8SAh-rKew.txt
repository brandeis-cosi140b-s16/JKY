As I was eating this David's burger with one hand, my other hand was battling one or two of those pesky gnats floating right above the table. Those things are tough to kill unless you clap your hands on them or make a good effort to trap them against the wall of the booth. I finally nailed one of those guys near the end of the meal. 
As for the burger, it wasn't as good as my previous visit over a year agao - nothing ever is it seems. They use frozen fries and onion rings, but claim to use fresh meat. I don't understand why you wouldn't make more of an effort with your fries/rings if you focus on burgers. David's Burger is set up like an in and Out burger right down to the thousand Island, so for about 3 bucks less you can get fresh fries and the same burger over there basically.  For some reason, the Patty Melt that my date had looked good, but overall this place is a dinasaur in the burger wars in the area. And hold the Gnats next time please.
