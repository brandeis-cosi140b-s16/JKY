Garcia's has typical Mexican food, perhaps a bit better than Macayo's. Not authentic Mexican food, but adapted to what the typical American might like. At this location of Garcia's, the food was OK, but the service was not good at all. 

The waitress couldn't give us guidance on drinks because she doesn't drink alcohol. The drink menu doesn't have any prices on it, so I asked her how much some of the drinks were, and she didn't know that either. She just gave me a price range of $5.95 "on up". I'm not interested in ordering a drink with no price, only to find out later that it cost more than my meal itself. I didn't take any chances that night. 

She couldn't guide us on what to order on most of the dishes because she doesn't eat meat. With all the people looking for work, I'm surprised they couldn't find someone appropriate to wait tables here. Anyway, some of the drinks got there quickly, but the manager ran drinks over to the table about 5 minutes afterwards (perhaps she forgot about us). 

Later on at 845pm, they were running a noisy vacuum cleaner in the dining room on the other side of the room divider. This went on for several minutes, and I thought perhaps they had closed down that dining room for the night. But no! There was a still a table of people eating there. If it was annoying for us, imagine how they felt! 

Just overall a disappointing experience and I won't go back to this particular Garcia's again. There were plenty of empty tables on a Saturday night at 730pm, so perhaps others have decided the same?
