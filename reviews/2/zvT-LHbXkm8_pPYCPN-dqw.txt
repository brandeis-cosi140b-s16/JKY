I was so excited to see a Mexican place open up in the heart of Shadyside, but wow was I let down.  First and foremost, the location/environment/ambience/decor of this place is fantastic.  The split level structure, open to the outside as well as the roof top deck are all amazing.  

Now for the negatives...The bar service though was somewhat mediocre.  Yes, it was kind of busy, but it seemed like they were staffed with plenty of employees and should have been able to do a more efficient job of handling the flow of patrons.  The food was somewhat bland.  No complementary chips were provided.  Not a huge fan of their traditional guac as it really lacked the taste of true avocados, and could probably benefit from more garlic and salt.  The veggie burrito was quite bland and lacking enough beans and veggies.  It really tasted like fast food.  I suppose the food was reasonably priced, but I've had better for the amount I paid.

Unless you're in the area and are dying for a margarita or something, I would just come here for drinks and just skip the meal.  There is better Mexican food to be had in this town.
