Let me first say that I so wanted to love this place. I grew up in Cali where I've had great Mexican food and after reading these reviews we wanted to take my mother out for a great Mexican  dinner while we were here visiting.

We tried 4 different dishes and they were so mediocre.  I kept trying every one else's thinking it was just mine, I had the spicy shrimp dish.  Not so much.

My mom had the chimichanga which was ok but everything else was meh...

If it was just decent I may go back and I understand every place has an off night but this was so far off I don't know if we will go back.

On the plus side and the reason for 2 stars is the service was very good and extremely friendly.
