I knew I was in trouble when I walked in this place.

This is an upscale version of Taco Bell.

I was coming back to my home, and thought it would be a nice gesture to buy a Mexican lunch for my landscaping crew. 

The food is very inexpensive; a taco plate with two chicken tacos, rice and beans for $2.99 and a plate with two chese enchiladas with rice and beans for $3.99.

The food was prepared fresh, but it had a total Gringo Taste. The proof; my crew are all from Mexico. They were honest and said it was Taco Bell quality, but they were hungry, so it passed.

I will not return to this place.
