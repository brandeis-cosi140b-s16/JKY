Eating at SumoMaya was overall a big disappointment last evening as it was our first time.  Service was the most challenging part of this evening and I learned from Eli the manager that they work in teams.  This was quite puzzling since we had one waitress and only one bus boy who delivered water once.  After all of the appetizers were eaten and cleared, it took over 30 minutes to deliver the main dishes and our waitress did not even know they had not been delivered. This system and the main dishes not being as good as the appetizers is why I think it is not worth the noise level, service incompetency and price.
