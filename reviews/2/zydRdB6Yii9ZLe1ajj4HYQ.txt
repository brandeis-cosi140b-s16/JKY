I've been hearing about this place for awhile now, so I finally get I and place my orders.
Chips were piping hot but lacked a good hot sauce to dip them into,
Beef tacos were good just not as good as a taco truck as had been told, rice. An beans, just soso. Was happy for jalape√±os and carrots just wished the whole meal were a little more spicy
