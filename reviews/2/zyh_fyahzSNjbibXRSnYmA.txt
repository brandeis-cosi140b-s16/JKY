Definitely not the best Mexican food I have ever had.  The portions seemed pretty small based on what they charged and the flavors were pretty bland.  I had the cheese enchiladas with rice and beans.  The enchiladas had hardly any sauce and were very greasy.  The rice was really blah and I didn't even touch the beans.  On the up side though the service was great!  Very fast and very friendly.
