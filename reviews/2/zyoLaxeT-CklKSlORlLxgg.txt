I've eaten here many times and normally the food and service is fine but today they were off. They could not make an order right to save their life and the guacamole was gross and not worth the money. 

I cannot eat gluten and I told the first person in line that I needed corn tortillas because of that and she clearly didn't listen because half way through the meal I realized I was eating flour. So now I'm going to suffer physically for that. My friend got a bunch of corn salsa poured on her order and they looked at her like it was a huge inconvenience to correct their mistake. The guacamole was too citrus tasting and the texture was off. 

I hope this isn't a sign of things to come for this location.
