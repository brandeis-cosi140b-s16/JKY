Probably the best Del-Taco within a significant radius in this part of town.  This place is the cleanest, with nicest staff, and food is much faster and better tasting for fast food.  It's the closest to how I remember del Taco being a decade ago when I first tried them.  For the exact opposite experience, go to the one on 59th ave & Beardsley.
