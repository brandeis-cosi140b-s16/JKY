La Parilla Suiza is a nice authentic breath of fresh air in Phoenix. Everything from the food, to the atmosphere, and people who work there give it a Mexico city vibe. A great place to take out of towners who want a taste of the west, or someone who loves Mexican food. The only downside? Service hasn't been great when I was there.
