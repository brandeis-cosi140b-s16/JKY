If I must say so myself, the margaritas are good, the fajitas were above average and the chips and salsa were decent.

Now I love Mexican places I can walk too and have a few margaritas and then walk home, but two medium house margaritas and chicken fajitas later my bill was 40 bucks. I would be better off get a cab and meeting friends closer to uncc or north lake where food is the same if not better and way better prices. Will try again in a few weeks, but I would advise going in with the knowledge it's not your typical neighborhood mexican priced place.
