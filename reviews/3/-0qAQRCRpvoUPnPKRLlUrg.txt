I've been coming to Oaxaca for a couple of years.  Before the remodel it was little more than a greasy spoon with great mexican fare.  After the remodel, I felt like I needed to dress up a little, the place is so classy!

Luckily the food is still great!  I ordered the chicken soup, which was delicious, albeit sort of cold.  Very savory though.  I would definitely order it again, and next time a bigger bowl.

Although we didn't sit there, the new bar looks like it would offer a good time.  Lots of tvs and a welcoming atmosphere.  It might be a good place to watch a game or meet men watching a game. :)  

The last time I was here though...it took 20 minutes to get our tab...on a very very slow Saturday afternoon.  We had to ask several times.  But I will definitely go back as the food is so darn good.
