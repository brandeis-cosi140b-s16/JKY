Bueno Burger had a rough night when I was there.  Only one side of the grill was working and there were a lot of patient customers.  We were given a complimentary dessert for our patience.  The dessert was something called Bueno Bites.  It was dough deep fried then rolled in cinnamon and sugar with a caramel dipping sauce.  Delicious.

My burger was one of their specialty burgers and it was made Glendale Style.  It was a good burger.  It should have come out piping hot but it was warm.

Bueno Burger advertises they cook with misquite wood.  Cool.

I will be back.  I hope everything is in working order next time.
