I thought to myself, "Well this should be an adventure!" when I pulled up. Doesn't look to great from the outside but I just had a very nice meal thanks to a restaurant.com coupon. I got a the biggest fajita dish I could find! Cooked the crap out of the shrimp, so I recommend just the chicken and steak kind. You get 3 different types of salsa when you sit down, so for a dip fiend like me, that's a positive (although 2 out of the 3 were too hot for me). Their guacamole is excellent. Flan, not so much. Definitely worth a shot though. I see a sign for $1 tacos on Tuesdays which sounds awesome. Will probably come back.
