Ok place.  Sorry I expected more you the reviews.  Nachos were average. We ordered cheeseburger nacho plate. The hamburger meat tasted like Taco Bell beef - which is not a bad thing. Super light on The lettuce and tomato. No sauce on the nachos, kinda dry.  We asked for a side of salsa.  The salsa was good!

I ordered a fresh margarita and it was very tangy.  I drank about half of it.

We sat at the bar and the bartender was great.  She was very friendly and kept my water glass full.

Lots of families in the restaurant dining area.  Clean bathrooms.
