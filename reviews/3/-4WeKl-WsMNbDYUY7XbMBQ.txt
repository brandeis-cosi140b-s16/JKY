always clean never too packed aside from late night munchie crowds. I got the carne Masada combo with rice and beans. no complaints here. located in a good part of town by the 215. for $8.00 it is much sometimes. sometimes if you get the females at the register they seem to cook you more for your dollar. I come once a week or so but its worth it.
