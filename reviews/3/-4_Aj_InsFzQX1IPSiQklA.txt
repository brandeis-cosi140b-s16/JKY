Parking was absolutely atrocious,  had to park forever far away and walk. I ordered a shrimp dish and the shrimp was badly over cooked. I had to send it back for the chile verde, which was delicious. Margaritas were great. I think the prices are high for the quality. Nice bathrooms and great service though!
