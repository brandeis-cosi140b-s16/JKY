I want to give this place more stars but just found the place OK.  My wife did love her chicken caesar salad...but how hard is that kind of dish?  I had three different kinds of tacos (the waitress suggested this when I could not decided).  I was really looking forward to this but nothing about the dish made me say wow.  I think I enjoyed the tacos at Tacos El Gordo more for much cheaper of a price.  The best part of our meal was our appetizer of plantain empanadas...yummmm...that I could eat every day for sure.
