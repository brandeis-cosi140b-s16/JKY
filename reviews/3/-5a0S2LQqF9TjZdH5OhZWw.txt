I go here occasionally when in the area, and always enjoy it when in the mood for a standard big plate of Mexican food, chips/salsa, and table side prepared guacamole.  Food was fine, but we had extremely good service by a very pleasant woman server at lunch last week, as well as all the others who waited on us during the meal.
