If you want traditional mexican then find another place. But if your like Modern mexican/Tex-mex, then check this place out.   

I tender to order the same things at restaurants that I frequent and Cantina is no different. Fresh made gaucamole is great but don't skip on the queso. Their unique twist on traditional queso is to die for. The chicken/steak fajitas are so large, I always end up with a togo box.
