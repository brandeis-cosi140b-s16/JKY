Instead of our regular mexican night at Don Pedro's, some friends and I decided to give this place a try. Decor was interesting. Service was pretty good. The queso dip was fantastic! The food wasn't extraordinary, but wasn't terrible. I ordered the Gordo burrito with beef. Nothing spectacular. I was a little disappointed. I think I've had better burritos from a food truck to say the least.The rice and beans were lacking in flavor. I think it's safe to say we will be returning to Don Pedro's.
