We were here to see a friends band play (The Garage Boys, great band btw) the location was a little hard to find.

The staff were very friendly, the drinks were good, the prices were not stupid as some strip locations can be.

The setting on the patio was nice, we managed to grab a couple of sofas for us and the band when they were on break, the sound system isn't the best, but it worked well enough.

I can't comment on the food, we had already eaten and were there just for the music.

The one bad thing was, right after the last set, security came around and ordered, not asked us to leave, literally 2 minutes after the last song, not even time to finish the drinks, sad way to end the night.
