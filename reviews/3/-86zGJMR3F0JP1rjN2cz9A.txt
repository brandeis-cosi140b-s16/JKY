while the service we had was good (the girl brought refills quickly and took our order correctly and quickly) and the environment wasn't bad. The patio had a very nice fire pit that was warm and toasty for a cold night. 

the food, on the other hand, wasn't much to write home about. the chimichanga was bland (needed salsa to kick it up a bit) and the guac was something i could get in any store ( if it weren't for the chunks of avocado, i would have thought it was a mix made with sour cream and a powder) and the chocolate chimis for dessert weren't that great, even with the cinnamon. 

i didn't go during happy hour, so i can't advise you on that, but the drinks my father had seemed to do the trick. 

all in all, its just ok. will it feed you decent food, yeah.
will the service be good, yeah. 
but if you are looking for authentic mexican, don't come here. or if you want spicy food.
