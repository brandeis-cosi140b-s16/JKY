I like it. Prefer to Taco Bell because DT has better hot sauce, IMO. 

They are usually great at the drive-thru here, but last night we sprang for the higher-priced tacos to get the sour cream and tomatoes. TOMATOES? CHECK. SOUR CREAM? NOPE. Obviously not worth a drive back for twelve cents of product, but easy enough to Yelp about the experience. 

Love the jalapeno rings. Hot, not like most of the jalapeno popper-type items at most place.
