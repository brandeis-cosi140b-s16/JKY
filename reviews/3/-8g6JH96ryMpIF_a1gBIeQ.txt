I was in town for my sisters graduation. Had some lunch here, wasn't bad but nothing memorable. Reminded me of an El Compadre of Arizona but less tasty. Not to many people in here on a Friday afternoon for lunch but from the looks of this place it gets busy at night where they feature local "mexican artists". Next time?
