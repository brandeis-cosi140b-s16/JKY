My server was very attentive and a delight in general. The food however still was not what I have been looking for in Las Vegas. I ordered my fail safe dish of cheese enchiladas with rice and beans. That being said it was still good, just not the best. I'm beginning to think that the only great Mexican food I am going to find will be back home in LA. Would I come back? Possibly.
