Chipotle. I'm sure it aggravates the owner to be compared to them, but that's what they are.  Not sure who came up with the concept first, but obviously Chipotle is bigger. The food overall was OK. Nothing to write home about and I think the prices are comparable.   The tortilla was a little gummy, but everything seemed to be fresh. The guac was decent.
