Spacious restaurant with fun d√©cor.  Plenty of servers and fast service.  We had a party of 20 after Aloha Fest down the street.  Reasonable prices and food was good. We ordered taco plates for the kids.  It came with 4 mini taco shells and your choice of protein in a bowl so they could make their own tacos, that was fun. The taco meat had good seasoning.  The free chips were fresh and the spicy salsa had a good kick.
