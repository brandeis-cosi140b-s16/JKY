Reeehhhhehhhh... I'm glad I went to satiate my curiosity, but probably wouldn't go out of my way to go back. 

From the outside you'd really think this place was fast food, Chipotle-style. I guess that's what I was looking forward to and expecting. It's a fairly nice sit-down place with good service, a full and fancy bar, and an open and airy pretty space. 

I guess for the money I was just expecting a bit more. When you pay around $11 for a burrito, you want it to knock your socks off. For around $11 you should quite literally be eating that burrito sockless. 
The mahi mahi tacos were better, but needed to be snazzed up by hand as well.  I guess really this is more of a DIY non-authentic Mexican food type of place.  I WANT SOME HEAT!

I think next time I'd hop on the 17 north for a few miles and slide on over to DEL TACO OHHH YEAHHHH.
