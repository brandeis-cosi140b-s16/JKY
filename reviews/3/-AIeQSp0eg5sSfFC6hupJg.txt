This place is ok. I had a Groupon and decided to check it out. 

I tried the chicken burrito, while my fella ordered the chicken enchiladas. My burrito was ok, a little lacking in flavor, but I did ask for the salsa on the side, so that could be my fault. Once I poured some of the green stuff on there, it was pretty good. My fella's enchiladas stole the show. They were melty and cheesy, just how I like them! They were filled to the brim with moist and meaty chicken. It was all white meat, we were quite surprised and impressed. This was my favorite thing about the meal. 

This isn't authentic Mexican food by any stretch of the imagination and I think some of their dishes lack flavor, but it was still pretty good for the price.

Not a big fan of the decor. It's obviously targeting a younger crowd, which is fine. A little too scuffed up and graffiti'd for my taste. Boy, do I sound old! Haha

Overall, pretty good experience. I probably wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again, but if I'm in the area or have another Groupon on my hands, I'm totally there.
