Since I have only been to Cafe Rio Mexican Grill on two occasions I am going to keep this review as short as possible. If the score was based on food alone, Cafe Rio would slide by with five stars. Unfortunately my scores are based on service, price, and cleanliness too. Las Vegas, we have a problem.

Sure I'd rather eat at Cafe Rio than Baja Fresh, On The Border, and Lindo Michoacan (pardon spelling if wrong, I don't care enough to look up that over-priced mess-taurant's name up). But the problem is that the staff (including the cooks) are rude and the place is dirty. I remember several months ago when I had to drive by the place everyday there were stacks of boxes and garbage in the back. I've worked in restaurants for years and we always broke down the boxes. There is a specific bad experience that one of my family members had at this location with some of the cooks. None of your business.

If all you care about is good Mexican food, go to Cafe Rio. But heed my warning that you might be paying a lot of money to fill your stomach if you are anything like me. The perfect (well... maybe not PERFECT) Friday Night : Marvin Gaye, candles, and a sweet pork barbacoa taco from Cafe Rio Mexican Grill.
