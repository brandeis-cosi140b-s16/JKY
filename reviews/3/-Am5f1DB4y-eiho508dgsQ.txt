Green Chile Burrito Combo - excellent; meat well seasoned and the tortilla is stuffed with sauce and veggies.
Breakfast Burrito -  Eggs, taters and stuff. Really good.
Sauces - Hot or mild they are very tasty.
Black Beans - best tasting part of the meal.
White Rice - inviting...must have mayonnaise in there somewhere.
Service - Sometimes overwhelming but courteous and fast.
Not a destintion restauant if you don't live close but well worth a visit.
