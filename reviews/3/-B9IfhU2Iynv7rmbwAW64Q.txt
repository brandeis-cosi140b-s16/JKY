As a UNLV student, this place has one of the best deals around. 5 tacos, 2 sides and a drink for $5, and the tacos are really good.  They are traditional street tacos, so on the smaller side, but they don't skimp you on the meat.  It's a fun place to go with friends, get a bucket of beers, and sit around and chat.  It's order at the counter, and they'll call your number when your food is ready.  I think that they also have either live music or a DJ on some nights, usually Latin themed, shocking, I know...
