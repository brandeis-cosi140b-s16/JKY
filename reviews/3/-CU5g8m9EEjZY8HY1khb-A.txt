I live nearby but have only eaten here a few times.  They recently made the transition to a full-service restaurant, but I must say, I preferred the convenience of ordering at the counter.  I also miss the chips and salsa bar!  The food is decent, but nothing to write home about.  The carne asada tacos, and green chile burros are pretty good, but stay away from the flautas and chimichangas which are pretty flavorless.
