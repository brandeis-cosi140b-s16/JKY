Got the veggie burro a few times, and each time I got it, the less I liked it.

I know my tortillas, and it seems to me that they are using the old school ones with TONS of trans fat. (still awaiting an email response)

Only thing I really liked was the salsa.

Meh, I will pass on this place in the future.
