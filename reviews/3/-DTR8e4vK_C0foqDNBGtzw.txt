We stupidly decided to have my husband's birthday get together there without having gone for several months. We thought it would be fun to have a group upstairs for drinks and dinner. When we got there we were sadly disappointed. There was a really strange smell that got worse as we were led to the banquet room because the upstairs bar area has been closed down. The food was good, not great. They had no drink specials going on at the time, although I could've sworn that the website said that they had happy hour on Saturdays . One of the water pitchers was cracked and ended up leaking quite a bit before we realized what was happening. The real saving grace was our waitress, whose name I forgot to write down and therefore have since forgotten, she was so accommodating and quick with the refills and to get us a new pitcher that didn't leak. She is the reason I added an extra star to my review.
