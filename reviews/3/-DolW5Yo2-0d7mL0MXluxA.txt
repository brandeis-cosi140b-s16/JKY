This is right around the corner from me, and I go there often. 

The only reason why I would give this place 3 stars is because of the service. 
Otherwise, the food is good. 

It's my #1 choice over any other fast Mexican food around here. Their meat spices are good, everything is always fresh and I LOVE their queso here. A lot of people don't like this type of queso, but I love white cheese queso.

The nachos are always my #1 favorite. Other than that, I usually get the rice bowls. 

The reason I have a distaste for the customer service - 

There is a couple of ladies there that are almost always rude. They give you a look like you're inconveniencing them and they act like they hate their job. It's cool, I understand. I hate my job too. But, I don't treat my customers like shit because it's my fault I hate my job, not theirs. 

There is one in particular that always is hateful. She never says hello, never asks what she can help me with and she has always screwed up my order. I tell her what I want, and she always puts something else. I hate to be a bother, so I never complain and I finally told her last time that that's what not what I had said. She seemed annoyed and I told her it was okay and that I didn't want her to change it. I don't like being rude to people, even if they're rude to me first. 

It sucks because I really don't like the other places around here, so I keep going back. I just mentally prepare myself before going in knowing my experience won't be the best. Maybe it's just me...
