Quality of food vs cleanliness......oh how tortured is the reviewer!
So, I had a $5 Stations food credit and haven't tried the food here yet.  
 The 2 shrimp taco plate with rice, beans & soda is $5.99.  Not bad.
Very good shrimp tacos and beans, the rice was OK. Their salsa bar has many varieties. 
I noticed some trash on the counter that wasn't removed while I was there. The cooking area could've used a hose down too.
The cashier mentioned how busy it had been, so maybe no time to remove straw wrappers that were right in front of the register. My order was to go and the cook/chef presented it to me not to go. She boxed it up, no problem. 
There was a bug in my soda so I threw it out. 
Meh.
