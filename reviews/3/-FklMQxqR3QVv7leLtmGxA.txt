The place needs an overhaul. The salsa bar is wedged in the corner and it has probably felled a bunch of people with salsa being out without for awhile. Move it away from that area and add some exciting stuff, not the usual watery green and red crap. Does anybody have the balls to make some exciting salsa's in Vegas? I usually get the Chicken nachos, but today I opted for chicken Burrito. Strange in that the burrito only includes cheese I think and a veggie mix of peppers for $5. I added rice for .50 cents, but burritos are not their strongpoint. Was a pretty soggy burro all the way through and the tiny bit of rice they included had a hard time holding up the shredded chicken. Kinda had a sour feeling after eating there today, but no permanent damage. PLace just seems stale and needs a refreshing of some sort in the dining room. eating at the bar is the way to go and what is with all the Ethopians or whatever crowding the sidewalk at that strip mall. How do all these people get into our country? No americans wil ever eat their food, so it's like they aren't really assimilating, they are just coming here opening up their own place and hanging out in front of their place all day. What a country. Oh yeah, burrito was kinda small too, for a buck more go to Chiptole and you will be full, but here stick to the nachos because those are actually worth the price.
