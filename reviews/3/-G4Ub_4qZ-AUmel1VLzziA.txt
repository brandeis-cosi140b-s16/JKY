it was back during my first year as a graduate student and my study budies were hungry after tons of hours studying at Memorial library. It was midnight and most of the libraries were closed. So, we were trying to find a good spot to study and to munch to keep us awake. None of the coffee shops were open so destiny took us to this place. It was obviously not a study spot, but was indeed an affordable and delicious food place. We had some tacos, with a basket of free chips. 
That night, we were thankful. 

On my next visits, I gotta try some other menus, like chicken quesadillas and tortas with chicken. The latter came in a big portion so I needed a box to go!
 their boing was refreshing!

As much as I enjoyed the food here, I was reluctant to give it a four or five star rate, as ehm, they need to work on the cleanliness of the restaurant. 
It isn't that dirty, but not clean either.
