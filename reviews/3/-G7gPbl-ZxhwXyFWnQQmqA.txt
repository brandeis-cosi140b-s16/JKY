Winding down our last night in town, our group decided that dinner was in order, and it needed to be Mexican. After doing some Yelping, and finding that it was one of the only places open that fairly cheap, and had a diverse enough menu to cater to everyone, we decided to head to Emilianos Mexican Grill & Bar. After about a ten minute cab ride from downtown, we were ready to feast.

After arriving, we were seated promptly, and given our complimentary chips and salsa. As far as the menu goes, this place has all the standard offerings you would find at any similar Mexican restaurant, not that that is a bad thing necessarily. The food itself was pretty tasty, and I made sure to clean my plate. Is it something insanely awesome? Not really, but it does the trick.

Along with the good food and service, Emilianos was exceptionally clean, which is always a plus when dining out. If I lived in the area, I could see myself dining here a lot.
