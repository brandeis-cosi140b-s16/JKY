Food was great but the service was just "ok".  Russel was our server.   We were sat at a table that needed to be cleaned.   We were told 3x someone would clean and finnaly our server did .

The margaritas were rely tasty.   The queso bean dip was amazing.

I have eaten here at least 10x and it's always pretty good.  This time the service kinda sucked, but hey I'll be back
