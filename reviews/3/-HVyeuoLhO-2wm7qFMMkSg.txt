It's painfully obvious that Cafe Tranquilo is still working out the kinks with the sudden change in management/name. My boyfriend and I came here Sunday evening around 10pm and the place was pretty dead (which we expected). I hadn't been to Gallo Blanco in a very long time, which is regrettable since I live right near The Clarendon. 

The good: The food is great. I ordered the chopped salad and loved the jalapeno dressing. My boyfriend ordered carne asada tacos, which he enjoyed. The tacos did come with an awfully large amount of salsa compared to the size of the tacos (street taco size). Weird. He ordered 2 and wished he had ordered more because 2 does not a meal make! 

The bad: Service. While our server was certainly a nice person, for some reason our beers did not come until after our food was served. It's just beer, so I do not understand why we waited so long. Plus, we were one of a whopping 2 tables dining (not counting the few people at the bar). We also had to request silverware. 

I admit that I was expecting to hate this place based on other reviews that I read. It is not Gallo Blanco, but was anyone expecting it to be the same place? If you adjust your expectations a notch and go in knowing that this is a different restaurant, albeit has a similar menu. Overall, the food quality is there, the service could use some improvement.
