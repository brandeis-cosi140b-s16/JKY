Average Mexican food.  Nothing to write home about.  Chips were good and so were the salsa.  The refried beans were excellent.  So much flavor. 

We started with the Mexican potato skins.  These were really good.  Crispy potato skin with cheese and different meats.  They give you 3 of them, one chicken, one pork, and one ground beef.  The beef one was the best.  The ground beef was really good.  A good amount of spices. 

The wife had a cheese enchilada and a chicken taquito plate.  She liked the enchilada, but didn't like the taquito.  The chicken inside was good, but they really scimped on the size.  They only gave you one.   I ordered the chile relleno and a beef taquito.  I liked the taquito, but the size is just not worth it.  The chile relleno was not good.  It was poblano stuffed with cheese and then an egg batter crusted on the top of it and baked.  So disappointing. 

Overall just an average Mexican restaurant meal.
