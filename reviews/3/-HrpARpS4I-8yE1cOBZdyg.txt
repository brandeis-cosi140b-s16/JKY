It really isn't as great or high praised as people make it seem. It's expensive for the little food they give you. They give you little food, and hella lettuce to make it look big and full but it really isnt a lot. Youll get full off the lettuce alone and even then theres so little rice and beans that you'll be able to eat that too. Its very loud incredibly crowded and busy. If you do get the nachos, it seems to be the only thing they actually give you a lot of.
