Solid tex-mex. I usually head to Don Pedros or Azteca when the craving for a Nopales burrito hits but this place works just as well.

They do good business at lunch, but the space is cavernous, so there's never a wait. Slaw and watery salsa in your face immediately as you sit. Optional white rice, if you ask. They're cool about being picky, so you can request all three sauces on your 'rito, if you'd like, or get fresh AND pickled jalapenos, or add veggies, no cheese, etc. 

Nothing's particularly deeply flavored or spicy, but for 5 bucks, Margaritas lunch can't be beat.
