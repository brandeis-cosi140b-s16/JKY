I expected more... Food is pretty good , but does not stack up to the hype. Decor is pretty cool if you are in to the whole "dead" thing... I must have come on an off night. It's like a giant bus from Sun City stopped by and unloaded a bunch of old people into this place. I kid you not.. Oh and the real kick in the balls was when they came with the check... 3 entress and 4 margarita comes to $103.63!!! WTF...
