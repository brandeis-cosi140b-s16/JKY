After 4 hours of playing, I was ready for a to have a sit down meal instead of a burger. I suggested Raul and Teresa. I do live in Chandler, but have spent a lot of time on the west side. I was craving Chile Colorado (red chile con carne).  I've eaten at Raul and Teresa, but  never posted a review. Waitress was good at her job and made sure we had everything we need. After placing out orders the standard chips and salsa was delivered. Nothing special and a little bit on the small side container of chips and the salsa contained a bit much oregano which was usual to my knowledge to even be in the salsa. Meals came shortly after. I order number 23 which consisted of chili Colorado, rice, and refried beans.  The order also came with flour tortillas. I immediately tried the rice with a little of chili Colorado and too my disappointment the sauce tasted of flour and no real spice. My next taste was tortilla and chili Colorado with the meat hoping for s better result. Well same results flour taste and no    Real taste of chili Colorado. Meat was okay, a little bit much in the connective meat. So I was disappointed in the main entree but the rice was good and beans okay. Service was the best part, very pleasant!
