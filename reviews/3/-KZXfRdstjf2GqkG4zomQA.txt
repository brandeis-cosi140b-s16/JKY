Tried this place out after driving by it everyday for the past year. Tried a bacon breakfast burrito. It was a little pricey compared to my usual Los Favoritos. The burrito was average. Very salty and had a weird aftertaste. It was not horrible but also not preferred. The lighting was a little weird too. Felt like I was at a disco. The fans are located right under a light. So the light would flash like a strobe light. I got my order to go, but eating there would have been a challenge of I stayed.
