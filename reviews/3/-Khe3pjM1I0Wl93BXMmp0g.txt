The best Mexican food option in the immediate Paradise Valley Mall area, but only because there really aren't any others. Carolina's, a great casual choice, is a couple miles west on Cactus. Closer by? Well, Taco Bell at Tatum & Shea? Okay. Chipotle and Qdoba, but they don't really count as Mexican restaurants in my book. Maybe the mall food court?

I do like Julio G's lunch menu. Lots of choices. Generously portioned. Reasonably priced. It also doubles as the senior menu any time of day (photo posted).

I also like the kids menu. Drink included. Numerous choices all $5 or less (photo posted).

Service is, for the most part, friendly and attentive.

The quality and presentation of the food is fine. I'm just not a fan of the restaurant's use of seasonings, or lack thereof, starting with the chips and salsa. A mild salsa and a hot sauce are presented with chips immediately after being seated, but neither salsa is particularly flavorful. The enchilada sauce? It's kid friendly (not a compliment). I find myself blending the salsas and adding them to whatever I've ordered to try to compensate for a general lack of zest. For those not wanting much heat in their Mexican food, Julio G's is a decent choice.

Julio's Too, next door, is a nice convenience. The menu and prices are pretty much the same as the main restaurant, but it's a taco shop style space designed for easy carry out or for having a quick bite.
