Solid, but lacking that little something that could make a spot like this special.

We started off with chips and salsa. Liked the multicolored chips, but they were a little stale and served cold. Made me a little sentimental about the chips at Blue Burrito which used to be located nearby. Served with green and red salsas that could be characterized as Scottsdale bland.

We opted for a couple of tacos and a quesadilla. The blackened chicken quesadilla was definitely the highlight of the meal, but the tacos. a carne asada and a blackened chicken, were just average. Disappointing also in that my request for two types of tortillas was not honored. The whole wheat tortillas were thin and dry, good for me I suppose, but nothing special and not what I ordered. The chicken taco also had quite a runoff of mystery fluid that filled my basket, a major taco pet peeve of mine. I'd also appreciate easier access to some salsa to help doctor the tacos as needed, not just a bottle of pepper sauce on the table.

No kids with us on this visit, but they do have chicken fingers ($4.99) and Cheese Quesadillas ($4.50) served with a choice of rice, beans or fries for children. No drink included.

They also serve alcohol, with a happy hour from 3-6 p.m. weekdays. They serve domestic and imported beers, as well as a house margarita and other specialty drinks. 

Ordering can be a bit slow, as we fell in behind some carryout orders at the counter on this visit, but service is quick once an order is placed. 

The staff here is always nice. I suspect if I ate here more often my review would gradually become more glowing just because of their friendly attitude. I will definitely come back. Just not that often with so many other good Mexican grills and restaurants available in metro Phoenix.
