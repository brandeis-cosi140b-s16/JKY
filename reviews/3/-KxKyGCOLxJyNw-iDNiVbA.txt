This is the slowest Chipotle of all time. There is always, always more people waiting in line than eating in the restaurant. I've narrowed it down to 3 possible factors:

1) Staff incompetence
2) Customer incompetence
3) Abundance of online orders or as I call them "the invisible line"

I'm assuming it's a combination of the 3. I can't rule out staff incompetence because I've been there when they've run out of chicken not once but twice while I was waiting in line.  Number 2 is always a bottleneck, for reasons unbeknownst to anyone. It is 2015, if you don't know how to order at Chipotle by now you should be deported.  Number 3 is probably also a huge factor, and one that I'm about to contribute to because if I have to walk into a 20 minute line at 4PM one more time I will do something crazy, like walk out of a Chipotle without eating. Scary thought.

Anyway, Chipotle is one of my main food groups so it's never going to drop below 3 stars, but the wait at this location is so frustrating and I have yet to remember to order online first so I'm going to have to rank them on the lower end of Chipotle Goodness. Just okay.
