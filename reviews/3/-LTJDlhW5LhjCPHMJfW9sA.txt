My family consists of 5 Serrano's regulars and we all love the food dearly. It is with serious dismay that I give this location 3 stars. I've been to this one much more than usual since it is closest to my new home, but holy shizen is the service terrible. There are two waiters, one male in the dining room and one female primarily in the bar that are attentive, friendly, and give a serious hustle. But literally everyone else that I've had at my table - bussers, waiters, & hosts included have been incredibly awkward and slow. I'm not a fan of sitting for two hours at a restaurant and I definitely don't want to be harassed about the number of chips I eat relative to my boyfriend by a sassy, teenage bus boy. Not only did he stop by the table about nine times to talk to us and not SERVE us, but he was rude and extremely awkward each and every time. I'll always choose the downtown Chandler location if I can but sometimes just have to suck up the service for a good taco.
