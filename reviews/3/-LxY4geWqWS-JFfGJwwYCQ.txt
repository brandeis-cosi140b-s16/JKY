After visiting once I thought everything was OK, but wanted to give La Paz a second shot before my review. With that said, it didn't change. Overall, everything was just okay. The chips were blah, not real hot and not real fresh, just okay. I did enjoy the salsa. As for my entrees, I chose the fajitas and there were about four pieces of chicken and a plate of veggies. Where was the chicken? Accompanied with pretty blah rice and beans. However, I did enjoy the side of guacamole. 
The location is a lot nicer than the old South Blvd. location, but as I felt at that location, they don't have the flavor and freshness they did years ago. With so many New Mexican restaurants out there, I wish they would focus on better tasting food.
