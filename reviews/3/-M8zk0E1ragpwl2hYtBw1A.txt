Had the supreme nachos and a cheese quesadilla for the kids.  The supreme nachos were nothing special.  They were the typical store bought round tortilla chips, with standard nacho cheese sauce, very skinny and overdone pieces of carne asada, and other garnishments.  By the time the top layer was off, the chips were saturated in generic cheese sauce and soggy.  The cheese quesadilla was your standard quesadilla.  I don't know what I was expecting, but these are things we could have ordered at any snack bar.  They were good, just not the quality you would expect from this food truck craze.
