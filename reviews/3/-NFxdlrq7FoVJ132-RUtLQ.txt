I found this place to be a tad pricey but you certainly get a lot of food for your money. This would be optimal if you were somehow able to salvage what would be left of your burrito to eat later, but unfortunately I found this to not be the case. Overall, it was a decent meal, the meat on my burrito was the best part. However, avoid the salsa! It just tastes like it wasn't meant to go on food.
