My wife and I frequent this place quite a bit. We enjoy it, we know what we are getting into when we go here, good prices for good portions of good food. 

Nothing lights out, but filling and, for the most part, authentic. 

The location is a little weak, you have to really want to go to Top Shelf to go to Top Shelf, as it is tucked just deeply enough into the NW Peoria Suburbs that its almost not worth it. 

I really enjoy the chicken burrito fundido. I'm just saying.
