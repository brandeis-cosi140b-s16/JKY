I stepped out of my comfort zone of carby, cheesey grease and tried the fish taco (orange roughy) combo.  It was good.  The fish was not breaded and was cooked perfectly.  I could have done without the rice and beans to save calories, but those were good too.  They give a mayonaisey salsa mixture to put in your tacos.  It was pretty good, but I think fresh lemons or limes to squeeze over the tacos would have been better.  

If you are not a carb queen, this was a good choice and relatively healthy.
