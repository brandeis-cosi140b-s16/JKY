We eat here pretty often as it's close to my husbands work. The staff there are all very friendly, lots of smiles. Friendly but not too chatty which is what I like. We get a lot for your money, and I think it's tasty. 

There are several different things to chose from if your vegetarian, which is important for us. The reason I decided to review today was because after two+ years going there for dinner, we received meat in a vegetarian dish for the second time yesterday. The first time, was about six months ago. I ordered a burrito with beans only. I didn't inspect it before sticking a bite in my mouth (I was talking, not look at food) and I ended up with a huge mouthful of ground beef. I haven't eaten meat in 20 years so I was pretty disgusted and spit it out onto to my plate. They did take that dish of our bill, and offered to replace but I had completely lost my appetite. I have ordered that dish a ton since that, with no issues, although I always check it before I bite in.
So last night, we ordered a vegetarian combo. It comes with a mushroom quesadilla. As I was chomping into the leftovers today, I bit into a huge chunk of chicken! Just one stray piece of chicken. Gross! Spit it out...

So I feel really torn about that place because when the food is right its good and the wait staff are so friendly. Two times biting into meat in the same restaurant is pretty off putting though... I haven't had this happen at any other restaurants in Pittsburgh and have lived here 5 years and eat out a lot.
