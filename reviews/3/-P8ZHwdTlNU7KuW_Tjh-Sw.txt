This place has a ton of flat screens around the bar and throughout the restaurant, with a huge projection screen in another raised enclave.  There is an outdoor bar with surrounding tables but I didn't notice any tv screens outside.  The seats @ the indoor bar suck, so I lobbied for a booth.  (The bar seats were like retro, high chairs that lacked a back you could lean into a lil too high, even for my legs).

Happy hour included a few 1/2 priced appetizers that the waitress highlighted.  She also provided a thorough explanation of speechless communication that would ensure our miller lites continued.  If you face the empty bottle @ the end of the table with the label facing outward, she'd pick up the empties for replacement.  I only forgot about this rule once & received a fresh bottle while I still had a 1/4 bottle left.

No clue how much the beers were but the deal seemed pretty good, since we had @ least 10 beers & an appetizer for $30.  The folks there seemed to run a tidy & expedient little operation and overall my experience was a'ight.
