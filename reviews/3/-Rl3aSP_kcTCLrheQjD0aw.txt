Very good service ! The guys were awesome very patient & recommended a few of their fav items 
Free chips & salsa is always a bonus.  $2.50 all day happy hour margaritas is a nice touch.  The mild salsa is tasty but the hot is a little to hot and bland I mixed the two and it was just right.  I'll be back
