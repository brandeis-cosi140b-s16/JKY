Four of us had dinner here and we all felt a three was a an accurate rating.  The food was OK with average flavor.  The staff was nice and addressed complaints efficiently.  One dinner was so greasy and tasteless it had to be sent back but they were very gracious.  I enjoyed my cheese enchiladas with an egg but the fish tacos were average and the chicken salad was average.  We would probably eat here again but would not crave it or trust taking guests again.
