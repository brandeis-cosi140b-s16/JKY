We ordered at 7:30pm on a Saturday night and our food arrived around 9:10pm. Slow delivery, but the restaurant did text me to keep me updated and let me know when the driver left for our delivery which was nice. We ordered the beef soup, which ended up being more of a stew but it was pretty good. Quesadilla was cold and bland. Ordered a shrimp ceviche that was decent and got a crab ceviche for free (not sure if that was an error or gift, but fine by me!). The fruit punch was DELICIOUS, definitely get some of that. It has fruit chunks in it and is heavenly. My boyfriend also got a ham sandwich and he seemed happy haha. I guess we forgot to get much actual Mexican food to really try this place out!

I give three stars for the slow delivery and food that was just ok (except the juice - thats pure heaven). Not bad but certainly didnt blow me away either. Also the minimum order of $30 for delivery was a little frustrating. We will try it again thoughfor sure, especially since we somehow forgot to order much real Mexican food!
