The margaritas  can make a woman suddenly sprout  chest hair and possibly a mustache .   (they cost less than $4.00)  Ay Caramba !

I tried a Baja Style fish taco and was asked if I wanted it grilled or fried..so I picked grilled . The taco had more fish than I was expecting and didn't seem oily , inside was a squirt of house sauce and cabbage . The ratio was mostly fish to vegetables .  I also ordered a chili relleno and I DON'T"T KNOW IF they make it this way all the time but they gave me THE BIGGEST CHILI IN ALL THE WORLD ! My battered pepper filled the whole styrofoam plate with soft cheeses and topped with a chili sauce . I had no idea this side order would be a meal by it's self.

The only thing I didn't care for was the mild salsa , (funky... but the others were OK )  maybe it was just off that day .

My husband had a beef taco and ordered one of the new menu items , the chicken and rice stuffed poblano pepper . The pepper was breaded and deep fried and dressed with a cheesy maybe sour cream and chipotle sauce . 

Tortillas and Beans are free of lard here .

Worth a try for a quick casual meal out that is also inexpensive .
