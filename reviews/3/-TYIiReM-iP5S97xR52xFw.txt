We came a group of 7 plus a toddler for lunch and they were very accommodating. The servers were good and the food came fast. However, there are plenty of places in Phoenix that you can get better Mexican food.

This place has been here for 30+ years and I have been here a number of times. Though, I have never been very impressed. The decor could use some serious updating as well.
