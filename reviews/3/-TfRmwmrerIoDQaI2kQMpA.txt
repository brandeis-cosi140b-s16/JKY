Had a pretty decent Breakfast burrito. The menu is gigantic and I was staring at the menu board for like ten minutes. They have over a dozen breakfast burritos and a ton of other unusual items. The salsa bar seemed well stocked, but alot of the items were of the spicy variety (onions and carrots) and two hot salsa's. Anyway, my burrito did not say cheese, but it had eggs, cheese, peppers, onions and I added rice. It was basic, but very filling and rolled tight. Place is tucked away deep in the corner of strip mall, so tough to find, but I wasn't looking for it, so that makes it a better discovery. Most breakfast burros are about $5-$6.
