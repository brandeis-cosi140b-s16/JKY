I headed back to Jalape√±o bricks specifically for their awesome BBQ. I got a pulled pork sandwich and a pound of brisket. Both were awesome as always and the couple who work and own the place are very nice. 

I had to give this place 3 stars because as you can see I got totally duped out of my one pound of brisket. Even with the container it was no where near close to one pound. The meat totaled around 9.6 oz... Which means I missed out on 6.4 ounces of brisket. I even got out a second scale to make sure it was not one pound. Did they not weigh it out?? That makes me worried for all there other things that are 1/3,1/2, or 1 pound. How did that happen? Did it mean one pound before it was cooked? That doesn't seem right because brisket is cooked whole... 

Now I'm sure you think I'm a pain in the butt and being picky but it's only because there brisket is darn good and I want that extra 1/3 of a pound! Hopefully this was a one time thing... Also, the brisket (as shown in the picture) was way dryer than the time before but I overlooked that because they are new and still have a few kinks in their systems. 

So definitely head to JB to get some awesome barbecue but beware of ordering the pulled pork or brisket by the pound. I didn't pay $14 to have a meager little Tin of meat.
