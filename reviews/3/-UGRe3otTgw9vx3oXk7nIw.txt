First time here and I'm not overly impressed. A second visit and different choices might make a difference. 

The Chipotle version for enchiladas, you can build your enchiladas or tacos. I told the girl behind great glass wall of sneeze protection that it was my first time. She didn't seem to care and started rattling off questions that were barely audible over the wall of sneeze protection and drowned out by the blaring Indie Rock. When she zipped through list of the meat fillings as if she had told me 29 times already, I knew I was on my own creating something worth eating. 

I settled on one chicken and one beef enchilada with a green and red sauce on each. Cotija and Creme finished it off. 

The enchiladas were slightly too salty and grease quickly pooled on either side. They just weren't that tasty but is that my fault? Maybe. 

An attractive lady got better treatment being guided through the build process from the scruffy counter guy who projected his voice confidently over the great glass wall of sneeze protection.
