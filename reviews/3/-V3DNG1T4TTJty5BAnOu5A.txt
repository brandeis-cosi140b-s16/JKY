Putting my Mexican restaurant rule to the test, I promised my self I would not judge this place , or any place, until the chips and salsa came out. My rule is (and it almost NEVER fails me) if the chips and salsa aren't good, the food won't be good. Stale, store-bought chips= entrees made with canned, processed ingredients- not fresh ones. Flavorless, ketchup-like salsa= flavorless food you would be better off buying pre-made at the grocery store. Try it out, it works!

After being served our chips and salsa and taking my first eager bite, my conclusion was: Not bad. Not amazing, but not bad. In fact, I only visited this place a week ago and I hardly even rememeber it. That's the kind of impression it made on me. I ordered the Machaca which I usually love, but this seemed to be lacking the flavor and texture I was looking for. The rice and beans aren't bad, but again, not amazing. 

I would recommend this place to people afraid of Mexican food- those that rarely eat it and never venture far away from a ground beef taco. However, if you are like myself and could eat Mexican food all day every day, I would recommend you skip this place and look for the nearest run-down, mom & pop, been-around-for-50-years, Nana still in the kitchen, local kind of place.
