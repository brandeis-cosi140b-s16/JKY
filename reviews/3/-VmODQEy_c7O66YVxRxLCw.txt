First off, the location of this place isn't helping it at all.  It's tucked away behind a huge ugly walled in area, and you can't see it from the street at all.  This isn't a luxurious meal by any means, and when we walked in we took note of all the un-bussed tables filled with dirty plates, etc.  However, we sat down to eat nonetheless.  

The server (who was also the cashier and busser on this day) was very polite and friendly.  He promptly brought over chips and salsa, which were very good.  The food we ordered was good - my wife had fish tacos, I had calamari.  Both portion sizes were large.  Mine came with beans, salad, rice and tortillas.  Our bill was less than $25, so no complaints on the prices either.  This place would probably flourish in a different location, and with more staff.
