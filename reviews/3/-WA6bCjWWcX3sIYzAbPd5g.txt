La Fonda is ok.  The food is your usual choice of Mexican, served up with a healthy dose of grease.  The salsa is average at best and they have been caught reusing salsa, so that is something to think about before you go. 

I also do not recommend getting a Long Island iced tea from this place, unless you consider a Long Island to be bad tequila, bad vodka and some coke.  

I have been here twice and was pretty unimpressed both times, but the place is always busy and has been around for a while, so I might just order all the wrong things.
