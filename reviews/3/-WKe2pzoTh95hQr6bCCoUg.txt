Came back to this place yesterday and noted a few things...

We ordered different food/drinks this time. We got the shrimp ceviche which was good but the shrimp had a really weird texture to it...it wasn't firm the way cooked shrimp is but it had the consistency of clams. It was just weird. We also ordered the chips and guac again and the guac tasted off to me....we added a whole lime and salt to it and it was still just okay. Definitely a downgrade since the first time we went.

The salsa improved thankfully - I actually enjoyed it this time but the chips are still so stale that it hurt to bite into one at times. 

My GF got the Mangochelada which was AMAZING. It's a preparada with mango pieces and a tamarindo straw. I will definitely get that the next time I'm in.

We got a different waitress this time and service was good, which I was happy about so I decided to keep the rating because though some things were improved, others declined. The first time we went the food was amazing but the service sucked; this time the service was great but the food wasn't up to par. There doesn't seem to be a happy medium.
