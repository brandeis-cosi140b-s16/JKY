I have been going here for years. I will go out of my way for their food. The green sauce that they make is the best. There is only one employee that I will now turn around and walk out after today's visit in the afternoon.  Everyone but this guy is awesome.  He was so rude, today especially.  If someone doesn't like customer service work they should get out of it. Instead he causes a bad write up for what is normally a great experience. I would have given a 4 or 5 stars but for this one employee today 9/6/15
