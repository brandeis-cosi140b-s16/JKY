Happy Hour. 

Half price apps and drink specials...minus the shrimp cocktail and their "signature margaritas" Oh and not the chips and salsa...yes, you have to pay for chips and salsa here!  $3 to be exact...who charges for chips and salsa?  

Anywhoooo...we decided to be rebels and opted for the non happy hour drinks because their Sol Rita ($10.00...yikers) is delicious!  A margarita with a bottle of Sol flipped upside down into the glass.  Then each ordered one of their very large in size and in flavor, Shrimp Cocktails.  HUGE shrimp, lettuce, avocado, jalape√±o (not enough for my taste), swimming in their tomato sauce...it's actually pretty tasty.  

Our server was friendly, but could've given us a bit more attention.  She pulled the "I'm gonna stop by their table at 6:58 (happy hour ends at 7) and MAYBE I'll get their order in on time" trick!  We made it though!

We'll be back for Happy Hour again I'm sure...
