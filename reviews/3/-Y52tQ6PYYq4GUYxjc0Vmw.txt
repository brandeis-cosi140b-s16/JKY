Their salsa gets an A+. Not really spicy, but high on taste. The fish tacos are solid and the Posada dishes are tasty. They have plenty of Negra Modelo on tap. My only gripe is with their hours. They close at 9PM on week nights - that might play well in Boise, but we need a little more time eat out here.
