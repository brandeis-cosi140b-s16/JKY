As the name suggest, This mexican restaurant is known for its tortas. I like this place. The torta i  always get is the cubana. Layers of puller pork with different types of ham and healthy portion of sliced avocano to top it all off. I would give this joint a 4 stars but the only reason why i didnt is beacuse most of the tortas doesnt come combo. You will have to order a drink and fries seperate. Oh yeah the fries are the bomb here as well
