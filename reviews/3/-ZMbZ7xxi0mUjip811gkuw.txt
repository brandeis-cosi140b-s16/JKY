I had the grilled fish tacos, eh. Not too impressed. The fish was kinda dry and there was barely any sauce with tons and tons of cabbage. However the rice and beans were very good and the cheese dip was off the chain. I think that if I maybe had gotten flour tortillas instead of corn, or the fried fish tacos it would have been better. Not my best OTB experience.
