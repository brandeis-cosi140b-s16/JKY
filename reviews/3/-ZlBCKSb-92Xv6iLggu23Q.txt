the carne asada is so good we deal with the shit show of employees stumbling over eachother to get it at least once a week. the place def needs a suggestion box, menu is confusing, again employees are just funny how all over the place they are, the manager, haha we laugh at her every time because she's always storming around not helping. good thing the food is so bomb, also careful if you're on your lunch, 2 taco stations one register never seems to pan out in our favor .
