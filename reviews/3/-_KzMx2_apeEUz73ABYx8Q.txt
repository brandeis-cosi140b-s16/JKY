Alright, Revo - you've brought back your yummy rice!  Last night I enjoyed a tasty little cup of creamy white rice with my machaca tacos (yes, the same order as last time).  

The tacos continue to be better eaten at the restaurant than after they've been smashed together in tin foil for To Go orders.  I'm all about saving the planet and reducing waste, but perhaps there's a better packaging solution or technique that would prevent the tortillas from becoming mushy and joined together - giving me one big taco rather than two small ones....  Or maybe I should just order the chicken machaca burrito from now on....

Thanks for fixing the rice! Now the tacos! :) :)
