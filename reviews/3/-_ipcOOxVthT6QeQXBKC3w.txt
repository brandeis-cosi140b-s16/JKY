Okay, so I love Chipotle. Love me or hate me, I don't care. It is the perfect place to get fast food, and -- if you plan it right -- get a decent protein-dense meal. Usually I get a Chipotle salad, half and half meat (they will end up giving you a little more) hot and mild salsa, guac, lettuce, and corn. So yummy.

However, the Oakland location has terrible lines during lunch and dinner. It's because it's in a college area obviously, but still. If you want to get Chipotle from here, go at 4:30. Or 2:30. Just make sure it's not noon or 6pm.
