Very solid Mexican food, almost Tex-Mex style. Heads up, the "fast food" part of the restaurant name is a bit of a misnomer. They can do a takeout order in about 10 minutes, but it's basically a walk-up and dine-in establishment.

Enjoyed their California steak burrito- special item, not on the regular menu. Order any of their burritos wet with enchilada sauce, it's mild but flavorful. Trying the enchiladas on my next visit. Breakfast burritos are large with choice of meat, shrimp and fish tacos are listed a la carte instead of as plates.

Service was friendly (and fluent), salsa bar is quite nice (the roasted salsa in particular rocks), and they offer tamales by pre-order: 2 days advance notice, 2 dozen for ~$15?
