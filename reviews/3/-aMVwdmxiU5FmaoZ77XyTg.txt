I want to love Pure since I live in Matthews and enjoy supporting local. The food is really good and the drinks are tasty. Everything I have eaten has been enjoyable, especially the salmon appetizer! The thing that keeps me from giving Pure more stars is the price. Same $$ for lunch and dinner. It's just a little too pricey. Do enjoy going there however.
