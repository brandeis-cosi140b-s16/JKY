This place is nothing special but it is special.  It has a very unique clientelle who are very loyal.  It reminds me of one of those places you see in TV where the working stiff's pony up to the bar and order a shot and a beer (beer and a bump) from he weathered looking bartender.  The food is pretty good. I had some kind of deep friend mushrooms stuffed with bleu cheese and wrapped in bacon.  Yum!  The beer is served in a football shaped glass for a touch of "dive bar".   The off track betting draws the old and tattered crowd who are living one day to the next and having a good time doing it.  The servers here are VERY nice and some will even call you "honey".  Don't ever second guess one of them though because they are on the ball and will be insulted if you second guess their order taking ability.  :)
