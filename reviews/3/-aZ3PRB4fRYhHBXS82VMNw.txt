With all of the good Mexican choices nearby, it was a difficult choice for me to chose Caf√© Rio last week but I thought I should try something new so I stopped in.

I wasn't sure what to expect from the outside. I wasn't sure if this was going to be a sit down restaurant or a quick service. It is kind of a combo. It is set up very much in the style of Chipolte with a menu that has a choice of burrito, tacos, quesadilla or enchiladas. The addition of enchiladas is a nice one. You can then decide which type of meat you would like. Shredded Chicken, Barbacoa (pork), Green Chilie marinated shredded beef and I think a  couple of other options. I didn't notice if they had a veggie option.

I chose the tacos on this visit. I got a two taco plate with black beans and rice. The tacos are made to order. I chose shredded chicken. The guacamole and sour cream were both extra (this irritates me at a Mexican restaurant.) The best part of the tacos were the house made tortillas. They were soft tacos which were pretty big and the tortillas were delicious! The chicken was pretty good too. They did not have hot salsa so that is a downside for me. The black beans and rice were just okay. The price is very high for this type of food in my opinion. For the two taco plate and a drink, I paid $13.87. Almost everything is an upcharge so be ready for that.

Overall I liked the food here. I am not sure if I would go here over other places nearby but I would give them another shot.
