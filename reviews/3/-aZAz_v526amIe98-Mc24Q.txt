My wife and I were just ate at  Fliberto's the waiter Martin did a fantastic job 5 stars however they have better food in the lower cost fast food part and won't serve it in their more upscale sports bar.  They need to consider allowing patrons to order food from the restaurant that is attached to the sports bar for a small  plate charge.  Especially for regulars who want Cowboys fries.
