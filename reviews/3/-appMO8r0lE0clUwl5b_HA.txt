They have fries?!

I pose this question because of the pictures I saw on Yelp; I got ruffles on the side with my order.

Anyway, El Guero is a nice little Torta shop that does have a pretty decent torta. I got the Cuban and it was really good. I didn't see anything on the menu that really stood out to me though besides the Cuban. The conchinita won one of the best sandwiches in Phoenix Magazine in the past, so I will be back to try it eventually. But, with some tough competition in town, it's hard to say when I'll be making it back.
