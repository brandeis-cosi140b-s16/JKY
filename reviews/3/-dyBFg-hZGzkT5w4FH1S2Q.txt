I was way excited to try this restaurant since it's so close to my house.  I just assumed it was one of those places that looked like a dive outside, but served up a piece of heaven inside.  Once I read the Yelp reviews, I was convinced I had made a sound real estate investment!

Maybe my expectations/hopes were too high, but I thought it was just ok.   I liked the chips and salsa, and the service was friendly without being in your face.  We ordered a round of margaritas which tasted good, but were really weak in terms of the amount of tequila.  My father had the garlic shrimp and octopus which was really delicious--if I go back this is what I'd order--and I had the fish cuilichi was ok, just kinda heavy and not really something that got me excited.  The girly girl in me says, "not worth the calories!"

I think I'll give it another try some time in the future--perhaps it was an off night.
