Seems like a typical chain restaurant but not the authentic or tex-mex I was hoping for and the chips were so stale we left it untouched. The food was just as expected, and tasted like everything was just heated in a microwave or something you'd get from the frozen food section. 

Our waitor was amazing and even offered info on where we can find what we're looking for since we're new in town.
