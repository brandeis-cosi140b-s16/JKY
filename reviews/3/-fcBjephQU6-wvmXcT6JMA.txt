We hit this place on the way home from a party...a typical LV party with plenty of booze and not so much as a potato chip to eat. I was starving!

The staff was awesome. Super friendly! The place feels like a "fast food" taco shop, but the food was definitely better than that. It is not the best taco place in the city, but on the way home, after a late night it was pretty F'N great!

I would happily head back for another round of tacos made with love at Tacos Mexico!
