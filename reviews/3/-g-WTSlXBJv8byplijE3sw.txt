We go to this restaurant at a lot. In fact we have been going weekly. Well the service went down hill, just in our last three visits. There is an older lady that has waited on us for the past 7 years. She is awesome. When our car pulls up in the parking lot and she sees us outside the kitchen window, she makes my boyfriend an I a bowl of Pico de Gillo, fresh and spicy.  The new girls barely listen to your order. I asked for mayo and the girl brought out a little cup of dried out crusty mayo. My boyfriend told her I didn't want it so she took it back, and of course this was all said in Spanish, so I didn't know he hadn't told her I wanted new stuff. So I asked him to ask her for more. She brought out a bigger dish with fresh mayo. When I got the bill she charged me $2.00 for the mayo. What the heck.  I ask another girl and she said well you got the big one. I explained the situation and she said I will charge you    90 cents. I had never in 7 years been charged for mayo. The girls are rude and only become nice when it gets close to bringing the check. I think I will try the one two places down.  I am still trying to figure out if the owners were on vacation. Food wasn't the same as when the older man is there either.
