Good, solid Mexican-American.

I had the Verde Enchilada, which was rated on the menu as a 7 for heat/spice. I would disagree with that, and call it closer to a 3: not much heat at all, and a little bit of spice, but definitely not a 7/10. I was surprised by this, because another reviewer claims that the verve dishes are really hot. No way, Jose. If it tastes like burning, I want it, so I was disappointed that it lacked real bite.

That aside, the portions were manageable (not too little, not too much), and the complementary chips and salsa were delicious.
