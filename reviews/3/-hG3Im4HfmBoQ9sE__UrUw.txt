I haven't eaten at a Baja Fresh in probably 3 years. My coworker so graciously sprang for lunch the other day, in celebration of my engagement, yay! 

Their food is always consistent and yummy! I had the grilled veggie burrito, same thing I used to get back in the day. Very tasty! She got the Grilled Shrimp Salad, she was very excited about it so I am going to assume it was awesome! There was a huge line but they got threw everyone quickly and my food didn't take to long. 

It is a big of a drive from the office but I think it might be worth adding it to the lunch time rotation!
