Why is Roberto's such a favorite for late night munchies? It could be that all of their fried items are done so in lard. I was happy for my friend who has a soy allergy because she does not have to worry about dying. At least not from coming in contact with her allergen. The same cannot be said from a possible heart attack.

I cannot resist the rolled tacos. They are a comfort food that is slathered in guacamole and topped with a generous amount of shredded cheese. The prices are comparable to other fast food Mexican. Plus there is an added bonus of it being 24 hours.
