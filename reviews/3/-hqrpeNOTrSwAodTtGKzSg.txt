The food is OK but I did find they have a very heavy hand with sour flavors here. They give you three sauces with your chips. One is smokey, another is spicy and the green one was painfully sour. I went with the lunch special that was a halibut Torta. I thought it was nice that I could have spicy watermelon instead of fries. The watermelon was marinated in too much sour lime juice and was very painful to eat. The torta was OK but had a small amount of fish compared to the very large roll. My husband had the lunch burrito that was filled with chicken rice and black beans. He said it was OK because the chicken was moist but could have used some sauce in it.

OK food, it will do.
