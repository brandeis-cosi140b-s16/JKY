I ordered the 3 taco meal all barbacoa.  The meat had good flavor and the medium salsa was perfect.  The reason for the 3 stars was this....Although the rice and beans are considered "fillers" - they should still taste great when it cost about $9.00 for the lunch plate.  I thought the beans were a bit too thick and the rice was about 2 more minutes from smelling spoiled :(  
I also docked a star since I also had to wait about 20 minutes and they weren't busy at all. I hope these are just some growing pains.  I'll give it another try in a few months or so.
