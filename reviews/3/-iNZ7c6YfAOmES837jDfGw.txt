I have to agree with Bill, I was at the same event. It was Agua Fria Homecoming and we all wanted to go to the game. We wanted to give Raul's a boost and bring in business. Raul was well informed of the crowd we would bring into his business. He was glad to have the business, but he didn't staff accordingly.

I have been there on other occasions and the food was good and so was the service. On this night, however, Raul did a miserable job of staffing and serving the crowd. His excuse....he had another big party come in unexpected. That is NOT an excuse as far as  I'm concerned. He knew we were coming, he had the count of 4-35-40 people and 45 showed up. He should have staffed for our group and had enough to handle the usual restaurant.

Sorry Raul, I like your food, but you failed miserably with you "Owl Alumni" who only wanted to get together and give you the business.

Guess we'll go back to see Mike at Raul & Theresa's, he has always managed to handle our crowd.
