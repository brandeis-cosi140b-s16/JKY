This place is great for happy hour.  You can get a huge goblet full of beer or flavored margarita for just a few bucks.  The bar is almost always full on those nights, so be patient.  You may have a wait a few minutes for a table/ barstool to clear.  Their food is nothing to write home about.  You can definitely get better and more authentic stuff pretty much anywhere you go, but this place is worth it for the happy hour.
