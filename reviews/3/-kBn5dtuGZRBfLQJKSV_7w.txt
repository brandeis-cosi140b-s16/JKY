Found this restaurant on Yelp so I decided to give a try. I came here last night, 9/13/13, and it's a nice clean comfy little place.

The staff did greet us as we entered but I didn't think he was helpful. As I sat and stood there looking at their menu, since they don't have a menu you can take with you at your table, not once did he offer to give suggestions nor let me know that they had specials that were posted on the wall to the left of the cashier. But I guess that was my fault for not looking thoroughly. 

So, we ordered a carne asada gordita, 3 queso empanadas, 2 tacos al pastor, 1 taco de carnitas, 1 taco de carne asada and horchata. The carnitas were nasty, all fat no meat, the carne asada was tasty, not bland at all and cooked well. The tacos al pastor were very good, definitely had that al pastor flavor so you can taste the marinade and they give it to you with pieces of pineapple. My favorite though was the queso empanadas but I think they can be $1.25 not $1.75, anyways they are definitely worth going back for and what I mainly like about this place is that their tortillas are hand made, and let's be honest,...there's nothing better then hand made tortillas, hmmm!!

One downfall, (for me anyways) is that they don't have the drinks out where you can refill yourself nor do they have a salsa bar and mainly all Mexican restaurants have one available where you can grab your own salsa's, chiles and radishes or cucumbers.

I'll definitely come back again but another thing I didn't care for much was that once we left, the cashier though he did say bye, didn't ask what we thought about the food even though I did mention to him that that was our first time there and that I found his restaurant on Yelp. You would think you would be friendlier to your guest and make sure their experience was nice so that they can come back and give recommendations.
