Chipotle food is mostly good across the board, but this location only earns three stars, due to the slow service and apathetic attitudes. 

Location: This is off 7th Ave and McDowell. Even at 5:15 PM, it's happening!  Parking is around the corner either south or east of the corner restaurant. 

Food: The food is typical Chipotle.  One can order bowls, burritos, chips and salsa, guac, and more.  The food is mostly good, though one night I got guac that was made with an unripe avocado, ugh!  The soda fountain does include sparkling water, which is exciting for me! 

Service: Apathetic and slow.  The individual making the bowls and burritos was making the food and as we walked up to the counter, he did not greet us or anything but rather started working on a to-go order. This is fine, but he could have said "hey" and maybe mention he would be with us in a few minutes.   The cashier was stressed, likely due to the busy crowd at the time?  

Ambiance:  Again, typical Chipotle. This location brings in quite a bit of people. 

This location would earn more stars if the service was adequate.
