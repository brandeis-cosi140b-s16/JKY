10/2/12...
First time here. Nicely decorated little restaurant. Nice patio area also. We were here on Tuesday night. Very quiet. 

The don't have alcohol license yet. But we were told they should have it soon. 

Ordered safe for first time. Chicken Enchilada Suiza. And Chicken Chimichanga.  Also Queso Fundido for appetizer.

The food was just average. The Fundido was a little greasy. 

There is no alcohol served at this time.  Not that this is a requirement, but just for informational purposes.  (Please note date of my visit as this may have changed since.)

A nice little place for a quick meal. Nothing that I would go out of my way for. 

Also, they have very nice outdoor garden area. Be interested to see if they actually put this along with the upstairs balcony area to use.
