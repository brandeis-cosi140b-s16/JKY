A-OK. Very chill, clean, and nicely decorated. Great, prompt, friendly service. The manager/owner fellow also checked in, but in a way that was welcoming and relaxed. 

I agree with others that food and salsa didn't have much flavor. But when I ordered grilled pineapple to be added to my fish tacos, they brought me out an entire quarter pineapple that was sliced, hot, and served in the rind - delicious and great presentation! 

Probably won't go back just because I like Fuego and America's food better for similar prices, but this was a good experience.
