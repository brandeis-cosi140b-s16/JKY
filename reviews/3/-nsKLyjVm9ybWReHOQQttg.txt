This is a really charming place, and they take good care of their customers too.  The waitresses are friendly and the decor is really creative.  The patio is very comfortable and is a great place to sit at sunset.  The food can pretty much be found at any Mexican restaurant, but I will say that the shrimp is better than I've had at other Mexican places.  The margaritas are pretty good too, but nothing I haven't had before.
