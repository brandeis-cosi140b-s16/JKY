While in AZ for family, we went to this place per the recommendation of some cousins. Those same cousins came with us and told us to get the platter of shrimp mojo de ajo style. I'm not a big fan of shrimp so I was like, "meh" and ordered the ceviche tostada with scallops and squid... It was pretty good. I was actually surprised by how fresh the seafood was considering we were in Arizona! 

I messed up. When their shrimp platters came, the smell alone got me salivating. It was a full platter of large shrimp smothered in garlic goodness. I stole a handful or so from my dad's plate and savored every bite. Those shrimp kicked my tostada's ass. Again, VERY surprised that I can now say my favorite shrimp plate is down in Arizona.

The only reason I give this place a 3 is because everything else we had was alright. The little soup that comes in a cup was okay and had some definite seafood flavor, but was too salty.
