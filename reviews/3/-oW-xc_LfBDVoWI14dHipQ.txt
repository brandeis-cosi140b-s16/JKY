My friend and I tried this place for the first time a few weeks ago.  I want to say from the start that in the interest of fairness the service was great, the place is attractive, and (since I know this place has been around forever) it must appeal to a certain clientele who like this middle-of-the-road type of Senoran food.  And 3 stars means A-OK according to Yelp.  So the flavors here work if you are in a pinch, but there is nothing that really wowed us.  Have you ever ordered a cheese crisp and wondered why there was so little cheese on it?  Have you ever dipped your chip in a salsa and thought, "I could probably chop up a better salsa than that"?  Nothing was bad, but our combination plates contained nothing that would bring us back craving something.  Taste is subjective, and it's a comfortable hang and the servers are attentive, but if you know, it all comes down to recipes, and we found the flavors merely adequate but not fantastic.
