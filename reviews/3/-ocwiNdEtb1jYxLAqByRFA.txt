Place is going downhill.  For years I've been coming here I've noticed a degradation in service within the general dining area to the point that I usually sit in the bar area as the people there seem to get service.   

Until today. 

 Example from today. service  here was very poor. Ignored our request of seating, make it seem like it's an imposition when we mention it. It's ok we can wait.  Then server forget the beer till food arrived,then forget the hatch side for a while leaving me  an under fired meal for most of it, yeah I like it going cold.

Many of us used to go here for lunch as I work nearby but the place is practically impossible to get a group to now as one of the checks isn't right or an order is missed.  It's food has been consistently good and since I am a heat junkie it's the nearest New Mex place to my work an obvious choice.  A choice that's getting harder to justify with days like this.
