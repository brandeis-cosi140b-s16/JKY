I never was a big fan of the original El Portal other than for it's Democratic party people watching.  But a friend and I went here today for a quick lunch and, to my surprise, it was pretty good.  Everything at the original El Portal always seemed too "saucy" for me.  That was not the case here.  The sauce was appropriate in quantity and not drowning the food.  It does have a college eatery vibe and is set up like a fast food place, but that makes for a quick meal without sitting around waiting for a waiter (the parking meters nearby only allow 1 hour, so the quick service was much appreciated).  One complaint is that they did not give us very many chips at all (maybe 5 each) so we had to actually go ask for more and got another small amount.  Chips are cheap and should be plentiful in my opinion.  As for main courses, my friend had some enchiladas and I had the veggie burro, which against all reason, I requested chimichanga style.  That meant it was deep fried and then smothered with guacamole and sour cream.  Yumm. I can't eat that way on a daily basis, but after a long morning in court, it definitely hit the spot.
