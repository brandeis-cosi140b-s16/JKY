We were hoping to find some authentic Mexican food and decided to head off-Strip to The Cantina, located in the Tuscany. After being seated, they brought out chips and salsa and bean dip. The bean dip was a nice addition, and when they ran out, they brought us pico de gallo until a fresh batch was made. 

For drinks, I had the frozen guava margarita. It seems like they use pulp since it was lumpy, but it definitely wasn't strong or big enough. We decided to order the tequila fajitas with beef and shrimp, which are flamed table-side. The tortillas are homemade, and the beef was okay. The shrimp, however, tasted amazing! It was flavored with a buttery sauce, and even though they were small, they were the best-tasting fajita shrimp I've ever had! The rice was decent and so were the beans, except they were covered with too much cheese. 

Service was good at times, bad at some. We had to flag down our server several times when it was busy. Prices are definitely reasonable. We actually got a free margarita with our meal, even without a coupon. But if you sign up for the Tuscany rewards card, there is a coupon for 10% off. Or you can find a 2 for 1 entree coupon in one of the free Vegas magazines. Overall, not too bad for a Mexican restaurant in this area.
