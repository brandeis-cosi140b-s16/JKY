I am right in the middle about this place.  I really liked the atmosphere, even though it was really hot because of the position of the sun about 5pm.  The bartenders are friendly and great with their service.  But my husband and I didn't really like the food.  Their chicken quesidilla was good (hard to mess up) and the bean burritos were good (another hard thing to mess up).  But the carne asada was some of the worst meat I've ever had!  The meat was tough and had no flavor.  The grilled fish tacos were OK....not spectacular like I expected from a place that is known for their fish tacos.
Happy hour is from 3-7 and they have specials on beer and appetizers.  It's definitely worth checking out.
