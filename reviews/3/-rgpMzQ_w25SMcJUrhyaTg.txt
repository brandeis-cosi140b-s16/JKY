This place is pretty average. The food is what you would expect at a Mexican restaurant. They have all your standard dishes with your standard sides. It tastes like all the Mexican restaurants I've been to before. Now this isn't necessarily a bad thing. Sometimes I want a basic enchilada with refried beans and rice, and when I do, I go here. But if I'm craving something a little more creative, I'll keep driving.
