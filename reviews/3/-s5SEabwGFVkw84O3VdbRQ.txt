Great texture great flavor! Medium rare steak is B-E-A-UTIFUL! Decent guacamole and decent beans and rice. I don't like that they've removed the meat flavor from the beans and frankly, I don't care how humane the meat is or how environmentally conscience the napkins are. Leave the stuff for the hippy campouts and just give me the top notch stuff without the pseudo-morality. It's food, not a religion.

I almost gave 2 stars on account of the preachy environmentalism-as-a-religion attitude, but I love the Chipotle Tabasco, IT IS AWESOME! If you haven't had it, I hightly recommend. That and they serve the real thing, Coca Cola.

Parking is tough but that's not a big deal. Park over at the Verizon store and get a little exercise walking over. It's better than losing your temper and coming to Yelp to vent, seriously.
