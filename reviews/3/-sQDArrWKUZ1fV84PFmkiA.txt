The shrimp salad with butter lettuce was excellent. Fresh ingredients like avocado and roasted corn really added to the flavors. I felt satisfied & refreshed to hit the I-10 again for Phoenix. I was disappointed that the salad was so small - didn't even fill the salad bowl. The serving sized appeared to be over analyzed for franchise profit in lieu of a great salad & draw for healthy eaters. Service is very friendly & professional. Fresh salsa bar has great options.
