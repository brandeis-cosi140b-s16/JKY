I am placing Burrito Express just inside the 3 star camp.  A qualified 3 stars, 3 stars for the category...little Mexican joints.  Is that a category?  If it's not it should be.

Anyway, just inside 3 stars.  Maybe 3.05433 or 3.06155.  Not as far as 3.14159 though.  Definitely not.  

I had a burrito with potato, egg, cheese and ham.  It was big.  Not huge but pretty big.  I mean it didn't bludgeon me with it's girth or anything but it was pretty big.  

It was good.  Not mind blowing good or anything but good.  Like I would have it again but I wouldn't drive far for it.  Like I would drive a few miles.  Probably only a few though.  Not a score of miles, that's for sure.  I would drive more than a couple but less than, say, 10 for one of their breakfast burritos.  Probably about 4 if I had to rate the burrito based on how far I would drive for it.  

But there are other places closer to my office with good burritos.  So if I was somewhere, say within about 4 miles of Burrito Express and I was in the mood for a large but not too large breakfast burrito that was pretty good I would consider going to Burrito Express.  I'm not saying I would definitely go, like I'm not making a commitment by any means here, but I would think about it.  Probably.  Then again, I might not.  I might forget about Burrito Express, actually.

What were we talking about?
