I've been connecting in Charlotte for years now, and this was the first time I ate at Tequileria.  I always thought they were more of a bar than a place to get real Mexican food.  However, I noticed they had some authentic looking items on the menu, like tamales, carnitas, and enchilada suiza.  

I ordered the jicama salad and had shrimp added.  It was quite good, and I've never seen such large chunks of jicama in my dish before!  There were jicama bricks in there!  Still, I managed to slice them and eat them during my long layover, and I was quite pleased.  Other items in the salad were shredded lettuce, tomatoes and large pieces of cucumber and 8 medium sized shrimp.  

I would go back now and try something more hearty now that the salad was up to par.
