Good food, nothing amazing. The one thing this place has going for it, is the house made tortillas. They are pretty bomb!

At this particular Cafe Rio, my experience was just meh. Half of the staff I dealt with were happy and seemed to be in a good mood, while the other half seemed miserable as hell. They also seem to skimp on the sides.

I'd be willing to come back and give this location another try
