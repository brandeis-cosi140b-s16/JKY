The place is very old and comfortable, the staff friendly especially the bartenders who were very attentive, the beer was ice cold as well.  The food was average at best.  I ordered the Chili Releno's special and it was not edible, I had to use the chips (also average and mostly stuck together) to scoop out what I wanted to eat.  The peppers were like rubber.  Great bar, but the food is average.
