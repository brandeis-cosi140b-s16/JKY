I just moved near this restaurant and thought I would give it a try on my way to work.  I picked up a breakfast burrito and it was pretty good and very filling.  You can order it anyway you want, and they seem happy to accommodate.  The owner was friendly and welcoming, and I felt that the quantity was good for the price.  It is a little hole in the wall place in a strip mall, and very plain inside, but I will definitely give it another try.

My only real complaint is that they are only open from 7am to 2pm, making it hard to get to them while they are open, as I don't work nearby and they are closed before I get home.  Oh, and I went there at about 7:45am, and they still had not made the horchata, which was disappointing, but somehow I survived.  This is definitely a mom and pop operation, and they are closed on Sunday too.  So for me, I will more than likely only be able to go there on Saturdays, or before work in the morning once in a while, which will make it difficult to make it one of my go-to Mexican food places.  However, I do recommend you give them a try, and I hope they are successful, as they seem like very nice people.
