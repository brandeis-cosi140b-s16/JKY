I've had night and day experiences at this location - seriously, during lunch and then late night.  During the day, their staff is super friendly (dare I say too much friendly sometimes?) and their service is fast. I might almost give them 4 stars. But this past weekend, I got sucked in by marketing for their Smothered Burrito and drove through around midnight. They had no non-sweet-tea (I go half-and-half usually, sorry I am not from the South!) and in spite of ordering a beef burrito, having the manager who was running the drivethru then ask me beef, chicken or steak (beef!) and my receipt saying beef... I ended up with Chicken. Guess I should stick to the day shift for my nacho cheese addition!
