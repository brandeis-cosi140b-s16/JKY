Food tonight was good as usual.   I've never gotten a bad meal.   And I have 17 check ins.   I love this place.   But service tonight was horrible.   No silverware or napkins while eating our chips until we were done with them despite asking.  Salsa Bowl was left empty for a good long time.  It took 40 minutes to get our meal.   Just bad.   Not sure if I'll be rushing back.
