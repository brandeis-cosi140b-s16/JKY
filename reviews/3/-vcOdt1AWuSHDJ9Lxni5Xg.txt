Having visited LDM's bell cow location on Central, I was totally prepared to be underwhelmed by this stripmall-y location along the light rail line on Washington. 

Well, not only was I not disappointed but I enjoyed one of my more rewarding lunch experiences of 2011. The service was no-nonsense but friendly and efficient and the food was pure LDM Scoville Scale bliss. I had the gringo friendly chimichanga with carne adobo, which was spicy and delicious and so filling I couldn't even finish, hard as I tried. The chips were warm and the salsas were up to LDM's reputation. Probably a tad hot for those who are spice challenged but perfect for my palate. 

It sounds like a little thing but I was also really happy with the size of the glasses. My Diet Dr. Pepper came in what seemed like a 44 oz plastic cup. Did I need 44 oz of soda at lunch? That's not the point and mind your business. A bigger glass helped me get my fill of soda without bothering the busy staff for refill after refill.

The only downside of this lunch trip was that I was damn-near comatose following the meal. But that's on me, not LDM.


Big ups to Los Dos Molinos.
