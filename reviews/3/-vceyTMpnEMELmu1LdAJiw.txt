Made reservations by phone and told them we were celebrating 2 birthdays. On arrival hostess acknowledged we were there for 2 birthdays.The bus person was great, tried to get the server's attention 4 times as I wanted to get a drink menu,finally got it wanted to order a virgin drink again difficult to get server's attention. Food took a while but worth the wait. During dinner 4 or 5 tables were celebrating birthdays sombreros singing ,when we were given the check there was no problem getting the attention of the server. No happy birthday wishes at our table! We always tip well maybe they thought the attention wasn't warranted. Very disappointed in the service. Yes I tipped the bus person.
