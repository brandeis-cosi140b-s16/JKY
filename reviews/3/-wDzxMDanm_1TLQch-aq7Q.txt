There are too many awesome restaurants in the valley (especially those that serve southwest/mexican) for a place to have 8 plates sitting under a heater with slow service. We didn't get the coffee we ordered for Sunday brunch until our food came. The food was decent. I ordered an egg white scramble with chorizo and spinach. It was delicious. My boyfriend ordered something different, it looked different, but tasted the same. Which was delicious. The potatoes were cold, despite sitting under a heater while they remembered to place our coffee order. They comped us on the coffee without us complaining,  so they get a bonus star for fixing the mistake. I might give them another try, but like I said so many other restaurants I would choose first.
