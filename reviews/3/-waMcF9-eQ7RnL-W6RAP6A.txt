If you like Taco Bell, you'll hate this place because it sells REAL Mexican style burritos.

Although they're slightly on the pricey side ($4.99 for a carne asada burrito with a few tortilla chips), theyr'e rather large and tasty.  You can really taste the char and smoke in the meat.... no fake liquid smoke here!

The regular size burrito is huge in comparison to most other places, I don't think I'd be able to eat the super sie burrito in one sitting.

They also serve authentic Mexican drinks, everything from Mexican Coke (made with cane sugar instead of corn syrup), to horchata, tamarindo, jamaica, and popular bottled brands.

The only thing that I think is kind of odd is that the place is decorated with scenes of Sand Francisco and the Golden Gate Bridge, I guess in order to show off the hometown of the owner.
