What can I say about Manuel's? Well some locations are better than others. The one in Phoenix is on the old and dirty side, but the ones in Scottsdale and Mesa are nicer. The food is good, but a little greasy. I love their chips and salsa (all you can eat). Their prices are reasonable and they have a lot of items to choose from.
