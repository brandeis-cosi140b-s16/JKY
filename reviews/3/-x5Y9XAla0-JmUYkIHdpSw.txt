I've been here several times for various work lunches.  While this is never my first pick, I don't mind eating here.  Typically, the service seems a little slow during lunch (even when they are not very busy), so don't go if you are short on time.  While most people go for the Mexican food, which I think is OK, I heard once the owners are actually Greek and that is why there are some Greek items on the menu.  Not sure if that is true, but I decided to try something a little lighter than my usual Mexican dish.  Surprisingly they have a really good Greek Salad and pita bread!
