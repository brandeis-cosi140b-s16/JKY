(Not to be confused with the Mexican grocery of the same name in Urbana, or 'Los Amigos' on Green Street.)

The service was good. Its a small operation, and they keep on top of everything.

The chips were excellent, they were the homestyle type, and I would guess they were freshly fried.

The Chicken Mole special was... not good. The chicken was somewhat tough and dry, and the mole didn't have a nice balanced flavor like moles I've had elsewhere: the cocoa powder taste was overwhelming. I should have sent it back.
