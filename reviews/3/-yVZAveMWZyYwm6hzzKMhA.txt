It was taco Tuesday so I decided to try cafe rio. Being that it was my first time there I was asking some questions to the lady behind the counter. I was wondering what came on the tacos what was extra. The lady behind the counter looked at me like I had 3 heads glaring at me hardly answering back. She looked at me like I was her worst enemy. Other than that the food was good. I had the chicken tacos with guacamole. The guacamole was decent. They had a ton of different lemonades that looked really tasty. The food was decent and the portions are huge! One entree is enough to share. I enjoyed cafe rios food I will only go back there if I happen to be in the area. The food was good but the customer service was not so great!
