Visited the Scottsdale location last night during Restaurant Week. Tableside guacamole was very tasty (although it could have been spicier), the carne asada was good too, though they were out of the pork dish I was hoping for. I would have given 4 stars but had my heart set on that dish.  Loved the d√©cor and ambiance; the staff was attentive. The churro was heavenly :)
