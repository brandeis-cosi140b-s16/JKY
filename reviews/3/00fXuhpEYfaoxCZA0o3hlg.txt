Love Diego's for their Tuesday night specials! 

Boyfriend and I decided to come here in search of some yummy nachos on a Friday night. We ordered a few drinks (margarita and he ordered some sort of margarita-crispin mixture) and they were very good. Service could've been a bit quicker, though. 

We also ordered nachos, an order of flautas and some carnitas tacos. We were just going to order the nachos, but the waiter made it seem like that wouldn't be enough food. LIES LIES LIES LIES. The nachos are huge!!! Unfortunately we made the mistake of overindulging on the free chips and salsa they bring to your table. The salsa was good, but the chips tasted kind of stale. Which was weird because they were still warm. Another issue we had was we wanted the nachos first and told our waiter that, but he still brought all 3 plates together. It was all very overwhelming. There was so much food that I didn't even get to try my tacos. The nachos were good, though. And the guacamole was amazing. We ended up taking most of the food home but much to my dismay my boyfriend ate it all at 2 AM that night (haha). I think I'll have to return just so I can properly enjoy a meal here.
