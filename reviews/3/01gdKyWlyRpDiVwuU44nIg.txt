Plentiful outlets! Hard to find at many airport restaurants.   Yes, the food is just mediocre/edible; I'm not sure there are many restaurants at an airport that offer anything else.  The three quesadillas dish is a great option to share ($10).  They make their margaritas with three shorts ($11).  A-Okay is right.
