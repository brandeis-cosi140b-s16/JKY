Let me start by saying I really miss Dan! The food is pretty much the same. I had the fish taco's and they were not as good as before. The tortilla was a lttle firmer, the fish was a bit smaller, the Chipotle mayo not as flavorful, neither were the salsa's for that matter. 

The service was slower and not as friendly. The cashier asked me "if that was it" after each item also she is difficult to understand. Not as big of a fan as I once was.
