$1 Taco Tuesday produced some mighty tasty taco's, but the place was slow and lifeless. I love the concept of the outdoor beach, pool, and surfboard tables - walking around in the sand makes you feel like you're on vacation. The inside is huge, but feels like any other Mexican restaurant with a bar. Bring your friends and try this for happy hour, or late on the weekends - when it turns into more of a club.
