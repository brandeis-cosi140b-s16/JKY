From 3/31/15
I'm not a fan; the food was sub par at best!  I got a burrito, and the beans were hard and undercooked as if they were not prepped overnight as you would do with fresh beans. I'm not saying my expectations where high, but cooked beans in my burrito would have been awesome.  The only reason I am giving three stars is because my cashier was really nice and helpful.
