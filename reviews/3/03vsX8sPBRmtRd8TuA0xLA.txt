So a few months back I was on this side of town. It was almost lunch time so I started looking for places to eat. Bingo Mexican food!!! I walked in and ordered an asada burrito. You know when your starving almost anything tastes amazing right? Well I wasn't really hungry but I knew I wouldn't have time to eat later. Best freakin burrito I've ever had!!! It was amazing I told everyone about my experience here. So tonight I was at the apple store at town squire. Yes, I drove all the way here to see if the they could replicate the amazing burrito again. Well they fell short but it was still good. It was hot but a bit dry. Not enough beans for my taste. The last time I was here the meat was freakin amazing. It was juicy and crispy. This time no crispy no juicy. I would have rated this place a 4 but man this place was filthy. The first 3-4 tables had crumbs on them. I bet if I added all the crumbs I could have created an asada plate!!! I didn't think it was a big deal maybe they just had a rush or shift change? I'm not sure but I was the only customer in the joint at this point. I went over to the salsa bar. Grilled onions and jalape√±os all gone!!! Don't really care for them but hey they must have been good right? You can get a pretty good view of the kitchen area from there. Omg the floor was a mess. There was paper and food on the floor. Come on people!!! Clean it up or be smart and move the salsa bar to another location. I don't remember the place being dirty. I will be back looking for that mystical burrito again!!!
