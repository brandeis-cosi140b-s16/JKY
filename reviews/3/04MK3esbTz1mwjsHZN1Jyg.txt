A neighborhood joint that we pass by all the time.  Coupons for this place come all the time, so we figure we may as well give it a go.

The restaurant is split up into two sections - dining in establishment on the left, bar area o the right.  

They start you off with tortilla chips, salsa, and a bean dip while they get your drink orders in.

The Husband ordered the Mexican Pizza (Large $10.45).  It's your choice of protein with all the standard fixings of Mexican food piled onto a crispy tortilla.  

I went for the Combination Plate (3 Items for $9.95), and chose an 
enchilada, tamale, and soft taco.  For the most part, you can choose your own filling (a few cost extra) and sauce on them.  With it, you get rice and beans.  

When the order came out, we thought they were both pretty generous.  Unfortunately for me, the requested low-fat green cilantro rice and low-fat boiled pinto beans were not replacing the red rice and refried beans I had asked for.  The waiter immediately took it back and they fixed the problem.  (Not sure if it was the waiter's fault or the kitchen's fault, but it was done quickly without too much drama.)

My enchilada and tamale were both tasty, although the chicken soft taco was a bit dry.  That was probably my least favorite part of the dish.  It made for good leftovers the next day.

They also have a Lite Menu, specials for those 60 years and older, gaming promos, and more.

Service was fine. It wasn't too busy on a weekday for lunch, so no real problems there.

Overall, it's a decent place for lunch when you want some Mexican food.  It helps when you find those BOGO coupons that come along though!
