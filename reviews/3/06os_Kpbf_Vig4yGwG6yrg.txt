I don't consider conversations with employees a review but whatever floats your boat.  I love El Pollo Loco. Their twice grilled burritos are great. They are stuffed with good chicken and all the good fix ins. The sides are decent. The chips are good with a salsa bar to choose your salsa. I like that their are lots of choices for entrees and sides which is convenient. For being a fast food mexican, it  is fresh and is a staple for my family. Its healthier than Taco Bell and doesn't give you explosive diarrhea.
