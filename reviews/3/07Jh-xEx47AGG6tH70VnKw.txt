The breakfast burritos are ok but their carne asada and beef tacos are bland. Very tough and chewy meat.  Their green hot sauce is a bit more flavorful than their red (pasty). The green sauce is their saving grace. 

I'm only coming here for their breakfast burritos from now on. Eggs, bacon and potatoes in a tortilla.  You can't go wrong with that.

I only use the drive through so I can't comment on the decor, bathroom ect.
