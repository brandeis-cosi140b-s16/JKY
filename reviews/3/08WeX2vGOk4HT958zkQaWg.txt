Rocky's is the kind of place my family loves, and I look at them like they are crazy.  Extremely greasy, divey joints are not my thing.  At all.  But they dragged me here one Saturday morning, and Rocky's is what it is.  No frills divey breakfast.

Exceptionally greasy food makes me ill, and Rocky's succeeded at doing that.  I don't eat potatoes, and every breakfast meal option came with potatoes.  There is no variety, the menu has 10 things tops.  To top that off, they were out of a lot of things.  But you know what?  Where else can you go for breakfast and eat for around $5 per person including a drink?

No bathrooms.  They must be grandfathered in, or they are just running a super illegal business.  Either way, when you are feeling violently ill after eating a meal here or just need to pee from drinking coffee, you'll be miserable, if you are like me.

Why three stars?  Because my dad is watching me type this and told me that I couldn't give them two.  So for my dad and the cheap prices, three stars.  Bring your family members ages 50+ here.  They'll appreciate it.
