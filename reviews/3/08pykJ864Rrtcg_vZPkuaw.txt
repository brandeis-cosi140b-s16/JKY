It's a standards Rubio's fast food Tex Mex.  If you know the place then it's no different than the others.   

If you have never eaten here before then you can do a LOT better.  The food is average but very expensive for what you get.  My in laws love this place on Taco Tuesday.  I'm always disappointed when they bring it over.  I've eaten about half of Rubio's  menu.  Expect to pay $10 for food and a drink. Should be more like $6.50. 

For the same $$ you can eat at New Mexican Grill. Now that place is awesome.
