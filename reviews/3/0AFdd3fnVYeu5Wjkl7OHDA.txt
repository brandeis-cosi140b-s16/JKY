Far from authentic but fish taco Tuesdays is money well spent. Especially since their only $1.25. I usually get about 4 fish taco's on flour tortilla's with extra onions. I pour on their delicious hot salsa from the 4 option salsa bar and go to town. I have tasted their specialty shrimp burrito's and if it wasn't for the price, I would order it more often. For now, my wallet thanks me.
