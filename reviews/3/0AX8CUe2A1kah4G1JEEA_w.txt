So I came here b4 class with my coworker . The line was long which is no shocker at chipotle. The line moved pretty quickly and when it was my turn to order I asked for an enchirrito( the really cheesy burrito) .  I say can I have an enchirrito . The burrito builder tells me that they are busy and would I like something else. I said no I'd like an enchirrito. So they guys gets the burrito breaks and then says you want a regular burrito right . Me no enchirrito , enchirrito finally someone else comes over and makes my enchiroto. I was annoyed but the it was so good. Ate the whole thing . Totally worth having to be aggressive to get my order across.
