$19.88 for fried rice? It's 20 vegetable fried rice and it was good, not great, but 20 DOLLARS FOR FRIED RICE? Our bill was $105 for three tacos, one 6-piece order of tiny pot stickers, hot and sour soup, the fried rice, a noodle dish, one drink from the bar and two non-alcoholic beverages. OK food; good service. Small portions. Value for money not there.
