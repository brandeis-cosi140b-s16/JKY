Good place.   I like to do "working lunches" here from time to time.  The food is pretty good, the service is usually pretty good too.  One thing we found odd, which is not really advertised is if you want a "skinny margarita" the current prices is $8.50 and if you want a "double" the cost is $14.50.  At that price I am looking at Ztejas instead (which is right up the street).  But overall, I would think most people would enjoy the experience here and it is a place we frequent.
