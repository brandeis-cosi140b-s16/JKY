Ehhh. I like chipotle and a lot of the establishments are typically quick, efficient and clean. The place here seemed like they were still working out the flow and made mistakes with work different customers in front of us, but rectified it nicely.

The woman's bathroom was... Unclean. Hardly any toilet paper left in either stalls, and one of the dispensers wasnt even up right. 

Food still good tho.
