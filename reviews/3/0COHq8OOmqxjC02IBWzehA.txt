Went here last week while on a layover in Phoenix.  We had been shopping across the street at Last Chance. (separate review)

Arrived at 2pm.  Sad HH didn't start til 3.  :(  Oh well, paid full price for a nice tall Dos Equis draft.  Sad that their locally brewed beers were not available at this location.  Here's an idea, don't advertise them if you don't have them.

Received some chips, salsa & bean dip.  The chips needed salt & the bean dip was too runny.  Passed on the $4.99 lunch special of the day 2 beef tacos. (TUE special)  I instead went for a chicken enchilada layered dish with verde sauce.  The waiter warned me it was spicy.  I'm a fire eater so I said bring it on.  Man was it spicy!  No joke!  Some sour cream would have been good with it to tame the heat but I abhor paying $2.50 for a tablespoon of sour cream that is worth $.25.  Portion size of entree rice & beans was just right.  Not overly generous portion size.  

Waiter & staff friendly enough.  Like the decor.  :)
