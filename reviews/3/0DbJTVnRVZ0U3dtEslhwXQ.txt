I usually don't frequent places like this, especially for the food-it is just too Americanized.  However I had a pretty banging time, it helps when the bartenders and patrons are all full of laughter and very strong margaritas.  Seriously, I would never attempt to have more than one of these things.  

There were people of all ages-college to older folks.  I went with a good group of comical friends who kept me entertained, but I couldn't help from overhear this airhead woman jabbering about the most random subject matter from the seven dwarfs to her political views.  It didn't annoy me though, it just made me laugh.  Oh trophy wives are great.  

The bartender was a younger guy who kept the drinks flowing with precision and timeliness.  I might be back if I am around these parts again.
