The food was good, I had pork tacos. Even my waitress Schilee was great! Why only 3 stars? The hostesses were THAT bad. Snobby to the max. One wouldn't put her iPhone down even while seating people! And when two ladies asked for a different table than where she tried to seat them? She handed them their menus and made them seat themselves and walked off annoyed with them. It was so bad I'm docking two stars.
