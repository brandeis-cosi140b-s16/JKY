It's the breakfast, folks! I'm with Tarah M. on this one.  I understand that La Salsa is cheap chain and I'm not expecting much if I come in here to eat, especially in one of the shadiest parts of the Strip! Still, the value for the price (at breakfast at least) is reasonable, and I've had nothing but friendly, attentive service with no wait to be seated. 

The three times I've wound up in this location have all been related to emergency trips to the nearby Walgreen's to pick-up forgotten essentials. After blowing a small fortune during the first night of a long Sin City weekend (why does that always seem to happen?), I love knowing that I can come down to La Salsa for a decent $4 eggs-bacon-potatoes breakfast and $2 double Bloody Marys.  They even gave me a fresh full coffee to-go at no extra charge when I asked for a cup to take my last few sips with me.  Nice!

P.S.  The actual salsa is not that great (at least for this Texan), so mix in some Cholula if you want some fire.
