Definitely looks like a hole in the wall, but the food is good and the margaritas are great. Had a large frozen strawberry margarita and a chili verde burrito. You won't go hungry with this meal. Lots of food. The rest of our party had everything from the shredded beef chimichanga to the chicken quesadilla and it was all muy bueno. The downside was we wanted to order more margaritas and dessert, but they told us they were closing early because they were slow. It's always disappointing when you want to order more, but the restaurant is closing an hour early.
