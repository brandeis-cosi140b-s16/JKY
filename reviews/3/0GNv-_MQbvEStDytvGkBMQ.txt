Average place, average food.  I was with a group that was craving Mexican Food, but I wasn't particularly in the mood, so I had the burger and fries,which i know it's a little odd for a Mexican Restaurant, but i put a twist to by adding jalape√±o peppers and the chipotle mayo.  It was far from being a bad burger, but it was nothing special either.  The fries were a little undercooked.  The servers were nice and the food came at the expected time.  I would eat there again, it definitely wasn't a bad experience.
