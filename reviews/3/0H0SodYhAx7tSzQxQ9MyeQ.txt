For a nice Saturday afternoon lunch, we decided to give this Salty location a try.

Perhaps because we were there on an afternoon, the place wasn't very busy at all....so, we had pretty good service.

We were a little surprised that you have to pay for the chips & salsa.  Yes, they're good, but aren't they typically complementary? 

Our food orders ranged from chicken nuggets to mini-burgers to chicken chipotle tacos and pulled pork tacos with the coca-cola sauce.

No complaints from us.  The food was good, our server was on the ball and no problems parking.

As far as price ... yeah, it was a little much.  Perhaps a lunch menu with lower prices would have been nice.  Our bill was just about $50 for the 5 of us (remember, we had 2 kid meals at $5 each), so it was a little more than we like to spend for lunch.  Overall, it was a nice lunch, but we probably won't return anytime soon.
