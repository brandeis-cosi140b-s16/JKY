There is nothing really special about this place. It's a typical tex-mex joint that is way overpriced because it's in a hotel. I ordered the carnitas which were $14, but they were seasoned very well. The rice and beans were typical and wouldn't say their stellar, but then again they're staples of any tex-mex style joint. 

I asked for more tortillas for my meal as I was only given 2. I found out later that they charge for extra tortillas. When I'm already paying $14 I should be given extra tortillas or if you're going to charge me then at least give me more than 2.

The server was nice until near the end. She was upset that we asked for separate checks. We had a group of 8 of us and of course we wanted separate checks. They even had an auto-gratuity on there and she couldn't do that for us? She was really annoyed but did it anyways.

Overall, the food was pretty good but overpriced and the service at the end sucked and we had to hunt her down to even get refills on water when it was hot as hell in there.
