I DID go again(for brunch this time), and tried something else like I had suggested to myself.

I don't know what it is about the west side location, but I just don't love it. The breakfast burrito I had was decent, but nothing stood out. His chorizo scramble was okay, as well...but we've had better at the El Dorado many times. This isn't a bad place, but it's not top on my list.
