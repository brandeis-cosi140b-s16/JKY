Heard Good things so have it a try on taco tuesday. Good deal and add $2 for rice and beans. Tortillas were great. Sweet pork too sweet. I liked the beef much better. They put  cilantro which I hate in the salsa so passed on that. Beans are ok and rice average. Ice machines barely worked. They tried to fix them but only a little better. Overall I won't be rushing back.
