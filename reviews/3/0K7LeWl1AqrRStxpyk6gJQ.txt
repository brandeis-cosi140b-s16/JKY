This place probably rocks after a night of drinking on Mill when your taste buds are numb, but for lunch - not so much. Been there a few times now, tried a few different options and I've never been very impressed. Usually order the tacos or a burrito - tortillas are kinda stale, lettuce definitely not as fresh as could be, and the rice and bean sides are just plain gross. Did dig the shrimp though. Small, but tasty. They always blast the TVs too (one at a time of course) - there are 3 over the bar - my friend and I could barely hold a conversation. There are definitely better Mexican places on and around Mill.
