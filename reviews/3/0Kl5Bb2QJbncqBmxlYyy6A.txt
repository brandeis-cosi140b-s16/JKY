Chipotle is my favorite restaurant because Chipotle IS LIFE! My rating is not based off the food because Chipotle food is always great and always deserves a 5 star. My rating is specifically based off of the service and speed. 
Let me say that the workers there were very nice. They were nice, but you could tell they were flustered and nervous. 
There was like 3 people in line and they seemed overwhelmed (this is compared to others who do fine with lines out the doors). 
The gentleman in front of me started his order and the lady behind the counter left his food sitting there. When she came back, she threw away what she started (since it was cold) and made him a new one. 
Total time took about 15 min to order and everything, so it was a lot slower than most chipotle. 
Food was great like always. 
Hopefully once they get used to working it will speed up!
