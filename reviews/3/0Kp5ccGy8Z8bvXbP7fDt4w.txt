The chips are so good. Also recommend the torta. Not sure why reviews are so poor compared to the old location...everything tastes the same as far as I can tell.

Update: Since I was back a second time to this new location, the quality of the food and service seems to have degraded. I don't think I can reasonably rank this as 4 stars even though the chips continue to impress.
