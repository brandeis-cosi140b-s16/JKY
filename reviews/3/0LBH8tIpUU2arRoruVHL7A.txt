Ooh, being away from pittsburgh made me forget one of my biggest disappointments: BYOB. Personally, I think they should post a sign so that I don't bother. I mean, for lunch, that's fine, but we were out on a lovely warm friday night, and given that there aren't that many places that even sell alcohol at night in the area that you can walk to, it's a pretty big hassle. 

So that was strike one. Strike two was the super-slow service. I mean, I do understand that the servers weren't getting nice drink tips, but if they would turn over tables quicker (esp. on friday night) they would be able to at least make a bit more tip money. I should mention that the wait staff were very nice, just not exactly attentive, though that could mean they were understaffed. 

Strike 2.5 was the way overpriced menu. The food was quite good, but at about $15 for an entree plate, and having the gall to charge for chips and salsa, at a place which isn't a good date restaurant (for lack of booze), that's pretty sad.

I only said strike 2.5 because I did really quite like the food, when it finally got there. But I think I'll save this as a lunchtime only kind of place....
