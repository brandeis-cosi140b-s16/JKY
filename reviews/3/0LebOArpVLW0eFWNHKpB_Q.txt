Burrito's are pretty good, only thing causing the lower star rating is the steak was a little over cooked causing it to be a little tough.  When I came in at lunch time there was a very long line (out the door)  the line did move very fast, but I had a bit of a problem finding a place to sit.   I do like Qdoba better.
