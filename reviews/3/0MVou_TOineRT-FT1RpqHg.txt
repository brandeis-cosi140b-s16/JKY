The food was on point, but the service was so slow. Came with a party of 10. The restaurant wasn't busy at all and it was disappointing how slow their service was. They also don't serve energy drink here. I couldn't order a Vodka/Red Bull, but their margarita was delicious! We were patiently waiting for our check at the end. It took over 15 mins for us to get our check! I definitely can say that their chicken enchilada was one of the best I've ever had.
