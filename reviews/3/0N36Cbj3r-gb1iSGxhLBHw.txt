Had to come by again to try out some crunchy tacos. Was praying that they made them like Rienda's but sadly it was not to be. The shredded beef was really good however quantity was lacking. The crunchy tacos themselves seemed overdone causing it to be a bit too crunchy almost bordering on burnt. Their green sauce had a good amount of kick to it as well which saved the taco. Lastly their price was a bit high at 2.25 each. Would try this place again but go on Taco Tuesday as it becomes a $1 each. 

If you're looking for pretty decent crunchy tacos then try out this place. If you're looking for a replacement to Rienda's, keep searching.
