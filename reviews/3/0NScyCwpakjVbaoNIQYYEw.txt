The ambiance was nice and the servers were friendly.  The decor is very trendy and not what I would expect in a Mexican restaurant...but this is Vegas, after all.  Unfortunately, the food wasn't anything to write home about.

We weren't very hungry so only ordered the tableside guacamole,  taquitos.and a couple of mojitos.  The guacamole was doused in far too much lime juice so all we could taste was lime.  And the sundried tomatoes in it were weird - they should use regular diced tomatoes instead.  We wound up scooping some of the pico de gallo into the guacamole which helped a little bit but the lime was just too overpowering.

The taquitos were pretty good as were the mojitos.  Nothing amazing but nothing great.

It's also VERY expensive for what it is.  For our simple meal, the bill was about $50.
