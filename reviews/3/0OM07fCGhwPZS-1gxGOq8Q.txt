I was split between a three and a four star review. The salsa was watery and bland, the dinner entry was good, and the service was good. Nothing spectacular here, and I didn't hear any of the other diners speaking Spanish. There weren't many authentic choices such as lengua, menudo, tripa, or cabeza offered.
