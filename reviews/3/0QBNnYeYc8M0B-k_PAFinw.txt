If you are simply looking for good, authentic Mexican food then you have found it. If you are looking for good service, or vegetarian options then......you might want to go somewhere else.

I will admit, we visited shortly after they opened but they simply have a long way to go and probably would have been better off not opening so early. The timing of the food was off so the kitchen isn't up to speed either on how to make things so that it all comes out together and our waitress didn't have any idea how to answer the questions being asked of her?

However....all that being said - I will give it another try simply because the burrito I had was wonderful but if the service is still poor I won't go back again.
