Seen this place for months but never tried it.  Nothing about the exterior looked appealing and the name certainly lacks any creativity.  We finally had the opportunity to try it and we were very impressed.  Great interior design, visually appetizing menu and good prices.  We were all happy with our meals and look forward to further adventures on the menu.
