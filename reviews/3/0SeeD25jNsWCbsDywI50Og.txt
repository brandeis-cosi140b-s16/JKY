Well it's not the best meal you'll ever have, but were you really expecting that? for what you're paying, it's good. just good, not great. I used to live in surprise and admittedly the food tasted better and more flavorful at the surprise location, but I don't have any real hang ups with this place. Very quick service and our waiter was a sweetheart. Would recommend if you're craving some texmex without wanting to break the bank.
