Okay, this should be 3.5 stars - but I rounded down because of the price uppings on the menu...which I understand - but the duct tape was a bit tacky. They could have at least gone with some masking tape. :)

Food was good. I even branched out from my normal 'Bertos ordering of the carnitas plate ("It just happens to be my favorite, and I order it ... in every dive I go to in this country"...name that actor that I'm paraphrasing).

I didn't branch out too much - went carnitas taco and 3rolled tacos with guac. Guac was good, a bit less chunky thatn I prefer, but not bad. Coulda been spiced up a bit...I suspect its more of an avocado puree than a true guac. 

Carnitas had good shells (2 soft/warm corn, like it should). Nice crust on the meat. Really seared it well. 

Can't remember what GF had...shredded beef tacos I'd bet. That's her 'Berto's go-to. 

All in all, not bad. If anyone can explain that wooden structure hanging below the drop ceiling for no apparent reason, I'd like to hear what your theory on it is. 

We'd stop in again, but there's a few other 'Berto's just as close (or closer) that we'd probably hit up first.
