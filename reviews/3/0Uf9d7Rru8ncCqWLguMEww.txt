I love Del Taco but I'm from Southern California where these are as Californian as In-N-Out. This one is attached to a gas station in a ganky part of town but they have a couple of plusses.
1) Del Cheeseburgers - better than any BK or McDonalds monstrosity, they're like a homemade backyard burger with fresh tomato, cheese and shredded lettuce. If youre gonna do drive through in this area, try one
2) Deluxe Chili Cheddar Fries. Crinkle cut fries, chili, cheese, sour cream, diced tomato and onions. So good. Love these.
3) Epic Grilled Chicken Avocado Burritos. HUGE and they have big slices of real avocado. Gives Chipotle a run for their money!

Plus 3 tacos for 1.09 on Tuesday. Can't beat that. The drive through isn't bad and you're right back on the freeway!
