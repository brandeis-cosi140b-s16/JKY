I love the Carne Asada burrito, the steak is juicy and tender.  I would give a 5 star rating but unfortunately when it comes to breakfast they never get my order correct.  I always order the steak and egg burrito with pico de Gallo, pico cost extra.  I always get charged for the pico but don't always get or I get a bacon and egg burrito instead.  When I do get the right order it is always good and I can never finish because they are big.
