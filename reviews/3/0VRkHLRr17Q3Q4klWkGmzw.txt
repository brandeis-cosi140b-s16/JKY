I can't speak for the food because I didn't have any! Just came for happy hour - on Tuesdays they offer $2 cocktails and $2 margs! (AND $2 tacos!). The service was pretty slow. I wasn't in a huge rush and only there for drinks so wasn't a big deal. Tip: check in with yelp and you get 1 free appetizer with ordering an entree.
