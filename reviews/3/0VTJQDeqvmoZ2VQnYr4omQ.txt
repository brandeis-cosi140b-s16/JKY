I had never been here before, but decided to check the reviews. There was quite a mix, those that rave and those not raving so much :). That made me more intrigued to try it out. Here is my take. 

The place was clean, service was fast and friendly, and the food was out in no time. That's a good start. 

Before I even placed my order I had chips and salsa in front of me. The salsa as other described was a bit watery. You might describe it as a rougher chop salsa, rather than a smooth blended salsa. At first, it tasted fine, but as I ate more there was some ingredient I just couldn't place my finger on. But whatever it was, it wasn't my favorite. The salsa became my least favorite part of my meal. 

I ordered the taco lunch (2 tacos, rice, beans, drink) for $7.99.  I got a chorizo taco and a steak and pork taco. You can choose between lettuce and tomato or cilantro and onion. I opted for what feels more authentic cilantro and onion. 

I thought the tacos were great. Authentic with two corn tortillas for each with some homemade hot sauce on the side. I would happily order both again. 

I also thought the beans were good and the rice was fine, but nothing spectacular. 

I was torn between a 3 and 4 star review. In the end, the odd ingredient flavor of the salsa pushed me to a 3 star. I mean salsa is a cornerstone of a good Mexican restaurant. 

I'd eat here again, but if their salsa has anything extra besides the usual ingredients, they should probably alter their recipe.
