I went to this Pollo Loco last night and Ordered a Steak Bowl and found out that was temporary. :( sad panda. 
I was so looking forward to it. last time I ordered it in December they had ran out of Steak, but had just enough for my companion to have it... so not only did I get to smell its deliciousness... I got to see it up close and not have it. then... realized my chicken bowl while still beign good came topped with onions.. sad panda
well this visit: I ordered a regular ORIGINAL BOWL with chicken. with no onions, pico - but with tomatoes and the register guy offered me cilantro alone, yes I will take that. 
What I GOT: 
an ULTIMATE chicken bowl w/ sour cream, guacamole, cheese, (that i didnt order) missing the tomatoe and cilantro that I did. 
ah well.. they gave me the more expensive dish and negated the stuff I wanted. ah well what are you going to do.. eat half since they have me an extra 500 calories on my bowl from the sour cream, cheese, and guac. . and took off the lite calories like tomato and cilantro. .

I still ike pollo loco but i dotn know how to be more specific when ordering but to speak slower? write it down? point to pictures? maybe theres a # system I can use?
