I went here with the family for some "amazing" nachos as advertised. The ambiance is that of a bar, with additional tables for families. TVs everywhere and the place is LOUD. We ordered the cheeseburger nachos and the BBQ pulled pork nachos. Our waitress was nice and attentive, and we did not have to wait for drinks or refills.

When the food came out I was a little surprised. A large pile of nachos covered in about everything you can think of. The cheeseburger nachos were really quite good, even my picky 7 year old liked them. The plating is something to be desired, on an oval skillet-type platter that is too small for the amount of food, and many a nacho ended up in the laps of my kids. The BBQ pulled pork nachos were not that great, but only because it was WAY too much. You need a gallon of water to swallow five bites, and the BBQ sauce and cheese are overwhelming to the palate.

Overall, not bad, but not spectacular. I would go again if I absolutely had to.
