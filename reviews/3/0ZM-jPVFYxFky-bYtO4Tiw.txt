This is an update to my previous post. 

The food is still great but man was I pissed when I took a bite of my chimichanga and was a toothpick in it. It poked me so hard into the roof of my mouth! Beware of the chimichanga! They really need to check peoples food before serving them.

There was no way to see it because was on the side of the burrito and it was covered in there cabbage garnish.
