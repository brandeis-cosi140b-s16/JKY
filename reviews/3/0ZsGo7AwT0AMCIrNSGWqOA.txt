The fish tacos are okay.   The fish is a little dry, but it's masked by the condiments on top of the fish tacos.  I have to say that overall, it's better than Taco Bell for sure, but I think I'm more fond of the fish tacos from Bone Fish Grill.

The Kahuna Platter definitely is a large helping as far as lunch goes.  It's pretty good for lunch but I have to say that from a fish taco perspective, it doesn't quite hit the spot.
