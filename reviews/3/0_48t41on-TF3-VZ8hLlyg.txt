I've been meaning to review them since we first went there and now I'm glad I didn't.
we've  been going there for about 7 months or so. First I fell in love w/ the shredded beef enchiladas and had them every time we went. But then they quit cooking the corn tortillas before they filled them,.. Yuk! So after a few of those I tried the red chile burrito... Again I loved it. Probably the last few months that has been my go to at least 2xs a week. But now (the last 3 or 4 xs) they have cut how much meat they put in it. And while I'm a fan of the sauce and the tortilla, Its just a large wet tortilla without the meat... Again Yuk! Last night was the last time for us. I wish I had taken a pic of it. The tortillas are huge , there was more than enough sauce and maybe 10 small pieces of meat. Really? That meat didn't fill 1/4 of the burrito !! I think we're done.
