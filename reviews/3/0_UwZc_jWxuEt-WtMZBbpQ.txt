I tried the salmon special and lobster-with-some-kind-of-green-sauce special and both were good. The salad that came with the dinner had a nice cilantro house dressing but I didn't really like that it had shredded cheese on it (too fast-foody). The waiter was really friendly and chatted with us about programming and computers, and I liked the casual ambiance. The only major problem was that my mom was absolutely certain that her spinach enchilada had canned spinach and tomatoes, but I didn't sample it to verify.
