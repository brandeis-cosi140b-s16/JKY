I'm almost not quite sure what to say about this place. I wanted to love it, I love the concept, the layout, and obviously the location (Cosmo) but at least from my first trip I was unimpressed. I'd say 3.5 stars would be more than fair.

Service- our waiter was a little short, kinda kept looking at us like ware idiots wasting his time. Obviously he was more interested in the party of 12 he was also helping... 

Food- only went for a light meal..
Dan Dan Mian- by far the best thing we had. Super spicy and definitely interesting flavones. I would order again..

Hot n sour soup- GROSS. Had the worst consistency and made me feel like I was holding spit in my mouth. Flavors weren't good, disappointed as I really wanted soup.

Street pork bun- tasted like soap? Not sure what was up with it but for 8 dollars the thing was no more than 2-3 inches. Left a weird bad taste in my mouth. 



Overall I wasn't thrilled on my meal. Will I return? Well seeing as the Cosmo is the only place to stay in my eyes, I may end up giving it another shot.
