affectionately termed "la hot-rear-end-a" by some - this place serves the craving for mexican cuisine, later at night.  way better than the traditional taco fast food franchises.  the ambience pretty much sucks, but the food is cheap and tastes decent.  definitely wouldn't hit this place up for a romantic dinner, but it's certainly an adequate stop for a low-key lunch.
