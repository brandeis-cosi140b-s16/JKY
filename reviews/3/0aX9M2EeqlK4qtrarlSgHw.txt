let me start by saying im a huge fan of chipotle. 

ive gone to qdoba once a few years ago and cant remember if i liked it or not (then again, i never went back so there must be a reason). after the wrangles game, we were hungry and had no idea what to eat. we notcied qdoba was still open (it was around 9:55 or so and it seemed capriotti's closed way earlier than 10pm). we walked in, and ordered. they made our food, and bagged it up. 

i got the choose 2 option, with tacos and the tortilla soup. quite yummy! and the bf ordered a steak burrito. the guy who made our food made some awesome suggestions - chicken in the soup and queso sauce on his burrito.

we got home, and i guess the vegas weather totally chilled our food :/ but it was still good!
