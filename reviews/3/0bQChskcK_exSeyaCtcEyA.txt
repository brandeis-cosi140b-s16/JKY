Chipotle is a great place i think if you want to eat healthy, this particluar one is close to my house, the food is very good, but its the service that gets me sometimes, i always order special things on my burrito and its a bit complicated, usually at other chipotles the person making the burrito is nice and does it with a smile, at this one they always seem so impatient and fast and when i ask for my special requests they seem a bit upset!
