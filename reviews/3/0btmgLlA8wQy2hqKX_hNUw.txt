My husband and I decided to try a new place to eat and came across this spot. It's pretty much another version of Chipotle, but this place offers nachos and taquitos. The food was good. Burritos are pretty big and they are filling (unless you're just greedy, then you would eat more). The prices are just a bit more than Chipotle, but no big deal. The staff was friendly and this place was super busy. The line was continuously out the door, so business is pretty good. You have the option to sit inside or outside. Overall, if we are hungry and all other places are at capacity, we'll come here.
