Can't complain one bit about the exuberant enthusiasm displayed by the young lady working the counter.  Nor did the Groupon lessen the expectation of reasonable satisfaction.  But, after 3 visits here over the past 2 years, sadly, the excitement ends when it comes to the food.  Not really bad, but, I dunno...does the expression "it's the SIZZLE, not the STEAK" mean anything to anyone else out there?  Just looking for the one great thing that brings me back, yet I am not seeing it :(
