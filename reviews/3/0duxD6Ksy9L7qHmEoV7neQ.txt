I've always preferred Qdoba myself, but Chipotle food is pretty good. This location is always PACKED it seems, like literally lines all the way to the door whenever I've visited. But service is relatively quick and the quality has always been good. I do think the prices are on the high side considering your food doesn't come with a side or a drink.

I'm disappointed though as on my last trip I needed to change my daughter, went into the restroom to find there is no changing table inside. They have a kids' menu, they have highchairs, but no changing table? I don't get that.
