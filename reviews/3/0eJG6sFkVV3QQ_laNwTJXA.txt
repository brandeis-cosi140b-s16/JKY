Good concept with lots of choices.  Food was a bit cool for me but I think that's just a problem with this style of restaurant.  it's hard to keep it really hot when your making it right in front of the customers from a warming table. My main problem with the place was the saltiness of the food.  While it had good flavor you usually have to add salt when out to eat.  Not here taste it first. There's plenty trust me.    Overall it was good  with a great atmosphere and nice staff. Just way to salty.
