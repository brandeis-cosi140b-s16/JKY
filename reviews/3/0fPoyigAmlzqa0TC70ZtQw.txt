Pros: Really cheap, lots of food, strong margaritas 

Cons: Average Mexican food, ran out of ice cream 

Ordered the enchiladas supremas, which were tasty and came out in under 15 minutes. That's OK because I needed time do down the margarita. The food was OK and the drink was strong. For dessert we wanted fried ice cream, but they ran out of ice cream! WHAT! Otherwise it was a good experience. 

In a close call I think I like Toro better, which is across town.
