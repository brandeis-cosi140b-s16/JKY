Took my peanut here for lunch after a visit to the aquarium.  The Raspberry Jalapeno Margarita was very tasty.  I enjoy the sweet with a hint of spice for my margaritas.  The bartender was even nice enough to alter a traditional margarita with some jalapenos as well so that was a great touch of customer service. 

Our server was prompt and friendly.  She was patient with the peanut so that's always a plus.  The fresh salsa was very good and the chips hot.

We only stopped in for an app and some ice cream for the kiddo.  We didn't get a chance to really try something that they are known for.  I got mini enchiladas that were good but not knock-your-socks-off or anything.  I enjoy a habanero sauce with my Mexican food and was bummed to see that they didn't offer any kind of spicy sauce (other than salsa - relax).

Bottom line - I'd definitely go again (I will even recommend it to anyone in the Chandler Mall area) but won't go out of my way to get there.
