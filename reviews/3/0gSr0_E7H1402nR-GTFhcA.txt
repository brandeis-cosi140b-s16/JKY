Hello Arizona. 

Just flew in from Hawaii and went to this spot to have a few (a lot). 

Service is slow. 
BUT if you go to the bar, it's on point. 
Or maybe they don't have servers. 
I dunno. None came by after dropping off the FREE salsa and chips. 
Yeah. Free!!!!
Is that a thing here in AZ? 
Cuz in HI you have to pay for chips. 
I know right?! Wtf?

Anyways. I'm not a margarita kinda person. But theirs is on point. 
However. I was ordering double Jacks on the rocks all night. Figured I would ask how much the shots were. 
$4!!!!!

Oh Arizona. I am gonna like it here.
