I like to come here when I don't feel like driving far for Mexican food. This restaurant is very Americanized, but its still decent Mexican food. I enjoy their fajitas, which come out on a sizzling hot skillet, with onions and peppers, with all the side toppings you can think of and of course it's accompanied with rice and beans. Another favorite dish of mine is the pollo fundido. This is basically a chicken chimi with a special sauce on top. I find myself liking the special sauce at Serrano's better, but Serrano's has nothing on the actually dish. Man if I could mix the two, I would be in chicken and special sauce heaven!

The one constant complaint I have about this place is the service. Every time we visit, the waiters and waitresses seem to be distracted by other things, for example games on the TV, other waiters or waitresses, or talking to the hostesses upfront. Your experience can really be ruined by having to wait long time for each part of your meal; it should flow smoothly if you care to do your job correctly. I have never been here when it's packed with customers, its always empty and very laid back, so they definitely have the time to make every table happy. If the service was up to par 4 stars for sure, the only reason I gave it a 3 is because I leave here every time with a HUGE FOOD BABY! Mmmmmmmmm
