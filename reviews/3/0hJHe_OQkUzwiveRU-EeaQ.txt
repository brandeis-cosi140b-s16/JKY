This place is close to my house- closer than either Tacos Mexicos or Robertos, so it's on common rotation at my house. My boyfriend prefers to get a carne asada super burrito while I tend to try either tacos or different burritos. Their lengua & carnitas are good, but I found lots of sharp bones in my birria, which ruined the experience for me. Their super burritos come with lettuce, tomato, sour cream, rice and beans plus the meat of your choice for 4.75, about the average. Their burritos are large and filling, making either a hearty meal or two lighter ones. Their chile relleno burrito is a little more, but  fairly tasty.
Be warned: their nachos are crap. You can get much tastier nachos a mile or so down the street at either the Roberto's at Russel or the one in the Sinclair station by Indios. 
Refills are not free but I always get my food to go so that's not an issue for me. I don't know how stringent they are about it, but they have signs warning against sharing drinks. 
Another decent burrito shop in Vegas. Nothing so outstanding its worth driving across town for, but cheap and filling if you're in the neighbohood.
