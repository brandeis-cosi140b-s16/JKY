Went for dinner last night and expected another wonderful dinner.  Unfortunately, while the food was very good, the preparation and delivery of the food was less than average.  Three dinners were served and then we had to wait 10 minutes for the next three and 5 minutes before the final meals were delivered.  Most annoying was the fact the restaurant was relatively empty compared to other times we were there. The waiter's explanation was that there was nothing he could do about the kitchen. Obviously there is some problem that needs to be addressed so that dinners are delivered to the party more seamlessly.
