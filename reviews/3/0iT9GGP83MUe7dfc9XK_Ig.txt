I over look this place way too much. But the other day I happen to be driving by around lunch time and stopped in.  It wasn't very busy although it was almost 2pm so I think I just missed the lunch crowd.  Parking was easy in their lot. Service was great. Friendly and quick. The restaurant is clean and quiet. I got the steak burrito bowl. It was good. I love that they have several choices for salsa.
