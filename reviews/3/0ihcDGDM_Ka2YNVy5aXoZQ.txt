When I'm in need of a quick meal and there's a Del Taco nearby, I will definitely stop by.  I happened to be in the area, so I dropped by and ordered my usual Veggie Works Burrito, $2.89 & Deluxe Bean Burrito, $2.78.

The service was fast and accurate.  The food was consistent with other Del Taco locations.....it won't win any culinary awards, but it's cheap & filling.  This location was very clean and the employees were friendly.  Overall, a decent experience.
