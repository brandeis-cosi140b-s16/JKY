We went here because we wanted somewhere new to try and we saw a full ad with tons of their menu pictures in seven magazine. Everything looked so amazing from a pretzel shake and this corn concoction and other things. We got to the place and was very confused as to where to order and where to sit. Once we went to the counter, the staff was very friendly and even custom made my order because I can't stand anything spicy, and literally everything on their menu to do with meat, was spicy. We noticed they didn't have a few of the items that were shown in the ad we saw which was only a week before-hand. Everything was tasting good but the sweet potato tots were so gross they tasted like they were out of a frozen bag that had freezer burn. 

For desert we decided to try a milkshake thinking they would have the pretzel one we saw in the ad. Sure enough, they didn't. Even the lady that worked there said it was false advertising. I had my heart set on that damn milkshake. She seemed like she didn't really know the menu because I asked if she can make something similar and wasn't too sure. If you like weird tasting gelato, this is the place to go. Beer flavored. Pistachio (which some people think would be normal, me not so much), Spicy chocolate..etc.

Anywho, I should have just brought the freaking ad in and told them to make whatever I saw on it. 

FALSE ADVERTISING.
