Not much to say here except that it's in a bad location and there's always some sort of dramatic commotion going on With the homeless people. Not that there is anything wrong with homeless people it just always seems to be some sort of fight going on. Food is meh I really wasn't raised liking Taco Bell I prefer authentic Mexican food. But because of my fellow white co workers they love this place so I tag along lol.
