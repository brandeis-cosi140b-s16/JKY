Eating here now with my girlfriend for the first time. The food and service was good but the choice of music is not appropriate. Foul language and the "n" word used excessively. This is a Mexican place and you are playing inappropriate getto music. I don't think we will be returning just because I can not bring girlfriend and esp my family back. So sad because the food was good.
