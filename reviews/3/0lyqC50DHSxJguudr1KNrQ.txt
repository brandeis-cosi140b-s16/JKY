Not a Monday night football destination, but clearly a destination for the make your own guacamole. At HH, all apps are half price and the guac was about $4 for a giant portion with five individual serving cups to make it my way. The pepitas seeds are unusual and spicy and I liked the chopped red onions and cilantro as well. They also had $3 Happy Hour margarita's, but the mustached bartender kind of ripped me off by giving me a larger size without permission. He paid for that during the tipping process. The TV's at the bar stink and the place was virtually empty for a big MNF game. Be back for the guac, but not for sports.
