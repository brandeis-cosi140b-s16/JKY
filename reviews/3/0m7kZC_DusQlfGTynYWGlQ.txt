Short version: it was busy (the place was packed), the food wasn't terribly special, and the service was slow.  
I had the steak/chicken fajitas  and my wife had the #6 (taco, tostada, enchilada).  Both meals were skimpy on the rice and beans; my wife complained about their 'fart water's tea and all 3 of her items were skimpy versions of what she was expecting; mine was ok but I've had way better at other places like Nandos.  It wasn't absolutely horrible but I don't think we will be back.
