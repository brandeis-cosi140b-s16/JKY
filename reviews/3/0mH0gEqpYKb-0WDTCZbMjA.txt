I am an avid Mexican Food Eater so this restaurant honestly caught me off guard a little bit and I have dined here twice, once by myself for lunch and then once for dinner with my boyfriend. 

I originally discovered it with the intention to go to Subway (next door) but then decided to try this place instead. The restaurant is a decent size but definitely gives off that hole in the wall mexican vibe that always makes me excited to taste their food. 

The staff there is decent, they were not overly helpful but not downright rude either. I was a little put off the first time I went there because their credit card machine was down and so they asked to write down my card information and charge me the following day (but in the end that's exactly what they did and I didn't have any issues with it). So I agreed and ordered the cheese enchilada meal with rice and beans. I feel like for what I received it was a little overpriced. The enchiladas were pretty good as were the beans and rice (with salsa from their salsa bar of course). I really enjoyed the salsa bar. 

The second time I went for dinner with boyfriend and ordered the taquitos. Again a little overpriced for what I got but they weren't terrible. My boyfriend got the taco dinner and he enjoyed it. 

Overall the food is average and a little overpriced but decent if you have limited time and need a Mexican Food fix.
