I have heard so much positive feedback about this place. It just opened near my house and was excited to try. At lunch time, I was the only one in the restaurant. I didn't think the food served was anything to rave about. I order a burrito with the pig which had great flavor but the overall burrito was very plain. Marked it off my list and won't be back.
