No ...it hasn't been 5 years since I've been to a frat party...it was since last week that I've been to a frat party.

In Las Vegas people get possessed I hear and I guess I caught it at
Diablo's Cantina

Hungover, tired, hungry ...we, insomniacs, stopped by anyways to continue this drinking marathon. We did not have a chance to dine here but this place was packed up to the ceiling.

Even though... the Mexican food that I saw on the tables were mouth-watering especially the volcano of nachos piled with everything looked so yummy. They definitely serve in big portions at this place.

One of my girlfriends ask the mixologist to concoct the strongest pitcher ever and he happily did it for us. I forgot the name of it but it was soo good. Sucks that I forgot about my yelper obligation of asking what the name of the drink was but what matters is that this restaurant seem lenient and quite accommodating to the customers

They did ignite some fun by putting out games...I don't know the concept of the game but there is a game wheel located at the bar which the customers can join in and they have hot chicks spin it for the audience's viewing pleasure

Diablo's is the place for a big frat party and quite the scene for large groups so if you really mean chug  business  then stop by with your buds and don't forget the timer =)
