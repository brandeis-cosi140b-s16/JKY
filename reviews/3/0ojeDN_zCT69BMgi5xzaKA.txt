It's open 24 hours and serves ok mexican food. Not anything to write home about, but hits the spot when you are cruising late night for a meal. I find that there food is on the greasier side,  and usually my stomach can't handle that. They do have some specials during the week, that make cheap meals for the family. Prefer RIvas Mexican Grill which is around the corner.
