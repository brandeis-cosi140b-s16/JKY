I tried the 3 tacos for $6 deal and ordered a soda in the can.  Ordering was easy enough and I got my food pretty fast out the back window.  I might not have known about the rear delivery system if I had not already wondered by it earlier.

I received my tacos, but my soda was missing when they called my name.  I mentioned it to very friendly lady that delivered my food and she promptly got it for me.

I ordered a green meat, a red meat and a chicken taco.  All three tacos came individually wrapped in foil and came in a brown paper bag.  It also came with both green and red sauces.  All three came with soft flour tortilla wrappings. I am not a fan of flour tortillas for tacos because I usually prefer the street style with corn tortillas.  The tables also had El Pato Sauce and another hot sauce for your pleasure, although I am not sure they keep them refrigerated?

The flavor, temperature, and the taste of the meat tacos were fine.  I was surprised to find beans in all 3 tacos, but they added nice texture and flavor.

The green and red meat tacos were pretty good, but did not stand out as something that I would crave on a Saturday night after a few brews.  The chicken taco had huge cubes of white chicken meat.  The chicken drowned out the other flavors in the taco (actually too much chicken).

Overall, a pretty cool eclectic place that I would try again.
