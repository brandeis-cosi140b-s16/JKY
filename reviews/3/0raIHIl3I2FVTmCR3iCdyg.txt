I knew better than to expect greatness from this place, but I didn't care.  For all I knew this place could produce the best taco around.  What I found wasn't a hidden gem rather a typical ASU joint.  Everything is sticky and is just what you would expect from a bar on Mill.  The place is kinda funky, kinda douchy blah blah blah, yada yada yada.

I'm still not sure why I chose this place for a regular evening dinner.  It wasn't horrible but it really is day/night-time drunk food type of place.  I had 2 tacos and they were ok.  Nothing special.  The chips and guac were also ok.

If I ever find myself on Mill during the night and it isn't too crowded I could see myself stopping in to have a drink.  However, I'm definitely heading to Filiberto's for my late night eating.

This place is worth trying but don't expect anything phenomenal.  And do yourself a favor and go to Local Dines and get a gift certificate ( http://bit.ly/dfR4eQ ).  Sure you might feel like an idiot going to a bar with a 1/2 price gift certificate but it will save you some cash and is totally worth it.
