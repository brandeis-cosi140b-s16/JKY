Hmm...not bad. Not Spectacular. Wasn't too impressed with the bored- looking high school girl behind the counter. Super cute ambience. 
It felt like I ate my carne asada burrito in about five seconds. Yes, because it was great but also because it seemed the size of a hot pocket. Way too small for the price. And the thimble size container of salsa did not help matters much. Your other option is the X-L, which is in a twelve-inch tortilla. I would advise getting the mega-burrito and saving the rest for later, seems like it would be a better bang for your buck.
Would it hurt to throw in a couple sides? Beans? Rice? Hell, even some chips?
Bottom line: A lot of potential, just not enough for the price.
