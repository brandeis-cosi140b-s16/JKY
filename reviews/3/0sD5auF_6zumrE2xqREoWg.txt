Look at your Yelp reviews, Baja Taco.  I used to pick up here once a week, and this has dwindled to I haven't been in 2 months.  I came for the excellent carne soft taco and chicken burrito- not the ambiance- but the modest but clean place has gotten progressively worse.  Also, the Hot Salsa that I loved is now always empty.  When I asked if the employee for it, she the mild salsa was hot salsa- like I can't smell.  After this happened three times I was out.
