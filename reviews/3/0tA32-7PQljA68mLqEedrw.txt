I actually really like the food here, my low review is for the the service and the difference in portion they give you, as compared to another location. The location on Durango has a nicer staff and they actually are a bit more giving when it comes to their burrito bowls. The food is great, the service here is not. You're better off going to the one on Durango! :)
