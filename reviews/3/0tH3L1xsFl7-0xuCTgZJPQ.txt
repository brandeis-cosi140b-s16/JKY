I have to admit that despite our close proximity to Mexico, I am typically underwhelmed with Arizona. I had a restaurant I loved in Chandler, but I have moved and it closed. Often when looking for Mexican in the QC I end up at Serrano's. For me, it is always average. Nothing bad, but nothing spectacular. 

I arrived tonight to a 20 minute wait. The restaurant appeared to be busy with the list and the number of people in the lobby, but once I was seated and ordered, the food arrived in less than 5 minutes. In fact, I was surprised at how quickly it showed up. I ordered the #23 comb, which is a taco, enchilada and tostada. I wish it were a burrito instead of tostada, but it's not - and even on the "build your own" combo section, a burrito wasn't an option.

The service was very good. My waitress, Ashly,  was prompt, stopped by multiple times (although I only received one drink) and was cute. All good things. The chips and salsa are good and I like the tacos. The enchilada was a cheese enchilada, which is difficult to screw up. The tostada I am not a fan of - it gets a little soggy, has a ton of lettuce and I couldn't really eat it. Instead I skipped it and went back to the chips & salsa. 

My take-away from the experience was a cute waitress, a good taco, nice chips & salsa and quick arrival of food. Negatives for the tostada, the ton of salad and just one drink. Will I be back? Sure - the choices are limited in QC. Will I enjoy it? It's better than Taco Bell, but overall nothing I will get excited about.
