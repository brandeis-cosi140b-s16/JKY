It's not much to look at, but this tiny 24-hour spot has some good burritos and some of the most flavorful salsa in town! The lot is tiny and it's a tight fit squeezing into the drive-thru. Prices are low and menu is simple: pick your meat and choose from tacos, burrito, or nachos. Drinks and asada fries round out your options. My go-to is the lengua burrito, add cheese, it comes to $8.

But back to the salsas. They offer a red and a green, and they're both great. Note that these salsas aren't especially spicy, but they have a marvelous depth of flavor that really adds to your food- I went through two cups of each style with just one burrito!
