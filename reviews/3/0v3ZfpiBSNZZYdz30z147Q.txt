One of the best places to eat meat at in Madison, it's all really tasty.  But jeez louise stay away from that huitaloche load of disgusting crap.  Service is also a little slow here and I had to ask a few times for another drink.  But the food is good so it's worth it.  Just stay away from the gross corn fungus!
