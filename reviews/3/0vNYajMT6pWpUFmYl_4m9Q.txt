Review for drinks only.
I was in for Happy Hour, the place was pretty dead, but it was a Monday. I had to try one of their specialty cocktails. We had a Coconut Mojito and a Purple Bikini Martini, a little pricey (9-10$ each) but we had coupons which made it easier to swallow. They were okay drinks, nothing special. We opted to go cheaper and just got beer and well drinks (BOGO) afterward. The service was okay. Nothing to complain or rave about. I hate that they don't serve complimentary chips and salsa but I knew that before going. The food we saw looked okay but we had eaten already so skipped food.
 I really have no need to go again, so I probably won't.
