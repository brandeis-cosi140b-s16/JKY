Rivas is your typical authentic style mexican food eatery, although in comparison to the other local restaurants in its same category (Filiberto's, Nico's, Texano's) I believe it is head of its class. Rivas has a super burrito, which is more like the american idea of a burrito(Chipotle style) of putting everything, including rice and beans, inside the burrito. The one area it lacks in is the Pico De Gallo, it seems to repeatedly have too much onion and cilantro in it.  Aside from that I'm a fan of Rivas and the fact that its open 24 hours makes it always a great option!
