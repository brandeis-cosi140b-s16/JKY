Stopped by after shopping to do take out. Saw how extremely nice, clean and authentic inside, I decided to sit down in the bar area to watch boxing. Love Boxing. 

My Waiter was very nice, called me "Senorita" and just little things aside from not having napkins nor eating utensils, that was quickly resolved.

I could have ordered something more mexican authentic, but for the first time I always order a mixed fajita (chicken, beef and shrimp) to review if I would return.

Well, another post stated it was bits and pieces of scrap meat thrown in; this is correct.  It had NO taste until the middle when it got tastier. The red and green peppers as well as the onions were not overcooked.  That being said, 3 Amigo's had the best mixta fajita over all the Mexican places I've patronized.

Upon leaving, the Mariachi Band was beginning to play, but is was 10:30 and I wasn't drinking.  It would have been nice to hear and watch boxing while eating.

I will return to try another dish as the atmosphere was enlightning.  Hopefully the a new dish will be too.
