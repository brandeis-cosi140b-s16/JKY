This is definitely Americanized Mexican food.

The good: beautiful decor, great atmosphere, friendly staff, and fast service. 

The bad: not as authentic as other places, a little more expensice than other places in the area, overall a few steps above On The Border.

If you're from the Midwest and want to stay within your comfort zone, this will be the best Mexican you've ever had. If you want to experiment and try real authentic Mexican, this isnt the place. Still the staff was friendly and great atmosphere with lots of menu options
