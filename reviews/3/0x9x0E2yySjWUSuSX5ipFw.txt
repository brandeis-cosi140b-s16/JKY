Food 3/5 - I hade the tostatas de Camaron & steak street tacos. Tostatas were pretty good but the texture of the tostata itself was oily & left a taste in the back of the mouth. Steak was dry & hard to chew.

Service 5/5 They were very nice. Food was prepared freshly & quickly.

Ambiance 3/5 - No Bathroom. Small place. No distinctive decor.

Overall - 3.6/5 stars - Not as impressive as I was hoping. But not horrible! 

Would I refer this place to a Friend? Doubtful.
