Not bad, not the best, a solid 3 stars.
Here's what I've eaten so far:
- Short rib taco - 4 stars: Great flavor
- Chicken taco - 2 stars: pretty bland
- Burger - 3 stars: not bad, but also nothing memorable about
- Fries - 2 stars: not crispy at all, I hate non-crispy fries
- Arnold Palmer - 4 stars: Made with fresh lemonade
I'd probably come back for the tacos, but just the short rib ones. I felt they were a little pricey at $3 per taco as they were pretty small though. All in all, this place is only okay, I couldn't say I loved it or hated it.
