This place is pretty awesome. The tacos are good, athough nothing like Mexico , but good. The menudo is really good.. A little over priced but it was worth it. The serving looks small but very filling. The only thing I would complain about is the prices. Overall a good experience. Also, you can check in and get free chips and salsa
