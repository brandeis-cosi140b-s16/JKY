Decent Mexican place at the Waterfront. I have been to Gran Agave a few times, most recently this past weekend. The food is always satisfactory and I have never had to wait for a table. They seem to have all of the basics down, free chips and salsa, large menu, good margaritas and fresh ingredients. The guacamole is always tasty and the mole sauce is on point. The portions are large and filling. The chicken in the tacos and quesadillas taste like it has been slow roasted for several hours. My only criticism is the wait staff. On Saturday, our waiter was visibly unhappy and impatient. Also, another server spilled a tray full of drinks right behind my dining companion and did not apologize or ask if he got wet. All in all, go to Gran Agave for the food, not for the friendly service.
