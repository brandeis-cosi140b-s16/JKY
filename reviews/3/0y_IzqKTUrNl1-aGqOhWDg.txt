My first time coming to Manuel's and was really disappointed. The waitress/bartender was really slow, they're usually quick about bringing you chips a dip, took approx. 10 min. I ordered the red Chimichanga. enchilada style, with red sauce, she brought it with green sauce, when I told her about the mistake, her fix was to bring a side of the red sauce... Not good customer service. I had an Arnold Palmer to drink, she never offered to refill it until I asked for the check. Now don't get me wrong, 1 bad day does not break this place for me. This waitress/bartender just needs to pick up her game if she's going to be successful here.
