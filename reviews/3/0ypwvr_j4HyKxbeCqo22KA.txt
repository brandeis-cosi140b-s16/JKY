I'm giving this place 3 stars for their food and fast service ONLY! So far I've had their green corn tamale (so so), their chicken quesadilla (my favorite but super greasy), and their chicken tacos (completely bland and super greasy as well). The service there is fast which I really like as I usually get food on my lunch break. However, the guy behind the counter with the glasses is out of it. He always forgets to give me my drink unless I ask for it, even then he has to check the ticket to make sure I paid. Not only that but it's rather small inside so when it gets busy at lunch it can be hard to get to the soda fountain to even fill up your cup. I was just there today and none of the customers would move so I literally had to push past their seats and almost hit a customer with my purse because they were in the way. It's not the customers fault at all, I just know if it were me in their seat I would be upset that they didn't think that through better. The guy behind the counter is always chatting with customers so he seems like a pretty decent guy and I'll continue to eat there occasionally for lunch.
