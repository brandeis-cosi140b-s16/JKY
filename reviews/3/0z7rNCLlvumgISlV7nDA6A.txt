I got the Carne Asada burrito. And a drink total was 9$ not that bad that's a responsible price. I got like 7 chips on the side lol.. They should of just gave me none because the chips aren't good at all and their salsas are okay nothing amazing. The burrito was actually pretty good it was very juicy every bite I had juice like spill out that's what it was making it good the guacamole inside was perfect with the meat. Place is cool like 4 tables were dirty when I walked in I cleaned it myself. Also the girl upfront doesn't have energy and just stands their and waits for you to come up to her to order. Kinda awkward. The place needs a little bit more energy. Also theirs a 25 cent refill box by the coke machine. Hahaha I don't think anyone would ever put 25 cents because one it was dirty and their was nothing in it. They seriously need to take that out just embarrassing. The bathroom was dirty too so I didn't understand how these guys get an A when food inspection comes because the place was dirty everywhere I looked. If you want just a good burrito yeah sure come grab one but it's not a place I'll be coming back to just doesn't have what I like in a place.
