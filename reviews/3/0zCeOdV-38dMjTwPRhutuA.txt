Way too overpriced for average mexican food, but great service. 

All of their drinks are super sweet. 

I also disliked that the tacos were "family style", aka you're forced to order 4 of the same tacos for $14, so you'll spend another $14 just to try a different kind of tacos. 

the Late night happy hour is for Industry folk only. I was mislead and thought it applied to everyone. 

the only plus was that after i ordered my expensive cocktail that tasted like sugar and hated it, my waitress without skipping a beat offered to take an order for something else. 

Am I the only one confused at the term "family style tapas"? Tiny portions that you are forced to share and pay exorbitant prices for... no thanks.
