Good service, okay food. I found this place on groupon. Its in a quiet part of Summerlin. 
Our waitress was very nice, very attentive. Live music, but a very lonely place, especially for a Saturday night. 
I ordered cheese enchiladas, the sauce was too tangy for me. My husband got a wet burrito and said it was pretty good. 
Overall, wasn't too bad but probably won't be coming back.
