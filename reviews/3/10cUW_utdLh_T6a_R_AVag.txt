I parked and as I was walking in I read a hand scrawled sign on the door "Especiales". One of these especiales was a chicharron burrito. Deep down I expected only half expected what I got when I decided to order this. 

Now I'm from New Mexico and a chicharron there is different from a Mexican style chicharron, for the most part. The Mexican style is the pork rind/skin usually fried till crisp then often they are either eaten alone (or with a few dashes  of hot sauce) or simmered in a red or green chile sauce until soft again.
In the NEW Mexican version chicharones is the fat back, the fat and meat layer just below the skin which is cubed and rendered until crispy.  
Again I was hoping it would be more on the New Mexican side. 
The burrito was the size of my shoe. This was a generous size  filled with whole beans, toasty homemade spanish rice and eventually I found a few cueritos/chicharrones. Honestly for $ 2.99 I can't complain. 
The salsa bar was ok, the salsa verde was quite good.  I also ordered a licuado de pina (a more  liquid milky version of a pineapple shake). It was just as I hoped.

It's a divey joint, ala Filiberto's.  Would I go back, maybe...
