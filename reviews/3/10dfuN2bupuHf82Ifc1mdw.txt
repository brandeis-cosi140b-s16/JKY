I wish that I could give 3 1/2 stars because I do feel that this location is improving.  I think they are losing a lot of business because of the bad reviews and slow service.  That works out fine for me because now I don't have to wait in line as long :)  We always order the special of the day, so the price isn't quite so high.  The place isn't cheap, but they do give you a lot of food for your money.  They didn't have horchatta (sp?) two times and that really pissed me off because I'm addicted to the stuff.  They said the morning crew forgot to make it.  Is that seriously an excuse?  I have never received cold food there, and I think the food tastes the same as every other location.  I don't think I have ever seen the place dirty, either.  The workers have always been polite to us, so we can't complain about that.   I live very close to this location, so I will continue to go there.  I might just have been lucky, but we do go there a lot, so maybe the people who had had bad experiences should give them one more chance.
