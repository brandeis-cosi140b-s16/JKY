The food is good and the price is decent as with all of these "authentic" Filaberto-ish Mexican food joints. They are all about the same. 

Like Filiberto's, and other hole-in-the-wall" Mexican restaurants,  the shop has a less than "Nice and clean" look and feel to it. Also just like Filiberto's, the burritos come with pure meat. Wanna add rice? It'll cost ya! Wait... they have to remove meat to fit the rice. Rice is cheaper than meat! Why on earth would anyone charge more money when they are saving money??!? Who want's a burrito with a pound of meat in it and nothing else anyway??!? You could buy 1 burrito for $3.99, take it home and make enough proper burrito's to feed 4 or 5 people. It's enough meat to gag a goat and it's not taking food cost or the customer into consideration. 

It's a terrible business model overall. It's no Chipotle's, but Chipotle's isn't authentic Mexican fare either.  =0(.

P.S. Armando Brothers is now right across the street.
