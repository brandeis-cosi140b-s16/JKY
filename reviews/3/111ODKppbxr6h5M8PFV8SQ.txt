I went back here a couple of times recently and I have to say that they have greatly improved their service and cleanliness of the restaurant. And they got my order right both times so that is a huge plus. The best thing of all is that they have started carrying some local beers from SanTan and Four Peaks. That earns them back an extra star in my book.
