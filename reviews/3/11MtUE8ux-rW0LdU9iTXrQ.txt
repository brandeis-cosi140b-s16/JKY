I love El Pollo Loco. It is one of my favorite "healthy spots" for lunch. This location i s closest to my house but still far away. So when I go here it is exciting and a treat.

This location is not the cleanest, especially the bathrooms. But I am willing to overlook that because I know they are super busy and I have never had a bad meal from here.

But when I went for my last visit it was early. I checked their website to see when they opened and it said 9am-11am. I jumped in the car for my mini road trip and when I arrived they were closed. The sign said they opened at 10am. WHAT??? Of course I went crazy in the car, full of sadness and anger. There was no way I could wait over 30 minutes. I just came from the gym and I was starving.

I had to leave and go somewhere I really didn't want to go. This is a simple mistake that should not have happened and they should fix right away. Now  I will have to put them on speed dial and call before I come.
