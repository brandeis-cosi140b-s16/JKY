Food was fantastic. Really fresh and very good. The chicken on my taco was a bit dry and the portions weren't very big..... I'm a BIG "value" guy though and I'm not sure it's that good of a value. My lunch was a chicken taco "flight" (their term for a combo meal) to include chips and salsa, a drink and a side. I paid another $1 for the shrimp side. Al in it was over $9 to sit on a concrete bench outside and eat out of styrofoam. I think that if chipotle can be a brick and mortar with a dining room and serve fresh Mexican food with their overhead.... And make HUGE MONEY....This joint made from shipping containers and no dining room should be a slightly better value in the price department.  That said... The food was great.
