Not sure what all the hype is with this place, but personally I think it's alright, but everyone else I know and work with LOVE this place and because of that, I'm dragged over here every few months. Cafe Rio is kind of like an overpriced Chipotle, where you can order burritos, tostadas, etc and they'll make the food right in front of you. The meats seem kind of dry to me and the burritos are pretty plain..only meat, sauce and cheese...really? There is also no option on the menu to order just a bowl so I have to get the burrito. Did I mention it was dry? They do offer a stamp card so your meal is free after I believe 10 stamps. I never bring it in since I come here a handful of times a year. For the price at over 10 bucks for a burrito and small drink, I don't think it's that great of a place...I'll stick with my Chipotle any day
