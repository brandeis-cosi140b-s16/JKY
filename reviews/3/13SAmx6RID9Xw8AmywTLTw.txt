Arrived 5:30p, Saturday eve. One couple and one group of buddies were also in attendance -- stayed an hour, no one else came/left. The staff was friendly and accomodating. Magaritas were $5, and tasty. Buddy and I tried: guac on side (delicious, fresh), chips were (nice), salsa (crisp and fresh), Shrimp enchilada ($11) and Swiss Enchilada ($10), served with white rice (blech) and peas/carrots (weird), refried beans w/ monterey jack cheese (nice).
Spiceeeness is just right for me :)
Tastes all melded well, but not so creative, same old stuff.
Cost: $41 (surprisingly high)...was guac $5? (3 Margs + H2O)
Next round I'll try the higher end fish products and assess for "sea" quality that San Diego is known for...

Enjoy,
