Was craving Mexican and Yelp led us here. I don't eat beans so how ironic I came to a place called Frijoles and ordered with "no beans".

I got the chicken salad. Although it not taste bad there was no special flavors that popped out. It did come with a lot of ingredients In it so that was appreciated. I also got Ceviche which also had no special flavors to it. It was just shrimp and avocado. It was a little too sour for my tests buds. I know ceviche is made with lime but mine could use a little less lime. 

The street corn didn't contain enough mayo, cheese or chile (or whatever they put on it). The chips and salsa was a good start through. It had the right amount of spicy to it.

The workers were all very kind and attentive. Did not have a bad experience but I wouldn't come here for another mexican meal.
