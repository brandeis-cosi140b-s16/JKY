Super cute restaurant.  Loved the old toolboxes for lights and maps for wallpaper.  I thought the food was so-so.  I'm kinda a taco junkie.  I thought the tacos lacked a punch in flavor as well as the gauc.  The best thing I had was the flatbread taco which the meat was super good.  I took it off the flatbread, as that was too much for me.
