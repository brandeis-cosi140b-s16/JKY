Julia T. egged me on to write corporate after my last experience. So after about two weeks, I did get two email responses from managers at this particular location. They both apologized profusely, and let me know that the particular employee whose behavior was both bizarre and offensive had been dealt with appropriately, and assured me that this is not the norm at their store. They also asked us to come in for a free meal, which we have no intention of doing. Although I do appreciate the acknowledgement of my concerns, I fear retaliation "extras" in my meal. When we want Chipotle, we'll go to another location.
