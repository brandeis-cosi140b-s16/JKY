Yummmmay burritos!! My sis and I ordered two carne asada burritos, they were the bomb!! Here is where we lose the two stars: When we ordered (togo) I asked if they had chips and salsa, to which the cashier said yes. I said ok, are they small orderes or large? She said very small so we ordered two. Upon receiving burritos there were no chips in bag. I asked the man at the counter for our chips and it was a big to do. Apparently chips are for dine in complimentary, and not necessarily for to go. I told him I had ordered from the cashier (who was standing BEHIND him listening but never opened her mouth once to say a word that YES we had had a whole CONVERSATION about the damn chips and YES I had ordered them. Nope. Just stood there watching the dude give me attitude. Finally after many sighs (I offered to pay for them, twice.I had assumed I had paid for them when I ordered.  I was told I did not pay for them (originally) over and over again. Um ok? I ordered them and was given NO receipt sans the credit card slip itself. NO itemization how was I to know??? I was happy to pay but the guy would rather be a jerk. Ok. 

Finally I am handed two GROCERY sacks full of chips. Wha?? I wanted two small sides. I just took them and left. 

And the kicker? The chips were not very good. No salt, overly thick and just kinda gross. My sister and I looked at each other like, damn we went through all that for some crappy chips??

Would go back for burritos, dont bother asking for extras. Keep it simple.
