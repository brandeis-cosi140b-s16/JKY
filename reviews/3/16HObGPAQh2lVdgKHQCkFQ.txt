This is the cleanest, fanciest Filiberto's of all time.  I feel like I should be wearing a suit and tie when I dine here.  Where is the valet parking?

With all of its fanciness this is still Filiberto's and one five rolled taco plate doesn't differ no matter what the interior looks like.  If you are a fan of greasy food Fili B's is the place to go.  It is cheap mexican food that best hits the spot while in a state of inebriation.
