I love señor taco. The one on the west side, in surprise. 

This one isn't quite as good. The salsas at the salsa bar were missing spoons and tongs. Some of the choices were never refilled and empty. Such as the hot carrots and onions with serranos. 

I had tacos this time. One with shredded beef and one with shredded chicken. The beef was pretty good but I'd never order the chicken again. 

Also, the señor taco in surprise sprinkle Mexican cheese on the chips. I wish this one did. 

Anyway. I'll be back to try my favorite señor taco item, carne asada burrito!!
