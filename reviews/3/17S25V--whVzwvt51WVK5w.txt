An old favorite 


La Loma Mexican Grill is tucked away in a small strip mall and has been there for as long as I have been in Arizona. The atmosphere at La Loma has  nice causual vibe and the staff is very friendly and accommodating. 

As you walk into La Loma you make your way to the front counter, view the menu, place your order, take a seat, and wait for your entrée to be delivered to your table.

 La Loma offers a good varied menu at reasonable prices. The only drawback is the plastic silverware and plates that your entrée is served on. However, I didn't mind  the styrofoam plates and plastic utensils after all its the food on the plate that matters not the plate it self.

The food at La Loma is fresh and tasty and my lunch companion and I enjoyed are meals.  Looking forward to our next visit.
