I swear their potatoes are magical.

Imagine a Chipotle setup, but with a slew of healthier options.  I don't ever order the healthy options...but they are there if for some reason you want to feel better about your enormous burrito.

You can fill your whole-wheat tortilla with brown rice and sweet potatoes.  Might I recommend the regular potatoes, however?  They are just yum-tastic.

Not the greatest meal you'll ever have, but a good, cheap, huge burrito to fill you up.  I like it better than Chipotle.  And it's a local business, which is always a good thing to support.
