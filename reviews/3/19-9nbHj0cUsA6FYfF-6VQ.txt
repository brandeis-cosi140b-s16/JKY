After a long drive from CA to Vegas, we needed food fast!
Eastern Ave is an easy off the highway stop before getting into the mess of the strip.
I saw Zaba's is a local Chipotle style chain so we stopped here.
Were there not so many restaurants like this by now I would likely give 4 stars but most places are just better than Zaba's
Sure, they  have two kinds of potatoes you can add to your bowl/burrito/taco/salad but the rest is standard and nothing really stood out in taste.
Take that back, the Cilantro Pesto I put on my salad was AMAZING!!!
The rest, boring.
Nothing was really warm, I like my food piping hot.
I had the salad with everything except for meat, it was fine, all due to the pesto.
The man had the burrito, didn't say much, I'm assuming fine, not stellar.
My son had the kids quesadilla with potatoes, super cheap at $2.99.
Service a bit lacking as no one really understood much english, but the place was clean and spacious.
$17 for lunch for 3 is great, but I don't think I would bother to come back, there is too much good food in the area.
