Its a great price for food, especially on the strip in vegas, but this is pretty far from the main part of vegas. The service was great and was very nice. Food taste wise was ok, i've had better. Its not your chipotle or taco del mar burrito if that is what you are expecting.

I'd give it 4 stars for price, quantity and service. 
I give it 2 1/2 stars for taste.

There is a salsa bar for your chips which is nice.
