I will have to say that out of the "Hispanic Restaurants" this one is better. Better than macayos and better than don Rubens in my opinion. It's on and off for us as it was so good it almost put my wife into labor when she was pregnant lol. She had the fried ice cream after the chimi and we were both in sugar heaven. It just isn't consistent for us. Give it a go. Get the enchiladas or my favorite is the green tamale(it's sweet)
