The tacos suck but their pollo nachos are good. Pastor taco is good. Haven't tried anything else. Service sucks. Waited for thirtyfive minutes for four tacos that sucked. Def coming back for nachos though. We also stumbled in for a band. Hollyfelds? They kicked ass and now I'm a fan.

I want to try tofu tacos next time.
