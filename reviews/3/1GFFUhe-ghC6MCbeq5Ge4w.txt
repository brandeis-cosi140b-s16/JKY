Our first visit and I have to say I am not impressed, they were out of tamales at 2:30 on a Saturday, one of the biggest shopping days of the year, they were out of half the soda on the machine, after we had paid for our order they informed us they only had one chicken taco left. They didn't know this before we ordered because honestly being out of 2 of the 3 things we ordered I probly would have changed my mind and went to robertos that at least has what we ordered. I will say the food was good and the place was clean but I'm still not impressed.
