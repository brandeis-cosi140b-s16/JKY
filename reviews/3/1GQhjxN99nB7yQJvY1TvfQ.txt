The breakfast burros here in this location are bigger and that's about the only difference in the two locations. It's not your best version, but not the worst either. Potato, onion and egg seems to be a fairly healthy choice, but there was some gas involved, so beware of that fact if you are going to work after downing one of these. Only 4 bucks, so it does not break the bank either. It does seems like way too big of a building for this place.
