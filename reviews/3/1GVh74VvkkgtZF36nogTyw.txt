We go out for Mexican food quite often...I had been to the Mill Ave location many years ago so we figured we should try this location since we live close.  

When we walked in it was a lil awkward, wasnt sure if a waitress sat us or if we ordered up at the counter. Eventually,  we were told to sit where we like. The waitresses weren't wearing uniforms or tags so I wasnt sure who worked there.  

There were maybe 2 or 3 booths filled, so not a super busy place at 7pm.

Thumbs up for coke products and the salsa was pretty good, a lil spicy but good.

I figured I would get something safe, a taco, enchilada,  rice ans, beans. Food came out piping hot, however I have to admit I was disappointed.  The taco was super deep fried and greasy and only had lettuce, no cheese or tomato.. That's just how they do it. The beans were pretty good, and the enchilada was okay, not very flavorful and same goes with the rice. Service was okay,  once food came we were never checked on.

Our experience wasnt bad, but there are other places I enjoyed more so im being fair and giving 3 stars
