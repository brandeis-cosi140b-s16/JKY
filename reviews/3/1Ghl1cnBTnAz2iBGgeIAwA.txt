I tried their samples at the Westgate farmers' market, and they were good. Not fantastic, not unusual. But good. I think I would have to try some more to really make a truly educated review.  

FYI, they have a holiday special, where if you buy 2 dozen, you get a 1/2 dozen sweet tamales for free. Rates are $20 a dozen, $10 a half, and $2 each.
