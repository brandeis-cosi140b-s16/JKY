This Chipotle (on Hwy 51 beside the Catholic High School) is ok but not as easy to get in and out of as the one on Providence Road.  For starters, they share a parking lot which is not laid out very well. Second, getting back out into the flow of traffic on 51 can be tough, even if you are taking a right out of the lot.  

So, today I stopped in to grab some lunch to take back to the office,  and found that the service was pretty slow compared to my other visits to Chipotle.

3 people had apparently ordered online and were now standing around waiting for their orders, which had not been prepared prior to their arrival. This sort of discombobulated  the entire line staff and the cashier.  

When they finally took my order,  things flowed a little better until I got to the checkout.  There I had to wait for awhile so that the cashier could sort & bag the orders for the folks who had ordered online.  They need to figure out how to streamline the fulfullment of online orders so that it is more smooth and efficient.  

Still, it's Chipotle - so the food is fresh and tasty... always a good choice when you want a quick and inexpensive meal.
