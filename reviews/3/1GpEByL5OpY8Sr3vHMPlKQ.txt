Take a pass.

Eh, with all the Mexican food restaurants in the area, this one is worth taking a pass on and going somewhere else (not that the food is any better, just nothing special about El Sombrero in comparison).  The seating is limited, the parking is terrible, and the food is not worth making a trip here.  I will not be coming back here again.
