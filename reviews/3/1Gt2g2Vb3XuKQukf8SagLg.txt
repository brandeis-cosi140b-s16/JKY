We arrived at 8, were told it was a two hour wait on the patio, and we were seated within an hour.  Waiting with perfect margaritas was great--but the salsa choices suck and the chips were a little stale.  There's red-hot red and fiery tomatillo, and the gringo in our group couldn't enjoy chips n salsa at all.  Maybe there's a third option they don't tell you about?  I dunno.  The red salsa tasted like the red peppers you sprinkle on pizza, blended with oil in a Cuisinart.  Not my favoritestyle--I prefer a touch more of the tomato.

My carnitas were pretty bland, frankly, but everything else our table ordered was pretty solid.  Chimis and enchiladas with flavorful, nasty-hot green and red sauces.  This is one place where I'd actually order a hamburger on the side for your out of town guests, just in case they can't stand the heat.

A Phoenix legend that everyone should try for themselves.  I got unlucky this time with my order--ten years ago I remember loving whatever I had.
