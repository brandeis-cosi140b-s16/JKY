I'm really on the fence about trying this place again. On one hand, I liked the wine/cocktail list, the appetizers and ambiance. On the other, the service was lacking and the entrees were tiny and oversalted. 

My sister and I came for restaurant prior to seeing a show at Gammage. I made 5:30 reservations so that we wouldn't have to rush dinner. Unfortunately, that's exactly what happened due to a 30 minute+ gap between our appetizers and entrees. Our server never checked up on us or explained what was happening until after we flagged down someone else to order another glass of wine. I was also irked that our server took my silverware after I finished my first course but never bothered to replace it. Luckily, the host sitting at the door rushed over to give me a new set so I didn't have to wait on our server again.

My sister got the vegan cauliflower bisque which had a light texture and nice basil flavor. I loved my fried manchego. It was like the best part of a grilled cheese sandwich accompanied by a delicious roasted sweet tomatoes. The succotash entree, however, was minuscule and almost ruined by the heavily salted wilted spinach. The shiitakes in the dish were very good though.

The desserts were both decent. I got the chocolate almond croissant pudding, and my sister got the vegan blueberry coconut parfait. We both agreed hers tasted more like a breakfast dish.

The patio looks like it will be very welcoming during the cooler months. Maybe after a couple months, I'll be ready to give Revival another go.
