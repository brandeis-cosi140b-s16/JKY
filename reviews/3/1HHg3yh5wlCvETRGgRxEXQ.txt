Some coworkers have been hitting up the Original Burrito since our office moved, so I thought I would give it a try.

Went their around 12 and noticed lil bit of a rush, but the line moved fast, so I wasn't worried.

I ordered the carne asada burrito with beans & guacamole, the guacamole was extra, because with the burrito you can choose either or, and I just was in the mood for beans, but also in my mind a carne asada burrito always comes with guacamole or avocado, pico de gallo and the tasty meat, so the chance to throw in beans, that made me happy. Just wondered why they would make you choose between the 2.

The flour tortilla seemed very fresh, the meat was delish, the guacamole, which was more like avocado and Mexican cheese blend was perfect, the beans over powered the burrito, next time I will pass on them, and it was lacking in pico de gallo.

The burrito came with chips & salsa, the chips were great, and the salsa, it was great with flavor but a little runner than what I like. I think I will go back and try something different. 

I enjoy trying new places for lunch, and happy to add another on to my ever growing list.
