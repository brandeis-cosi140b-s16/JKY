I give this place (& I call it a place because the staff is unfriendly as HECK!!) 3 stars because I did order the right menu item but didn't have any warm & fuzzy feeling like they want you to come back. They figured everyone wants to eat here. Not a problem, there is only 1 staff member that actually greets a customer & she isn't a server; she's a custodian !! Food good , ambience good, service sucks & expects the customer to "be here". Not a great feeling.
