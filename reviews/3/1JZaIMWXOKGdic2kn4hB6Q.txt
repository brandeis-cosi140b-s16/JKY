A decent spot to eat at. Our waitress wasn't as fast as she could have been considering it wasn't packed. Most of the food was tasty especially the molcajete but we had three complaints that kept coming up around the table. The fish was very sub-par, over cooked, and over seasoned. The rice was a little soggy and it was very tasteless, it was almost hard to eat to be honest. To finish it off the salsa was very watery and it felt like it was missing something. All In all, it was an alright spot I doubt we will be going back considering the long drive but I wouldn't count it out for good.
