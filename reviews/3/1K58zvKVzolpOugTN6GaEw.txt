"Typical American style Mexican food. Very clean restaurant but a little cold, I think it needs some centerpieces or artwork or something. Service was great, guacamole was very fresh. Chips had a slight aftertaste and the meals were average. I wouldn't really recommend it, but if you are craving mexican, it should do the job.
