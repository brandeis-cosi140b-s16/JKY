The frozen drinks were weak and definitely not worth their price tag.  We did, however, enjoy sipping them on the patio during an overcast Vegas Saturday morning.  It was actually relaxing.  So my stars are for the casual ambience and not for the drinks themselves.  It worked and was fine for the moment, but we are in no race to go back.  My advice:  order an "on the rocks" drink and stay away from frozen ones.
