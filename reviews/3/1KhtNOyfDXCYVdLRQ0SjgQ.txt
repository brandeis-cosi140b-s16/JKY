The sign also bills itself as 'Santa Fe style' food. Having lived many years in New Mexico, with a family - generations of which are from New Mexico - the cuisine was decidely not New Mexican. It was standard Sonoran.

With that said, the meal was quite enjoyable. The enchilada sauce had a nice flavor. The dulce de leche was fantastic. The service was very good. The decor was a little non-descript, but that's OK, All in all, a nice addition to the meager choices for Mexican food in Surprise.  We would probably come back.

I had to give it 3-stars because of what it is not. If you are looking for Spanish food - there is none here. If you are looking for New Mexican style-cuisine, you won't find it either. 

However, if you are looking for a decent, enjoyable meal at a local family-owned establishment, this is a good choice.
