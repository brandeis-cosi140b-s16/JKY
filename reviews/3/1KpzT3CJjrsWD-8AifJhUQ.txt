This Qdoba location is a quieter, shorter wait, alternative to the Chipotle located on the NW corner of Tatum & Cactus. I know some diners are passionate in their love for Chipotle, but Qdoba mimics the concept very well. Both chains originated in Colorado in the mid 1990's, which no doubt accounts for their similarity. 

When the lines are out the door at Chipotle, come on over to the SE corner of Tatum & Cactus. The food at Qdoba is solid and the staff is friendly.
