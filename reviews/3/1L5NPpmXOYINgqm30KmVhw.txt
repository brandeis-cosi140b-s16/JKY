I haven't been back since 11/13. The service had always been excellent. Salsa is good, but they would be better off buying the tortilla chips from the store and serving those. The patio can be fun during the season. Drink and food prices are fair. They're local so if we're not in the mood to drive, it works (lately we've driven to get our Mexican food fix). Definitely would have been a 4 or 4.5 had it not been for those bad chips....
