If you're looking for a bloody mary that meets any typical bloody mary standard, do. not. come. here. "Watery Mary" might be a better description, as their take on a bloody has no heat, no flavor, and tastes like watery tomato juice. I think there was a garnish? I was so shocked at how un-mary like my bloody mary was that after writing this review, I think I'll have to block the experience from my mind. 

Onto the menu - it's changed quite a bit since I frequented it in 2010. The menu changes unfortunately have not been for the better. Their once eclectic selection which featured dishes like a cheesy au-gratin served in a cast-iron skillet, is now a page of run-of-the-mill mexican fare. While the selection is not the worst, it's not as good as it used to be and their tacos definitely don't come close to the top of my list. 

The tacos: 
Two soft shell corn tortillas that are soggy and fall apart easily. I had the seitan tacos, which I'd recommend as a decent veg option. 

On the plus side, their guacamole is top-notch and they have a bomb patio. I highly recommend their chips, guac, and margaritas or sangria if you're looking to kick it with friends.  If the patio is full, the indoor bar and restaurant area ooze old-timey vibes -- so no matter where you're sitting, you'll definitely fall in love with the space -- sans their watery marys.
