After Monterreys i didnt think i could go to another mexican restaurant and be satisfied. This place does that. Most everything was cool.

Do yourself a favor and go here. The food is good. Atmosphere is awesome. The one thing i don't get is that their salsa isn't great and you have to dress it up. Mexican restaurants have to make great salsa! If you candle spicy order their spicy salsa mix it with their regular and put some salt in it. Awesome! However i don't like to make a concoction at a restaurant. Thats the whole reason i go to restaurants.  Other than that their regular salsa taste like it came out of jar. You have to dress up ur food, and do it right. Thats why they only got 3 stars, other than that i enjoyed myself.
