Got in quickly, asked to be seated at a low top table and were seated at a very small one. Good food, but nothing spectacular. The queso fundido was like most I've had, but made with Gouda cheese which gave it a better taste. The quesadillas had too many peppers for me liking but were good. Husband had carnitas which were fine.
