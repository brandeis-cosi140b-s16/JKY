Qdoba is a healthy alternative compared to some other not so healthy fast food options. For those who aren't familiar, it's the same concept as Chipotle where you can choose from a burrito, tacos or bowl. Pick from white or brown rice, black or pinto beans, and veggies or several types of meat. You then choose your toppings which including salsa, cheese, corn, sour cream, guacamole and more. 


I think it is a little over priced for what you are getting but it's probably comparable to other fast food places nowadays. I like chipotle better personally. This location is fine and just as good as any other. 

My only real complaint is that the bathroom smelled like urine which is just plain gross.
