There really isn't a whole lot to say about Del Taco. It's like a low end, more authentic version of Taco Bell that kind of wants to be Roberto's, but also wants to be a Mexican McDonald's. The tacos aren't THAT bad and the fries are ok. I think it goes without saying that you should avoid the American food, burgers and such, at any Mexican eatery. It's a good place to grab some food if it's 3am and you only have a few bucks.
