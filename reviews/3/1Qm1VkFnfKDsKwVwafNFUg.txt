You would think that in Nevada you could get good Mexican food, but I suppose something right on the Strip wouldn't be authentic.  It was edible/ good enough, mostly, but I will complain about the rice and beans (which were $5 each as a side!! A $10 side of rice & beans, seriously?) and the rice tasted like cooked white rice with tomato paste.

The only reason this place gets 3 stars is because they often hand out cards to get $3 margaritas and boy are they yummy!  They do them on the rocks, but they have just the right amount of alcohol and the margarita mix they use is good.  They are MUCH better than the $12 blended margaritas you can get in the restaurant.  Go for the $3 margaritas at the take out window by the door and nothing else (maybe a side of chips & salsa if you need just a little sustenance).
