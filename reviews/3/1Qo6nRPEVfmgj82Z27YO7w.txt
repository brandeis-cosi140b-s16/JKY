The atmosphere is clean and lots of sitting room. Good selection of Mexican food and seems to be a good step above fast food Mexican but not on same level as a few real Mexican favorites. Good cheese crisp. Mini chimis don't compete with gecko grill. Chimi was ok. Great chips and ok salsa. Ok price.
