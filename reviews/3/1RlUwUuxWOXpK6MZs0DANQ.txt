I visited this place on 9/1/2013. I love that they are open 24 hours. I recently moved to the area and after a long day of moving my husband and I were very hungry. We used to eat at Julioberto's in Phoenix (see my review on them), and I was skeptical about Filiberto's after hearing they are nothing like Julio's. However, I was pleasantly surprised. The portions are huge, like a Julio's, but the food was different. My husband's Chimichanga was great! and I enjoyed the burrito/taco combo I got as well. I like Filiberto's beans better than those served at Julioberto's. We each got a huge combo and split a drink (with a side of sour cream) for under $20, which, for the portions, is very fair. If we weren't so hungry, we could have easily split a combo, which we often do at Julio's. 
Another thing I appreciated about this place was that they got my order correct. At Julio's I often was missing little extra add-ons, or they would get my drink order wrong. Nothing devastating, just irritating and Filiberto's GOT IT RIGHT THE FIRST TIME!!
If you're looking for a late night tasty Mexican feast for cheap-- LOOK NO FURTHER and go to Filiberto's!
