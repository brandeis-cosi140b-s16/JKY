With a desire to get out of the 100+ degree heat, we headed up to Cave creek for a bit cooler weather, some chicken tacos and a couple brews.  El Encanto has a neat little pond in the middle of the restaurant, and pretty darn good food.  The service was great, draft beer was ice cold.  I wouldn't necessarily make the drive solely to eat here, but when in the area it is a very solid dining optoin.
