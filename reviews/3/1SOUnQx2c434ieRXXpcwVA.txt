Decently priced and taste for Mexican fast food. Its not everyone's favorite but their are very few 24 hr restaurants open. This is one of them. Tacos are larger then most which explain why they are over 2 bucks. They also do a TACO Wednesday which I find weird. In California its Taco Tuesday for specials. I do love there Taquitos tho.
