I had gone to this place right after Guy was there and I ordered the #1 combination 3 tacos server with rice and beans I picked a Carne Asada, Lengua and a Cabeza... I remember not being so blown away I was really disappointed. So fast forward a few years to now and I say I need to give this place another try... I think to my self Guy was ranting about this spot... So I head over for lunch and it's really busy so I get to the counter and order the # 1 all Carne Asada tacos I go find a table and drink my drink my number is called I get my food and look at comment bar there is no salsa so I have to ask... I ask for both she seemed kind of bothered. Let me tell you these are no write home about tacos the salsa on the other hand I could drink both kinds it's really good. So I am not sure if I will be back anytime soon with all the other options out there... DDD just lets me down every time.
