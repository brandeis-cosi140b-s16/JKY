This is perfect for a quick not too heavy or too expensive bite to eat.  I did expect more as far as location and set up, but, it was perfect for us as a last quick meal in Vegas before heading home.

My son ordered the Enchiladas de Mole Poblano - Shredded chicken rolled in corn tortilla, covered with Mole Poblano and topped with cotija cheese, onion and roasted sesame seeds. They were a little too sweet and choclatey for our tastes.

My mom had that Huevos Mexicanos and she loved them!  

I had the Pelonas - 2 Fried Rolls stuffed with shredded beef , fried beans, cream and hot sauce.  They were not as seasoned as I would have liked, tasted like they needed salt or something was missing.  If it wasn't for the cream and hot sauce, I think the meat would have been too dry.  The bread was delicious though!

And we all shared the mini-Molletes - open face bolillo bread spread with refried beans and topped with melted cheese and pico de gallo.  They reminded me of home!
