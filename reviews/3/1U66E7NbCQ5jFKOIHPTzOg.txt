I like coming to this Qdoba because it is close to my house and my office.  Sometimes I will come here on my lunch break or I will come here for dinner with friends on the weekend.  It is a small shop in the Central Park shopping center. 

My favorite thing to get here is the Craft 2,  you can pick from a variety of things.  For example you can get tacos, tortilla soup, quesadilla or a naked taco salad.  I always get two soft tacos and two hard tacos.  

The downside on this Qdoba is that they are closed on Sundays and they are not open very late on Friday and Saturdays.
