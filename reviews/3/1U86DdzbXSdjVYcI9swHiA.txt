$3 drink specials during happy hour really means if you order the cheap beer, you might end up paying $3.75 after tax. However if you want anything decent, you will still end up paying a vegas standard price.  I ordered two margaritas here because the wait lines were just too long at the bar. They have a side bar where drinks are quickly prepared. Two strong margaritas with some cheap house J.C. tequilla came out to be about $18.  Its a good pitstop if you are cruising down the strip and looking to get hammered. It gets too busy on the weekends to actually sit down and drink though.
