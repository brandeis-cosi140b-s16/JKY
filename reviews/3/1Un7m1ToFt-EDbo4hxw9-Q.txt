My BFF and I stopped by here for a quick bite. We had intended to go to the cafe next door but the chips and salsa sounded good so off to Garduno's we went.

The chip and salsa were good, not excellent but good and a provided a good thermometer for the rest of dinner. I also liked the fact that they had a self serve salsa bar which included an avocado salsa! I love avocado salsa and this was a good one! Creamy with small avocado chunks and slightly spicy a great combo with the warm tortilla chips! Mm Mmm!

Not being too hungry I just opted for the Rolled Tacos (or Taquitos as I normally call them). Pretty simple, you get 6 total tacos- 3 filled with chicken and cheese and 3 filled with shredded beef and cheese then the whole plate is topped with cheese and pico de gallo. Good stuff! The plate comes with sides of Chile con Queso (I didn't care for this one), Guacamole (ok, not great) and Sour Cream. I opted to dip my tacos in the avocado salsa instead :)

Overall we had a good dining experience. The service was friendly and prompt and our food came out timely and hot. 

While I didn't love the place it was good and satisfied for a quick bite. I may return, but there are so many other GREAT restaurants in Vegas to check out instead!
