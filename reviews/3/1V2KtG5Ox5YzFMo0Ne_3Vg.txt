I finally went back to Round Corner Cantina in honor of a dearly departed friend, who simply adored the brunches.  The Sunday Brunch is worth 4 stars: $4 Bloody Marys or Bloody Marias.  Both well-mixed and priced right.  Not too crowded.

The catch is that this place is intolerable on weekends.  Being that Butler St. only has a dozen bars, this should be a top choice for me.  But it's not.  The service is incredibly slow.  Worst than that, the server knew nothing about the drinks.  I tried to ask about the Carnation, but she had to look at the menu to see which drink I was referring to.  I ordered it anyway.  What looked to be a mix of the best attributes of my two favorite cocktails--the Cosmo and the Dark 'N Stormy--was just a heavy dose of ginger beer with a splash of mediocre vodka, a touch of cran juice, far too much lime, and way too much ice.  It was a hot night and the drink was thoroughly watered down by the time it got to me.  I'd be inclined to blame the server over the bartender, but I'm not sure.  I'm not a professional bartender, but when I serve drinks with ice on days over 80 degrees, I make specialty ice cubes with the drink ingredients to not water down the drink.  For $7, I certainly wasn't expecting my cocktail to be a third water by the time it arrived.

Finally, the food.  In a word: eh.  I thought both of the pork tacos were all right.  But the pollo tinga was downright awful.  Chicken in all varieties is one of my food staples, but something unholy was done to this poultry.  The guac was decent, but honestly Mad Mex has better...and if you're claiming to be authentic Mexican anything, Mad Mex should not best you on any detail.  To top it off, they charge $3.5 for chips and salsa and then only refill the chips but not the salsa.  C'mon.
