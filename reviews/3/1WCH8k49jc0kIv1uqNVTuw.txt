My gf introduced me to Roberto's, and if she hadn't, there's an excellent chance I would've missed Roberto's altogether.  It's un-remarkably decorated to the point of almost drab inside and out, at least the location I patronize, but clearly Roberto knows he doesn't need to spend money on the ambiance since people flock there to eat.  I don't really know authentic Mexican food, and I tend to go for the ala cart items like a simple regular taco, but I can judge a good place by the line at the counter that's there no matter what time of day (and Roberto's is open 24/7).  Because of hours of business, the place can sometimes draw an odd crowd.  If I were hungover, second only to Waffle House, I'd go for Roberto's at 3AM, but that's another story for another kind of forum.  

My gf gets the #11 every time.  I don't know what all is in that, but she never deviates from that item.  She piles on the carrots from the condiment bar, too.  She loves Roberto's and that's really why I continue to spend money at this place because the food in terms of flavor, doesn't really stand out to me, but I can tell a real difference in Roberto's dishes compared to other fast food Mexican joints.  It's fresh, for starters.  And for fresh, they prepare it made-to-order every time and quickly.  If the crowd at Roberto's is unruly, at least I don't have to hang around there too long.
