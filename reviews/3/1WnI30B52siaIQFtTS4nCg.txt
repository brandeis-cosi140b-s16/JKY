I went to this location for the first time yesterday. The service was very friendly and fast. I ordered the burro with spinach queso, one of the lunch specials. While the food is decent I wouldn't say it is fantastic. There are just so many really really good Mexican restaurants in the area. I thought the salsa that came with the chips tasted like jar salsa from the grocery store. Julio G's just didn't "wow" me but the food was decent and the lunch prices were pretty reasonable.
