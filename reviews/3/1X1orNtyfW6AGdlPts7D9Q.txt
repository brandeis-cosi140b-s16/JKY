This is a burrito place similar to Chipotle or Qdoba.  They also do soft tacos.  A choice of several meats and a vegetarian option.  I'm not really fond of the barbacoa (too sweet), but the chili roast beef is good.  They will "enchilada style" it for free.

One thing I'm not crazy about is the rice.  It's fine when put in the burritos, but as a side by itself it's sort of a lime/cilantro rice.  For a side dish I'd prefer a more traditional Mexican rice (tomato/cumin/etc).  The beans are nothing special (black or pinto).

The tortillas are made fresh, the ingredients also seem to be (they make a point of it everywhere you look in the place).  They have a neat soda option where you can use Torani syrups and soda water.  I wish they had a few more flavors available, but the ones they have are good.

A solid choice for burrito places.  Nothing particularly special, but good.  We will be coming back when the mood strikes.
