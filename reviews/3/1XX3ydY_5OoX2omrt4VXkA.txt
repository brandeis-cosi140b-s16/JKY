Place looked busy and smelled delightful. After a 30 min wait before being seated. We all decided to get the buffet. Lots of tasty looking dishes and with free mimosas. Everything tasted much as it looked. The carnitas and handmade corn tortillas stole the show. 
They had run out of oj so mimosas turned to just champagne, and the bloody mary tasted like there was nit a drop of vodka to be found. Would of loved to have tasted the chips and salsa but after asking 3 times for them we gave up. 
Overall food was tasty, service was slow.
