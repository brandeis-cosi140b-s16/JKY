Well, it was a mixed bag on my first visit to La Poblanita.  I stopped in and asked for an order of chicken soft tacos on corn tortillas, a pork tamale, and a regular horchata.

It took maybe 6-7 minutes for my order to be prepared and my number was called and I went up to grab my bag.  First the good:  the horchata was terrific.  I ordered the regular because I thought the large was priced a little high at $2.50.  I was wrong.  The large is well worth the price and I'll get it when I go back.  The tamale was excellent.  It was a little light on the filling, but it had a really great flavor and was a bargain at $1.50.

So when I order food to go, I've had enough good experiences that I don't ever bother to check to make sure I was given what I ordered.  That practice burnt me today.  My tacos were neither chicken, nor soft.  They were ground beef and they were hard.  Sigh.  If either of the other two items I ordered were bad, I might have gone back.  But I didn't.  I ate them.  They were okay.  I wouldn't get them again though.  Too much other fun stuff on the menu.  Like tamales!  And horchata!
