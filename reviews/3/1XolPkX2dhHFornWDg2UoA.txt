I guess I just ordered the wrong thing? Craving a quesadilla we headed to Fausto's for lunch. What I got was inedible, disgusting and a mess. Granted we did take out.. granted we do live 3 minutes away. I don't know what excuses I can make. I opened my little styrofoam container and it was just a jumbled mess of grease and slime. The chicken was really low quality, the orange grease was everywhere and the tortillas sucked. The veggies were gross too while we're at it. It was inedible and I threw it away. I travel to mexico all the time (probably been 25 times?), I grew up in TX. I know good mexican food and I know good "americanized" mexican food as well. This wasn't good at all. You can in fact make a quesadilla that isn't greasy. Authentic mexican places do NOT use orange cheese. Doesn't happen. I attached a photo of the nasty monstrosity of a quesadilla they served me. 

I'm giving them 3 stars instead of 2 stars because the hubby's nachos were decent. The carnitas on his nachos were bland and the meat quality wasn't great, but at least the portion was good?
