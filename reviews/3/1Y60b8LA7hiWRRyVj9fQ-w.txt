This is basically the same as Roberto's or several other Mexican food places around.  The food is what you would expect, it's pretty good, not too expensive, and it comes out quick.  Since the food is rushed out so fast, you often get meals where the cheese isn't remotely melted.  Generally they just rely on the heat from the food to melt the cheese.  Staff has been friendly and the place is usually pretty clean.  I give this place 3 stars because it isn't anything special, but still good.
