Food is 5 stars!!

But if you have to wait 15 minutes for menus and 10 for a drinks and 30 for your food!!  Now that sucks. There is only one lady running food taking orders and running register. They should at least have 1 more person taking orders.
I hate waiting for my food especially when I'm starving. 

However service Is always on point and the lady is super nice every time I come. :)
