Surprisingly A-OK for this random joint.  

The chips and salsa were the best part.  Good salsa.  

The menu was pretty large.  Lots of options and combos and such.  The food was pretty standard for reasonably priced "american" Mexican.  

The fish taco was good.  Flavorful creamy chipotle sauce.  

Nothing will knock your socks off but definitely a decent meal for the price.  The place is cute too.
