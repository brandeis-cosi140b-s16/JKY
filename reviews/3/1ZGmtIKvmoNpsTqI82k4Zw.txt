I think I should have thought about what i ordered before I just got stuck in line and had to order quick,but my thought was hmmm seems like a Chipotle type place.

I wasn't a fan at all of what i ordered everything was just blah and bland. I did like the tortilla but they put it in under the salad i ordered. 

Just not a big fan, might try it again but go a different route.
