Al Pastor carved off the spit. Got it a little too early and it wasnt very crispy yet but I will be back to try that again when Im in town.
Chorizo and egg burrito was good.
Carne Asada tacos really good...They serve whole beans on top, which reminds me of the way my friend's dad used to make them in the middle of the desert, cooking over a campfire.
