Quick Hit: Consider Checking Out

The place was recommended to me by several friends that have lived in Phoenix their whole lives as a tucked away restaurant gem serving authentic New Mexican Cuisine. Gem is an adequate description since the restaurant is decently nondescript in external appearance and seating is very limited - they have a handful of tables and bar seating available. Due to limited space and great popularity, you would expect significantly long waiting times. Indeed when we arrived there for brunch there was hordes of folks waiting outside. This sight alone deterred other Dicks Hideaway dining hopefuls from trying again another time. We decided to wait and have drinks (Bloody Mary and Dicks White Sangria - both well made, and the sangria is like drinking liquid candy, it was delicious). With drinks in hand, the 30 minute wait seemed much shorter. The restaurant atmosphere is definitely a relaxed one with humorous tag lines and stickers with funny phrases scattered across the walls. Heck, you are even greeted at the door by a "kids left alone will receive a drink and a kitten" - don't quote me directly. All in all, real chill and laid back vibe. Now for the most important part, the food. Several appetizing items on the menu representing New Mexican cuisine. In all honesty, the items looked more appetizing on the menu than it truly tasted. After eating my steak Benedict and sampling my friends dishes, everything was just ok. Some dishes were so over seasoned that it completely masked the individual taste of the combined ingredients, while mine was blandly flavored. The food portions were large and came out hot (actually the plates are so hot that I encourage you to wait several minutes or you may get a first degree burn - serious). Service was incredibly friendly, grounded, and accommodating. The service rounded out the experience.

Overall, cool place, decent food.
