This place wasn't anything out of the ordinary. Slow service on a non busy day. Typical Mexican food you'll find in just about any other Americanized Mexican restaurant - tacos, fajitas, quesadillas, guacamole, etc. Servers weren't sure if the refried beans contained pork fat or not. It was always a different answer each time. Suspect.
