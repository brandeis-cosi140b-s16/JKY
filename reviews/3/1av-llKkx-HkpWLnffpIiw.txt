As someone who works in the Neil Street area, I am dismayed that most lunch times options are limited to typical restaurant chains.  Luckily, I can count on Cactus Grill when I want a fast lunch that is less corporate than a McBurger.

The quality of the food is near mediocre; some ingredients really shine, but others somehow always disappoint.  Many of the meats (chicken, steak) are chewy and dry, though they're left to soak in their juices before service (doesn't help, unfortunately).  For my meat option, I usually stick with the fish, which is deep-fried in a panko-like batter.  The fish dishes also usually come with a drizzle of creamy chipotle sauce, yum.

Recently I bought a burrito with cilantro-lime rice and black beans.  The rice is an unmistakable (but poor) imitation of the rice from Chipotle, with cilantro that is never mixed in evenly.  When I bit into the beans, I realized they were still...undercooked?  I was pretty surprised by this discovery as most places use pre-made, canned beans rather than beans cooked in-store...so compliments to homemade beans, but disappointment at undercooked beans.

Despite my criticisms, I still return to Cactus Grill every other week to pick up food.  It's not luxury, but I don't expect too much from lunch on a weekday.
