If my favorite San Diego or Tijuana tacos could talk to me:

Tacos: "What's that smell on you?"

Me: "What smell?"

Tacos: "Did you cheat on me in Las Vegas?"

Me: (horrible liar) "uh... no..."

Tacos: "How could you?"


** What happens in Vegas... OH STOP IT... 

Yeah anyways, actually I'm the one who feels cheated... I mean it's like test driving a Chrysler 300 when you've got a Rolls Royce Phantom at home!!!

After you've already delighted yourself with SD or TJ tacos especially those super flavorful Adobada street tacos, mmm, mmm, mmm, it's just nearly unfair to compare with 'otra cosa' taqueria even if it's another LA/Orange County institution a hundred miles up the road like Chronic Tacos (Las Vegas location, in this case).

For starters, do yourself a favor if you are ever in SD and try this spot right here (you can thank me later):

Looks like Mike C (originally from SD) also knows what I'm talking about: http://www.yelp.com/biz/chronic-tacos-las-vegas#hrid:RJNasrlnO69eizLItnicjQ

My sister Alli S, who now lives in Vegas, suggested this taco shop and told me that the tacos were "Surfer-dude style tacos"... (I'll give you a minute to think about that one)... uhh, huh?  
So, whatever that means... (haha I love you sis but it looks like you need to come back home to SD lol!)  

Tacos were okay, not bad though I'll say this, this "Surfer-dude style" taqueria might be the hippest looking around!  http://eatchronictacos.com/index.php = see what I mean...

You want hip:

Carne Asada tacos was AAIIIGHT!

Surfer-dude hip:

The Al Pastor tacos was BAMMERWEE!  (from Riptionary.com - Surf Lingo)
