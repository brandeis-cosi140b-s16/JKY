This is a great restaurant however I don't get a chance to eat there very often because they close very early. I am sure that I'm not the only person that live up in this area that works late into the evening and would like to go out and have a good meal before heading home. Its just disappointing that they close so early. I would hope that the management would realize this and reconsider their hours of operation.
