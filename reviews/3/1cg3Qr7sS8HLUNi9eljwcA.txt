We expected great things and for the most part we weren't disappointed, I just expected more.  

Being from Montana, and in the Southwest on vacation, I thought after reading reviews I'd be in for something special.  What I got was typical Mexican fare and flare without being dazzled.

Don't get me wrong, it was still very good.  Just not special.

I will give them a nod for their home made hot sauce.  Very very spicy and very very delicious.

No ground beef.  Shredded only.

Small indoor dining room with rustic chairs tables.  Not very comfortable in the chair department but the Mexican theme is strong inside.

Outside is also nice when it's cooler.

Standouts to me were the the sauce mentioned earlier along with the cheese enchilada.
