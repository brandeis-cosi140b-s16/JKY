I was not to impressed with the food and definitely not impressed with the service. There is a limited menu that consist of vegetarian or beef. The only meat they offer is beef so if you don't eat beef you will have to dine somewhere else. This is a cash only establishment as well so make sure you have some pocket change. The prices are reasonable and the food is cooked to order. Don't plan on being greeted or getting service with a smile. The establishment is clean with a high traffic of patrons who order there food to go. So there is plenty of dining space.
