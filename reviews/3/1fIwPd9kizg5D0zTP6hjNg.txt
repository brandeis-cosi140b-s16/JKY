I came here for a work meeting/lunch a few Friday's ago. There were a total of six of us. The inside was barren, only one other table occupied. This was good because we had to push same tables together so all of us could sit together near the back.

I ordered the lunch fajitas and did a split of the steak and shrimp. My meal came with three flour tortillas, rice, beans, guacamole, sour cream, and lettuce/tomatoes. The skillet contained red and green bell peppers, onions, and steak/shrimp.  The portion size was good but the presentation and taste were lacking. The guacamole, beans, and rice lacked flavor. 

One co-worker ordered the soup (green chili corn chowder), another ordered Courtney's Burrito, and a third ordered enchiladas. I can't remember what the other two ordered. However, everyone's meal except for one arrived at the same time. When our co-workers meal finally arrived, the server apologized saying they burnt it the first time and had to remake it. 

Overall, I don't think I'll be back. I've been wanting to try Jalapeno Inferno since they opened up and I'm glad I can cross it off my list. Unfortunately, I wasn't very impressed with the food. The only upside was that the wait staff was very friendly, helpful, and quick.
