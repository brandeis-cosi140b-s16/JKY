Went through the drive-thru and got a burrito and enchilada. The food was extremely hot which was impressive for fast food and it appeared they had just made it fresh but there was limited flavor in the food.  Which usually stands out for a Mexican food with all the seasoning and sauces they use.  I would try this place again to see if it was a once off but if the flavor is missing again next time I won't be back. I'll update this review if the next visit goes well
