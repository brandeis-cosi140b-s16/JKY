I have had this place bookmarked for quite some time now & was so excited to try it out in hopes of finding a new favorite Vegas place to eat. I will say the food was good, but not mind blowing spectacular with every bite.. 
I ordered the bulgogi chimichanga, my husband ordered the burrito version and we split bulgogi fries. The Korean sauce was tasty, the meat was tasty. The fries themselves seemed like frozen fries, nothing that great. I also expected more cheese on the fries.. (Shredded, wasn't all melted). The food definitely had flavor I just get the feeling what I experienced wasn't as good as this place used to be (from reading other older reviews). Could use just a tad bit more. some of the food was a little bit/ almost on the dry side. I would love to give it a try again but not sure if we will since it's on the opposite side of town for us.
