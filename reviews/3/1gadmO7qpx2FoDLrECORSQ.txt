I have dined here before, while on vacationing and always had a good experience.
This time, was just okay. I came here on a Sunday evening and the service was pretty slow. I actually had to get up to pour my own water, since the server went MIA for 10 minutes. 
The table side guacamole was delicious and the salsa's were good. 
I ordered spinach enchiladas and the inside tasted great! The shell tasted stale or something. 
The doors and windows were closed and there were a few birds flying around. Not something I would normally care about, if the windows were open , but I kept thinking that they were going to drop poop in my food. 
Overall, I think the service needs to improve, because the other few times I had been there things had been much better.
