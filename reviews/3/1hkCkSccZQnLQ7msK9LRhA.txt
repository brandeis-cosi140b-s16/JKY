Tried out this spot based on the yelp reviews and my love for tamales , maybe I'm just plain spoiled growing up in AZ and enjoying homemade tamales my entire childhood .... They were just ok, tried 3 different kinds and spent a small fortune ....   Based on the size of the Tamale , was thinking I was going to get my $ worth ...   The inside of the tamale was very good , but had to get thru the thick bland maza to get to the great taste ...  You are paying for the outside , as that is where the bulk of the tamale is ...   less maza more meat please !!!!

Just Ok .........
