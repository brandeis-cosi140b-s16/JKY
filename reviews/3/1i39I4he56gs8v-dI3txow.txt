Taberna is a great spot for drinks and some decent Mexican food.   The patio is really nice,  and the d√©cor is fun and resembles its menu... a modern twist on old world Mexican.  I started off with their signature margarita, it was fantastic. A bonus (which used to be standard with Mexican restaurants) is they serve you complimentary chips and salsa.   I really enjoyed the mango tomatillo salsa with the plantain chips, but the fire roasted salsa seemed to be the table favorite.  The chips are thick, but not greasy and definitely made fresh to order.  Our server was very knowledgeable and was able to provide me several vegetarian options that were not listed on the menu.  I decided to order the veggie enchilada's with a side of black beans. The beans were a little bland (not spicy as indicated on the menu), but the enchilada's were solid.  The rest of the table was not as satisfied.  No one loved their meal, and a couple peoples food came out cold, mine was not smoking hot, but definitely edible.  After a complaint was made, they promptly replaced the cool dish and the manger offered us free desserts.  For desert we had the trio of gelato and the flan.  The gelato was good; my favorite was definitely the roasted banana... Yum!  The Flan tasted more like a ricotta cheesecake.  I normally don't like flan, but this was excellent!  The meal started and ended with a bang, but what came in the middle was a little disappointing.  Despite its shortcomings, I'll definitely give Taberna another shot.
