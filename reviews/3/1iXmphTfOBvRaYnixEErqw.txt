An old friend came to town and suggested we go here. I'd never been...which was surprising considering I shop next door at Safeway and have driven past it a million times. The chips were great, the dining room is casual with booths on the edges and tables in the center featuring your typical colorful hand painted chairs (and the tecate banners hanging from the ceiling). Service was very good. 

I ordered tacos (because I consider myself a connoisseur of tacos) and always try those first at a new Mexican Restaurant, but was a bit disappointed when they served them in pre-cooked shells. My preference is the shredded beef, fried with the corn tortilla. The food does have good flavor but does not strike me as anything but standard.

It's your Classic Mexican Food! It's a tortilla, meat, cheese just served up a million different ways. I didn't expect anything too over the top here. I will say they get a bonus for serving Negro Modelo in the special Negro Modelo glass. Good times, good friends, good food. I will be back!
