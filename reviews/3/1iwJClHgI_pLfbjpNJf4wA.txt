We were excited, we were brave we were less than thrilled.

The burritos were a bit too greasy, the fried fish was mediocre, but people did enjoy the tacos. 

The hot sauce is the one redeeming quality here, it is hot. Otherwise not a big fan. 

Also very few veg options. 

If you like telenovellas they are going strong with the TV on the well.
