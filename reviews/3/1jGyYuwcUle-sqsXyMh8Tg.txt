Ok food  is good for sure! We have a toddler and I asked in the child meal could we half and half the beans and rice the girl at the register said sure, then when we get the food the "manager" (I'm assuming) says sorry we don't do that I told her I would pay for it and she was very rude and said sorry we don't do that. Really? I explained to her that a toddler is picky and we need to get both I would pay for a side, I got attitude, why do I get attitude from a employee?!?! She is a small tiny thin girl with a bad attitude, avoid her and all is well! They have messed up our take out orders twice now. We paid for extra tortillas and never received them TWICE now. I asked for both hot and mild salsa for the chips and again got attitude and told i need to pick one or the other, really? Customer service sucks, make sure your order is correct and don't dine in and it's ok.
