I feel I'm generous with the 3 stars because they haven't given me problems in the past but recently is a different story. The last 3 times I tried to come here 2 times being around 10 pm at night and they run out of chicken.. It would be understandable if it was like 15-30 min before closing but an hour like really?? And then I come again at 5pm today and out of chicken. The service is not the friendliest.. People working the drive thru talk with such a tone like they are just miserable.... Will come back but please get it together.
