Decent food. Good size portions. Very inexpensive. Fast service.

The food is decent...not the best Mexican food you'll ever have, but solid. I've never been disappointed. You get what you pay for, if you're looking for upscale food, go to Eldorado Grill. If you are looking for fast cheap pretty good food, go to Laredos. Don't forget to order a margarita!

The tableside guacamole is kind of cool to watch and tasty.
