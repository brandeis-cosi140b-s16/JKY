When I craving a good taco and don't want to spend an arm and a leg I check out this place. The Chips are not always the best but the salsas they bring out to the taco are fantastic especially the green avocado salsa but you have to ask for it. I ordered a vegetarian tostada it had re-fried beans, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, cilantro, and fresh avocado! It was absolutely delicious. The only downside is sometimes the menu changes and the hours varies depending on how busy they are.
