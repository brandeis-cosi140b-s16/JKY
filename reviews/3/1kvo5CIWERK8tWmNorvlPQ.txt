Was raised on mexican food. So with that being said, I have very high standards when it comes to mexican food.  I ordered a carne asada burrito. The meat was very bland and a bit mushy. They used cheddar cheese instead of Mexican white cheese, also the rice was over cooked and the tortilla was cooked to long so it was hard. Was really disappointed because it has a very authentic mexican feel when you walk in.
My wife had the carne asada tacos and she was not satisfied with the flavor also. On a scale from 1-10 it gets a 5. Will not be going back to this place:-(
