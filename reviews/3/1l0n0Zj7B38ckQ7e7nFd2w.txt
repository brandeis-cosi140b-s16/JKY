My friend kept saying how this was one of her favorite places so I thought we should check it out to see if the hype was true. Service was fast. It was nice to see that bean dip accompanied the chips & salsa. 
I ordered a typical carne asada burrito while she ordered her favorite, shrimp tacos. There was nothing about the burrito that stood out. It wasn't the best, it wasn't the worst. I tried the shrimp tacos, they too were ok in my eyes. She however LOVES them. Sitting outside did help as spring nights in Vegas are always nice. 
To me it didn't live up to the hype that was provided to me about this place. See for yourself
