We stopped by Los Tacos for a quick bite to eat before checking into our hotel. 

The lady at the register was friendly and helpful, while we were trying to figure out how much food to order.

 The portion sizes here are HUGE! I ordered two tacos and was only able to finish one so I gave the other one to my friend. In my personal opinion, I thought the carne asada was cut too big that it was a bit difficult for me to eat it. The quality of the meat was very good though and I love that there is a generous portion of avocados on the tacos. The tortillas they used for the tacos are the ones that they sell at the super markets so I would say it could have been better. Overall I thought the food was A-OK.
