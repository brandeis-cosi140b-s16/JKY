Have been going here since it opened, and I think the owners are wonderful people.... but I have to give an edit.

Their verde sauce with jack cubes and onion is amazing.  It is one of my all time favorite sauces.  I could eat it everyday and even bottle it.

But I have to complain about the Red sauce.  I used to think it was some of the best it the valley.  Why did they tinker with it?  It now has a taste that is very bitter and taste more like the red sauces at the 24hr burrito stops.  I wish they had kept it the way it was originally.  It was so fantastic.
