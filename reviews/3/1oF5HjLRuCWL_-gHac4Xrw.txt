This place is wildly popular and established. The food is cheap and the delivery system is efficient. There is nothing bad on the menu. Its all in a decent sauce if you like red or green. The bean burritos are smooth and cheesy. The homemade tortillas are what keeps people coming back. 
The food Is not a good value. The special
Burrito is filled with potatoes as a filler. I would rather pay more to get no filler and more meat. The green chili burrito is the diameter of a small hot dog with a bun. I order two and then it's not a deal and I'm eating tons of tortilla and less fun stuff inside. A good burrito is supposed to have a great tortilla (which they do) but that holds all of the delicious toppings together and makes the burrito.
