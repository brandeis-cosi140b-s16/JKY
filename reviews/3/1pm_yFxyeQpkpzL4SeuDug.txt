I saw the segment on America's on Sonoran Living and wanted to check it out.
They have an extended patio now, which was nice-had some heaters too which was nice on a chilly night.
The interior is cute and charming-an old bungalow style home with some tables thrown around.
The menu is tiny. there are just a few choices-and nothing more than carne asada, a bean burrito and ceviche one night a week.  That's not horrible but don't come here if you are looking fora  vast area of menu items. 
Cheap and tasty and the salsa for the nachos was the best I've had since arriving in AZ 2 1/2 years ago. Tamrindo juice was also very tasty.
