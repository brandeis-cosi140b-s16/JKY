I had to try the new breakfast items just to say I did. I ordered an Am Crunchwrap with sausage and a bacon breakfast burrito. My husband ordered the Am Crunchwrap with steak and a burrito with steak. 

As for taste stick with the steak! It really makes the meal. I enjoyed my Crunchwrap with sausage, but it was nothing that great. But with the steak yes, please! The Crunchwrap is great if you are on the go or need to eat while driving. It has a layer of hash browns, a sausage patty, bacon or steak, eggs, and cheese. It's all held together in a flour tortilla that is then pressed so it all melts and melds the goodies together! 
The burrito with bacon was meh. It contained chopped bacon, scrambled eggs, and cheese. But again with the steak it totally transformed the burrito. And where are the beans? I think a Mexican breakfast burrito calls for beans! Just my suggestion :) 

Overall I learned on my visit is order the steak! Amazingly good flavor! Makes the bland burrito totally better.
