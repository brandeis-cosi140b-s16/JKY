The service here was quite horrible, the waiter was constantly suggesting our party of 14 to take shots at like 1PM, which was annoying.

One cool thing was that we were seated in our own little room surrounded by all kinds of tequila. I ordered the beef quesadilla, an appetizer, and it wasn't very good. Not much cheese and the meat was difficult to chew. 

Also ordered the unlimited chips and salsa and small Strawberry margarita. Margarita is good, can't taste the alcohol. Chips comes with three different salsas, medium, mild, spicy, all taste good. 

One other thing was they over charged our quesadilla by $1, not sure if they hadn't updated the menu or manually typed it in wrong, but that was irritating as well.
