good authentic mexican food - had the taco and enchilada combination and a michelada.  Great chips and salsa (chips are warm and freshly made) The michelada was really unique - the michelada "sauce" came in a large 12 ounce glass - usually when I get one you get a couple ounces at the bottom of your beer glass - so that was pretty tasty.  Food was just your standard mexican fare - I would go back, though if looking for Mexican food in the area
