Stopped in for lunch have been waiting to try it out. its right down the street from my work and from my house. it needs a lot of improvement with service but the food was really good a little bit pricey.  But they need to work on their bar area only high to bars.  Doc has restricted me from using my right foot so can't stretch it to sit at the bar tops in the bar the hostesses wooden honor the prices for happy hour for a bar only and weren't really accommodating finally the manager came over and said that he was aware of our situations and still honor the price. 

So management=great 
hostess = horrible service 
server he apologize they're still new but we got our water after our meals and we had to ask for chips and salsa and someone had mentioned that you get fruit but we never got.

Willing to try again in 6 months if they last.
