Food is okay. The layout is not family friendly at all.  There are only 3 tables inside where you can pull up a high chair (and they are crammed very close together!).  The vast majority of seating is on high bar stools... Not practical for small children, the elderly, or anyone with mobility issues.  I was excited to give them a chance, but the logistics are a nightmare.
