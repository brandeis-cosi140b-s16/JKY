I think 'Burghers are only gooping their pants over Reyna's tacos because they've never had anything other than Taco Bell or its cousin Mad Mex. I'm from the southwestern part of the country and while I certainly appreciate the freshness and "clarity" of the food served outside Reyna's, I was not impressed by it. It was nothing that I couldn't and don't already make myself at home. Since Pittsburgh will never be the southwestern states and whatnot, I guess I could go along with saying these are some of the best tacos in the city.
