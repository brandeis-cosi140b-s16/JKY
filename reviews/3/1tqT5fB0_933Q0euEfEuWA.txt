Segundo sol would probably not be my primero choice for Mexican food in vegas.... or anywhere near the top for that matter. 

The food is good, service is friendly, but there was not much memorable about this place for me. And when you are paying $15-$20 for tacos it had better be darn memorable. Nothing particularly wrong with it, but just not worth the money. 

I had the bottomless chips and salsa (but bottomless and $4 is decidedly inferior to bottomless and free like most Mexican places), and the pork tacos. The 3 salsas that came with the chips were OK but not very fresh tasting... but ill give it to you though that it's probably hard to make good pico de gallo in January.

Pork tacos were also good but did not particularly impress. 

For those price inelastic folks out there though, the ambiance of the place is great: they have a nice indoor and outdoor bar, a TON of tequilas, and there is an upscale but still laid-back feel to it. So if you don't mind paying $40 for a meal you could get off the strip for $12, then by all means give it a try.
