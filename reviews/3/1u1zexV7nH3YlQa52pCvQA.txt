Wow...disappointment... This is our usual go to for mexican food.  It was so busy last night (Wednesday) that it was 5 or more minutes before getting our water, and more than 10 before we got our chips.  Both the salsa and bean dip didn't taste as good as normal (and we were starving!). I had the beef taquitos-there was only a smidgen of guacamole and no cheese.  My husband had the carne asada chimichanga which he raved about.  The soup was yummy as usual though!

I'm going to rate our dinner a 3 instead of a 2 because they were super busy (We heard the birthday song at least 5x while we were there!).
