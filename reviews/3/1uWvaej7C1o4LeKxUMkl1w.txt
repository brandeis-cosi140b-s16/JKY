I usually go here for business lunches although it's not the best idea due to the slow service. It is not the employees fault though, this place is always understaffed - especially in the bar area and on the bar patio. 

If you aren't in a rush though and can take your time, bring your patience with you and sit on the bar patio. It is right on a lake and the view is beautiful. 

I like how the chips and salsa comes out with a couple salsa bowls as well as a bean bowl. That is different from what I've seen at most Mexican food restaurants.  
The fajitas are a good choice and are always very flavorful. If you ask for corn tortillas be prepared to wait about 15 minutes for them. Happens to me every single time, even if I ask for them when I place the order. 

The guacamole is fresh and cold from here. 

The margaritas kind of suck and have too much mixer in them, but they are cheap so I always order them anyway. 

This place is great if you have a Mexican food craving,  time on your hands, and aren't picky about your cocktails. The food is always what brings me back.
