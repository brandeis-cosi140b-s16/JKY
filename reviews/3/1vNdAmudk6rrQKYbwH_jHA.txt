I call this chain..ole reliable. Never had a bad meal here in at least ten years. On this day, tried the grilled chicken taco combo plate classic style. The one thing that wasn't that great was the white sauce they douse the chicken in before it ends up on your tacos. It is not a bad sauce, but I think that might be the same one they use on fish and it doesn't belong on poultry. Regardless, the two tacos for 7 bucks were loaded up on white chicken chunks and mostly lettuce and the chips were super crispy at the location and the rice was above average. I will order no white sauce next time and this will be back to it's usual four stars rating.
