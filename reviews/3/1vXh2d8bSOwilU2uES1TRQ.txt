3.5- first you enter to the delicious smell of mesquite grill. The smell is so enticing! They offer burritos , salads, burgers, and chicken breast. My hubbie and I ordered the Glendale burger a burger with bacon, cheese, a mild horseradish , barbecue and mushrooms. It came out promptly. The burger was good, meat was tender and smokey. I felt the patty was a little thin and agree with the previous review that it's 1/4" thick. The bun was soft which my hubbie enjoyed. Between the burger and fries it was a 5 napkin night. I asked for a side of ranch and was given what I think was the cilantro ranch- it was surprisingly good! My fries were ok- came out barely warm but tasted good. I later was told by my husband his was warm and perfect. The inside does look like Chipoltle . They have brewed tea which is a big plus in my eyes and have Coke products. So all in all good. I would return. The staff checked on us twice and made us feel welcome. They have a frequent diner program. I wish the burgers were more beefy and lettuce was not shredded. Next time I'm trying the salad as I love the mesquite and want to try the carne asada. Give this place a try- there might be a scaffold holding up the roof but it adds to the charm lol!
