I enjoyed my food. I would love to give a higher rating. But, I won't. I'm just glad I ordered take-out. Upon walking in there was an odor that would make Robert Irvine gag.

Why I stayed, I have no idea. Other than I already committed myself by purchasing an online discounted certificate.

I will say they didn't leave me hungry that is for sure.  I also ordered a kids portion for a co-worker. They seem nickel and dime you on things. The kids taco only came with meat - so they charged extra because she wanted lettuce and cheese on top.

The could be a little less stingy on the amount of salsa they give with a takeout order, that's fo sho.

The frustrating part of the experience is I wanted some cheese sauce. They only had one size and it was priced pretty salty ... If you know what I mean.  But, it basically went straight to thicker than wallpaper paste after sitting for a few minutes. You could say it got harder, quicker than an old man poppin' those lil' blue pills. No bueno - as the kids say nowadays.

But, I repeat, the food was actually perty durn tasty. [Two taco plate: Shrimp and Gringo Chicken]

The decision is up to you, 'Merica! 

[Probably look for an online discounted certificate to help offset the dinero.]
