Great green chilli burro enchilada style...like traditional Mexican food here 50 years ago--and you can get it in a mini version, which is a normal portion. Very disappointed in the ground beef taco--meat blah, and a preformed taco shell that tasted like the boxed ones from the grocery store. A plus is a cold glass that was served alongside the cold bottle of beer. Mini cheese crisp was great ans shareable for 2.
