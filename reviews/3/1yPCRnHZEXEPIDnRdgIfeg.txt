The pupusas are terrific but the service is lousy. The food here is great with a great variety of Honduran, Salvadoran, and Mexican dishes. I tried pupusas and tamales here and the pupusas were great and the tamales de elote were average. My friend ordered a half chicken with plantains which he said was rather good. The portions are big and generally a good value for money. The service is rather lousy. I pointed out to the waitress that my friend was overcharged on the bill and she refused to correct it and was icy from then on. She wasn't terribly friendly to begin with but it was solid ice by the end. Oh well.... If you don't mind the service, the food is terrific.
