This Macayo's is just like every other Macayo's except they have the slowest service in the world.

Standard chain Mexican food. I normally get the California burrito and an Iced tea. Nothing overly spectacular. Actually, the chips and salsa are really good.

Do not come here if you are in a rush because you will be anxiously shifting in your seat waiting for your check at the end of your meal.
