Staff is friendly, the place is relatively clean although they could do better. 

I would rate 2.5 stars if I could, but I decided to round it up to 3 because the food tastes good but it isn't authentic Mexican food. It's close though. 

They bring A LOT of food, they have a pretty good skirt steak but beans and rice have tons of room for improvement. Rice is really dry, and the beans have are pretty much flavorless. 

Food isn't disgusting per se, but it is greasy. Their guacamole is pretty solid. Chips are ok, I definitely do not like the complimentary salsa they give. 

As far as good goes, it's hit or miss. They label a lot of items in their menu as one thing, and then they bring you an entirely different item. 

For example: Chiles rellenos. Their "interpretation" of a chile relleno is an omelette stuffed with poblano peppers and beef.

Authentic Chiles Rellenos are Poblano peppers stuffed with beef, dipped in an egg+flour batter and deep fried. 

Also, their "version" of pork carnitas is pretty awful: It's just fried pork. Authentic pork carnitas are cooked pretty much the same way pulled pork is cooked.

I keep coming back because is the closest, not so bad Mexican food restaurant near by.
