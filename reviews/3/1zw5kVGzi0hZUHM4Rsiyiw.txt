I'm tired, hungover, sore, and my ears are still ringing from the night before. What can get me out of bed? BURRITOS!

On our most recent trip to Vegas, my friends and I drove by this place on our way to Ralph's and saw their "best dam steak super burrito" sign and were immediately sucked in. 

I don't know about it being the BEST, but the steak burrito was juicy and decently sized. The chorizo breakfast burrito with beans was yummm. They're a little over priced in comparison to the cheap Mexican food in Los Angeles (you can check out a picture of their menu here on Yelp), but compared to the other food you can get in Vegas it isn't bad.

My only beef with this place was the wait. The second time we came here the wait was so long for them to TAKE our order at the drive-thru that we ended up parking and ordering instead. It took us 25 minutes to get the first of our 6 burritos (three separate orders). Turns out there was only one person working the entire place (on Memorial Day weekend!), but the wait should never be that long at a drive-thru taco stand. NEVER.

Also, there is no indoor seating -- there is only an outdoor seating area (no shade) by the street.

Because it's in Vegas, and because The Strip is lacking cheap Mexican food, I will probably come back, but if this place were in LA I would probably skip it.
