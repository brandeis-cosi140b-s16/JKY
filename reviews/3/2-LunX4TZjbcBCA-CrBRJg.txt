It's basically like Mexican fast food...but it tastes OK.

I had the chicken tamales and didn't like it (smelled more like tuna than steamed chicken), but the chips and salsa (I ordered a $5 guacamole side) were amazing! The other order on my table was the chicken fajita burrito and that was better than the tamales..(he ate it all, so I assume it was good)...

All in all, an OK experience...
