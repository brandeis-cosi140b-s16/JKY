I've wanted to try this place for a while, so I finally talked my boyfriend into going before a movie. He was reluctant because he had been to another location and felt it was just "so,so".  Well he was right.  When we walked in the host and hostess seemed confused, as to what we might be doing there... um we would like a table, please!  So they looked at the computer and at each other and decided to sit us at a two top table which shared a bench with a family with young kids, meanwhile the restaurant was about 80% empty.  The service was okay, but we had to wait about 20 minutes for our check which was a little annoying.   We would have gladly ordered another beer while we were waiting for it, but we were never asked.  As for the food, the chips and salsa were decent and my veggie enchiladas were good.  I don't really have anything to complain about, it just didn't blow me away in one direction or another. If I could give it a 2.5 I would.
