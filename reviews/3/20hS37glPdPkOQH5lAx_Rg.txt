I've been here quite a few times, as my family that comes in from out of town loves the place. They're very savvy when it comes to New Mexican cuisine and they say Blue Adobe's excellent. 

One time I ordered their special which was some sort of salmon taco plate. Boy it was seriously one of the best things I'd ever eaten at any (New) Mexican restaurant period. 

Another time I ordered the standard taco plate which was pretty good but not fantastic, but then again it's just tacos so I don't know what I was expecting. I've also ordered some of their spicier meat plates which have all been good. 

Plates run anywhere from $11-$20, with most of them falling somewhere right in the middle of that bracket. It's not a cheap Southwest fare restaurant by any means. Although it's good I don't know if it warrants $16 a plate. 

The one thing that really turns me off is how bad the acoustics are in the restaurant. It gets EXTREMELY noisy in there, so much so that you can't even hear the people you're sitting with as they're screaming at you from across the table. I went here for my birthday with my mother and fiance recently and it turned out to be a huge headache because none of us could hear one another talk. I think because the place is just a large open room with cement floors and no partitions makes the sound bounce like crazy. I've tried sitting in all areas of the restaurant, and unfortunately you can't escape the noise.

That alone will probably keep me from going back again, but I wouldn't let it dissuade anyone from checking it out. Just be forewarned that if you go when they're busy, you're bound to get an earful.
