Look beyond the uninviting store front, with windows protected by metal bars, and you'll find a decent restaurant with cheap quickie eats if you're craving Mexican food. It's nice that they are open 24 hours, so you can have a burrito, torta, or taco any time you want!

We came in search of a breakfast burrito. They have several options here, all under $4. I chose the potato, egg, and cheese ($3.65). It was a hefty burrito, filled to the brim with breakfast ingredients. The textures in the burrito were all too similar, from the slighty mushy potato, the melted cheese, and the soft scrambled egg, and the taste was a bit one dimensional, which made this burrito subpar compared to the heavenly breakfast burritos at Los Favoritos. I had it with some of their hot sauce too, which they only offer in the red variety (Los Favs offers green and red). It was OK, but not as flavorful as hot sauces at other quickie burrito places I've been to.

While they do have a dedicated parking lot, there are limited spots, especially when it's busy. We had to park around the corner in a residential area and dodge cars coming out of the drive-through lane to get to the entrance.

I'll come here again to try some of their non-breakfast foods, but for now, they're just A-OK to me.
