Meh, this Filibertos is ok. I like them as a chain, but this specific location is always extra slow-even at the drive thru. It's also more expensive then the other ones. And they don't offer the California or Arizona burrito, which is my biggest complaint. The regular size is too big and extra expensive here. Overall, it's alright
