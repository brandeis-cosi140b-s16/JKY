The older man (not sure if he's the owner or the manager) has the strangest sense of humor. But funny nonetheless.
He took our order, a table of 6, and told us that they were out of rice. We all believed him until he brought our orders back with rice as the side. 
He brought this container with three different salsas, one red, one green and one cheesy yellow that was on FIRE! Don't get me wrong, I love spicy foods but this one had no flavor, or it killed our taste buds, we will never know.
The waiter/owner/manager got the birthday girl the wrong meat on her quesadillas but he did surprise her with a tostadas and ice-cream with a candle on top.
My fish tacos had only one corn tortilla per taco so I had to eat them with a fork, even though they were very tasty and flavorful. 

The place was pack on that particular saturday night and all the servers were running around that it took a while to find us a table. We sat at the bar for a few beers until they were able to clean up a table for us.

Even thought we were here a few years ago, and weren't too impressed by it (the decor was average -and still is- and so was the food) we may come back to an earlier time if we're in the area. 
Friendly staff.
