Aargh - the two reasons I come are the two reasons I can't give this place what could be it's due worth.  I came specifically to try their salsas and their horchata.  Unfortunately I never really got to try either b/c they had run out pretty much out of all of it.  Probably a good sign that they are busy and popular but at the same time, a big disappointment.  I tried their two taco plate.  The cochinita pibil and veggie tacos.  Both were ok.  The beans were ok but not nearly as good as America's homemade beans.  The rice was like everyone said - not your typical mexican rice.  Not bad though.  Apparently they were so busy they could barely keep up with "supply".  The salsa bar was pretty dismal.  They had just a little of the cilantro and peanut one.  Horchata was all out.   I'm disappointed that I missed out but at least it's a good sign that they are the place to go.  Will definitely be back to hopefully try again.

TIP: If you are coming at night, be very careful.  It was really dark and there weren't any real lighted signs.  I could barely see it so it's easy to pass it.
