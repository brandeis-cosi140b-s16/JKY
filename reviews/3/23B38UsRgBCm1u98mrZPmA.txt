First timers since cocomo joes closed. Came in around 8:45 pm and place was pretty much empty. We weren't sure if they were still serving food.  Still decided to go in. Service was great - thanks, Michael!!  Food was tasty and portions were decent. It's really too bad there's no entertainment after 9:00. Place would be packed if ownership listened to its customers and brought in live entertainment on the weekends. If things don't change, I can't see them here though 2015.  Again, it's unfortunate because south cave creek needs more nightlife.  Not sure if we'll be back without live entertainment.
