I am writing this review because of Salsa. Yes the pollo quesadilla is amazing. And the burro's are fantastic. There salsa though is out of this world; yes it is expensive, but for good reason. I use to be a regular here, kind of a creature of habit. My love for the spicy side of life was quenched here. There salsa is made with several exotic peppers that can only be found in Mexico. That is why it is over six dollars a pint. The rest of there food is amazing, but pay the extra and get your piece of salsa heaven!
