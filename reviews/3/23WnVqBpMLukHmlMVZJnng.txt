The place was clean and the employees were very friendly. Our food was served fairly quickly -- It was prepared fresh, so I didn't expect instantaneous service.

My son loved his quesadilla and said he wished he had ordered two. I had a carne asada burrito, which I found hot and tasty. Nothing terribly special, but definitely not bad. I think you'd really like their food if you love avocado -- I tasted a lot of that on both the taco and the burrito.

The el pastor taco I had was interesting. I found the flavor reminiscent of the BBQ pork you get at Chinese restaurants. It looked like the meat had the same pinkish ring and brightly-colored exterior glaze. The pineapple enhanced that flavor. Maybe it is just me. I may have to go back and order it again just to see if that's how it usually tastes. 

Overall, I think it is a solid 3 stars.
