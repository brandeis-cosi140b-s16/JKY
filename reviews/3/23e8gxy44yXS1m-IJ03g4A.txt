This is a quasi-Mexican cafe.  It's similar to Qdoba and Chipotle, but has a few more menu items to choose from.  It's simple, basic, but good.  The tortillas are made fresh from balls of dough (not just warming pre-made tortillas as the others do).

They are not a match for someplace like La Tolteca, but good for "Mexican" fast food.
