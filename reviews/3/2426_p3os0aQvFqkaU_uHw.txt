A couple of my coworkers suggested picking up Maribel's for lunch. The idea of paying $5 for lunch appealed to me, so I tagged along. Maribel's is attached to a bar, and has a weird setup. There's about 6 tables, a pool table and a couple of TVs. No hostess station or anything like that.. just a big open room. The daily special was fish tacos, which I am not a fan of, so I settled on a bean and cheese and split half of chicken quesadilla. My party (6 ppl) was the only party in the restaurant and it took about 20-30 mins for us to receive our food, which is a bit of a bummer. They probably aren't used to the volume. They did give us free chips and salsa though, which was really good! The bean burrito was comparable to a Taco Bell burrito as was the chicken quesadilla. Nothing special. The server was nice and friendly. I probably wouldn't go back when there are better alternatives, like Roberto's, with much faster service. I will say this place would be super handy if you got wasted at the bar next door.
