Went there for dinner with my husband.  Our waiter was great!  Friendly, attentive and pleasant.  Chips were good but salsa was not hot at all.  Asked for something hotter and brought out a fresh green salsa that was a bit hotter but not much.  

My husband had the cevich√© which was good and I had the shrimp tacos which were ok.  Thought the prices were a bit high but it was good for a special dinner.
