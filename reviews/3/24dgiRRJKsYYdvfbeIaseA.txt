Among the best margaritas I've had in the valley! Get the house margarita and you will not be dissappointed. Now the food is a different story, I've tried multiple plates here, and have only really liked one, the Chipotle Shrimp. It's delicious!  Also try going for happy, as the small plates and street tacos and pretty decent and the margaritas are only $5. Just to sum up, go for the margaritas and happy hour and stay away from their regular menu food. Should you decide to order something, get the Chipotle Shrimp.
