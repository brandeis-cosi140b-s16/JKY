By all common sense i should detest this place, over-salted food... check, stereotypical music... yup... includes ranch in food... oh yes. (and then there are the monstrous portion sizes) I keep coming back because they have 1/2 priced margaritas on Thursdays, a fairly decent happy hour, fresh tortillas, fresh ingredients, and decent service.  The food plays to the lowest common denominator so my friends who hate all things not-American food can find something they enjoy. If you want authentic Mexican go to S. Park Street and hit up El Pastor. (for serious) Also If you have to choose between the east side Pedro's or the west side location.. hands down pick the west. (east is a tad dumpy)
