I really wish Yelp! allowed 1/2 stars because I would give this Qdoba location a solid 3.5 stars. 

This is the best Qdoba Madison has to offer. Of all the times I've dined here, and it has been many, the food has been fast, fresh and correctly made. There is a variety of entrees you can choose from including burritos, nachos,  taco salads and more. I will say they they do skimp on the meat. You have this large burrito that sometimes breaks because they are so full  rice and beans but doesn't include a lot of meat. 

I often get a chicken burrito with white rice, black beans, pico de gallo, corn salsa, cheese, sour cream, lettuce and cheese queso sauce for an additional $1. Their queso is amazing. I REALLY love it. It brings the burrito all together and has a lot of flavor. 

This location in particular sits up on a hill and offers a great view busy of Fitchathery Rd. 

Note: Guacamole is now FREE!!!!!
