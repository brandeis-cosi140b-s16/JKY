Quick, cheap, and yummy--just the way I like it.  Small building, good service from behind the counter. She took our food out to us at the table.  Huevos Rancheros were bueno. Not the best rice I've had but still good, they put the cheap cheese rather than the yummy white crumbly cheese on the beans, and the carrots tasted a bit old, but all things that can be forgiven if the price is right. :) 

Will go there again when in deep Henderson and in need of a cheap meal.
