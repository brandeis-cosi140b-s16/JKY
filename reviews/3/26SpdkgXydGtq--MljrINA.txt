Go to Carlsbad for quality food, late-night or earlier. The servers are friendly and they're ready with beer. Unfortunately we weren't cautioned of the size of our foursome's order.

All dishes are of large, if not massive, quantity. The nachos with chicken fed four of us, such that only I could finish my entree after a lot of face-stuffing of their good burger.
