Little bit of a mixed opinion here.... Since wife is involved in substance abuse treatment she didn't find whole "addiction" theme too humorous. 

Nevertheless I should say food is pretty good. There is not much New Mexico style restaurants in town to begin with so I am somewhat short on comparison. I'd like to try some more dishes here to come to more educated conclusion. For now rate 3.75*

Salsa was darn spicy and fresh sopapillas are good. 
Good effort on decoration and interior... really liked it.
