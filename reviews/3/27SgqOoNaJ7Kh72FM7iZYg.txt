Well let's start by saying that their cilantro pesto deserves a star all by itself. That stuff turns anything you put it on into amazing!

Although, I unfortunately had to subtract 2 stars because I felt so rushed by the workers!! I barely had time to think what I really wanted on my burrito. There wasn't anyone behind me in line and only two people in the place. You would think they could be a little more patient with me, especially since it was my first time there and I wanted to customize my meals perfectly. I even asked a couple times about the workers opinions of what she liked best and she laughed and said she didn't know...

It would be nice to have some more feedback from the employees here as well as not feel rushed and like I'm taking up to much of their time for my one order.

On the upside, it's close to the LVAC gym and you can definitely make healthy options here. I like their wide variety of sides and sauces. They even have sweet potatoes! I will be back and hope to see improvements in the future. :)
