I haven't been to a Salsaritas in a while, so I thought I would renew my experience. This is one of those places where they assemble it in front of you, sort of like a Subway of burrtos. They also offer quesadillas, tacos and salads. The Mexican pizza is something I've not seen at other places.

Otherwise, it's the same as other places. Chicken, beef, pork, etc. Guacamole, salsa, other veggies and the same.

The seating area in this one is interesting. It's more cantina-like with the usual booths and tables, but also a small bar area with a half-dozen seats there. Plus some seats outside.

It's okay, but I prefer the salsa bar that they have at Moe's.

Warning: The chips and salsa/queso are extra. It's a clever upsell, since they ask if you want salsa or queso and you might not be aware that it's a combo. But the chips I had were good. Nice and crispy with the right amount of salt.
