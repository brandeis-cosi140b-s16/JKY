The first and only time I have ever ate at Chipotles was about seven years ago in Las Vegas. Never understood why people were making a big deal about them then. And after trying the one here in Surprise, I still or will never understand what's the big deal. I never missed it the last seven years, and will never miss it in the near future.
I did like the ordering on line feature. Because every time I drive by Chipotles, its always crowded. So I ordered the steak, vegi's, and black bean burrito. Wife had the shredded beef taco. They were large, and a nice about of meat. However, my burrito was cold, it was like it came out of the fridge. It wasn't like it sat there waiting for me. I called them when I left the house to see if they started on it yet. They said no, but they'll get started on it right away. So when I arrived, they were just finishing up and bagging it up. The burrito was OK, probably would be better if it was hot? However it wouldn't have been great. 
The pros:
Online ordering, was great to walk right up front passing everyone in the long line to get the food and pay.
Service was good, workers were very nice.

The cons:
Food was cold
Food is pricey

Still not understandings the hype?
