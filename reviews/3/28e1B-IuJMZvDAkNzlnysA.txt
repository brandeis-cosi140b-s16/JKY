This place had it's day...that day has passed. 

I used to love eating Ricardo's growing up, and once I moved out of state I used to look forward to coming here to eat when visiting family. Nowadays... Man, this place has plummeted low. The chile they serve with the chips is more of a half hearted parody of what the sauce used to be. The food quality isn't what I remember it, but maybe I just didn't notice the quality when I was younger. 

  The service is so so depending on who your server is. The inside of the place has been the exact same as long as I can remember it. 

   I love the ice tea here if that makes any difference. I used to love this place, it's a shame I still don't.
