Okay, so being a huge fan of Chipotle and noticing a trend that Chipotle-style restaurants that offer the line style of food usually are way below par I was not sure about trying this place. They were offering buy 1 get 1 coupons and we couldn't afford not to try it in case it was a good find. The food here is okay. The flavor falls very short of Chipotle and the flavors run more on the bland side. The first time I ate here I felt like I could barely taste my food. For two people to get full for less than $8 bucks though....sometimes you just suck it up and make the exception. We both usually get the Queso style burritos, mine vegetarian, my boyfriend gets chicken or steak. Now that I have eaten here a few times, when the coupon gets me, I'm a bit more acquainted with the flavors and find the food to be tasty. Not great, but not bad. Let's put it this way, I would not pay full price to eat here...but if a coupon presents itself and I don't feel like cooking, why not?
