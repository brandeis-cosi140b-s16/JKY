If your looking for great chips and not spicy salsa this is a good place to go, other than that meh, have had better Mexican food elsewhere. We had a party of 10 and all ordered different selections. The Mexican pizza is 2 fried burro tortillas with space beans, ground taco meat and lots if cheese topped with a sprinkle of chopped tomatoes and green onions. You could probably make a healthier version at home by baking it.  As for entrees, the carnitas are a total miss. It was basically your DIY pork roast minus any seasoning from the crock pot but shredded, reheated and dry. The tampiquena was average. Small piece of carne asada, well flavored but I would suggest have it cooked med. rare. The cheese enchilada was decent, good mole sauce but doubtful homemade.  The carne picada was interesting. Think of fajitas diced up and plated with a side of rice and beans. The steak is pre-cut and tossed with diced green peppers, tomato and onion then saut√©ed. The seafood enchilada looked okay, but is chopped shrimp and imitation crab smoothered with a cream sauce and baked with a mound of cheese. The menu reads exactly what get.  

Most was flavorless and a disappointment.  Basically American version of Mexican substance.
