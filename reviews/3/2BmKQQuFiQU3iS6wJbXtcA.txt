Go for the tamarindo drink. That was pretty good. 

Tacos were somewhat dry. Mole was less than I expected, although I have to say that not too many places do mole. Consomme was pretty good, but it's chicken broth, avocado and strips of chicken. It's gonna be good! I had the taquiza. The rice and beans were awesome. The taco's different meats were just not too impressive. I tried the Suadero, Tinga, Al Pastor, Mole, and Tripa. Their meats are not juicy enough for me. The tortillas here were perfect. They were soft and fresh. Everything was really fresh, but the culinary desire for more leads me to rate them a three-star. Even their white onion and cilantro could have been more finely chopped.

Their chicken enchiladas came with mole. I have had many great moles. This mole was not a great one. It was a good one. 

I lived in Mexico City, D.F. The tacos I had there were absolutely mindblowing. People would stand around taco stands and they would give you consomme as well. The animal fat would serve as the grease for the backdrop of flavorful meat for each taco. The toppings such as cilantro and onions were finely finely chopped. The grill that they used were the ones similar to the ones being used at Tacos El Gordo, even though TEG is Tijuanan style.

At Los Antojos, I feel that the execution of the food could have been so much better and reading all the reviews, I had high hopes for this place. Yes, perhaps some may say that I'm harsh, but if they advertise a regional food, and certain people go there for that regional food, that food should reach or exceed the standards. If this were in Mexico, it would have been one of the least busiest stalls in even areas like Tacubaya. 

It is possible that the person cooking my food was an employee instead of the mama other people mention in their reviews. Thus, I will definitely try to come back when the mama is there.
