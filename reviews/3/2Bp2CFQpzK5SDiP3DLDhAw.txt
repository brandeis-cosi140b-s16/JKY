One star was docked because the service was very slow. The food was okay and comparable to Taco Bell. They did have fresh avocado which was nice and delicious. I ordered their new chicken avocado bowl and it was decently cooked and seasoned. If I was in a rush, I might try them again but feel there are better options in the area.
