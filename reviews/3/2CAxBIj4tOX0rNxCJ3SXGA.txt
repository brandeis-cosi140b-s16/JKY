The food is above average but the prices are way too high and the idea that, "It's Vegas," is not a proper excuse.

For our appetizer we ordered the corn on the cob and were definitely positively surprised by what we received.  The corn was roasted well and not overcooked, while it was covered in chili powder & cheese.  It was definitely a good selection and I recommend it to anyone not on a first date (cheesy corn on the cob could be a bit messy); 3.5 stars.
For my entree I got the carne asada tacos and was pleasantly surprised at the flavor, because it looked almost generic and old upon presentation.  But, the tacos themselves were quite good & fresh, although they were on the small side.  The added rice & beans were good, but not great, and definitely tasted a bit older or part of a massive creation.  A solid dinner choice, 3.5 stars.
My fiance got the beef barbacoa and it was not that good.  The rice & beans certainly tasted very similar to mine, but her meat had a slightly odd flavor to it; not spoiled, but odd and overpowering.  A below average choice, 2.5 stars.
As for drinks, we both got the strawberry agave margarita and enjoyed it.  It tasted so good that we thought it lacked alcohol, but as we soon found out that we were wrong :).

Overall, this place has some stronger items and some weaker items.  Unfortunately, it is overpriced and continues the Vegas theme of expensive mediocre food.
