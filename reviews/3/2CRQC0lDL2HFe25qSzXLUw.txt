5 of us dined @ Guido Garcia's last night... service was GREAT, drinks were good but my dish was just average. This was my second time here and again my dish had little flavor. I ordered the beef tacos and the time before white enchiladas. My friends had the raviolis which seemed like the better choice. They're cheese covered bread was not warmed or toasted which I find odd. I plan to go back but will stick with the Italian menu instead : )
