Another restaurant that hasn't kept up with it's original concept.  They used to be really creative and spicy.  Seems to be americanized now.
Taco plate looked like an appetizer and the best appetizer was melted cheese.  They used to have a mussel appetizer in a mole sauce with fry bread.  That was worth the trip.
It's such a small place you would think the service would be better.  They need to get back to their roots to make it.
