This place is hit or miss.  Lately the carne asada burritos have been grizzily and pico was overpowered by onions.  But today, 99cent chicken tacos they did not have at 9:40PM even though the special is until midnight.  This is not the first time this has happened to me at this location.  And the girl who works there, her english is not so great.  All she said was special out, rather than we have no more, we ran out, etc.  Of course no substitute was offered.  I think I will have to stick with Don Tortaco.
