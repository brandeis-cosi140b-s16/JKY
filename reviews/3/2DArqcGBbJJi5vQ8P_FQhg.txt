Went to Frijoles and it was 11:06 am.  Could see three employees inside working and they could see my guest and I.  They waited another three or four minutes before coming to open the front doors.  Then after ordering and sitting at a table a loud explosion went off behind the counter.  But the food is great.  Hope someone learns how to tell time and control the loud noises in the future.
