Don't get my 3 Star rating wrong, the food here is very good.  Everything is super fresh, but it is not what you or I would expect when ordering a normal taco or burrito from a Mexican Taco Shop.  It reminds me of a healthy taco shop.  You can tell that their tortillas are made with health rather than taste in mind, (you can also see  through them).  I don't know about you, but when I go to order a burrito I know it's not great for me. I just want to indulge in the moment of my deliciousness and feel bad about it after.  

** Salsa Bar ** - Somewhat okay, had 3-4 choices. None of them were spicy though. That bugs, big time.

-In conclusion: If you want the "expected" flavors of Mexican cuisine, please just go to your local Taco Shop down the road.  This place is good, but not that place.
