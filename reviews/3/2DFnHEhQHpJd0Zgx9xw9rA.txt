This was the starting point for our club crawl, which I thought was a great idea. It's nice space with activities that help break the ice a little bit. We bopped along with some balloons, danced a conga line for shots and enjoyed a lot of fun performances. As part of the crawl, we got two for 1 yard drinks, but they could have been just tonic water and lime for all the good it did me in getting a buzz. One would think that an entire yard would have some effect, but nada, zilch. zero. Disappointing.
