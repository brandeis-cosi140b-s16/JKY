Ok this is inside Doc Holliday's or vice versa I never can tell, either way I did not have the Mexican food soothes is a review of the bar and bar food. If you pick up The Sunday magazine there is a coup in the back for a free drink. I had a Shock Top, to be honest it was a little not cold. The bartender however was quite nice. I had the hamburger it was ok, not great just ok.I can't complain for 4.50. Overall this is a friendly local pub with a great happy hour. Live it up you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!
