My husband and I wanted to try a new Mexican place. He had heard about Maria's and so we decided to try it today. We arrived at 3pm. The sign on the door listed the hours 7 am until 3 pm. They let us come in, and eat anyways. The ambience isn't anything to be desired. The air conditioner was broken, and they had swamp cooler, and floor fans which did not cool the place at all. In the Valley of the sun in the summer, AC is necessary for comfort. The food was good, huge portions, but the soda machine was broken so they gave out warm cans of soda. The reason I gave this place 3 stars and not 2 was because they stayed open after 3pm.
