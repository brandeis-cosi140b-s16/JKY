I have been here a few times and each time I'm left with the same mindset.   "Not great, but not terrible either".  It's ok in my opinion, but there aren't any better choices in the area so I guess you work with what you have.  If you are craving Mexican food, while there are better places further away you could do a lot worse.  For me nothing stands out as far as flavor. Everything taste just like 100s of other ordinary Mexican restaurants so it's hard to pin point one flaw other than just say everything is average.  

The service is decent so no complaints there. Nice bar and happy hours. Decor is very nice as well.  So in short: overall experience will be enjoyable , food is ok.
