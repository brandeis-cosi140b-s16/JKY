Am I the only person who sees "Ajo Al's" and thinks "A-hole Al's"?
Anyway, went here for lunch.  The service was very good.  I think the chips./salsa hit the table before my butt hit the seat.  Well done.

I ordered the chicken enchilada/chicken taco combo. It comes with rice and refried beans.  My wife had something called Chuy's Chimi which is a chimichanga served with beans and rice (I have no idea who Chuy is).

The food was OK.  It wasn't great. I ate the enchilada first and thought that nothing could be blander than this. Then I bit into the taco.  I dumped some salsa on it and that helped.
$30 plus tip for two meals and drinks.  Not bad.
