I went here on National Margarita Day with two of my friends. They were running a special for $2 house margaritas and $5 coronaritas! We all opted for the $2 house margaritas. The waitress then suggested we each get an additional shot on the side that was only "a dollar more." We all agreed and ordered them. When our bill came, the additional shots that were only "a dollar more" were actually $1.39 each. It was not a big deal, but obviously for some people something like that might be. We ordered 3 rounds, so it ended up being another $5 or so on our bill which wasn't a big deal. This is also one of those restaurants that does not list the price of drinks on their drink menu. 

We just ordered some appetizers with our drinks which came out fast and all tasted good. We got a special loaded nacho that was a featured item, chicken fajita quesadilla, and queso dip. 

This is located on the outskirt of the Concord Mills Mall which means it can definitely get BUSY at times. When we arrived it looked like there was going to be a long wait, but luckily everyone ahead of us seemed to be large parties and we were seated right away.
