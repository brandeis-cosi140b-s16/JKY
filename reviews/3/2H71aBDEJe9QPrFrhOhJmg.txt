Ehh sums up my visit. I got there 5 min before my order was due to be ready. When I went to the line I heard one of the line people say oh we lost that ticket but we are making it now. 

She offered me a drink while I waited. I took it but she did not notice I already had a free drink due to a coupon on my ticket. I waited patiently so I got to see the restaurant. 

There were several dirty tables and the drink station had spilled soda all over. Plus they were out of forks and napkins.

I had the barbacoa enchiladas. I am not sure what sauce was on it but it was so sweet it was almost inedible. I also had a side of chips and queso. I did not like the chips at all. They had a lot of seasoning on them. 

I doubt I will go back. I would rather go to Chipotle and have less options. At least they are cleaner and have better quality.
