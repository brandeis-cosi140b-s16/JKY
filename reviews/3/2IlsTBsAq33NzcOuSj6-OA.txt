At the sight of the prices, I found this place to be a little greedy on the wallet. Nice setting, good variety on the menu as well as wine selection. However, there was a huge turnoff overhearing the waitress discussing an employee being fired, and I really thought that was very unprofessional for a restaurant employee to share that with guests. In addition, the waitress was seen touching her hair while serving food and that just really grossed me out.

The meal was good, but honestly due to the prices and poor attitude and unprofessionalism of a staff member, I would not return.
