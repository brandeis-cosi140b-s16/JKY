Today I made a venture into the newly renovated food court of Arizona Mills. Of course I bypassed the salad bar and  shocking to even myself the Froyo place and went straight for what I was hoping to be the spicy selection at Tinta Mexicana. I quickly checked over their list of items, tacos, burritos, and bowls a bit limited but hey it's mall food. Upon first glance I was thinking this is just another Chipotle in disguise, but Tinta Mexicana has something they do not, Bacon wrapped Hot Dogs! Need I say anymore? I got the Sonoran, but did it my way. I just could not see a tasty bacon dog smothered in mayo, ketchup and mustard as the menu suggested. You have your choice of brown or black beans, and onion mixed with cilantro. I skipped the onion cilantro mix, as to spare others upon my return to the office. Now if they had cilantro alone, I would have gone for it. I asked to replace my condiments with their spicy salsa, of which was not spicy at all but still flavorful. The service was a bit slow on the uptake, but they are fairly new and perhaps still working the kinks out. All in all for around $4.50, a pretty good deal. I'll be back, I mean c'mon they've got Bacon!
