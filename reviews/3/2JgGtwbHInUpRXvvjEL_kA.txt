Easy and quick. This is a typical burrito shop. It's connected to a gas station which feels a little sleazy but honestly it's pretty decent. I usually get the steak and egg burrito because it just hits the spot for me. 

It's just your typical Mexican food. No frills and nothing amazing. Be prepared because it's cash only. If you really don't have cash, then just buy something small at the gas station and get some cash out. No biggie. 

Enjoy!
