Made reservations 2 weeks in advance for 9 at 6PM. We got there at almost 6 and the table wasn't ready. Waited 20 minutes and then they come out and ask us if it is OK for some of us to sit at a table the rest in a booth. Really!!!! Hungry so we agreed, the initial drink and food order was quick but after that we had to ask for soda's beer and even water. The food and service was much better when they were at the Palms. We won't be back
