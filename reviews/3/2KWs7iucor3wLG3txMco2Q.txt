I went here for lunch on a Saturday afternoon at the taco stand right in front of the restaurant.  I had the chicken, pork, and beef tacos.  I sat at one of the tables right outside the restaurant, and it was quite convenient because we got to order and pay right away without the hassle of going through the typical restaurant service.  We got the tacos quite fast, however, I was not impressed by the food at all. The tacos were soft shelled and double layered, the toppings were flavorless and bland...quite salty for my taste.  All in all, I've had better tacos elsewhere.
