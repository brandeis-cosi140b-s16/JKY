I finally tried this place because it is nearby and it has a lot of good reviews. It's just fine if you're looking for Mexican take out food. If you've lived in Vegas for a while you know that Roberto's is the standard for decent, cheap Mexican food around here. Algobertos is pretty much the same thing. The menu looked to be nearly identical. I ordered a chili Verde burrito and it did not disappoint. There isn't a whole lot more to say. If anything it was a little cleaner than the average Roberto's and the self serve area with the red and green sauces had something I haven't seen anywhere else, freshly chopped jalapenos mixed with onions. So that was pretty cool. But honestly, the food is the standard fare for this area. If it's close by it's worth it but not if Roberto's is closer.
