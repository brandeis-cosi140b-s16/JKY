Wish I could give this place 3 and a half stars. 
The food is amazing! Breakfast is delicious and uncomplicated. I dream about the shrimp tacos st night. The cocktails are super tasty. So why not 4 or 5 stars? The service is ridiculous. We'll get either no glasses of water, or 3 from 3 different servers. We'll get 4 people asking us if we're ready to order, and then get ignored for 20 minutes. I don't know what the problem is, but it's every freakin time!
I wish the level of service would match the quality of the food. Then we'd be talking about something spectacular.
