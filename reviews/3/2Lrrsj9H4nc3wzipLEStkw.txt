Not as great as we remembered it from about 5 years ago. The first time we went, we go the chile rellano, and it was BOMB DOT COM!...but of course, they didn't have it anymore, so we settled for the barbacoa enchladas. 

Margaritas: good, and fairly strong, but they should be since they were pretty pricey!

Guac: It was okay, not great, but certainly not bad.

Ceviche: The worst I've ever had. It was overly sweet instead of citrusy like it should have been. I think that dropped an entire bottle of mango syrup in it...gross, and it was all scallops instead of shrimp...or at least a mix of the two. I would NEVER order it again, and I would TELL people not to order it! Plus, it was expensive. 

Barbacoa Enchaladas:  I liked these more than my husband did. I think they were just the right ammt. of spiciness without being overpowering. I also liked the sauce they were covered in. He didn't think they were bad, and honestly, I think he only says that they weren't "great" and only good because he was crushed he couldn't have the rellano..nothing would have appeased him.

Dessert: Since it was my husband's birthday, they brought him a birthday flan. I don't like flan, so I didn't partake, but my husband said it was one of the better parts of the meal.

I'm not sure if we would return since Vegas has such an ENDLESS ammt. of restaurants to choose from.
