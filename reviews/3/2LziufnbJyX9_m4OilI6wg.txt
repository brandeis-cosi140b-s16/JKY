Was looking forward to lunch here since it came highly recommended by a friend.  The place is clean and I was greeted properly at the door.  However, as a single, I was ushered toward the bar. Pet peeve. I spoke up and was shown to a booth.

Service was very slow at first and was told "Someone will be right with you!"  No so. Finally a polite server showed up.  Friendly AND a clean uniform.  Ordered Tortilla soup and two cheese enchaladas.  The soup was basically tasteless...more like hot water with a few chips in it. Enchalads Ok, but nothing special.  For poor service and mediocore food I give it three stars.
