Bottom line 3.5 stars.

My date and I were greeted and seated promptly. The chips and salsa were delivered but the chip person made no effort to say hi or anything as they normally do in mexican restaurants.

It took quite a while for a server to get our drinks and it also took too long for them to actually get our drinks out. After that, however, the service was much better.

I ordered the shrimp tacos and my date ordered the fish tacos. 

My plate was quite good...the fried shrimp tasted amazing I was surprised. The refried beans were also tasty.

The top shelf margarita had a good balance. Strong by flavorful.

I have to point out one quick detail in hopes management sees this. 

After we were done eating and drinking I was going to use the restroom but a busboy ( the same guy who delivered the chips without a smile or a hello)  was sweeping the one toilet one urinal bathroom. He saw me and just kept doing his thing.  I ended up having to drive home to use the bathroom. 

I would suggest they clean the bathrooms after all or most guests are done eating or at least allow the guest to use it. 

The food was good the service could use some work, but overall not a bad spot.
