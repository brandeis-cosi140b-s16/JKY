Vegas folks love their fast food Mexican and Roberto's are always a decent stop for a breakfast burrito or carne asada burrito.  Keep your taqueria demands simple and Roberto's is a solid choice.

This Roberto's location is clean, quick, and offers a tasty breakfast burrito.  Solid tomatillo sauce as well.  Not the best in town, but worth a stop if heading home after the bar or needing a morning burrito with pico.
