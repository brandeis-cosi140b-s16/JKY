Chips and salsa were the best part.  Ordered the #7 combo that had two tacos and an enchilada.  Both tacos were loaded with slaw and pico de gallo with hardly any chicken or steak.  Meat was pretty bland.  The chicken enchilada was good.  

This place has great decor, great tequila selection, and good service... But if your name is Hot Taco, you gotta have great tacos!!  Gave it three stars for this visit since service, enchilada, and chips/salsa was good.  Will try again in a few months
