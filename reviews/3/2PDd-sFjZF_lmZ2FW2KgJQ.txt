Rand H. and I stopped in the other day and I realized something about Mexican buffets and myself, they don't mix! Here's why ... when it comes to Mexican food I ALWAYS order the same thing! A Carne Asada Burrito that's my delectable choice when I choose Mexican food, often from a roach coach!This spot was no help in changing that personal tradition!
Someday someone may be able to enlighten me, and I'll let go of my  mono mindedness for these particulars of preference.
