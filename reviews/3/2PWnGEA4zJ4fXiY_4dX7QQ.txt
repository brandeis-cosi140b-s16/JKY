"Dacha" is Russian for summer house- and from the outside, this little bungalow-shaped building sounds perfect. The menu of comforting Russian cuisine also fits the bill. But once you get inside it's like this place has Multiple Personality Disorder, because the inside looks like a straight-up 80s European discotheque with blaring music and hookah.

Bizarre d√©cor choices aside, the staff is polite, the pricing and portions are good, and the food is delicious- just wish this place would be set up more like a restaurant so the food could shine!

Oliviye ($10):Russian potato salad, it's delicious and super fresh. If you haven't had it, you need to. It's exactly what it sounds like.
Rassolnik ($10): Russian version of a beef barley soup, a little sour with some herbs in it, very comforting. I wish they'd add solyanka to the menu!
Zharkoe ($12): Russian-style beef stew, classic peasant food, comforting and tastes just like your grandma made it a couple of decades ago.
Dacha-style Pork Steak with Mushrooms ($10): juicy pork steak topped with mushrooms, served with garlic potatoes and a salad, doesn't sound Russian but it is and it's well-executed too.

Other noteworthy items on the menu include pickled herring, pirojki, vereniki, pelmeni, and several types of bourekas, as well as entrees of schnitzel, stroganoff, and chicken kiev.

Someone here is hip to marketing, and they currently have a deal up on Groupon ($18 for $30), a Yelp deal, and also a Yelp check-in deal ($5 discount)- use any of the above to come in and give this place a try.
