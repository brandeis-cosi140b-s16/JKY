It was my first time in and I had their "taco salad" today. Kind of disappointing. There was no kind of taco shell or tortilla chips that you would assume with it being a taco salad. Would've been so much better if it had been served over a bed of tortilla chips. Judging from the photos uploaded on Yelp, the salad was literally the same garnish they put with their burritos and enchiladas but with a very small scoop of guacamole and sour cream. Their red salsa was pretty good, green salsa lacked serious flavor. Three stars because they seem like real genuinely nice people. I will probably be back again, probably won't ever order the taco salad again until they change that recipe.
