WHOLE IN THE WALL. Stopped by after work on a Friday night, the place was empty surprisingly, but that just made it all that easier to get a drink :b Not much of a selection at the bar, I was in the mood for some El Jimador and to my dismay they didn't have it available. I did however, try a shot of Buchanas  as recommended by the bartender. YUM :D. Tried a old fashioned margarita on the rocks, eh, it was ok. I have had better. But it was cheap, nice size, around $5.50, the waitress was very polite and even offered to put a little extra in for me :D... She recommended I try the salsa dip. It tasted home made but way too watery. I wasn't impressed. The bartender suggested I try the Guacamole DIP, on a scale of 1 to 10, I'd give it a 6! Not bad. Unfortunately this was about all I had. 

Aside from being it being very quiet and slow that night, the lighting in the bar was kept dark, the chairs were old, and overall the place seemed a little run down. BUT supposedly, per the bartender, the owner of the bar is in the process  of remodeling the place to separate the kitchen and the bar. I think this place has potential and with a little fixing up it would be a neat little place to relax, get some grub, and a drink :D
