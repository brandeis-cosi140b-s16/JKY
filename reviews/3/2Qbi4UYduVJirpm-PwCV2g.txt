This restaurant is a little hidden so just be aware that it is in the back of the shopping area. I enjoyed both the green and red salsas and split a pitches of margaritas with my group- which oddly our server did not recommend to do. He said the pitches makes the margaritas get a little too watery- which I think could be fixed by not filling it so high with ice and having glasses full of ice to pour into. Overall it was a great drink $35 for a pitcher of house margaritas which had about seven pours. 

Let me just say. This brisket is banging. I also has the charro beans which despite being cooked with bacon were nothing to write home about. Get the brisket. Prices are also pretty fair considering its Southpark and all.
