If the owner of this restaurant is reading this PLEASE LISTEN.  The food is fabulous, for the most part. Anyone wanting to go, try the crab relleno. It's awesome. The shrimp and mango quesadillas, amazing. I love the fish tacos as well. I have heard good things about the hot dog as well. Here are the bad things, and these things may deter me in the future. 
1. There are too many servers and they all visit the table at some point. It's confusing for both the customer and the server.
2. The chips are gross. Bland and dry. 
3. You CHARGE for extra chips. I have never seen a mexican food restaurant do that. If you are that strapped, change something about your cost structure. How much does that extra basket cost you, 50 cents? Come on now.
That's it... change these things and it would be a great place to eat.
