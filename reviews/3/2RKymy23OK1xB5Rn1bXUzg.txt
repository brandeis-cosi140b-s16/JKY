I am constantly searching for excellent mexican in the valley.  This place is just OK.

The pluses:  Reasonable pricing, good service, decent atmosphere.

The minuses:  Margaritas seemed pretty weak, expecially when we ordered them in a pitcher.  The food itself was OK - We ordered carnitas, which were good but nothing special, and the appetizer sampler, which was mediocre.

All in all, nothing remarkable about Pink Taco.  A solid three stars.
