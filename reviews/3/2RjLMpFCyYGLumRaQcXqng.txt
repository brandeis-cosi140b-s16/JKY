This location is one of the new franchised America's; not to be confused with the original, owner-run locations that have been in Phoenix for years.
Basically you can choose among three proteins: chicken, carne asada, and al pastor (pork) in three different forms: tacos, tortas, and vampiros.

I ordered the three taco platter but as we were waiting for our food, we were informed that the al pastor wouldn't be ready to go for about 30 minutes so I doubled up on the carne asada instead.

What you get is your basic street taco on a very light corn tortilla.  The interesting thing is that everything inside is chopped almost to the point of being unrecognizable.  The meat is diced into tiny bits.  Oddly so is the lettuce. I wasn't really sure at first is it was lettuce or finely chopped onion.  Stranger still is the lack of a homemade salsa bar.  They have bottles of the jalapeno and haberno sauces you can get in any grocery.

Fortunately it was "Happy Hour" (4-7pm) so the tacos were only $2 each (regular price is $7.19 for 3).

All in all, a decent taco, but really pricey.  La Taquitos at 48St & Elliott, does a better street taco for $1.25 everyday.

That said, we really did get our money's worth as, during the grand opening, we were treated to chips and salsa, a couple of haberno/mango margarita samples, and as we were finishing up, I guess the al pastor got up to temp because they brought us a couple of the tacos we originally ordered.

I hope the service stays at this high level even when the corporate franchising people are gone.  That said, I be more than OK if they lost the "singer" out on the patio.
