Pretty average taco shop, a little watered down in some locations to fit the taste of the gringos.  =)

In fairness though, their market here is a little different than the market in California.  Even in Vegas some of the Roberto's are just a little different in depth of flavor.

They have somethings that on the menu in San Diego (Hazard Center store) that they do not have here and I wish they did.  For example, the hash brown burrito and this amazing loaded carne asada quesadilla.

With that said, still a fairly consistent solid choice.
