Hadn't been in this place in 5 years or so, but my impression this place was good so one afternoon I returned. A lot has changed :(

There was 1 server working the entire place when we entered - poor space cadet was absent, unknowledgeable and slow but hey, slack cut since she was alone!

The menu has alot of tex mex favorites, and then some crap that's trying to be new and exciting but fails. We tried the queso and was pleased with it (hard to ruin gooey cheese, si?) but the fajitas my date ordered came out with 0 sizzle and all the wrong condiments (no guac, double sour cream instead of requested opposite). I had a salad with a jalepeno vinagerette and it was OK - I know it had chicken in it and came in a large tortilla bowl but nothing else so I think that says how memorable it was.

I wouldn't swear this place off, but I won't be suggesting we stop at On The Border in the future, especially if you're on a time restriction!
