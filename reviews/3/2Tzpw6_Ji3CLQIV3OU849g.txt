So I decided to come back here after a 2 month hiatus. I will admit the the entire staff had changed,  good job on that.  This batch looks like they were actually trained.  Now if they would stay open later,  lets say 11pm or midnight,  that would be awesome. C'mon management, the Arrowhead area is a happenin area, doesn't it make sense to stay open later and capitalize on all this potential business.  Just saying. ..
