I have been here twice now, and both times felt that the food and service is mediocre. The fish tacos are not good and expensive, the crab enchiladas are fair but again, more than i would like to spend on enchiladas. 

The drinks are great, and its the only bar I've ever seen to have Negro Modelo on tap. 

In summary: Go for draft Mexican beer or Mojitos, go elsewhere for dinner.
