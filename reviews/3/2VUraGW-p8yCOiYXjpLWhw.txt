I am giving 3 stars, not on a food experience I had, but to praise Douglas Bolle, founder and CEO of Zabas I had sent an email with concerns I had with my last experience with Zabas at this location. Not only did I get a prompt personal reply, but Douglas asked me to call and talk to him. I was so impressed that he took the time to find out my concerns, and we had a great conversation about fast food. He took the time to personally address the issues. I see only good coming out of this. I was offered a coupon which I declined, his interest in his establishment was worth more than a coupon for free food
