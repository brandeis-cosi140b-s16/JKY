While frequently going to Yogurtland, I've always eyed this place, wanting to try it out.  My time finally came!

I had stopped by at Panchero's after getting some Yogurtland the other day [yes yes, dessert before dinner  XD].  I had ordered the chicken quesadilla and it wasn't too bad.  I liked how they make the tortillas fresh!  It's not exactly the best I've had but it's okay for an Americanized-Mexican food place.
