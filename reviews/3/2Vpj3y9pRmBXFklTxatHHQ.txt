Another day in Phoenix and another burrito. It's a theme that has become all too common in my visits + layovers in AZ, and my love affair with Mexican cuisine often leaves me desperate and stupid enough to seek it all forms both good, bad, and ugly. To declare El Bravo as the best burrito option in Sky Harbor Airport would be the truth, even if it doesn't say a whole lot. 

For airport food, it's as pricey and as subpar as one would expect. Don't fall for the sad nachos or the depressing state of their soft tacos, burritos are definitely the way to go. If the thought of eating a small brick of a burrito doesn't appeal to you, ask them to have less rice and more protein / filling. Some folks shoot for carne asada, I am more of a chicken pollo fan myself. It's not as tough as the beef and the chicken is usually the least dry of the choices

If you go wet enchilada style, it'll save you the trouble of wolfing it down while holding it like a slob while keeping that flour tortilla soaked and moist (oh my). This will all run one close to $10 with a drink and rice and beans, which for airport prices isn't the worst thing ever. Don't expect the staff to accommodate any picky eating habits, unless of course its simply a matter of 86'xing the veggies.

Finally, the airport version of El Bravo is as expected, a watered down version from the semi-famous original (http://www.yelp.com/biz/el-bravo-phoenix) in downtown Phoenix. There is some limited potential here, but until something better comes along, it's best that El Bravo Sky Harbor remain.
