Grub!  Gotta have it Grub for flight crews and airport employees only!  Our on private taco truck and more.  Good service until it gets busy.  Somehow, Monkey always gets order lost in the mix.  Otherwise, it's the best place to eat in the entire airport.  Good prices for good food.  Tacos, burgers, tostadas, sandwiches, breakfast burritos - absolutely filling and don't forget the ice cold drinks and treats.  Monkey usually do:  ASADA TACOS, CHICKEN TACOS, BREAKFAST BURRITOS...
