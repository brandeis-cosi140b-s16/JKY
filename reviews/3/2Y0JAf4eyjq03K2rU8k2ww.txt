This is one of the nicer Roberto's I've been to. I usually order carne asada fries or the California burrito, but the other day I saw my co-workers eating some taquitos and that made me crave it ever since. So since I was determined I came to this location on a Wednesday night. As I look at the menu I remember they call their taquitos rolled up tacos instead. I order the special that comes with guac and beans as well. I get excited when I get my food and dig in. The rolled up tacos were rather dry? The beans were decent and the chicken taco had a whatever taste. I do like the fact they put cheese all over the servings. I don't think I will order this again and stick to my usual choices of fries or California burrito. Although last time I had the fries I wasn't that impressed either?
