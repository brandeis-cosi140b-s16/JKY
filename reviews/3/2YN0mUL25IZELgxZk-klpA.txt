So my first impression was that this was a yuppie urban Chipotle's only more confusing since the menu was written over head instead of behind the servers which is ten times easier.  BUT, the beef short rib enchilada was SO good and the choices of toppings (cheeses, vegies, etc) were SO much better.  And they top it off by baking it in a cute little clay dish in the oven.  It was YUMMY!  The chips, however....much better at Chipotles.  I will definitely go back for lunch soon and try some of the other interesting dishes...probably not for dinner.
