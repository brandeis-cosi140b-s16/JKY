I was on a mission from god (very small "g") today:) and needed a quick retox...

Los Betos filled that role with...wait for it...three rolled tacos and a coke:)

And yes, retoxifying, they were...chock full of greasy, cheesy, and salsa covered goodness:)

My rolled tacos were very edible...and they didn't get my order wrong (more than I can say about a certain redhead's burger joint:)...but really, how can you screw up the rolled tacos?...You can't:)

Just for places like this, I've created a chart with the "crap to quality ratio", in honor of Ryan C:)...(see "photo" attached...you wouldn't believe how difficult it is to attach a chart:)

Although originally developed by Ryan C, in his secret lair, to asses quality  and quantity  of Boofay's, I've discovered these calculations work quite nicely for any type of greasy, divey, suspect, shady, oddball, sketchy, rough, funny smelling, bizarre, foreign, wacky, oddball, outr√© and outrageous eateries:)

Thanks Ryan:)
 
Bon Appetite:)...
