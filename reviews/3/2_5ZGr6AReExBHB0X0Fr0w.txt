I've dined here since before there was a Yelp! I'm talking waaaay back, like Peabody's-machine way back, when getting your first AOL dial-up connection was a big deal.

I don't think much has really changed...well, except that I have the option of downing a margarita at 11am without any guilt. Something about having a live band at ANY hour brings out the charm in tequila.

My liver was (surprisingly) not up for that, so I focused on strictly food. Something about their lunch menu seemed to fall kinda flat. Their chimis with green chili are pretty good, but nothing you couldn't get better at other restaurants.

With my last visit, I realized that BREAKFAST is what makes this place shine. For a mere $7 I scored a generous chorizo plate with an egg and some refried beans. All with a huge flour tortilla on the side. The first meal of the day goes largely ignored, but with a dive bar atmosphere and solid morning menu, Bitz-ee Mama is something to look forward to on Sundays.
