Really solid lunch deals and pretty close to Tex-Mex which I still get cravings for from time to time. I had the spinach chicken enchiladas and they were nice. It was a ton of food (of course) so we definitely needed boxes for leftovers. If you're in the neighborhood, it's a solid deal and I'd stop in again. My only wish is that they did a green sauce with the spinach chicken enchiladas. That would be heaven.
