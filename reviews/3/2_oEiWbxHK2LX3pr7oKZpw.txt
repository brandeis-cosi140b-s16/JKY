Average across the board - ok service and ok food.

Located in the Fiesta Casino, it offers the same menu as the other Station Casino Mexican restaurants.  As the others do, they offer a salsa bar with 6 different salsas and bean dip.  It wasn't kept as clean and tidy as I'd like.  I realize there are plenty of people serving themselves but I would hope they would keep an eye on things.

Service was ok.  Everything was kept short and sweet.  There wasn't anything spectacular or memorable but she did her job.

I ordered the taco salad.  This was just ok.  It was a little bland and had to add additional salsa to liven up the flavor.  But the fried shell bowl was fill to the brim.  Kudos for that!

I wouldn't rush back to this location for Mexican food but it would satisfy a craving.
