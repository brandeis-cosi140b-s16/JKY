All this time, I thought Baja Fresh was a fast-food place comparable in quality to Del Taco- but then my office ordered lunch here. And my mind was changed! Their quality is higher than fast-food caliber, produce is fresh, salads are huge. None of these things I can say about Del Taco or Taco Bell.

Menu has tacos and burritos, nachos and flautas, bowls and salads- quite a few of them! Lots of customization options, too, and sides include chips and salsa, guac, or cheese. Opted for the Cilantro Lime Shrimp salad and a chicken tortilla soup- even though I really wanted nachos.

Salad was huge and fresh, tons of shrimp (8-10) with a tasty cilantro sauce and at least half of an avocado. Soup was a bit on the greasy side but had a ton of chicken and good overall flavor. 

Probably won't make this a regular place, but glad to know quality is better than their exterior suggests.
