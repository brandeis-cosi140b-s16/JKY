This location is in an area of town that I don't frequent too often.  However, sometimes I get a craving for one of their menu items and I will make the drive to satisfy that craving....which is what I did the other week.

I ordered my usual Veggie Works Burrito and Bean Burrito.

While I was waiting for my order, I noticed a Claw Machine in the corner!  This Claw phenomenon is all over the place now....LOL
