Clean, but average Chipotle. 

I had lunch here with my girlfriend and both of us were happy with our orders. We were given sides of pico, our burritos were both fresh, and the service was speedy. This location has a weird seating arrangement inside, with mainly long benches and stools. We ended up getting one of the only areas where there were actual chairs. 

The overall vibe of this place is good, but not overly inviting. It feels kind of cold and industrial there. The staff seem nice enough, but I've seen better service at Chipotle locations before. In the end, this is probably be the best location near the Laveen area. I would come back in the future at some point if I am back in the area.
