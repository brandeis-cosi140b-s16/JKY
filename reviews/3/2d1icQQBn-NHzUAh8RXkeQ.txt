Not the cheapest, not the best, but it was open late on a Sunday.

the Nachos were good, from what I remember...

The drive though took FOREVER. I guess that might be a good sign at a Mexican food place though, if you know what i mean. 

if it was the only place again ( I cant believe Taco Bell was closed!) I would give it another go.
