Going to have to knock this place down a peg for the bad service.  What most reviewers are saying is true; great food but slow and inconsistent service.

Maria is a doll but seems easily distracted. Her husband is surly and an incompetent bartender.  On two separate visits my wife and sister in-law ordered margaritas, in both instances the husband (not friendly enough to clue you in on his name) "forgot" to put the tequila in the drinks. In my four visits he seemed to hate being there.
