This place was fun with great music - both live and via DJ.  They did hit us up a few times to take pictures of us and try to sell us photos of those pictures.  They're cute but not worth the price IMHO.  A balloon artist came by and made balloon hats for everyone at our table, we won some free shots in the music trivia game, and the service was nice.

I had the chicken fajitas, which were good.  It was a fun spot to grab dinner before our Cirque du Soleil show.
