Tonight was the first night my family and I went to this location. The 3 star that I'm giving is based on the food, and food only. I had the chimichanga and it was great! I loved the fact that they aren't stingy when it comes to the guac. And sour cream. The carne asada fries were pretty decent. Plenty meat. My husband ordered the tostada. He said he had better. Now the fact that I'm not giving it any more stars is the customer service. The girl in the front either hates her job, or her life. Seriously! I felt so awkward. She needs some basic customer service lessons or something. I'm sorry, but come on peoples. I don't wanna be giving my money to someone who ain't happy taking it! Lol
