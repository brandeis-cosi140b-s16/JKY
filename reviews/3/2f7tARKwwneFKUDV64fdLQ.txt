Here's the truth (which I'll always give you), if I hadn't gone to California Taco Shop before I went here, I probably would have given this place another star.  Since I have...it's A-OK.  Which I always have to remind myself, is not by any means bad.  

It's very tiny, with only two real tables, but they offer a great take out service so it makes up for the tiny dinning accommodations.  Besides, if you're like me, you inhale the burrito you purchase in 2.5 seconds and you're done, so it wouldn't matter if I had to stand and eat it.  

I ordered the steak burrito.  I really wanted a shrimp one, but there are no seafood options on the menu.  The other menu option missing is fresh tortilla chips.  Total bummer considering they bring you a fantastic spread of regular salsa, salsa verde and jalapeno's.  I could have used something to dip in it!  So the next option was to slather my burrito in it.  

I thought the burrito itself was good, but definitely not a giant one you'd get at Cali Taco Shop or Reyna's in the strip.  It's more of a taco size, you'll need more than one if you have a big American appetite like I do!  The steak was a little too salty for my taste, but was cooked just right.  The rice was really the winner of the burrito.  It had just the right amount of lime added.  Loved it!  

Would I go back?  Sure, why not.  But I probably wouldn't order the steak again and I'd hope they have chips next time!  Plus, it's a fantastic addition to the neighborhood!
