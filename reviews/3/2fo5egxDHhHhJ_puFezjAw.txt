An impromptu dinner out led us out to the OTB (I went ahead and abbreviated it).  Very quiet around 6 pm, and the hostess and waitress were very friendly. The guacamole was yummy and the bottomless nacho chips were just that... never ending!  My waitress did get my order wrong, but, hey chalk it up to human error.   Cute blondes get away with more anyway!  The fajitas were pretty good though on whole.  They also had a mariachi band...  LOUD!  It scared half the people sitting when he belted out the first note of whichever Spanish song they were butchering!  But was good for a laugh!  Not a guffaw, but a good chuckle :)  Price is about average, 15 bucks or so for a meal...  Just bring someone to split the tab with ya!
