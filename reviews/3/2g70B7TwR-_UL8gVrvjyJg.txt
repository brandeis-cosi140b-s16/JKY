I am a huge fan of the La Parrilla Suiza restaurants in Tucson.  This branch located in Phoenix is similar but misses the mark compared to its sisters down south.

I have come here a couple of times and both times, service was fine.  The food however seemed to lack the freshness that I was accustomed to from the Speedway and Oracle locations in Tucson.  I REALLY like those restaurants and are some of my all-time favorites.

Part of the issue aside from freshness (of the salsas for instance) was the booths.   They are very compact it seems.  I am not a big guy at all but I felt crampt in the booths.  The back of the restaurant isn't as lively or bright as the other restaurants.  Although you can see the cooks in the kitchen, they are enclosed in a wall of glass or plastic that makes it feel like you're in a zoo.

Overall, not bad...certainly not terrible, just not the "authentic" La Parrilla that I am used to.
