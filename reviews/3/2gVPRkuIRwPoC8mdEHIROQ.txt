It seems the description that fits Macayo's is "average".  I have been here on several occasions, but only for lunch and Happy Hour, and have only eaten in the bar.  It always seems like it is a spur of the moment decision, when I am hungry or thirsty and passing by.

The interior is dark, although they do have a nice patio looking over the parking lot.  The staff is friendly and efficient, and if you have a specific request, they have always provided it.

That said, the food is average, not great, but not bad.  The prices are reasonable and the portions are large.  The chips are above average, and the salsa (the hot one) is delicious. That seems to be why we eat in the bar - they are very free with the chips and salsa.

This is not a destination restaurant for me - but if I am thirsty or am hungry for their chips and salsa, I will stop by for a few drinks.
