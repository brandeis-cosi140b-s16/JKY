Usually come here late-night.  Depending who you get helping you, usually the guys are cool, but their drive-thru lady can be not so friendly hence the 3 stars.  So service at night ranges from 1-5.  The food is good, but like any fast food not great.  Although I will say their steak tacos al carbon are pretty good and pair well with their most often than not fresh crinkle cut fries.  In my opinion if you want to avoid the gift that continues giving (diarrhea if you didn't know) that Taco Bell gives with every purchase come here.  Or get your Pepto ready at that other place.
