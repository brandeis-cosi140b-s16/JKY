Late night dining with friends and on a budget, Macayo's sure hits the spot.

I have to say, I do not eat Mexican food often, unless it is homemade by my friends, so I tend to rank places lower.

I will say that the atmosphere, prices, and general service of Macayo's, coupled with their good food, qualifies it for a decent rating.
We had a huge group and were seated pretty quickly.  They organized our check splits from the beginning, which saved us a ton of hassle at the end.

Chips & Salsa rating is decent: chips are good and not too salty, and the salsa is a good balance of chunky and not too thick, which has you eating probably way more than you should.

I had a shredded beef enchilada with albondigas soup...I think the total was about $7 before taxes & tip, which wasn't bad, considering the giant enchilada that I got.  there was a good level of cheesy, which balanced out the slightly dry quality of the beef.  However, I did like the albondigas soup...well flavored!

Customer service was fantastic.  With the good crowd & timely delivery of the food, it was an overall good experience!
