Good thing for Roberto's across the street is that they are located, across the street. Because if they were located on this side of Horizon Ridge, they would be shut due to Fausto's offering better tasting, better selection, better quality, better atmosphere of inexpensive Mexican food.

A few nights ago, Fausto's cooked us a delicious entree of Carne Asada Fries and also Nachos w/ chicken. While waiting for our freshly prepared order for take-out, we enjoyed watching a football game in Espanol on their TV. Good thing my son is taking Spanish in school, as I had no clue what they were talking about.

Fausto's is a nice little place for sit down or take-out! This restaurant is clean and deservedly maintains a Grade A by SNHD. The service was VERY friendly and fast! Prices are very competitive and reasonable. Sat/Sun they offer menudo. Breakfast served anytime. We'll be back!
