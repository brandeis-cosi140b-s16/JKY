You are going to have to negotiate some of the strangest parking lot I have ever seen in Las Vegas.  First go past the restaurant and turn near the T-Mobile store, then past that turn right.  We eat here every couple of months when we are in the mood for fish tacos.  They have the tastiest fish tacos in Vegas; hot, juicy, and crisp, with cabbage and great dressing.  I always like to add a little guacamole.  They also have burritos, tacos, and bowls; both chicken and beef.  It's all serve it your self, but the fish tacos are made freshly and they bring them to you hot.
