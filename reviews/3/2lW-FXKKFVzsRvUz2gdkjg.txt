The Commisary is the Downtown Grand's answer for while you stay here and are looking for a quick bite to eat. 

THIS is where hotel guests can get the coffee you were forced to pay for when you accepted the daily $18 amenities fee. 

There are 2 counter people and they are hustling to meet the demand. 

The breakfast burrito is $5. Pretty good sized. Jack cheese only. I wanted cheddar which has more flavor. Today they were out of bacon. I didn't cry. They should have some tomorrow.
