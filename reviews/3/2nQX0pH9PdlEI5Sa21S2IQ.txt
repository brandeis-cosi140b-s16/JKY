Well I went back and it was a little better now that they have gone back to the traditional menu.  My biggest issue today is it sort of fell off my radar when they made the changes and I don't have anyone in the family begging to go there anymore.  Prior to the changes I would say we would go 2-6 times a month.  Now I would say maybe once every 2 months.  Serrano's has become one of those places where we go if I don't feel like cooking and I don't get much push back from the family on going there. Certainly not a place everyone is begging me to go... It's more like the family will put up with it.  Would I recommend it... not my first or second choice in the area, but it is close and for that if I don't get much push back it'll serve the purpose.  Certainly not a glowing review.
