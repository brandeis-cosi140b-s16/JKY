After being so impressed with the Cave Creek location, we decided to try the Fountain Hills spot as well.

I have to say I was pretty disappointed... I decided to venture away from my old standby (chile relleno) & try something new. I had the Pollo Asado con Salsa Autentica, which sounded mouth-watering on the menu. I got what appeared to be a boiled, rubbery chicken breast covered in salsa. It was supposed to come with black beans & rice, but there was no rice & the beans tasted like they were straight from a can. Yuck.

The chips & salsa were good, and almost exactly the same as the Cave Creek's location. 

My mango margarita was delicious, but had barely ANY alcohol in it.

The only saving grace was our server, who was attentive, personable & quite funny! Unfortunately, we never got her name... (A noteworthy detail: the manager on the lunch shift Wed 4/25 was the LEAST involved manager I've ever seen in a restaurant! She passed us several times during our hour+ there & didn't even acknowledge our presence.)

Granted, we were there for an early lunch, but after having read the mission statement on the back of the menu, I would have to say it was a let-down compared to the Cave Creek location.

When my husband & I move to Phoenix next year, we will be making the drive to the Cave Creek location when we want excellent Mexican food & an enjoyable dining experience.
