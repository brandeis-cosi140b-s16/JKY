Kind of a dump, but we got seated right away.  We just came for food, didn't check out the bar area.

Menu has the standard mex options for a sit down place, plus breakfast 24 hours a day.  My friends got quesadillas, chimichanga, and a torta and they thought it was meh ok.  One friend got a horchata and said it was a really good horchata.  Soft drinks were refillable.  I stuck with water, and it had a nice lemon slice in it.

The chips are fried tortillas that you have to break apart yourself.  I'd have prefered standard chips.  The salsa it came with was fantastic.  I don't know why, I don't know what I like about it but I really liked the salsa.  It came with bean dip too, but I just stuck with this salsa I really liked.

I got a bowl from the "lite" menu, it had carne asada, green rice (no idea what green rice is but it was rice and it was green and it tasted good), mushrooms, and a baja kind of sauce.  YUM!  wow this bowl was really good.  Kind of pricey for nine dollars.  I'd love to see a calorie count, if this was truly a dieter food, I would definately recommend this, because I'm a big guy that's not on a diet and loved it just for what it was.

If it turns out this is a low cal bowl, then raise my review a star, I'd become the next Jared and just eat this every day and lose 50 pounds.

All in all, there are better options for sit down mexican, but the reason this gets three stars is because of the carne asada bowl I got and that this place is open 24 hours and the salsa the chips come with.  Occasionally there are groupons available, and I'll basically come here if I can get a groupon or if it's really late and other options aren't open, but I wouldn't really come for dinner during regular hours at the full menu price.  I'd also be willing to come to try out any specials or happy hour etc. where the prices are cheaper.
