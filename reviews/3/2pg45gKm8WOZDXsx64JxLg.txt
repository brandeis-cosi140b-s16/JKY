This place is surprising inside.  It is modern and more upscale than you would expect.  I'm still not sure about the name.  It suggest some Chinese fusion but there is no evidence of such on the menu,  There is some bamboo sticking out of the planters??  They have a very nice patio.  

We tried the queso with shrimp.  Not a win.  It was like the pale cheese goop and not the real stretchy cheese I had hoped for.  In addition, they do not serve it with tortillas, just the chips you already have.  Since it is more of a dip than a queso fundido, I guess that makes sense.  

We also had carnitas tacos.  They were A-OK.  Tender and crispy all at once.  Not bad, not great...just A-OK.  My sister in law was very pleased with her chilaquiles.  My husband was less than impressed with his steak.  He said it was flavorless.  

The chips were yummy, the sangria was tasty and the service was friendly. Prices were fair.  The ambiance is very nice.  However, I am not sure we will go again.  Maybe for a drink.  There is much better Mexican food to be had.
