A busy spot in Scottsdale, lots of tourists, spring training baseball fans. We had a great waitess, Jessica, which made our dining much better than others. Noticed slow service by other waiters. Food was ok, ate in the bar, beer was served warm, had to ask for ice. Probably will pass on this place for second visit.
