For lunch one day, my wife and I each had a pair of al pastor tacos with onions, cilantro and pineapple.  The cook did not slice the al pastor to order, but rather chopped it into tiny pieces that proved to be disappointing in comparison to our prior visits.  The free salsa bar was good with me selecting a small portion of warm black and pinto beans, a variety of salsas, grilled onion and peppers plus pickled carrots.
