While Lindo is my favorite Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas, I prefer to skip this location and go to the one in Henderson. The food is still good here, although it is better in Henderson, my friends shrimp salad had about 3 shrimps on it and every time she gets it at the other location it is LOADED with shrimp, including when we went last night. This location all feels more cozy and crowded, the tables are close together and I felt very in the way of the servers just sitting in my chair. They had a mariachi band that I could not stand, not that I mind the tradition music, it's just that this restaurant is set up like 3 small rooms so they went from room to room singing and because each room is so small is was RIDICULOUSLY loud. Also there would be other music playing in the other rooms so by the end of the night I had a migraine. All I all, I do recommend Lindo, but if you don't mind the drive, head to Green Valley.
