Okay folks, this is it. My final verdict, the end all be all of my Cabo reviews. I've had more than enough visits to add them up and divide them by pi. Cabo's perimeters were empty and the streets of Noda were barren. No gallery crawl, so lunch was to be served unadulterated and uninterrupted. 

It all started on a sunny Sunday afternoon with amazing weather and a $2 can of Modelo. The service was friendly, the patio was ideal, and the food came out hot and fast. 

Chips are no longer cold and instead of the regular fried White fish tacos, I decided to switch it up and opted for the special Tav-ah-roo tacos. The Tuna still wasn't anything special, but the wasabi sauce was pretty fabulous. Blackened tuna tacos were also so/so, along with the sides. 

Cabo still hasn't made the upper echelon as far as my personal favorites, but still a very cool spot with decent food and a nice break from the norm.
