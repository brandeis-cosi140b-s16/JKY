I like the spaciousness and cleanliness of this location.  The marinated veggies at its salsa bar are always plentiful and fresh.  I prefer just a bean and cheese or machaca burrito, but their dinner plates are good as well as their rolled and regular tacos,  nachos and enchiladas.  Although its adjacent to a bar you don't even notice that.
