The Paradise Cantina has been an on and off favorite of mine for Happy Hour (4-8pm 2 for 1). I've had the food on more than one tipsy occasion, but unless I've not eaten all day, I will try to just  have drinks here and then head to Joe's New York Pizza a couple doors down for dinner as the food here is hit or miss. I am a big fan of the nachos, and their queso dip, but the entrees in my experience aren't all that great. 
This is definitely a nice place for a happy hour in the summer as they have a nice big patio for those long summer nights, and it is good people watching location for both tourists and locals alike.
