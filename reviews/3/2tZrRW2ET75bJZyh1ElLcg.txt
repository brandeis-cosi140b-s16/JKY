Hubby and I went here and used our Entertainment coupon. We checked out the reviews first and it seemed about 50/50 . Not scared. We arrived and it was quiet for a Friday night in Tempe. Still not scared. We order a beer each and get down to checking out the menu. I order the steak fajitas and hubby gets the carne asada penasco. My fajitas were delicious, lots of peppers and onions crisped nicely. The steak was flavorful and juicy. Hubby liked his enchilada, I got a few bites, it was delish!  Love the sauce. He said his steak was a little limey, wasn't crazy about it.  
       There was a salsa dance class going on that looked fun. It seemed to be getting a little busier too. Our tab was  $25 for 2 dinners (we had coupon worth $12)  and 2 beers . Okay I guess. I gave it 3 stars for the server. Normally I'm real forgiving. I waited tables for more than 15 years and know how it feels on that end. But we were easy customers, no problems or special orders. She barely looked at us and when she brought our change , she just dropped it off and left. 
       We didn't see the owners, we heard they're cool. Will look for them next time, if we go again.
