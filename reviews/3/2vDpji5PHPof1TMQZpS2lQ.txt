Was in Phoenix and decided to stop off at Filiberto for a quick lunch before I had to catch a flight home. 

I would best describe Filiberto's as a fast food joint a set up from Taco Bell. Basically it's a fast food joint with lots of mexican fast food items such as Burritos, Tacos, and Tortas. Prices here are a bit more than you would expect from a fast food joint and you're looking around $4 - $8 depending upon what you order. 

I decided to go with the Carne Asada Tortas Combo. I was hoping to be in an out but the food took a long time to cook. I probably waited about 10 minutes before the food came out. The Tortas was a good size and was a mix of good and bad. The Carne Asada had good flavoring but was tough and the guacamole while good was layered on there thick. It was to the point where I got a guacamole torta with some carne asada topping to it. The fries here - well frozen Costco fries. 

As to ratings, Filiberto is ok. It fills a need and nothing more. Overall you can do better but if in a jam and looking for someplace, will work. 3 Star rating for Filiberto's.
