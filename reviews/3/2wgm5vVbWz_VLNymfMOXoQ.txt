My family and I have been patrons of Richardson's & the Rokerij for over 10 years. The service has always been so so, with condescending waiters, etc. but the food usually made up for the bad service. I mean we even returned several times after my sister found a rubber band in her pasta Heidi and still had to pay for the dish. However, our past few experiences have been sub-par. Service is worse than ever and the food does not make up for it anymore. It is either too spicy or severely overcooked and dry. It will be a while before we return!!
