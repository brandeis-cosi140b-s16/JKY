This is my go to fast food mexican joint when I'm in the mood for something more authentic than Taco Bell. My only gripe about this place is that they have the standard refried beans from a can that most Mexican restaurants have. I had some authentic, homemade refried beans once and now I'm totally spoiled. Anything else just leaves me disappointed.
