My husband and I didn't want to venture far on Friday evening for happy  hour, so we decided to check out Z Tejas' specials. We sat at the bar and were helped by two very nice bartenders. During happy hour, drinks are $1 off and appetizers are half price.

Again the Tejas trio and cornbread did not disappoint. If we had stopped there, this would probably have garnered four stars from me as a happy hour destination. However, we also tried the smoked chicken jumbo quesadilla which was very disappointing. While the green peppers were a nice touch, the chicken was much too smokey and there was practically no cheese in the quesadilla. There was just something that was totally off about this dish. On our way back home, we decided that on future Z Tejas happy hour outings, we are completely sticking to drinks and the Tejas trio.

For six beers, 1 margarita, and 2 appetizers, our bill was $34 so we were pleasantly happy. Happy hour only runs until 6:30 and I noticed that at 5:45 or so, the bar area was completely full, so make sure to get there early to get a seat.
