I'm a big fan of Mad Mex so why the 3 stars, I guess this is my least favorite location.  I really enjoy the Robinson and McKnight Road locations as I always feel the service and quality of food is excellent.  

My disappointment from the Greentree location is the food.  I always order some version of an item that contains the Southwestern sauce b/c I love that stuff - whether it's the Wingo-rito, Tofu Wrapture or Los Wingos wrap - I'll order it!  

Typically I order a side of the Southwestern sauce because like I said I LOVE the stuff and it's nice to dip the wrap or fries in it for an extra kick.  Typically when I've order one of my Southwestern sauce smothered wraps/burritos at Robinson and McKnight they douse enough of the sauce on the wrap that I only need to use the sauce on the side for my fries.  The Greentree wrap was so dry and had itty bitty drops of the sauce in the wrap so I'm glad I asked for a side of the sauce.

Also the waffle fries which typically come out hot, fresh and delish, were all welded together that I had to peel each one off the other.  It just seems that the times I've gone to the Greentree location the food isn't as well prepared as the Robinson and North Hills locations.
