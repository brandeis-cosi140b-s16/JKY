Normally, I enjoy the food Rubio's a lot more. This location doesn't seem quite the same as the others. The staff is nice enough, but I don't know if they're trying to cut costs more here or what. 

My son's quesadilla had about 1/2 the amount of cheese it normally does. So, when you're making something that has only TWO ingredients, it is pretty easy to tell when they're skimping. Maybe it was just an off day. 

The fish taco that I had tasted really good, but the corn tortilla was not as soft as it usually is - you know how cold or old tortillas fall apart when you try to wrap them? It was like that, but it didn't taste bad, so maybe it had been sitting out a bit and had dried out a little.

My tortilla soup came in a bowl that was about 2/3 full, which I thought was a little weird. Later, when I was driving home, I realized what was missing... no tortilla strips. I probably should have said something about the omission, but it had been a really long day and I didn't even think about it until after we left. I'll probably be back since this location is pretty convenient when we are running errands on the weekend, but there is another location on my way home that I prefer.
