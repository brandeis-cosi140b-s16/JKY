I met a friend here for drinks and an early dinner.  It was not the typical Mexican d√©cor, a little more sophisticated with dark wood paneling and low lighting in the bar area.  Service was standard.  The best part was the guacamole made table side, we ordered it TWICE it was that good!  I typically don't prefer "chain" type restaurants...so...my opinion is: "Glad I went, but been there, done that, no need to go back"

I would like to rank the restaurant with 2 stars for being just another "me too" but I will give it 3 stars just for the guacamole - BTW - we had him make it extra spicy!
