heard a lot about this mexican restaurant so decided to check it out, service was extremely slowwwwww I waited almost 45 minutes for 2 tostadas and a taco salad, need a system to separate pick up from dine in, the food was okay nothing out of the extraordinary.  I will go back to try the breakfast burritos and see if it is better. location hard to find but it is great historic area if you want to see the real phoenix.
