A nice change from the usual Mexican joints I'm used to in Atlanta, but nothing great by itself. A small description of the Mexican named dishes would be a nice touch for those not in the know. 

The salsa is a nice, but unique change from the usual pureed tomatoes served on the east coast, and with refried beans to boot. The chips are different also, with thicker chips help to mound up salsas, beans, and the queso fundito.

The fish tacos are decent, but nothing to write home about being overly dry, but not totally without flavor. I am used to an aioli or some sort of jalapeno mayo to help moisten the fish, so I just used the salsa instead. Maybe it's just how this place does tacos pescado??? 

All-in-all I think I would give this place another chance with another set of dishes, so there might be another update in the near future.
