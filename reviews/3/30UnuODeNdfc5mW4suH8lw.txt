Came here for a quick snack on a break from work. We shared a chorizo pizza and the nachos with chicken. The service was great and pretty quick. My only let down was that the nachos seemed to have that cheap nacho cheese on them. The chorizo pizza wasn't really my thing either. I'll definitely go back and try something else as the atmosphere and service were very good.
