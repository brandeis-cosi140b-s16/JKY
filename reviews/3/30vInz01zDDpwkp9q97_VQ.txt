It seems like every time I turn around at Stonecrest, there is another place that I haven't eaten. Maybe they just keep closing and opening in the same location and I can't remember. Or maybe after turning around so many times I'm dizzy and can't recall. I really don't know - sometimes I feel like there are corners of this center where I get lost.

Whatever the case, this time, we stopped at Qdoba because we didn't recall eating there, and felt like something a little different. Of course, it's different for Stonecrest options, since we couldn't recall eating there, but it's just like every other Qdoba. Nothing much special about it.

Shuffle in as the line gets long at times, stare at the menu and try to figure out what you want, look over the glass and determine what you want on the burrito (or whatever option you prefer). Pay.

What I really don't get - while I appreciate the counter and all - is why can't they make it so you can see what's happening back there a little better? I don't want to sneeze in the beans or anything, but I'm a tall person, and there are times I can't figure out what I want on my quesadilla. Plus, I like to watch. Er, look.

Think Subway - I want to see what's going on. I like that the lids keep it warm and all, but No sense putting it out in front if you can't see what's going on you know. Give me a little more room is all.

The good thing is that service is generally nice enough - except they keep hiding something behind those lids. I'll figure it out one day.
