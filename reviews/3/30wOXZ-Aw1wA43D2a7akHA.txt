I like this place because it's a super short walk from where I live, but I wouldn't recommend it as a place to go if you would have to drive more than a few minutes. My boyfriend & I have only been going in for lunch where it's been pretty empty & quiet.

The place is pretty nice inside for a strip mall restaurant and has a small outdoor patio with an indoor/outdoor bar and window walls that open up. There are a few tv's for watching games. The menu is standard tex mex & delivers a good meal, if not especially exciting. I've had:

- Quesadilla: These things are massive, as in an entire pizza pan massive. The cheese is a little on the rubbery side, and there isn't much filling other than cheese. 
- Queso Dip: Better than nacho cheese but not as good as queso fundido. It's fine for dipping.
- Salad: Fresh fillings & decently sized. 
- Cheese Enchiladas: Pretty okay. The sauce is average, but tastes really amazing if you're looking for a greasy alcohol absorbing meal. 
- Rice: Average. Pretty much tastes like grocery store rice.
