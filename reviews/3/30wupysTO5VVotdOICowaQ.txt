3 of us came in here for dinner based on the good reviews on Yelp. We ended up splitting the grande platter. 2 tacos, 2 tostados (mini taco salads really very large) 2 enchiladas, 2 chili rennos, 2 taquitos, rice and beans.  The best things were the tostados and tacos the rest was just OK,  we couldn't finish it it was so big.  It was only $18  for all that, what a great deal!!!  nice inside, very clean and the waitress was great.  not the best but for the price we will be back for sure.
