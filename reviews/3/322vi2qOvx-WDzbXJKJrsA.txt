While I've tried various Mexican restaurants around the valley and in parts of California, there seems to be a distinct flavor with these smaller locations that just makes the food extremely flavorful. 
I'm not sure if it's the years and years and years and years of grease and food residue or just a good cook but whatever it is it makes the food perfect at 2 in the morning when your heading back home from a night out with friends. 
I normally order their Carne Asada Burrito which is always a crowd pleaser but their other options are also good. I've also had their Torta de Milanesa(breaded chicken) and their tacos which always seem to hit the spot. 
The location isn't great and the place looks run down oh and you get the occasional homeless person asking for a taco but if you just use the drive thru then you'll be fine. 
Overall, good flavor and great salsa!
(Almost forgot, they only take cash no debit)
