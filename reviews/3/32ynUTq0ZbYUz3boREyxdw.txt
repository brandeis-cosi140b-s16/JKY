Not much to look at, probably was a Wendy's or some other fast food restaurant in a former life.  The menu features lots of choices of burritos, tacos and combination plates.  Order from the not so flattering pictoral menu posted above the counter.

All the food is prepared fresh so grab some chips and salsa (three varieties) while you wait for your order to be called. Ours took about 10 minutes.  

Food is fresh, hot and inexpensive. Lunch for the three of us was just under $20 total. I had a combination plate with a shredded chicken burrito, crispy chicken taco and it came with rice and beans -tons of food-only $6.99.

Lots of everyday people stopping in for lunch. Decent and filling chow.
