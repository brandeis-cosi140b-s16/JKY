Roberto's on Boulder is very good 'cheap' food.  For those of you that have never been to a Roberto's, don't expect dim lighting and fresh flowers...it's a fast-food Mexican joint for Pete's sake! :)  
I don't recommend being in a rush if going through the drive-thru...it should really be classified as "semi-fast food"...lol.
Tacos+rice+beans= snoopy dance by me.
