Came here for lunch today because I had a 25% off coupon.  The chips were good... salsa was kind of watery but ok.  Our service was good:).  The food was fine... not the best Mexican I have ever had, but don't think this place even tries to accomplish that.  They want people to come and drink and hang out... maybe have some food.  I paid $6 for my lunch thanks to that coupon I had so I am not going to complain :).
