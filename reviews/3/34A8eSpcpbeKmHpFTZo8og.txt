carna Asada fries! yep if you have not tried it take some time one day to enjoy the late night Mexican food nearest you.  
Carna, Asada, 
-take a large plate of fries, dump thin slices of beef, sour cream, cheese, guacamole, salsa and onions, bam!  


Another Filabertos Mexican restaurant,  seems to be kept clean.  As all the other location find this place 24 hours a day look for the bright yellow sign.


I go here for Weds Dollar bean burrito, add cheese for $80 or so.
