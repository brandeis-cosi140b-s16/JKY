I'm a semi-frequent visitor to Vegas.  Mexican food is my favorite, so I went online to check out reviews and decided to try Ricardo's.  There was a crowd out front, so I almost didn't go in, since I was traveling for business and was dining by myself.  I thought the host of people outisde indicated a queue inside for a table, but it turns out that the 'queue'  was just smokers.  Having to walk through a cloud of smoke was a bit of a turn-off, but tt is what it is and I went inside.  I was seated immediately.  They have an extensive menu.  I was waited on immediately for my beverage order.  I order a marquarita and ice water.  Margarita was very good.  They offer a small, medium and large.  Other reviews commented that their chips, beans and salsa were good.  Their chips come with a guac dip, tomato salsa and beans.  The guac dip and beans were great, but the tomato salsa was very bland; there was no flavor.  The chicken enchilada was very good in flavor.  The chicken could have been cut up a bit more; it was in big chunks.  The carnitas taco was very good.  The rice was full of vegetables - corn, which is typical for Mexican food, but it also had peas, carrots, green beans and lima beans.  I've never had Mexican rice with these vegetables in themn before and did not care for it at all.  The service was good up to the point of getting my check.  It seemed to take forever and I ended up having to ask for it.  I put a credit card in the check holder and after waiting a lengthy time, was presented with a handheld credit card machine where I had to run my own card and punch in my own tip amount and print out my own receipts.  I've utlized self-service tablets at restaurants before, but this felt like I was doing the waiter's job as this was not a true self-service tablet.  The decor and ambience of the restaurant was good.
