GREAT OLD TOWN GLENDALE DINER. Don't miss the live music for an awesome VFW-like, all-Formica, orange-vinyl dining experience. All that's missing are the brown-striped plates. This is _real_ Glendale, no corporate paint color standards and standard-issue banded-collar button downs, just old school eats and smiles.

--Live music Sundays 10:30 to 12:30; bossa, blues, honky tonk and diner rock
--teeming with regulars; staff makes you feel like family
--service prompt and courteous. My heart would have exploded from caffeine overdose had I taken them up on all the refill offers.
--this is the essence of non-corporate bliss in a local joint. 
--if you like the Tee Pee, you'll love this place.
--Mexican undertones in fajitas, chorizo skillet and posole
--all American favorites too. Cream of mushroom-based gravy is thick as can be.
--dishes that could look good did look good (I'm giving a pass for my gravy-covered eggs and hash -- it LOOKED gross, but tasted great)
--great Sunday breakfast spot
--right in the middle of antique shop nirvana
