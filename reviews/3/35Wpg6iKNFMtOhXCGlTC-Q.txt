I've been going to this place off and on for over a decade.  The food is good, but it's really pricey.  Far too expensive for a place that uses plastic utensils.

Also, they give you about 5 tortilla chips.  For some reason they are very stingy with chips.  You can order multiple meals to go and you're given about a ziploc sandwich bag's worth of chips.  The small bag.

I'd give the place a higher rating if they had better prices and more chips.
