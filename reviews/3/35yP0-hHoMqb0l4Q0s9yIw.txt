I have to say that after reading a few reviews of Maria's I was interested in tasting their food. The general consensus is just about on the money. From my experience, I am going to have to rate Maria's as average. 
    The Atmosphere -- After reading a previous critic review, I can see that it indeed, was formerly an Arthur Treachers, lamp post signage and all. Walking in, you're greeted with bright colors, and faux leather lined booths. I have to say, as a word of warning, be careful not to sit too fast, as the benches are a bit soggy and you'll drop with a thump onto the wood below. 
    The Menu -- The one thing that I can really note about this menu is that it's big. Really big. There's a lot on it, with all of the food that non-spanish people have come to expect from Mexican food. Everything involves cheese, sour cream, or some kind of sauce. Not that it's bad, in fact it's exactly what most people have come to expect from Mexican.
