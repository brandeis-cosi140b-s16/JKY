I am surprised at the range of reviews of this place. It seems like everyone either loves it or hates it. Well, I am taking the middle of the road on Willy & Jose's. It is OK. Sometimes worse or better than others. They have moved locations inside Sam's Town, and neither of them are that impressive. The new location is cute and does have an outside patio which is in Sam's Town giant covered courtyard. This way you can sit outside even in the rain.

The food is pretty good. It is also very large. If you like large portions this is a good place to eat, but you can easily share if you want. The chips and salsa are pretty good and plentiful. It is possible to fill yourself up on the chips, so be careful. I have had many of the dishes here and they're pretty good. But, if you are expecting authentic Mexican, go elsewhere. The tacos, burritos and re-fried beans are good enough, but the Spanish Rice seems to always miss it. It looks the part, but never has any real spice to it.

The service is hit or miss. I have been there when the server is around whenever you need them and when you can never find one. Don't look for great service here. I think you will be disappointed. I have also never gotten a worth wild margarita at Willy & Jose's. I know they have a bottomless margarita, if you ever get asked if you want another, but seriously, why bother. They really aren't worth the price of one.

The last issue I have is the price of all items. The prices are a l bit high for just ok food. Bring up the quality to match the price.
