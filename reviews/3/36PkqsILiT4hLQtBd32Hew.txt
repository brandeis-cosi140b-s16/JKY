The food is wonderful but the service was a little spotty on the patio. Told us it was going to be a 15 min wait and then they seated us in 3. That was a good start, but would have been upset if we had gone somewhere else in our rush to eat that day. 

Was there for happy hour and got some tacos, the quesadilla, and a bunch of drinks. The $3 HH house margarita is solid, although they may try and up-sell you into a "nicer" one. If I wasn't there during HH I would have probably listened, but hard to justify the $5 more for a normal one. 

One of our tacos got switched out for another one. No biggie, it was delicious anyways, but would have been great to have what I ordered. 

Location on the patio is really nice. I don't know if I would ever want to sit inside unless it was summer.
