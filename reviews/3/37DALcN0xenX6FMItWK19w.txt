Like Chipotle, Baja Fresh is one of my top fast food picks. The food is quality (and about as "healthy" as fast food can get). 

This location, however, has a lot going against it. The place is in a very high traffic part of Scottsdale. It's in a very small spot that shares a tiny shopping center with a Starbucks. There's virtually no parking, so if you go during a busy time, you're probably going to have to drive out and around, then park down the street. Also there is very little room for the lunch rush line, so everyone gets very uncomfortably close trying to stay inside so they're in the air conditioning. There's also no real place to wait for food, so if all the tables are taken you end up standing in a lot of people's way. 

If you're going to pick up food from here you should order ahead, or go during the off hours.
