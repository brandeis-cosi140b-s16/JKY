It's a great little Mexican place in the area, which is great because there are not many options close. There food seems more like fast Mexican food (like Romeros and places like that) but more quality! I have tried a lot of different items from here and they all are very good. The only thing I was very disappointed in was the chile rellenos. This is one of my favorite Mexican dishes but it was basically wrapped in a fried egg. The soppapillas are very delicious! Hot and fresh with honey and powdered sugar. 

(Sorry for the spelling on the dishes, some might be incorrect)
