We have eaten here 3 times and been satisfied each time.  As other posts they certainly serve a good portion of food.   The guacamole is not as nasty as a couple of posts indicated.  The super nachos are excellent and enough for 3 people to share.  The rolled tacos are what you would expect.  Meat in a rolled, fried shell and topped with shredded cheese and guacamole.  We have ordered both these items each time here and have enjoyed them.  The chicken burritos have a slight bite to them.  The carne asada is good.  The service is polite, but slow.  At times there is a language barrier depending on the employee.
