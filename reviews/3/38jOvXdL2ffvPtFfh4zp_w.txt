The food was good but the service was horrible.  It's sad when you have to ask 3 different times to get a side of sour cream and 20 minutes for a drink.  The wait staff dropped off my food and vanished.  Not sure if I was at a magic show or a restaurant.  The only thing I know for sure is that I will not be going back to this place.
