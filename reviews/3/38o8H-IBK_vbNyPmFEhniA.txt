I went with the "famous sliders", which were pretty decent.  Not high quality burgers, but not bad.  Chips and salsa were ok, and the fries weren't bad.  Their Chuy's brand barbecue sauce was surprisingly good - probably good enough to compete with the national brands (assuming it isn't already a re-label of an existing brand).

I don't think I'd make a special trip out there, but I'd probably consider stopping in again if the opportunity arose.
