I haven't eaten here yet, but my cousin and aunt have eaten here about 3 or 4 times now.  My cousin said it's better than Roberto's, which is pretty good; it's oddly hard to find really good mexican food here.  I'm going to try this place this weekend, and I'll write a more in-depth review at that time.  
From what I've heard, the make-your-own burrito is the bees knees, it's $6 for a huge burrito, that is made kind of Subway style, you tell them exactly what you want on it (and they don't charge you extra for guacamole or sour cream!!).  After my cousin ordered this a couple of times, the next time he came in, the guy there (who he said was really nice) knew his order and started making it before he ordered, just confirming it as he was making it.   It's truly a family owned business, a plus in my book.  Support local businesses!
