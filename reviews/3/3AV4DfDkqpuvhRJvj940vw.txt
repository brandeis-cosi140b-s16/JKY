Their salsa is either really tasty or I was just really hungry when I came here for lunch (the traditional tomato salsa, not the green tomatillo salsa, which is kind of blah tasting).  Had the Ono taco and the ahi taco.  The Ono was quite good, the ahi looked like it had seen better days.

Prices are reasonable, but service was slow.
