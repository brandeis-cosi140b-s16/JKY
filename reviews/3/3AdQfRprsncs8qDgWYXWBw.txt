The place is pretty cool I've wanted to check this place out for 10 years there red chili sucks I wouldn't walk across the street if they let me it for free for life! There green ain't bad but there chilis more like gravy I like there chimi special on Monday the service is good there menus pretty  big I'll come back it has a vibe I like and I'm sure there's other stuff on the menu that's good seen a few thing I'd like to try not to many Mexican spots impress me nothing like my g maws cooking when it comes to chili.
