Full Disclosure: I am rating this place without trying any of their drinks.  The drink menu looked great, we did not get anything.

The highlight of our meal was the queso dip.  I liked this queso as much as any I have had in Charlotte. I almost licked the bottom of the plate clean.  For dinner the burrito was good, not great, as it was 90% rice.

Another plus was the servers, though.  Very friendly and on top of everything.

I would return here, but not sure if I would go out of my way to do so.
