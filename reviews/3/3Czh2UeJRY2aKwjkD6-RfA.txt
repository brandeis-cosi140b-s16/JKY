So Chipotle is friendly, has all these body- and earth-friendly ingredients and whatnot, but you know, I just do not get them.  The restaurants are not all that friendly (talking the physical location, not the service at this point).  There are usually something like three chairs.  The menu is decent enough, and you get a reasonable portion size, but you end up paying for their "food with integrity" in a fast food setting without the service (I am talking about the service here).

It is not that they are not friendly, but it is not like you get table service or anything, so if you are going to pay more than fast food prices, it would be nice to get more than fast food service, right?

The place looks nice, and they give you what the promise (so far as I can tell - I did not actually take a Chipotle farm tour or anything to know any better), but there are just not that many options, and for this sort of price, I would rather have "real" food in a "real" restaurant.  But that may just be me - lots of folks seem to like them, and they are better than some options out there.
