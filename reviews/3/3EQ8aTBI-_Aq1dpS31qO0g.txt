I like going here for dinner & taking the night off of cooking.  They do good Tex-mex style plates.  The restaurant over over-lit  (too bright and uninviting) so we sit at the bar.  Service has been okay,  sometimes you gotta just hollar when ya need something,  and that's just another perk of eating at the bar.
