I went to Tortas Paquime for lunch and I was pleasantly surprised to find that their food is borderline authentic. I ordered the Tacos de Ribeye plate and the tacos were small, the meat was mostly fat, and the red and green salsas available were not spicy at all. 

My highlight of the trip was the agua de limon, it was delicious! It tasted just like the agua de limon I used to drink in Mexico at similar torta and taco establishments.
