The location of this restaurant is somewhat questionable, but if you can get past that and managed to find a parking spot in this 15 cars parking lot and you have been somewhat intoxicated, then maybe you'll find Pepes Tacos to be A-OK. 

Nothing really jumps out at you at Pepe's, which may actually be a good thing.  Don't expect the food to be spectacular, but neither is the food below average.  The lengua tacos are not overcooked but a bit bland. 

I would actually recommend the al pastor.  But my favorite about Pepes is that your order comes with chips and beans.  The beans are half smashed and half whole, and they taste delicious.  Pepes' chips are also surprisingly fresh.  

I would come back for the chips and beans, but who comes back for that? ...
