Having lived in Texas, we are continually on the hunt for great Mexican food. Sadly, we will have to continue hunting. All 3 of us had their fajitas, and we were all dissapointed. Both the chicken and beef were bland, the onions and green peppers over cooked with strong butter flavor, and the beans were not "tasty". Why the 3 stars then? Well, they are doing the tortilla shells correctly. Freshly made, and very good. Its a start. And their chips were great, and service prompt and friendly. Hopefully they improve everything else...(along with their marg prices. $14 for a reg size. Really?)
