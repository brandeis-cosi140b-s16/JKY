Decently good Mexicanesque food. I've enjoyed pretty much everything I've gotten here, except for the fish tacos. Right now, the carne picado is my favorite dish -- full of jalape√±os and juicy marinated meat. In addition, their salsa is tasty and the chips are nice and light.

It's near my house and always good. The dining room is cozy and well taken care of. When I'd rather just pick up dinner for the family, they have a handy pick up window out back. I really can't complain.
