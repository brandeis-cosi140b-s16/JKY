The food is good enough.  A couple things are a little more creative than Chipotle would offer.  The beans and rice are nothing to write home about and unfortunately, they give you a lot of that..  The fruit-based salsas are nice.  There is a the sweet green chili sauce they do that is nice, but probably high in sugar for an entree.  If you get a drink, you might easily drop $10.  You can get better food for that at a sit-down Mexican place..
