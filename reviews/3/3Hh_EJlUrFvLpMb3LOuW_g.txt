Nothing fancy, but generally filling and not bad. Tonight's Arroz con pollo provided a decent, filling, tasty and inexpensive meal.  The dining area was (and is usually) clean, and the men's room is adequate, seems sanitary and has always been stocked with the necessities.  Several specials a week make the place even more extraordinarily affordable than it already is.  I've certainly experienced better - but considering every meal is a value at Chico's, it's A-OK.
