It's more than Mexican,  so that is a bit confusing to the brand.  I like that they serve grass fed beef.  I think they could kick it up a notch. They have a decent food concept here but may not be executing to their potential. Something just isn't right about the space. Get some design help. My steak salad was good,  but not great. Skip the gorgonzola cheese. Goat cheese is a better ingredient for that salad.
