According to my friend I met here for dinner last night, this cozy little Mexican 'cantina' has been around forever, but this was my first time. The place was pretty quiet when we got there around 6 and although there were lots of open tables, they sat us by a family of 6 with little kids who were not too happy to be there. We figured, oh well, they looked like they were almost done. But wouldn't you know, they sat another table right by us with another family with a baby. I just can't figure out why they do that??? 
However, the food is good greasy, cheesy type Mexican. I had the chicken enchiladas (which would have been better if they had more enchilada sauce and less sour cream.) My friends had the Mexican pizza, which they pronounced as delicious. Service was friendly and efficient. But the best part of the evening was when I saw the hostess taking a big cup of ice water outside to a person who was waiting at the bus stop in front. That simple gesture made my evening!
