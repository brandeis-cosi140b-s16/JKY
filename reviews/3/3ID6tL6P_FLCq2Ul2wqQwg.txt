Not the best filbertos, but not the worst. I came here because I was in the area, starving, and wanted to sit down somewhere to eat.  I got what I l always get, the #3 (2 shredded beef tacos, beans, rice and a drink.)

Not a bad experience, just blah.  There was a TV that was blaring loud with some mexican kids show on, and there was a weird crowd in here.  Food was decent, but I think I like my regular Filberto's better.
