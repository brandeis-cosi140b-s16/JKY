Delicious tacos, friendly service. The cashier and chef were joking around the whole time, they seemed to really enjoy themselves. The tacos themselves were great, plenty of filling and sauce, they weren't dry at all. Price was a little on the high side, I easily spent $20 for 2 people, though that could have just been my aching stomach.
