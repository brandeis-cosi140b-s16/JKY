Any night that includes Chronic Tacos is sure to result in blacking out.  I just can't escape their reverse Chronic Hour specials.  

$1 Landsharks (used to be Tecate, I actually prefer the Landshark though)
$2 Jager Bombs 
$3 Rockstar Vodka
$4 Long islands (?)
$5 Cabo Wabo shots

I don't exactly remember if that's quite right.  That whole blacking out thing.  All I ever remember is going up the ladder from $1-$5. . .then doing it again. . .then again. . .

Then waking up the next morning puking their horrible horrible food and swearing off drinking.  Until I recover and start drinking again.
