Wanted to try something in the Vegas area recommended by Guy and Diners Drive in's and Dives...well this place was a dive alright, we couldn't even find the place after 3 drive by's..no signage, nothing in this strip mall!  Great array of international Flavors in small street sized tacos.  We had the plantains and black beans for an appetizer, yum, crispy and beans were flavorful and a bit sweet.  I had the Bombay, chicken in an Indian curry, good Flavors, i think mine was missing the chutney, because all I got was chicken in a curry sauce, nonetheless was flavorful, yet one dimensional, could have used that chutney.  Also had the pescador, a fish taco, a bit bland, but in a red cabbage slaw, white sauce and guacamole, the guacamole was a bit brown, I think it was a bit old - not memorable, but we come from San Diego, some of the best fish tacos anywhere!  Hubby had the shanghai and texano, he loved them both.  Good Flavors for a hole in the wall, right across the street from UNLV
