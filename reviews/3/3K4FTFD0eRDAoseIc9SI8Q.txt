Came here with my husband on a Friday morning 4/4/14 
The place was easy to find from the strip ,love the Mexican feel and look.  it was pretty empty fast service and very friendly waiter he was really attentive to what we needed. the bean dip and salsa are really good I shared a tostada de camaron with my husband that was delish, i got a plate of camarones a la diabla a good amount of spicy if you dont eat spicy food i dont recommend My husband got caldo de camaron he loved it i had a taste very flavorful . We also got hand made tortillas that were great reminded me of my grandmas cooking i def recommend but is a little pricey but for the great service and food its a steal
