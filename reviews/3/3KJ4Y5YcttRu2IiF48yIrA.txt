This place has good food. Their lack of reservations is silly.  On the weekends they tell you to come and dine with no wait. When you arrive you end up waiting over twenty minutes.   The atmosphere leaves tons to be desired. The walls are adorned with xerox copied photos of the beach. They all say "courtesy of the UPS Store."  The tables are crammed together. So much so that if you drop your silverware you make intimate friends with the table next to you. The smoking patio must go immediately if they are to survive. Each time a server opens the door smoke and ashes waft into the main seating area. This is not a bar with dollar tacos. Their  food is actually good. I recommend the enchiladas. As such they need to curb this bar type smokers patio.
