it was oooo-kaaaaay.

the service was generally stinky and unsmiley.

the food was supah tasty but supah salty and all of the tortilla skins (both fried or steamed) were really thick.

the decor was a little eccentric for my tastes, with crosses on the bar, horns hanging from the ceiling, and goth black menus with pink writing.

but it had all of the right ingredients for a hump day meal out - cocktails, filling food, and air-conditioning - and for all those things, i am thankful!
