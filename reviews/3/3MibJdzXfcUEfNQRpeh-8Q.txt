Came here fairly late at night the Sunday before Labor Day. It took a while to get my party of 5 noticed and seated. The two servers seemed a little stressed out despite the place not even being half full.

Two trays of free chips & salsa came promptly. We ordered the bucket of Mexican beer, which was the Sunday special. I chose the chicken flautas appetizer since I wasn't too hungry. The food didn't take too long to come out, but I could tell that it had been ready for awhile.

The flautas weren't as crispy as I would have liked, but tasted ok. The overall consensus was that the food was alright, but the service was slow.
