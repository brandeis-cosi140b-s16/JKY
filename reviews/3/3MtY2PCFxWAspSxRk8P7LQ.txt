After spending the summer in Mexico City (the actual city not the restaurant) I was craving real Mexican food and after reading all these reviews couldn't wait to go here. Unfortunately I was a bit disappointed.

Pros: VERY fresh foods. The tortilla chips come straight from the fryer still hot and if you get the guacamole (which i highly recommend!) the waiter comes and grinds all the ingredients in front of you in a stone mill. Delicious!

Cons: the main course was mediocre. Perhaps I'm spoiled after having such incredible mexican food, but the tacos fell short of my expectations. I ordered the taco combo (barbacoa and al pastor) and got food that was on the blander side... I guess more authentic than any other place I've been in Pittsburgh but surely not impressive.
