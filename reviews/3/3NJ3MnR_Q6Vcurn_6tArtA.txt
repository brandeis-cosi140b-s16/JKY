I really wasn't expecting this place to be spectacular because 90% of the "Mexican" restaurants in this town serve the same stuff the same way for the same price.  This place was no exception.  You get a decent plate of food complete with rice and re-fried beans for under $10.  The same ole' tacos, burritos, etc. you would find at just about any other place.  Nothing special to be found here.

I did enjoy the serve yourself chip and salsa bar.  The chips were good and the salsas were good as well.  I also liked that the staff was very friendly and the food was ready in under 5 minutes.  They have it all down pretty good for the 12:00 "lunch rush" of which I was a part.  My coworkers and I were out of there in under an hour.

I ordered the chile rellenos.  For some reason they felt the need to put some type of thick breading over the chillies.  This is no bueno.  However, after picking off the breading the chillies were quite good.  Spicy and full of cheese just the way I like them.  The re-fried beans and rice that came with the meal were just ok.
