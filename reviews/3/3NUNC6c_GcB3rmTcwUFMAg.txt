It was okay.  The chicken was tasty.

Service was WAY too slow, and the guy at the register didn't even give me a number which didn't help at all.  I remember coming here in the drive-thru a few years ago and it taking a long time then as well.  The taste is good here, but not distinctive, and for the money I can't say it's a great deal either.  For this kind of upper tier fast food Mexican (as compared to Taco Bell or Del Taco, which is lower tier), Rubio's blows it away completely

Doesn't suck at least.  Nice to try for a change every once in a while, but not my first choice when looking around for something to eat.
