This review is actually based on my second experience here at Lindo Michoacan. 

If you are looking for a smashing view of the entire Las Vegas valley and you don't want to spend $$$$$ at the Stratosphere, this is your best bet! However, if you are looking for fantastic Mexican food on top of a smashing view, I'm sorry to disappoint you but this is not your place. 

My first experience at Lindo was pretty good from what I recall but I had a seat right near the window and I was perhaps distracted by the scenery so much so I didn't pay much attention to the food.. 

The other night was "Take II" and we did NOT get the window seat. This fact led to more clarity on the entire dining experience. Service was nothing above standard and even slightly below if you want to get technical. 

My true love in Mexican food life is a good guacamole..mmm..I was pumped about this $9 FRESH guacamole until I piled some on my chip (which wasn't fresh) and took a bite. It was filled with unripe tomatoes, overdosed in lime juice and I swear I was picking the cilantro out of my teeth the rest of the night and possibly the next day (overboard). 

The food to follow was luke warm, massive and lacked flavor.. If you're wondering what I ordered, I think it was a #6? Chicken taco, enchilada, and something else that was "soo good" I can't remember, haha. 

All in all if what you want is a great view of the city and you're not looking for fantastic service or authentic Mexican food, Lindo is the place to be!
