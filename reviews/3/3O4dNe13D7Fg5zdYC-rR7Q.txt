C'mon! What's more important in a town where you can find a million Mexican eateries with enough salsa and chips and guacomole to pave your way along the newly installed light rail that runs just outside of this location?  If you answer that a refreshing cerveza or a ginormous top shelf margarita at a reasonable happy hour price allures you...you found a good location for a Monday evening yum yum.    Be assured that the free hor-d'ouvres are not gonna be returned if you plan to walk to some sort of resting place after you slurp away your painful week!  Wait!  Did I say that you arrived on a Monday to sing Karoake because your week just began?
