Since I had made reservations, we were seated promptly. Before we had the chance to look over the menu, we were asked about our drinks. I ordered a margarita and husband ordered a modelo. They were offering a free margarita with the special entrees. We both decided to get the specials, but there was a catch.. Since I ordered a margarita prior to ordering our meal, I couldn't include that as my free margarita, even though it was the same size. The waiter stated it was already in the computer as an order. But for the meal, it was delicious. Shrimp, crab rellano , with cilantro rice and black beans. Husband had the shrimp and chicken suiza. Yummy. And 3 margaritas, alittle watered down but good.
