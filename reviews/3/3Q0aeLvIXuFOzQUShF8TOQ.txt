Went here yesterday for lunch, and a had pretty decent experience at Crazy Taco.  You should know this not the wow a date place, its much more of a solo Saturday lunch spot.

As previous reviews have stated, I was drawn in by the festive mural on the outside of the building.  Parking was a breeze, and upon entering, I was immediately greeted by a young lady who asked if I was dining in or placing a to-go order.  As the interior didn't feel to homey, I decided "to-go" it was going to be.

After perusing the menu for a minute, I ordered the California Carne Asada steak burrito.  My order was brought to in me in a styrofoam box, with hot (red) salsa.  Altogether, my order came to $9 and change.  

Upon getting my meal home, I was delightfully surprised at the bounty of cheese they dispensed over the top of the burrito.  Don't mistake this for a chipolte-esq burrito that you eat with your hands.  No sir, this was something you might order at On-the-Border and eat with a fork and knife and cut into slices.  

The overall presentation of the burrito was great, it was filled with fresh looking/tasting bell peppers, onions and steak.  It was accompanied by sour cream and and a bed of lettuce.  For me however, the steak was a little tough and the burrito was a little bland.  I felt like it could have used an additional seasoning, or another side item other than lettuce to make it "pop".   


Despite the fact that Crazy Taco didn't "WOW" me, I would definitely give it another shot.  I missed not having that chips and salsa which usually accompany any Mexican meal, therefore I'd also like to dine in as well.  I'll be back, but not after I try some of the other Mexican fare in the area.
