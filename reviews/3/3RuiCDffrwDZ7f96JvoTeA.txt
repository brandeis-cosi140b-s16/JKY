Because our server was so absolutely friendly and fantastic, I have to give this place 3 stars.  For food, however, I would give it a 2, and the only thing allowing me to go that high was my husband's Cochinita Pibil.  It was layered with flavors of sweet and savory and seemed very "Caribbean."  Delicious.  The green chili salsa and red salsa served with the "too" hard chips to start the meal were not good.  The green chile salsa tasted and appeared completely watered down...almost like tomatillos soaked in water...very thin and with no other flavors.  The red salsa was strictly one note...lacking that sweetness that should accompany anything "red."  We also ordered the guacamole which I think would have been good if they would have used salt and then thoroughly mixed it.  At one bite, the lime overpowered...the next bite the complete lack of lime left it boring.  The accompaniments to our dinner, refried pintos and rice, both lacked salt and seasoning.  At one point, I asked if they had any other red salsas, and the waiter brought us something quite divine.  Although it was "green," it tasted red, sweet and like ripe tomatoes....delicious.  I don't know why that wasn't served up right from the beginning.  I know this is a review based on few food choices, and I wouldn't normally do that, but we are just passing through, and I don't want other passersby to make our same mistakes.  I would look at the other reviews on Yelp and choose a menu item that is frequently reviewed and rated highly.
