I grew up around here... before there was the Pointe at South Mountain and any of the office suites that line baseline road there was orange groves and nestled within were cool old houses along with a Mexican restaurant called Juan Tanamera's.  In fact my dad's friend built his house there and I have pictures from the 70's of my dad helping to build this house.  My dad would bring my sister and I here for dinner often... the food was great and we always had a great time.  Once the Pointe was built they bought the Mexican restaurant and named it Aunt Chilada's.  Everything changed... the menu was different, the staff was different.  The only thing that remained the same was the structure of the building and the cool ponds that surrounded it which no longer have coy but sometimes an occasional duck.  I agree with the other reviewers of this place that the service is lack luster and the food is OK.  There is one thing I like here and that is the albondigas soup... small bite sized meatballs with veggies and a savory broth; they also put fideo noodles in it which makes it even better.  I do crave this soup and since it is very close to my work i often call in an order of it.  Every time I walk in to pick it up it always brings up fond memories from the past.
