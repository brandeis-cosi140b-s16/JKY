When stuck at the pricey resort up the hill this place is wonderful.  When out and about with the ability to drive around...meh.  It was reasonably priced with good drinks.  Being from Texas, I found out that the California/Baja influence on the Mexican food was definitely there.  Sour cream EVERYWHERE!  Their salsa was good, queso - HORRIBLE!  It was very crowded while we were there and it was a Thursday at lunch time!  This place also had too many tables crowded in one area.  You had the option to sit outside, but it was soooo freakin' hot I was not interested.  I could see how that might be nice at night though.  Crap shoot...
