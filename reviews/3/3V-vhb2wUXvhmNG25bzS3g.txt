My husband and I had a late-night itch for some Mexican food, so with the restaurant being so close to the freeway we decided to dine in.  Nice ambience.  Our main entrees were delicious (both got the corn tamal), however we were a little dissapointed that we had to ask the waitress for chips/salsa and for utensils after our entrees were given to us. Overall, the food was delicious - hopefully next time around our waitress and/or host will be a little more prepared.
