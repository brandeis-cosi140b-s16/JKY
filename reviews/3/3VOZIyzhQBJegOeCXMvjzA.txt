This is what they would call new Mexican cuisine if there was not a State and hatch chili laden style that already stole that name.

The industrial themed location is situated just off central in down town phoenix. If it were not the the green strip we might have missed it. There is a small lot in rear but it was full so be prepared to park on the street or even splurge at  meter.

The limited menu is written on some over head boards, you can get breakfast until 2pm which I will try on my next visit.
The menu consists of a few tacos and a dish that is like a enchilada pie.

The only veggie option were the tacos frescos $7. two medium tortillas wrapped around fresh jaimica and peppers, with a side of rice and beans. To my surprise the tacos were cold, no sauce, and uncooked. It was like a salad in a tortilla, it was fresh and healthy but I wanted more flavors. It is served with a small thimble of bland salsa.

It was a decent meal but for the price I can easily put a few raw veggies in a hand made tortilla.
