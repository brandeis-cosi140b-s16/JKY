Warning: your children may ask what the murals on the walls are, and you will probably not have an answer for them. To be honest, I'm not quite sure what to make of them; the abstract Mexican heritage design is certainly not my style, but who am I to judge what's beautiful. 

But do you know what are beautiful? Tacos. 

I'm a Southern California girl. When I'm hungry and short on time, my first restaurant instinct is naturally a taco shop. And trust me when I say--I know my tacos.
Since I was having a formal dinner not too long afterwards, I ordered a beef taco and enchilada plate combo with rice and beans. I wasn't too impressed with the salsa choices, nor the enchilada sauce, but everything hit the spot the way Mexican food always does. The rice and beans were standard tasting, but the lady behind the counter was super nice and patient as I searched the menu for my favorite dishes. 

My stomach was a happy can't-take-Mexican-food-out-of-my-life-even-on-vacation camper. The plate had no shot at survival.
