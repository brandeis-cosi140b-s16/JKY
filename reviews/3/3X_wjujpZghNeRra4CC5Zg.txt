Make no mistake, the Del Rey torta was tasty in its own right.

But with the hype built from Man vs. Food and other reviews it was bit of a letdown. 
The refried beans worked well in the torta but the other components just seemed like a big mess of meaty ingredients piled high.

Good if your looking to munch, not so much if your expecting a top-tier torta.

Mexican food in Cali has still been surprisingly better even though one could assume AZ is closer and home to the real deal. (Like the sign Los Reyes says, Real Authentic Mexico City Food)

They also serve huge drinks without alcohol....wat
Hopefully they acquire their beverage license soon.
