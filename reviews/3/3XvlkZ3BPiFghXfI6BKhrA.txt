Pasqual's is a decent tex-mex restaurant in the "lifestyle center" section of Hilldale mall.  I used to patronize the Pasqual's in Middleton, but that one closed a while back.  The food at the Middleton location was good but the service was hit-or-miss.  No surprise, it's the same way at the Hilldale location.  

The food is good.  The ingredients seem to be high-quality and everything I've tried has been tasty.  The chicken enchiladas are especially good.  Unfortunately, the service is lacking.  Me or members of my party have gotten wrong food on several occasions.  Usually it's something like getting chicken instead of beef in the enchiladas.   I'm sure they would be happy to fix it/offer to take it off the bill, but I'm not the type to complain about stuff like that (instead passive-aggressively writing angry Yelp reviews) so I guess I can't complain that I get the wrong food.  I would say that once out of every three trips, there is at least one aspect of someone's order that is wrong, which is far worse than any other restaurant I've regularly visited.

The price is right and I the decor is a nice change of pace from your standard tex-mex place.  The waitstaff is friendly and attentive, service is prompt and the food is (usually) hot.  There isn't much to complain about.

If you're looking for authentic Mexican, skip this place.  But if you're looking for good tex-mex and aren't shy about correcting your incorrect order, try out Pasqual's.
