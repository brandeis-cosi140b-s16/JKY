This is a pretty neat little Mexican restaurant.  They remodeled this year so I had been meaning to stop by and give them a try.  The setup is a little weird you order in the back left of the restaurant and have to wait at the little window for someone to take your order.  Then they give you a number and you hang out around back half till they call you.  I liked that they have lots of vegetarian choices ( for a mexican restaurant ) that are labeled on the menu, always nice.  They have a small patio outside which is pretty nice for the fall.

I found the food pretty good for a fast food mexican place.  I covered mine in the slightly spicy salsa that came with it and guacamole so my tostada and cheese enchiladas were pretty good. They didn't seem bland at all. I'll have to ask if they have hot salsa next time.
