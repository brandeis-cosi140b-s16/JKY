My family and I have been coming to this particular Ajo Al's location for as long as I can remember. It's always been a neighborhood staple to those who grew up in the area as it's conveniently located and the prices are really reasonable.

As I've grown older and taken more notice of things like quality of food and level of service, Ajo Al's has gone a bit down in how I'd rate the place. Don't get me wrong, every time I come I know exactly what I'm going to get, and so should you!

They overload you on chips and salsa which is awesome because I friggin' love chips and salsa, but beware of filling up too quickly. The service is always a bit lacking, sometimes slow, sometimes not the friendliest. The margaritas are decent, but they never put enough ice in them when you order it on the rocks. The food itself is average, I usually like the combo plate with a shredded beef taco and cheese enchilada or the fajitas with chicken and steak. Pollo Con Queso is the fan favorite here, I have friends who will swear by it every time they come.

Overall, it's a decent place to get Mexican food where the food is consistent, service is so-so, and you wont have to break the bank on your bill.
