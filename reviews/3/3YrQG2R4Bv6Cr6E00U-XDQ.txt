Lowering the rating for this place because they only have one item on the menu that tastes great.

I tried the carne asada fries. I thought it would amazing based on my love for the burrito. Boy was I wrong! 

Thick, greasy fries with no seasoning whatsoever, over-processed nacho cheese, mediocre guacamole and carne asada.

I would go back for the burrito, but it sucks that I only have one option there.
