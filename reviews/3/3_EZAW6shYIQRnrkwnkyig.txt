It's not horrible, but it's not great. It is close, which is why we always choose this place when we want Mexican food. The food is overpriced and a bit on the greasy side. We ordered take out, and since they were so busy they were very apologetic and threw in extra bean dip and chips & salsa for us. 

If another place pops up within a 3-5 mile radius from home, I will definitely check them out and see if I can replace Serrano's. But for now, they'll do.
