I thought the entrees were good, I had tamales and my buddy had the chicken enchiladas.  I tried both and thought they were both pretty solid.  My one complaint, and I REALLY hate this about Mexican/New Mexican spots, is that the rice and beans were totally an afterthought.  Blah, Blah, Blah, they frankly well...they sucked.  They were such a big minus they took away plenty from the main dishes.
Do tell them if you're not a spicy food fan, I like spicy but even I was sweatin' at the end of the meal (not that I minded but if you're more timid you will be in pain).  And they do not mention on the menu what's spicy and what's not from what I recall (nor was I asked my heat tolerance).
