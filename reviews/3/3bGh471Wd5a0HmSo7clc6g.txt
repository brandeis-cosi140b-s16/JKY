Came to lindo last night, we loved the view as we got there early enough to get window seating.
Service was good.
View was great.
Food was mediocre I had the Chile relleno (they put a tomato like sauce on it) doesn't seem like authentic Mexican food, hubby had tacos and they were ok.
I've been to lindo before years ago and now I realize why it's been so long since I've been back.
Cost of the not authentic dishes will make me likely not to return
