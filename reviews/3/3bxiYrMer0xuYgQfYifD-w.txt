Stopped in to 1900 on Saturday night at prime dinner time.  Luckily we were able to be seated quickly.  The standard chips and salsa were brought to our table.  The salsa was good with a nice kick.  The chips were just ok.

Sangria was on special ($6) that night so I ordered a glass.  It was well-made with fruit flavors that paired well with the wine.

I ordered the Huitlacoche Quesadilla which featured mexican cheese, corn truffle, roasted poblanos, and corn pico.  The positive is that they give you plenty of quesadilla.  I think there were 8 sizable slices.  I wish they had come with some sour cream or extra corn pico on the side.

Our service was fine but defintely not overly warm.
