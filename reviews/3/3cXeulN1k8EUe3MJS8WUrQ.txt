Love there appetizers the crab dip AWESOME!!! Been here twice salmon taco and bbq mahi is amazing..but the reason they received only three stars is the service slow and they continuously forgot to come by our table and there sides are not good at all..I think taco bells rice taste better and I haven't eaten there in over 5 years . But the main food is great and app. Try for yourself
