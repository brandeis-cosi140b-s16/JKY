I recommend the Foie Gras with truffle butter emulsion paired with any '94 Chateau LaTour...

Oh wait, wrong place. Writing from memory, will update if I go back (aka surprisingly hungover & don't feel like microwaving breakfast). This is lard plain & simple, done pretty much the right way, usually tasty but with a kick an hour or two later. Cheap, big, & much better if you're either drunk or only have $10 in your bank account and need fatty burritos to last the whole day. Surprising that they're in the far reaches of Ahwatukee, so (probably unfairly) an extra star for that. Also a plus that they have a drive through so you don't have to get out of your car. Chorizo or bacon breakfast burritos do the trick & are surprisingly cheap. A little too dry in my opinion, but doesn't matter so much for me, I always put lots of hot sauce on mexican anyway. Self pity & questioning certain life decisions come free of charge.
