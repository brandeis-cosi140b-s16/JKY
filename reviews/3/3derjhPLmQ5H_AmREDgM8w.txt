Well... Most of the people working there are very rude. They almost act like they're too good to be working there and to be helping you. There is one girl that works there that we love (Cesy?), but everyone else could care less.  Unfortunately Cesy isn't a permanent employee as she is in charge of a different branch which will be over on Silverado Ranch and Maryland Pkwy.

Aside from that, the food is consistent. My husband usually gets the chicken burrito and I usually get the chicken bowl.  Gladly the interaction with staff is minimal otherwise I wouldn't want to be there.  It's good for a quick bite and a somewhat healthy option.
