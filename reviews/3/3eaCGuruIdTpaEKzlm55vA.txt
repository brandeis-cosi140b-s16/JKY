The food is always good and fresh here. It's a little in the pricey side but the VIP card is nice. Buy 10 and get one free. 
The only issues I have is with the staff. I recently arrived at 10:27 (they open at 10:30 and the front door was open). The lady yelled, "we're not open yet", ran to the door and locked it as if I was trying to rob the place. I had to stand outside for 3 minutes till they opened. Then she came to the door and unlocked it and walked away never acknowledged to me that they were open and I can come in....
Service is hit and miss here sometimes....sigh...
