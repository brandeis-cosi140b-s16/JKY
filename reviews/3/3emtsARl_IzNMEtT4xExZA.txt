I'm sort of torn between 3 and 4.  Yes, it is a really great tasting burrito and the ingredients are much better to start with  But it is also one of the more expensive fast food burritos.  I've probably been to this location at least a dozen times and all but twice I pretty much get the same thing. Today the weather was beautiful and my haircut across the street was finished early so I sat on the patio for lunch.
