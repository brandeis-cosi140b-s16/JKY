My dinner yesterday at Garduños was off because someone was asleep or just didn't care about doing things correctly.  I ordered the Chile verde con machaca--the beef version of their chile.  The server brought me Chile verde which is their chile with chicken.  I was OK with that because I always order the machaca so this was good for a change.

In addition to that mixup, the dish came without charro beans and without the chopped onion and cilantro that they always serve with the chile.  I'm not sure if they were in a hurry or if the quality of staff is suffering.  The server could have made an error with my order, but the server didn't make the error with the plating.

Come on Garduños, get with it or you'll be off my radar.
