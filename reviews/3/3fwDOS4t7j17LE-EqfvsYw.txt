Just happened to spot this location on my way home last week so I made it a point to stop in.  It is in a re-purposed chain drugstore building that also house a Chase bank and a Verizon store.  I asked the fellow making my burrito how long they had been open and he said about 2 months.

The burrito was the same great overstuffed one I am used to.  My choice was carnitas, pinto beans, fajita veggies, green salsa, sour cream, cheese, lettuce.  That combination ends up being really runny so I was a mess by the time I was finished. :-)

The interior has high ceilings broken up by sound insulation and hanging lights.  Most of the seating is community tables, mostly high tops, with fixed seating done in industrial gray and plywood.  I wasn't impressed.

I like having a location close enough I can run over at lunch.  It wasn't real busy there and without much in the way of offices to drive their lunch business I hope they do well.  It certainly was not very busy when I was there.  Part of that may be due to the seemingly endless construction on that stretch of Northern.
