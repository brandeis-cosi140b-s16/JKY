Recommend: the Chimichangas, churros with chocolate or strawberry, the pollo fondidio, and the Mexican burrito, and get a Jarito. :)
Used to be the best place to go for Mexican food, but not so much anymore. We have been going for about a year, give or take a few months. 
After the renovations, they look prettier and have more room, but seem to now be lacking in the service and quality.
The menu has changed some since we first started going, which is great, I love some mix up and most of the new stuff we have tried isn't bad, but it's not great either. 
Food is okay, nothing compared to when we first started going though. It never comes out hot anymore. Our chips are completely gone by the time the food comes and the beans always have a film from where they have been sitting for a while waiting to come to the table. 
The servers are normally nice, but you will see them first thing when you sit down for your drink order, when they bring your drinks back they will want to take your food order, and if your not ready they will come back about 2 minutes later and you probably won't see them stop at your table again until they bring you the bill. It's very hard to get refills on drinks unless you flag them down-which can be hard to do!
We will probably keep going to La Unica when we don't feel like cooking, but it defiantly won't be the 1/week we used to go.
