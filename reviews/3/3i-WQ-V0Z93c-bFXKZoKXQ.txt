I will run for the border before I spend $6 for a taco, nacho, and Pepsi beverage. I remember the days, not so long past when Taco Bell was reasonably priced. It seems that fast food chains such as Taco Bell and Panda Express charge the same as the better local owned restaurant. With my Yelp application practically being a third arm, I am enlightened to local taco shops that are a far better value than Taco Bell. 

  If you are a Taco Bell fan, the service is okay with a capital "O." It is walking distance to the Walmart supercenter and Sam's Club. The crazy drivers will be an obstacle. During school season, high school kids will fill the place up.

  I never say never. But until Taco Bell lowers their prices, for the next 6 months I will only be supporting them through only nachos and cheese or soda purchases. And that is if there is no competition.
