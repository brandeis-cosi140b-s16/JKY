Caf√© Rio is definitely one of our regular spots (partly because we live walking distance to this location).  We love to get the pork burritos here - buyer beware that the pork is on the sweeter side.  That might turn off some people, but we really like it.

The ambience of this place is good.  Brand new and clean.  This particular location can get a bit crowded though, especially during dinner hours.  Whats especially great is that you could just walk over to the Golden Spoon next door for some dessert =).

One of my main things I like to get is their steak tostada.  It's pretty much a taco salad.  They put a hard flat taco shell at the bottom and pile it high with some rice, beans, a ton of lettuce, sour cream, cheese pico de gallo, and those little tortilla chip strips.  I think it's a good option if your kind of watching what you eat (just x out the cheese and sour cream).  I really love their creamy dressing too.

If you're getting a burrito or tacos though, look out of the extras like sour cream and guacamole though - they cost extra and they don't tell you that when you are ordering.

Overall, A-OK if your looking for a change from the normal Chipotle.
