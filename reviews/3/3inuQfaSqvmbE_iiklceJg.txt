So after all the hype, I finally decided to give this place a shot. They're opening up a new location right by my house on 7th Ave and just North of Indian School, but seeing it being built piqued my curiosity.  I decided to get takeout from the 7th St. location. We ordered a Carne Asada Burrito, Vampiro, mexican corn, guacamole and salsa with chips, a horchata and the lady talked me into trying their new Pastor, in a taco. Total damage was just under $25.00.

Carne Asada Burrito- It was okay, nothing to write home about (which I have to say was disappointing, I was expecting to have "the best carne asada in the valley" that they bravely boast, but it just wasn't all that great)
Vampiro-Tostada with the carne asada, again just mediocre and a bit cold.
Corn-Disappointing. The menu boasts mayonnaise, cotijo cheese, hot sauce and lime but somehow I think I only got the mayo and cheese. It somehow managed to be bland and needed some salt (not sure how that happened with the cotijo)
Pastor Taco-It was pretty good, no complaints
Horchata-The flavor was good, but the texture was a bit grainy, which I'e never experienced while drinking horchata.
Salsa/Guacomole- Good house salsa, just the right amount of heat. Guacamole was good to, no complaints here.

Overall, it's pretty good. Is there anything I'd actually crave from there that I couldn't get at a kajillion taco shops in PHX? No.
