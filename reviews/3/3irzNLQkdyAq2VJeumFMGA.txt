We waited 35 minutes on a Friday night to be seated out on the patio. The furniture on the patio could be a little bit more comfortable ..but it was okay. This is our second time that we have visited and my husband and I feel that the food is okay..not the best or amazingly good, but the servers are attentive and we did not mind the food that we ate.
