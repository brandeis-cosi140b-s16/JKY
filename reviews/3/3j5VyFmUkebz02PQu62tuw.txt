Stopped in for a quick dinner after shopping.  They had a limited time lobster burrito so I gave it a try. Ordered it into a platter which added beans and a drink. The burrito was good and filling 3.5/5. The beans were a nice side to dip the tortilla chips in 3/5 but the tortilla chips were pretty ordinary 2.5/5. The counter staff, a very nice lady named Christine was very helpful even though she was inundated with a high number of customers.
