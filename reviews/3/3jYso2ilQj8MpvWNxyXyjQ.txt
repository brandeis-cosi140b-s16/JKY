I love a grilled burger esp over mesquite. Can it get much better? 

Well yes. I will explain. 

Concept 5 stars 
Building 4.5 and I like the scaffolding. LOL 
Service was a tad slow but they were training and they were super nice. 5 stars 
Cleanliness 5 stars and we were there after a huge lunch rush of "handicapable" folks. 

I had a Bueno with American cheese, Let, Tom, Mayo and Mustard. Kind of a standard burger. 

-The meat was fresh just too thin 
-The toppings were good just too much, 
-The bun was good just too thick for such a small patty. 
-The flavor was faint and I did not detect any additional seasonings. 

Oh yeah... the combo with frys and a drink, is the same price as just the reg drink. 

Better then most fast food joints but then again the price is higher too.
