The service here is really good. Our server did an excellent job at accommodating my group and was very nice. The decor makes me feel like I am in a Mexican home during day of the dead its red and black and looks very authentic. I tried the goat and pork tacos both meats tasted very bland and lacked flavor. I am a big fan of naked city pizza but I don't think I will be back to Desnudo tacos any time soon.
