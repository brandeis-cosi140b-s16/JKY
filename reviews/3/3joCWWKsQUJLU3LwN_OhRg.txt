After a single visit, I'll give them three stars. 

The wife had the shrimp cocktail, and was overwhelmed at the amount of shrimp within (I don't eat shrimp, so it wasn't as if she could share). If you like shrimp cocktail, I guess the word is to come hungry and you won't be disappointed.

She had the eponymous Chile Verde, and I had a combo platter. It was good, not great--I'll admit, as refugees from Southern California, our sights might be a little high--but it was probably the best we've had in the last three years of living in Charlotte.

Service was good, folks were friendly, parking a breeze.

I know we'll definitely go back. Maybe a fourth star will be awarded upon that meal.
