The chips, salsa and bean dip are the good reasons to go here.... other than that not much to say.  Everything seems to be sooo greasy and mushy within seconds.  If you order something with a crispy taco, eat that first!  It will be a soggy mess soon.  I have to say that they have a nice patio or drinks which has been a better experience than the food and I wish it wasn't so because I live really close by.  I do have to say that the service is always 5 star.
