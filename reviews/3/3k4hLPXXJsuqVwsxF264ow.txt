I've heard a lot about this place and finally had the chance to try it out (Thanks Karen!)  My thoughts; this place was okay/mediocre.  There were wide variety of burritos and maybe I picked the wrong one, but all the raving about food and it was decent.  Service was there but nothing I couldn't find at the local fast food joint.  Granted, I didn't expect much pizzazz from them, but what brought energy was the decor.  I totally dig the hanging stars; think I can gaze at them for hours....hmm.  Anyhow, the mini pi√±atas was delightful along with the mirrored wall - hey do I have cilantro in my teeth?  The place had that modern tacky feel - a lot of dinks and dots with a sleek smooth look.  Some places the menu on the flatscreen doesn't work for me, but I think this place does it justice - yes I know Karen you couldn't see it; it was too small, but my keen Asian eyes are like eagles (as long as I have my contacts on that is.....) - enjoy!
