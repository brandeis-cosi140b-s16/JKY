This was my first visit to pollo loco and I was really excited to try something other than Popeyes or KFC. I head here for lunch around 1230 on a Friday and I find myself stuck with 4 cars in front of me; sucked but I figured, it should move fairly quickly, this is fast food after all.  This was SO NOT the case; it took me just over 15 minutes to get to my food. 

The food itself was just okay. My wing was pretty burnt and dry and the breast was good. The black beans, which I was hoping for just some side regular black beans were BBQ! I think they need to advertise this, I don't care if it's their way of doing it, but some people don't like BBQ flavor and should be aware of this. The veggie side was just whatever, not bad but nothing to brag about; glad they didn't load it down with butter! 

I will consider trying again, but not anytime soon.
