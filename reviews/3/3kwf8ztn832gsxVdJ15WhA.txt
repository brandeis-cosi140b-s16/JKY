My wife loves this place.  Do you know that jeep saying that only jeep owners say.  "It's a Jeep thing, you don't understand."  I guess Cafe Rio is the same thing.  I just don't understand why people go crazy over this place.  This restaurant is always packed.  I always end up going because I can't always pick where we eat.  Now as you read this I know what you are thinking.  This guy is just bashing this restaurant.  Ok, so I am a little.  Let's get to the food.  Is the food bad?  No  Is the food spectacular? No Is the food a little different? Yes.  This place is not your typical Mexican food joint.  I have actually tried a few different items on the menu at this establishment because I cant seem to find something I like.  My wife gets the salad with the pork.  The pork is really good.  It is the right amount of sweet and tender.  This place also makes there own tortillas, which is always a plus.  The salad comes with your choice of a lime vinaigrette or a ranch type dressing.  I advise against the lime stuff, it is a little too tangy.  I ordered the chicken Quesadilla and it was pretty good.  This is one of those restaurants were you have to go and order. Don't let anyone tell you what they think because honestly this is a different type of Mexican joint.  Cheers!
