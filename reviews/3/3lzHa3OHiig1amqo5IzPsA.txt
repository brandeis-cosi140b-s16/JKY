Valle Luna bats .250.  Not high enough to put in the middle of the lineup (hell, probably not enough to even start), not low enough to send back down to AAA.  Completely average.  I'll admit, however, to frequenting the restaurant primarily for its bar which seemingly promotes about 17,696 drink specials and more on football sundays.  Other than that, there isn't really a whole lot to say one way or another.  Perhaps that says more than a lengthy review ever could...
