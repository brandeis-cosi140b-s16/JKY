UPDATE:  The El Matador closed its doors in March 2012 http://www.azfamily.com/news/Matadors-Restarant-Closing-Down-144045526.html

I remember the old rival El Matador / Nogales restaurants from the 70's (and much earlier) and lament the urban renewal that destroyed the best and cheapest mexican food in town.  They were neighboring, competitor businesses owned by branches of the same family.  They had separate entrances but you could go from one to another through a doorway toward the back.

Alas, the Matador family-branch took the buyout money and rebuilt across the street from the also-rebuilt  Adams Hotel downtown.  It fancied up, raised the prices, and went all to hell.  The decor is nice and the music soundtrack is excellent. 

I only go there anymore on Sundays, from 10am to 1pm, for the free mariachi show.  It is a very good group, Mariachi Tierra del Sol, of seven or eight musicians (hence the extra star).  I get the overpriced, blah breakfast just to enjoy the tunes.  I must say that they serve a pretty good cocido, only on Sundays, that is not on the menu...ask for it.

If it were not for the, downtown-captive businessmen and conventioneers, this place would have closed long ago.  The mariachi bring in a crowd on Sundays, after church, especially around Mexican national holidays.  It is probably a nice place for drinking, the bar is quite attractive.  

Maybe they have to keep prices up to stay open in the iffy downtown market and "americanize" the mexican food for the damyankee business visitors, transplants and snowbirds.   

I suppose the Nogales Restaurant branch of the family just took the money and retired.

With the economy crash and the impact of SB1070 this is one of only three places left in the Valley with a regularly scheduled mariachi show.   Go on Sunday for the show
