The food is always pretty good, no matter what Chipotle you go to, it tastes the same. This location tends to have stale chips, so make sure you taste them before you leave if you're having your food to go.

The thing that is not so great about this location is their customer service. Twice now I've gone close to closing time and it is evident that the employees just want to leave. Hey, that's not an issue, I get it, but good customer service does not end because it's 20-30 minutes to closing time. On Halloween night, an employee announced that if anyone was planning to eat there that they needed to go eat outside because they needed to clean inside because they wanted to go home. Ok, got it.

They were out of something, so the same employee said that were not going to make anymore because they had cleaned the grill and they wanted to go home. Pretty sure we understood the first time. They were annoyed at the lady in front of me because she ordered 3-4 burritos. They kept trying to rush everyone.

It is pretty much hit or miss service, but if you just want your Chipotle fix, then no issues here.
