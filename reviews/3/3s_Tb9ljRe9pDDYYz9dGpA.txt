We only visited the coffee bar section at the Commissary,which has coffee drinks, bagels, breakfast burritos, crepes, and gelato.  It's handy and affordable when you want to grab a fairly quick breakfast.  My bagel was decent and they were generous with the cream cheese without and extra charge.  The husband said the burrito was decent.  Overall, for what it is, I recommend it.  I'll post more if we ever eat lunch or dinner here.
