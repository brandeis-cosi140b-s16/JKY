Overpriced/small portions/mediocre food! The food was pretty heavy handed on the spiciness. Not a problem for me, but the people I went with were not expecting it. There was a long wait considering the restaurant was nearly empty. Not worth it, I don't plan on ever coming back. Though it is BEAUTIFULLY decorated... The environment must be figured into the price.
