After hearing so much about the korean taco truck in LA i was so excited to find out that we had one in Las Vegas.  I was around the neighborhood running errands and decided to check this place out since I live on the other side of the town.  

It was literally 112 outside and thank god there was no line.  I tried the beef, tofu and egg tacos and also ordered their "not so fries".  I gota say one thing, they are definitely different tacos.  I couldn't get a strong grasp on whether I truly liked them or not.  The Korean type slaw they threw on top of the tacos were a bit sweet and had a strange taste to it.  The tortillas like everyone else said were flour and not as hot and soft as they should be.  The fries were tasty but also a bit on the salty side.  

Overall, its a cool place to try out but I probably wont be coming back here for a while since it didn't blow my mind.  I was probably too excited on the idea and then the food let me down a bit.
