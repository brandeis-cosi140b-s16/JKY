Let's get to the point: if you stick to the specials, you can overlook the mediocrity because it's hella cheap. At $2, I don't expect a good margarita, and the $2 tacos are Taco Bell quality. But it's a cheap place to eat and drink in a part of the strip where cheap eats and drinks are becoming hard to find. So load up on $2 Modelos and cheap tacos here before you move on to another place on the strip.
