I liked Gran Agave a little more than Darren did but was still disappointed since I'd been wanting to come here for a while. The best thing I had was the black bean soup with rice which was very hearty. Darren's churros with ice cream were also decent. My combo #8 came with an enchilada (blah. they use something to stretch out the ground meat in some way, and it tasted funny), a tamale (not bad), Mexican rice (so-so), and fried beans (one bite was enough). The decor was cute though, and our server was really nice and helpful. I don't think I'd want to return.
