I love Chipotle, but whoever made the guac yesterday really messed up. There was so much salt in the guac that was almost all you could taste. 

I must say that the staff here were probably the friendliest bunch of staff I've encountered at a Chipotle. 

While the guac was terrible, the rest of the burrito was great. Excellent and really delicious which I always get coming here.
