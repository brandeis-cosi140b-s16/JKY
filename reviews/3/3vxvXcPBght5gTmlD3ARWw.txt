Yes, another review for Del Taco.....when I'm on my No Meat diet, this place is on my frequently visited list.  This visit, I got a Veggie Works Burrito, and a Bean Burrito Deluxe.

The service was fast and the food was prepared well.  Sometimes they skimp on the ingredients, but this trip they did a great job and the Burritos were tasty.  Overall, not bad.
