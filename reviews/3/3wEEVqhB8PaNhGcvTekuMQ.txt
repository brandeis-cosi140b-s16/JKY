The burrito ruined the meal and that was the main dish. I ordered the carnitas burrito with side rice and beans. The rice and beans were great, not salty like a lot of other Mexican food joints. The burrito was mostly tortilla and the carnita I did get was dry and was not fresh. I had to remove most of the tortilla and add salsa so it would not by so dry. I would have giving this place a 1 star but the rice, beans, salsa, and chips were very good.
