Busy at lunch.  1 line for Burritos and 1 line for everything else.  You get through the line pretty quickly.  Typical Qdoba.  Choice of steak or chicken.  Decent food for a decent price.  Rice is a little bland.  Steak is spicier than the chicken.  Had a new cashier today that tried to charge us $10+ for 4 tacos with fajita veggies.  

Limited seating inside.  Most people get it to go.  If you show your company badge you get a free drink.  If you join the rewards program you get a free burrito after 10 entrees with Monday being worth double.
