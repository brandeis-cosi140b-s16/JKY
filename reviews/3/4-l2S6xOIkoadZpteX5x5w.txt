I got the chicken fajitas which tasted very good but it only came with 3 very small shells.  I asked the server for more and got them a few minutes later. After I got my bill I saw that Inwas charged additional $ for them.

They need to provide enough shells for the dish that you order and are already paying for.  At the very least, make the customer aware that it will cost extra.
