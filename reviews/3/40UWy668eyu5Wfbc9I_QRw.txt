First time today and maybe my last.  While I wouldn't say I would NEVER eat here again, I could live without it.  That says a lot considering I'm a Mexican food fanatic.

House margarita was pretty good, but  overpriced ($7) considering the glass was filled to the rim with ice, resulting in a rather small drink.  Both salsas were tasty (red tomato-based and green tomatillo), both spicy but the heat was not overpowering.  I love the ala carte idea for the taco menu as there are many to try, but found the food to be less than impressive.  I had a chicken taco (pollo asado) and beef (carne asada).  The chicken was bland and at room temperature.  The beef was a little more flavorful, but still only mildly warm.  My husband tried the lobster and fish tacos.  Both were overcooked and he complained there was not enough fish and too much cabbage.  He also ordered grilled street corn, but they apparently forgot to grill it.

Cien Agaves definitely has a fun atmosphere, cool decor, and a great idea with focusing on tequila and tacos, but the experience is lost with average food at best.  Reserve this place for happy hour, but look elsewhere for a good meal.
