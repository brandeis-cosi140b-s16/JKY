The service was good, our waitress was friendly and attentive.  They give you chips and salsa before you order. The chips were nice and crisp  

The food was ok, but not amazing.  The batter on the chili relleno was pretty good, nice and eggy.  The sauce on the enchilada was also pretty good, nice and flavorful and smoky.  The bean chimichanga was only ok, not great. It was crispy, but the beans were kinda of runny and flavorless.

The patio was very nice, we sat next to the fountain.

Even if we lived in Apache Junction I don't think we would go back.
