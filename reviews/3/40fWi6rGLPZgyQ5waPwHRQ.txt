We decided to grab some food before a concert we came to see at The Club. 
We did not go in the restaurant, but sat at the bar outside instead. 
It was happy hour so I ordered a Mango margarita for $5 and nachos for $5. 
The mango drink was delicious....not too sweet, which is also a concern with fruit drinks. Didn't really taste the alcohol, which is fine, because I was just having it with my meal. 
The nachos were ok. They didn't look like a lot on the plate, but they filled me up. I ordered a side of salsa, because I don't like the onions in the pico.
I would give the nachos a 2 and the drink a 5....so overall I gave it a 3. 
I would definitely return for the drinks. 
The service was just ok.
