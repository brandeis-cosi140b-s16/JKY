It wasn't what I remember when I was younger.
But it was just okay.
I wish they had burritos, but they don't.
Just average mexican food.
I think it was like 18 bucks for 2 people and one drink.
They have an ice cream bar, but it's not as wonderful as it used to be.
They used to have gummy worms. Now all I can remember is sprinkles.
No churros either.

My taco was missing something, it didn't taste beefy at all.
Even though that's all that was in their..beef..

All they had playing was Hispanic music. Which I don't really mind, but I wish they had a different variety.

I like my chile rellano though. Beans were a little dry, but I wasn't really expecting much.
