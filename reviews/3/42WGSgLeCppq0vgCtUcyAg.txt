Mill Avenue is probably one of my least favorite places to go to hang out simply because it is insanely crowded all of the time, however, Chronic Cantina is sort of tucked away off of Mill. It's still pretty busy here on any given night, but a lot less so than some of the MAJOR Mill destinations. 

I went here with a group of friends the other night because they were spending time with a friend from California. 
The DJ plays a pretty good mix of today's hip hop and even some Dubstep upon request (yay for Skrillex!). The bar is packed full of great choices for ANY type of booze your heart desires. I love that they have Blanco Basura. What a hilarious name for a beer. 

The dance floor isn't huge, but they have a pole in the middle for those girls (and possibly even some guys) who get drunk enough to utilize it. 

I haven't had the food here, but I intend to make another trip, so I will update my review after that!
