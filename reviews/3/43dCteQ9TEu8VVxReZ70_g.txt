My husband & I were really excited about trying this place after seeing the rave reviews online. The ambiance was cool, even though we were the only people in the restaurant in the entire time. They had some good local beer. Sadly, we were disappointed with the food. We had the brisket tacos, a swordfish taco special, Brussel sprouts, corn & a dessert. The only thing we really enjoyed was the corn. The beef tacos were fatty. The dessert was inedible. It was a "Taco torte" apparently (we thought the waiter said chocolate torte). It had definitely tasted as if had been sitting in a fridge for a week or more. It was like a dessert you are forced to eat at a family reunion that your great aunt made...an instant dessert of sorts. So bad. I know it's tapas but the portions were very tiny. We spent $60 and I left hungry.
