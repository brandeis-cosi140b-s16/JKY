We went to this place because Nogales Hot Dogs wasn't open yet. It was not impressive. I wouldn't call their hot dogs "Sonoran hot dogs." They're more like fully loaded hot dogs that happen to be wrapped in bacon. Tasted like store bought hot dogs with only a little bit of beans, onions, ketchup, mustard, tomatoes on them. The horchata was just okay but came with mostly ice and only a little bit of horchata. The fries were, however, very good. Thick cut fries seasoned with salt and pepper, those were the best part of our meal.
