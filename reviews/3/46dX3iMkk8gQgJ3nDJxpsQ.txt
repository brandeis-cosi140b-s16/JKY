Pasqual's is an all-around average experience that will disappoint only in regards to the fact that it resoundingly fails to impress on any level. I am not a fan of their tacos or burritos, but nothing I have had here could be described as "bad." The ultra-Americanized unoriginality of Pasqual's Mexican food is rivaled only by The Taco Shop.

I keeep coming back to it because the nachos are really where it's at. They're incredibly crunchy and flavorful with a decent seasoning, reminding me of the now-forgotten tortilla chip kings of Taco Heaven. Heaping portions of cheese, beans/meat, and veggies make this dish into a paragon of Mexican fast food.
