I wrote a semi-scathing review of the Ajo Al's on 16th street, but I want to make clear that this particular store is considerably better than its Phoenician counterpart. 

I'm not sure exactly what it is that makes this experience so much better, but I think it's a blend of the ambiance and the food. First off, the decor is much nicer, and the art more tasteful, and the food is just plain better. Don't get me wrong, it still doesn't make my top ten mexican food spots in Phoenix, but it isn't bad for Tex-Mex.

Great for gringos looking for some satisfying grub, without wanting to burn anything or overwhelm the taste buds.
