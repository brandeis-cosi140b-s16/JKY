Let me start out by saying the chips and salsa are very good.  Thin, crisp chips, corn and blue.  Three different kinds of salsa.  The hot is just hot enough, green salsa was great, mild was perfect for my husband.  We ordered the chicken and shrimp fajitas which were very tasty.  I had started to rate it 5 stars on the quality of the food alone, however, we saw our waiter ONCE when he brought our meal and then never saw him again.  We had to hunt him down to pay our bill.  I'm disappointed.
