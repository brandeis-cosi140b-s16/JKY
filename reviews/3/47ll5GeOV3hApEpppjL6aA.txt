This is a solid joint for mexican food. It's not gourmet, but it's not a total dive either.

I stopped in for dinner last week with my Dad, and we sat down in the dining area (non-smoking). Very quickly, the room started to smell like someone was smoking weed. Of course, I pretended to not know what the smell was, but my Dad caught my lie. That turned into an awkward dinner conversation. Oh well.

The server was very kind and offered to move us to the bar area, without us asking.

In any case....when you are seated, you get a nice plate of chips, salsa, and bean dip.

The food is quite good. Lots of options. There is a "healthy" menu, as well as a "seniors" menu. 

I opted for the Chicken Sarandeado. A grilled chicken breast that was nicely seasoned, served with tortillas, rice, beans and pico. 

Nothing about this place stands out as life-changing, but this place is A-Ok and I would come back because the service was good, the food was good, and atmosphere was fun.

Salud!
