I was recently invited to a gathering here which I was thrilled about due to many great experiences at joyride. We sat on the patio near the beautiful fireplace ready to enjoy our fall evening with friends.  I'm loving the music here!

Our server was Trevor and he repeatedly let us down through the evening.  He was super slow to take orders and we had been sitting quite a while before he welcomed us or even took drink orders. When ordering, I inquire if they have Chambord.  He does not know but says he will check- he takes all the drink orders and when everyone gets drinks around us we do not see any for us.  When he runs by a few minutes later I ask "no Chambord?" Which he gives me deer in the headlights... I'm like "just give me the house margarita!!"  The guy next to me gets his 2nd margarita before I get my first. He does finally explain the bar is backed up- but still takes no ownership or makes any apology.  A simple "thank you for your patience" would have made a world of difference.  Just the servers knowing what spirits and liquors they have in stock would be great!!!!!!

The nachos were quite good as well as the chicken, crispy fish, and shrimp tacos.  Unfortunately the rice & beans came out way after the tacos were eaten. 

Of course when it comes time to pay trevor tries to give me card to some random guy... Who tries to give a card that says Samantha to a guy? 

Trevor is a lackadaisical finger pointer with the memory of a goldfish.  As a business manager I would not have him interacting with clients.
