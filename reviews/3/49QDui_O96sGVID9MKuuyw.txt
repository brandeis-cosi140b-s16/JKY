For a good price and decent food, I like Chipotle, but I was not happy with the service I received.  I do not eat meat so I need my veggies and I would like a good amount of them for $8, not just a small scoop.  But first, my experience at this location was terrible.  I got there, ordered my veggie salad and there was less then half a cup of veggies left in the dish, of course they probably have been sitting there for sometime and not fresh.  The lady behind the counter asked me if it was okay just to put those on, OF COURSE NOT!  I am not here paying for old veggies, I want fresh.  So I had to wait about 10 minutes for fresh veggies to be prepared.  Then, they only put on a small scoop, umm, mam, I am only getting veggies and lettuce, please put more on.  And of course when I asked for this I was given a "I am super annoyed look" by the employee.  HOW RUDE!  After I finally got my salad, it tasted good, nothing too special, but it was good.  Customer service sucked and I  will not go back to that location!
