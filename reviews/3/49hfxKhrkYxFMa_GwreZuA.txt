The food was not bad, but definitely not worth the price.  Roberto's has better tasting food at a cheaper price.  

The shredded beef burrito tasted exactly like the salsa, which did not work.  Should have stuck to traditional seasonings.

Rice and beans were tasteful, but so was the guacamole. 

Staff is friendly and prompt in attention, but we were the only ones eating.

I rated this place on the low side, due to the overpriced food.  The last three eateries in this same location failed for the exact same reason; overpriced meals.
