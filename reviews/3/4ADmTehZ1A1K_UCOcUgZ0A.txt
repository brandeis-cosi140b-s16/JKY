We got there around 10:15 pm and we decided to wait for the Happy Hour at 11pm. We got Estrella beer (which is really giod),Seafood Soup and meatball with fries fries for the kids. All this before 11pm. The soup was ok, 2 mussels, 1 clam, 1 shrimp and few pieces of some white fish that tasted really good. 

After 11 we got the Chix Wings, Pan Boli, Saffron Chicken and Fried Calamari. The chix wings where really good. The calamari was better. The batter stayed crispy after 10 mins, which is weird to find a batter like that. Pan boli it was great for the soup. 2 pcs. of baguette toasted with jamon serrano, manchego and EVOO.  

The Saffron chicken a disapointment. No flavor, no seasoning, no saffron. Looked like a turmeric puree on top of chicken.

The service was ok, but there was problems between customers and the bartender. Some people left so disapointed that even the manager couldnt fix whatever issue they where having. 

Maybe I'll be back but this town is getting so full of Tapas Bars that is getting boring.
