I really need to start of list for Mill Ave.  Professionals looking for a good happy hour  on Mill Ave.  I totally love when a new place opens up because I have a fantastic workgroup that I can't wait to try your place out.  

With that said, we walked ALL the way from University...huff, puff, huffying..to the north side of Mill Ave. to check this new place out.  Lucky for us happy hour starts at 3pm.  Ok...we worker bees start at 5am-7am, because our counterparts are on the east coast. So, we all get off between 3pm-5pm.  

Loco Patron had great HH specials.  Beers were cheap and the marg's were inexpensive.  The marg's were okay.  I am not a fan of sour drinks...they were nothing special.  Chips and salsa were comp...nice touch.  The service was okay...even at 3ish.  I really don't recall anything that made this place special, we brought such a large group and it was ok.  The place was able to accommodate our seating arrangement.  Not sure if I will come back.
