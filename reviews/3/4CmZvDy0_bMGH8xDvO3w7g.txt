Was craving Mexican so had to do it. Large restaurant so little wait time. Lobster tacos were not fresh, mahi on the fish tacos were dry and lackluster, and the chicken enchiladas were very mediocre. Presentation is on point, and from the photos the dishes look delectible. But you can't fool the mouth, and the freshness wasnt there.
