I went here after work with some co-workers.  We arrived at about 6:00pm on a Tuesday and there were six of us.  We were told there would be a half hour wait for a table so we found some space to sit at the bar.  All of the employees were very courteous and drink service was fast.  
   Food is another story though.  While at the bar, I ordered nachos which took them about 25 minutes to bring out to us, not exactly fast service, especially for an appetizer that should take no more than 10-15 minutes to make, even if the restaurant is busy.  The nachos themselves were decent, but nothing special.  Another co-worker ordered chips and salsa (which they charge for, by the way).  The chips were definitely from a bag, so I was a little disappointed as I like when restaurants serve them freshly fried, especially if they are going to charge.  My overall take on the chips and the salsa; again, it wasn't bad, but not that great either.  The waitress did offer us a free refill on the chips (another A+ for service!).  I also ordered the enchiladas with mole sauce which was good, but not great.  As far as drinks go, I've never had a margarita before, and margaritas were half off so I decided to give it a try.  It was alright but nothing fantastic, however that might just be because I'm not a huge fan of mixed drinks.  My co-workers seemed to really enjoy the drinks that they got.
   In summary, I would give this place 5 stars for the service and atmosphere, but only 2-3 for the food.  Honestly, it's a nice place to get a drink with friends, but the food, although palatable, is nothing special.
