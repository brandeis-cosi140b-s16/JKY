This place is cute.  I was a little intimidated when I checked the menu online and there were no $$ signs.  To me that always means pricey but I was pleasantly surprised to walk in and look at the Mexican food selection to find that everything was under $15.

So my first disappointment was paying for the chips and salsa.  Paying, really?  The waiter was generous with the salsa and chips but that still disappointed me.

Food:
Chips and salsa-  Salsa wasn't good.  I mean it was OK but being a Mexican food lover, I've tasted many salsas in my day and this was mediocre at best.

Chile Rellenos-  These were delicious and would highly recommend them.  Also, the rice is fantastic.  Not the biggest pork fan but I still found these amazing.

Machaca & Tomatillo Chimichanga- Also delicious. I mean it is a deep fried burrito but still very well done.

Sopas- you can add a sopapia for .75 each.  We each had one which came with honey as our dessert.  They were very good and not too much or too little.

Service:
Fan-freakin- tastic.  Our server was great.  He was extremely attentive and friendly.  


So this place is more like 3 1/2 stars probably but we ate at Dick's Hideaway the next night which was much more impressive and thus, because I am comparing, I have to give this 3 stars.  I would recommend it and come back!
