Wanted to see how their tamales compared to Macayo's and went for dinner Monday night. Got seated right away. The chips and salsa were very good. I ordered the Mix & Match with the green corn tamale, rice, and beans. My friend got the red beef tamale so we could try both. When they came out, I was disappointed to see them covered in sauce. I am so used to tamales in the husk that I didn't even think about them being served in sauce. Turns out the sauce didn't really add much to the tamales. The green corn tamale was very sweet and I liked it. The beef tamale was barely room temperature, didn't have much spice, and the masa was rather dry. Wouldn't recommend that one. But our service was good and I felt so stuffed after that meal!
