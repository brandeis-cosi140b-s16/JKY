First off, let me say I love Macayo's and have tried many locations.

Now, this is not my favorite location and I'll tell you why.
 
The restaurant itself is older than some locations, and it has not been redecorated. That's fine but I know there's better. The parking lot is a little sketchy, especially at night. 

The food comes out usually pretty tasty, but the quality could be a step up. I ordered dinner to go one night, and came early to pick it up so I went to the bar for a margarita which was on happy hour. The bartender tried to get me to order a patron margarita for like $7 more than the happy hour marg. I didn't appreciate that. When I ordered the $3 one, I was pretty much ignored after that. I had told the hostess I would be waiting in the bar for my food, and she also never came to let me know it was ready. After sitting there 20 minutes, I went and asked. It had been sitting on their counter for who knows how long. Once I got home (only a 3 min drive), my order was correct, but the food was lukewarm. Disappointing. 

On a different occasion, it was fajita fest or something, and I ordered a combo fajitas and I was overcharged. I pointed out on the menu exactly where it said the price and I had to ask for the manager because my server didn't want to adjust the bill accordingly. 

Another time I went for dinner and my server was mostly absent, but the bus boy was awesome and completely took care of us. When our server showed up at the end to drop off the bill after disappearing for 20 min, we mentioned we wanted dessert. 10 min later he came back to say the fryers were already off and we couldn't get anything for dessert that was hot. The manager took care of the situation and offered me a comp card for next time, which was definitely sufficient and appreciated.

But that's why I only give 3 stars.  Love the food, but I'll usually drive farther for a better location. 60th ave and bell is the best imo.
