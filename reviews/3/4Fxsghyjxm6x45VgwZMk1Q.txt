We are always looking for very authentic flavors when it comes to Mexican food, because, well... we could make it at home, you know? But sometimes we just want to be waited on, and not go through all the cooking, and the washing of dishes and pots.
So when we have a really big craving for something Mexican, it is very specific, like Menudo, or Birria. Something that we know takes some time to cook, and we just want to have some right now!
Well, this place was packed!! The rainy Saturday morning we ventured out to try it for the first time. Because all the empty spaces were taken by diners and people waiting for their turn, we had to wait like 15-20 minutes outside in our car. Which built some high expectations, we thought "This gotta be super delicious"! Well, once we got to be seated, we ordered our birrias, our kids had pancakes and Tacos de Birria, I know, don't even ask! Service was great! The ladies that took care of us, really took care of us! They were very friendly, and helpful.
We thought the the birria was "OK", but not mind-blowing. We added all the "Add-ins" and it still tasted somewhat bland.  But it is a really good place to go eat, by all means... We just haven't found a place that we can recommend a 100%. No, not this one.
