Cute name, cute decor. 

It was a given that I would want to eat here since we were staying at HRH. Add that to the fact that they are on www.restaurant.com ($25 gift certificate for $10 or less) and we have a winning combination! 

I ordered the Burrito Mojado with chicken. It is served enchilada style with this amazing Pasllia Chile sauce and a side salad. My man ordered the Steak Burrito Tradicional that also includes a side salad. Both burritos were on the smallish side and pretty pricey, but it's Vegas, right?

I'd come back for happy hour and a couple of margaritas.
