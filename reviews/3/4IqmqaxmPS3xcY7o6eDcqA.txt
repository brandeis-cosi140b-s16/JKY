This place is OK; I go there occasionally. The food comes out way too fast to be cooked-to-order.  Maria Bonita comes standard with your standard Mexican restaurant fare on the menu, as well as the canned Mexican music (although I understand this place has live bands for certain occasions like Cinco de Mayo).  It is clean and has nice decor.  There is upstairs and patio seating, as well as a bar. 

Maria Bonita is located in the neighborhood shopping center at Rea and Colony, across from Burning Tree.  It is on the Walgreen's end.
