Came here after just landing in Phoenix to grab some late night tacos, it's pretty cool that the trucks have their own parking lot and there are two different trucks with what seems like two different menus, but after the novelty, the food isn't all that amazing. The tacos came out to about $1.50 each, which is slightly more expensive than what I'm used to, especially for tacos of this quality.

The service however was great, and they were super friendly about explaining their menu and what all the different meats were to anyone who didn't know, which is not as common as you would think in food trucks. I wouldn't say the quality here is amazing, but if you're coming around the area and looking for some dirty street tacos to grab a quick bite and maybe even hang out with friends in the parking lot, come by and give frontera a shot.
