This "original" Tia Rosa is a conundrum because the food is good but the overall experience is confusing. Question to answer: are you a counter service restaurant or sit-down dining experience? Let me help:

Counter Restaurant: walk up, order your own, pay for chips and salsa that are served in disposable bowls that are way too small for even the broken chips to dip. You expect this at a counter restaurant and come to accept it. Expect counter experience. 

Sit-Down: PRICIER but a willing exchange for the service, ceramic, glassware and maybe some fancy napkins or something.  Expect sit down prices with all the corners cut. 

In the end, I'd be much happier if you were priced like a counter restaurant. Good is good but overpriced. And give us a bowl that can fit a chip!
