THE GOOD: 
1.) CONVENIENT - Late night food alternative that is close enough to the strip. 
2.) INEXPENSIVE - especially after burning money on gambling, partying, and overpriced club drinks! 
3.) QUICK SERVICE - It's a freaking fast food chain...it better be.
4.) MOSTLY TASTY GRUB - The tacos and burritos are pretty good. However, their Menudo really hits the spot....especially after a cold crazy night.

THE BAD: 
1.) FOOD SUPPLY - They often run out of certain food items.
2.) FOOD QUALITY - There have been some menu items that was definitely a miss and not a hit (might just be bad preparation). 
2.) INCONSISTENT SERVICE - Sometimes the service sucks.THEY FORGOT MY BURRITO!!! 
3.) RUNDOWN VENUE - The restaurant is kinda cheesy: jacked up jukebox busting out the Mexican music, the old school tables/chairs, and the cleanliness of the front counter definitely doesn't win "positive" awards. 
4.) SKETCHY AREA: There is a reason the place is caged up like minimum security prison. I've seen freaky things happen there - a guy beaten up and robbed right outside, the standard late-night fight between rowdy customers, and what looked to be an unfit teen mom with a half-naked baby that seemed to have horrible mouth sores (CALL CHILD SERVICES!!!)

THE FINAL VERDICT: TACOS MEXICO...SURE WHY NOT!?!
Cheap, semi-dirty Mexican food is definitely a good cure after a Vegas night of partying, drunkenness, and debauchery. If you're above and beyond the clean, pricey late night eats within the strip (side note: GET OFF YOUR FREAKING HIGH HORSE!!!), then head down to the ghetto cuz Tacos Mexico definitely fits the bill!
