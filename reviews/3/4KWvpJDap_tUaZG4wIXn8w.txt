I am giving 3 stars as the service was horrible but the food is a 5+. Large portions and excellent taste.  I mentioned my concern regarding the issues with the server to the young man doing the seating.  His reply was"we hear that a lot but people always come back".  It seems service is ongoing issue and one that is unlikely to change.  Plan on at least 2 hours.  The young man was right, I will go back for the excellent food.
