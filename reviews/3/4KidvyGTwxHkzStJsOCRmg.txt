So my friend at work told me i should try their food... He said it would be packed by 11 so i got there around 10am.  I ordered the Machacha Plate but i really wanted a machacha breakfast... it was good.  I think i will try the burrito next time and hopefully that will be the ticket.  The machacha plate was good the meat was slightly salty, the beans and rice were good also... i like the tortilla though! it made the food better... i just like tortillas when they are placed over open fire i guess.
