Corn cake souffle with mole was DELICIOUS!!!!  We also tried the chips & salsa (I didn't love the warm salsa, it was a little tomato-y for me), the hibiscus quesadilla which was outstanding, and the three x crispy taco deal with three mini crispy tacos - we tried picadillo beef, potato and chicken.  I didn't try the chicken, hubby loved it, I loved the other two - potato is soooo good.  Nice selection of Mexican draft beers.

Now for the downside....They missed the Pozole on the order (didn't charge but still annoying).  The crispy tacos, we asked for the $2 for three flavors deal, they charged us for three full orders at $8 each.  They charged us for the chips and salsa despite the fact that the woman taking the call said it would be waived for the difficulty they had in taking my order.  

We will be back, just careful to review the bill/order from now on.
