You know when, after eating at place several times, you start to get really sick of the food? Well, it doesn't take too many visits to Baja Fresh to get to that point. Although they do offer a pretty good selection of "Tex-Mex" food, and some really good burritos, the food here is pretty much the same as most of the Mexican Grill style restaurants around town. The atmosphere is nice though, a couple flat screen TV's playing some sports games and authentic Mexican music by artists such as Enrique Iglesias. The prices are about the same as any other similar style restaurant with burritos at about 7 dollars and quesadillas for 8 or 9 dollars. A couple things that I do like about Baja Fresh is that they give you fresh tortilla chips with your order and they aren't stingy with their guacamole, unlike Qdoba.... There's also good seating here, indoor and outdoor. For me, this is more of a place I'll go to when I'm really hungry and in the area.
