This is probably not the best location for the quality of food that I've come to expect from this chain. I had ordered a Mexican style steak with their spiciest chilli sauce.  This sauce is supposed to be the spiciest sauce they make. The heat kick from this sauce is pretty intense, especially on the next day. The steak I had ordered was medium-rare. The quality of the meat was pretty good and it was cooked perfectly. You do loose the flavors from the juices of the meat due to the heat, but it was a Mexican place and I had low expectations for the steak.

We ordered a table side guacamole, which was made fresh in front of us. The drinks were good, I would recommend trying their mango margaritas.
