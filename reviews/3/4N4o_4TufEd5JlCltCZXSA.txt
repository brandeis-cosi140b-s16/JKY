The drinks and the guacamole are really outstanding.  Really yummy.  

The actual meals really lacked taste when made vegan.  I wouldn't recommend this place if you have someone with food sensitivities or allergies in your party.  They really did try to be accommodating, but they struggled getting the order right.  When the order did come out, it lacked taste completely.  I'm sure their regular menu made the regular way is amazing because the guacamole was one of the most amazing things that I have ever eaten.  

Also, very pricey.  More expensive than I would have anticipated (even considering its location) and I did not feel like I got what I paid for overall.
