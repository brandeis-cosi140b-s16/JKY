Ok... now to rate this small quaint spot that I can do every now and then. I ordered the fried rice and it was pretty good. A little dry, but the flavor was good. Not my choice of dine-in as it's a little diner-ish to me. Lots of in and out loud traffic, loud tv right about booths. Waitresses a little not presentable. I would change that FAST. Appearance is Everything!
A few of the tables had been left dirty, another thing they need to work on. It made the place look shabby and dirty...uncared for.
