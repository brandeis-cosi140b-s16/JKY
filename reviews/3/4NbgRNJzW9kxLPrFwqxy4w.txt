My girlfriend insisted we come and eat here for breakfast.  There was nothing overly terrible about it, but it just didn't wow  me the way I am used to taco stands home in Texas doing.  Usually the decor in these places is forgivable because of the authenticity of the food, but here, I just wasn't feeling it. One plus is that they have a good collection of "aguas".  I wouldn't outright avoid it either though.  The food was more than reasonably priced for what you get.
