Great service. The people are nice, but unfortunately the food is just not great. 

The food is boring and with Qdoba and Chipotle to compete with, up your game. The seasoning on the chicken did not stand out. It was all very bland. It was also very dry. I added salsa and sour cream but it just was not enough.

I ordered a burrito bowl with a tortilla. So same thing as a burrito, but they charged me an extra dollar for the tortilla. Blah.
