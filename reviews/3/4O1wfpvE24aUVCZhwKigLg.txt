I have been waiting for a slow day at work to make the trip for lunch as this place is not close to the office at all. I was hoping it would be worth the efforts to go this far as the reviews were all so positive. 
Hole in the wall location kind of tucked in a small commercial center so pay attention when your driving by, currently there is a burnt down Jack n the Box as a landmark right across the street so use that as a landmark for the mean time. Walking in the place is small, not air conditioned and just kind of meh but given its location i dont expect to be walking into anything super posh either. 
I have eaten here now twice with the first time having the tacos 2 beef and 1 chicken both the Korean style offerings and they were good but nothing super spectacular in terms of flavor coming from the meat. The flavor of these tacos came from the kimchee and slaw more so than from the meat. With the special being 3 tacos for $5 i figured its not a bad offering. The return trip i made i picked up a bulkogi (beef) burrito for the $5 and i was more impressed with that as i think the addition of more meat and less filler product you were able to take the flavor of the meat more which was not bad at all but again nothing spectacular to tell mother about but it was better than the tacos in my opinion. I do like the fact that they offer you bottled water at no extra cost that was a very nice surprise, and the sliced orange after your meal was a nice touch as well. All in all for $5 meals its certainly a place i would go back to if i was in the area but i wouldnt go terribly out of my way to come back to.
