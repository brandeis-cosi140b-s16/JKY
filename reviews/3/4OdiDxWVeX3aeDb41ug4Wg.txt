This place has been quite disappointing. I've gone here several times thinking it'll be different and it's not. It's priced higher than others and I absolutely hate that I've thrown away my food twice from here. Won't be going here again. My Carne asada tasted like fish. Gross. It was like they cooked it either right after each other or together. Three stars bc the staff is great.
