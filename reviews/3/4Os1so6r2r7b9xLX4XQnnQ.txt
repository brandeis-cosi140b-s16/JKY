Not bad given the limited choices in the Cave Creek / Carefree area.  Would rate it four stars if they used a better flour tortilla for their burritos.  Their tortillas taste like the cheap ones you would buy in a grocery store.  Nice ambience for casual Mexican Food and would be better if they cleaned the pond water.
