This place's ambience is comparable to a Godfather's Pizza. Really open dining area, lots of lights on, green cushioned chairs, pretty quiet. Definitely a casual family restaurant. My friend and I sippin' margs felt a little out of place. I was definitely overdressed. 

HOWEVER, the food was pretty good and super cheap. Maybe a lunch sort of place? I don't think I'll be coming back. Too many other places to try.
