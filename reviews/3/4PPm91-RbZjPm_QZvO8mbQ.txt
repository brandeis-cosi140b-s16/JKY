The table side guacamole is great.  I also get a lot of the bottomless chips and salsa.  The other items on the menu I've had but I usually default to those.  The bar is great for late in the evening.  Its located right on the Las Vegas strip so it can get kind of spendy.  

I like also going there on my lunches and getting a quick burrito.  The service it fast and the view is great.
