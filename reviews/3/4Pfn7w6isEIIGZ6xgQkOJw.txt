I went last night after kickball for some after game festivities and had a fun night.  The food is good and pitchers of beer are cheap.  Plus they let us play flip-cup in the back.  =)  The only bad part of last night was I ordered a Blue Moon and it was $6.50 for the pint which is just outrageous so I went back to the cheap beers for the rest of the night.  The cheese crisps are very good here.
