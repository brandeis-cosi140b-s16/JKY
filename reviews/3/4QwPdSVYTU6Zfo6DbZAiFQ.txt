I first heard about Secreto in Phoenix magazine. This summer it proclaimed that Secreto has the best burrito in the Valley.  This seemed too good to be true, especially since the place is near my house.

Finally made it to Secreto this week and wasn't blown away. The food was good, but the burrito is not as good as the green chile burrito at Carlsbad Tavern.

Had the bacon wrapped shrimp appetizer. It was good, but for $12 I expected more than 4 shrimp.  The rice was delicious. Next time I'll skip the beans and ask for extra rice.  I liked the chickem better than the beef, will try the carne adovada next time. 

Knocked it down a star because the service was slow. Took two of us over an hour, which is sad because we were hungry.

There were several items on the menu that sounded good, so I'm going to give them another shot.
