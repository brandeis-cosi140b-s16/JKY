My husband and I visited this past week (tourists from texas) we ordered fajitas that were moderately priced. We enjoyed them! Cons: waitress was SLOW and not too upbeat, lighting was very DIM.. And the restaurant doesn't provide complimentary chips and salsa. 
Pros: Good spot, good eats and you can bring your own drinks in. Attractive waitresses and bartenders.
