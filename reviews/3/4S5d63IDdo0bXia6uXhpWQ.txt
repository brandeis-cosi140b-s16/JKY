We stopped here for happy hour as I was lazy and it is close to work. Turns out they have a decent happy hour with assorted drink specials, half off selected apps and a pick 2 food special that runs open to close for $6.99. I selected the Tortilla soup and cheese enchiladas. The soup was good and enchiladas was also good and came with rice and beans. Our server was great and I wish I remembered her name but after a couple of the happy hour Margaritas names escape me.
