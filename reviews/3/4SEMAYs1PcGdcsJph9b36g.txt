The food is delicious, the service is atrocious.

I really hate to leave a negative review for a vegan friendly place, but the service is just so terrible It has to be this way. I have tried to come to Tediberto's 7 times. Of the 7 times, they were closed 4 during business hours that they had posted on FaceBook. How can you expect people to come to an establishment when they are never open when they are supposed to be.

The food is incredible. Really. The tacos and the nachos are out of this world. Just don't expect to get your food in any reasonable amount of time. I waited 45 minutes one day for a 2-item takeout order. 

The first time I came the tables were still dirty from the night before, the owner recognized it, and yet we still had to ask her to wipe down the table. 

Definitely some major improvements needed.
