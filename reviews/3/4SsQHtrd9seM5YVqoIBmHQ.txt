I'm a big Mexican food fan! This Monterrey location in Matthews always seems to hit the spot. Stopped by recently on a Saturday evening for dinner. Got right in! I ordered the chimichangas w/ shredded beef, fried. I know, I know, they do offer an non fried option, too. Great flavors w/ the guac & sour cream & side of refried beans. Topped it off w/ an ice cold Dos Equis. Can you really ever go wrong w/ an ice cold Dos Equis? The wife tried the Taco Salad w/ chicken. I enjoyed that dish as well. Is this my go to Mexican restaurant? No, but on a Saturday night when I'm hungry and not in the mood to wait too long, this is a great option.
