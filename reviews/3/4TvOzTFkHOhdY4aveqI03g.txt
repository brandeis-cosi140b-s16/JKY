This is the 'Mexican' food I was raised on, peeps.  Macayo's is mother's milk to Vegas natives - at least to really, really Irish Vegas natives who consider the food at Macayo's 'Mexican.'

The poor waitresses are decked out in pink and blue flowing Mexican stylr dresses that are purely horrid.  They serve up RC cola, which makes me laugh.  The food really ain't that bad, but it really ain't that special either.  The chips and salsa still delight me to this day, though.  And not many things beat getting a TCT.  (Toasted Cheese Tortilla.  It's a giant quesadilla, besically, and they bring it out on a pizza sheet and rest it above the candle on the table that has a constantly low flame and can't really keep it heated anyway.  But man, that there's comfort food.)

I can't help it.  A part of me will always have random cravings for a little Macayo's, no matter how old or high-falutin' I might get.
