Decided to try this place today after driving by several times this past year. I had the bueno burger...it tasted all right, good concept with the way they grill. Thought the burger would be bigger seeing with how much it cost, but I get a burger patty for less price at a fast food joint. Plus, they told me its going up in price soon so it will cost even more.  I'll probably go back again but not get a burger.
