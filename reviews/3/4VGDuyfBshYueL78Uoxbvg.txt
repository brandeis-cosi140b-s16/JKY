Pasqual's is one of my fave places but last night I had to endure a waiter in training who forgot my celebratory Margarita, brought my food almost simultaneous to my appetizer (which I specifically requested he avoid doing), asked me how I liked my food before I'd had a single bite (then didn't come back to ask me for reals), forgot to ask me if I wanted desert, and never brought the bill. And to make things worse we had to listen to a SCREAMING child for over 45 minutes. Not my best experience there but I do still generally enjoy the food and atmosphere most of the time and will definitely try again sometime once I've made a full recovery. ;)
