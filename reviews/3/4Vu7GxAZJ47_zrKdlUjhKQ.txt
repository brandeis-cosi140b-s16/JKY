Food was good, service was fair.  We ate in the bar area, and a server from the dining room walked in, grabbed a cocktail napkin and blew her nose... Right there at the bar.  We weren't the only customers in there, either.  So it's ok to blow your nose in front of the bar customers, but not the dining room ones?
