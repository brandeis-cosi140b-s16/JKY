The service is good and the food has good flavor.  The cost is holding them back.  The food is priced too high for what you get.  The value is not there because the portions are small for the price.

I started with the queso fundido.  It has good flavor.  As an appetizer about three people could share this.

I then had the crispy potato rajas tacos.  They were quite tasty.  Once again the portion is the problem.  You get so little for your money.

Our servers were friendly and helpful.
