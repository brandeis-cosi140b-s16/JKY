Tried this place for lunch on Saturday despite some of the reviews about the service. There aren't that many Mexican restaurants in Madison or near my house.

So we walk in and wait to be seated, and it took at least 5 min to be seated. We got water and chips pretty quickly and they were good. Took about 5 more min for a server to come get our drink order. Took awhile to get our beers but they came in nice frosty mugs. 

We seemed to have two servers so I really couldn't tell who was the main one. 

The food was quite good for tex mex and I'd go back for it. I had tacos and enchilada sampler, my boyfriend had tamales and my son had the kids nachos. We all liked the food.

If the service had been great I would have given 4 stars but could not justify it for this visit.
