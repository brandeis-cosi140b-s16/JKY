Poncho's is one of my favorite spots to come to with my family & co-workers. The food is great and very rarely do I have any complaints on it. I would give it a 4 or even a 5 star if it weren't for the hit and miss customer service. The last time I was there for lunch with some co-workers, we had crappy customer service. Our waitress was very short and dismissive. She barely looked at us when talking to us. She slapped the receipt on our table and ran off. Didn't ask us if we needed anything else or if it was all on one bill. When we told her we were paying seperately, she took off again and brought us back our separate receipts. She was annoyed that we didn't tell her we wanted separate checks. Um.... she didn't give us a chance!
