Good food but pricey! 

Upon walking in, I was immediately greeted. The staff here is exceptional! It was my first time dining here as well as my friend. Wednesday's are half price with student IDs so we jumped in the opportunity. 

I ordered a chicken quesadilla and a soda. Salsa doesn't come with the chips you get with your entree. $7. I asked if that was before or after the discount. It was after. Thank goodness we came on Wednesday because I couldn't imagine spending $14 on what I got.

The food here is pretty solid. The salsa was good. My quesadilla was warm and fresh. The chips were seasoned well. 

Overall, great service and good food. Wouldn't return though due to price. The area has so many great alternative options to choose from for a comparable price.
