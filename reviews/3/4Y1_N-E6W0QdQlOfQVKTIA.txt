I understand what people are talking about when they say the service here is meh--I experienced just that yesterday.  

The food, however, is really pretty good.  The guacamole was delicious;  the oranges gave it a refreshing taste.  The sea bass torta was yummy, as well, with moist and well-seasoned grilled fish.  The margaritas were excellent, and I could tell they were freshly made.  Unfortunately, they arrived after we received the main course.  I really would have liked to enjoy the margarita with the chips and guac.  

Note for next time:  Don't order any food until I've received my drink!
