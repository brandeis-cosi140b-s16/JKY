Not a huge menu, but a nice selection of tacos, tortas, etc.  Server was nice and friendly, but wasn't knowledgable of what was on the menu. I asked about the appetizer "Antojitos" and had no idea. I asked him to find out, he comes back with vague descriptions with Spanish names I'm still not familiar with and neither is he. I once again asked to find out what is was. Really? I ordered it based in his description and it came out and was different than what he said. Normally, I'd send it back but was starving. Wasn't bad. It was mostly fish, we think. It included small potatoes croquettes, some type of cheese mini burrito, I think swordfish on a chip. We each ordered one taco, the crispy pork. I asked how big they were in case they were the small ones, I'd order two. His answer was "regular size".   I ordered it anyway and was a nice size and very flavorful. The rice and beans that came with it was DELICIOUS! I'd go back, but they need to school the staff on what the food is and their descriptions. I know a lot about food, but I'm no ethnic expert. Help me out Here!!
