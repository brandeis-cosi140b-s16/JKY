Sometimes you just have to have a Michalada and cheese enchilada....I was thinking this as I left work on Friday and decided to call two of my favorite people to join me.  Luckily, they were both available so I headed over and started with the Michelada part while waiting on them.  I had forgotten how good their bean dip is and put a lot of it away while waiting on my companions.  the enchilada was a tad disappointing though...I don't know if I was too full or too spoiled by other "New Mexican" joints in the hood but the sauce was lacking, in my opinion.  Still, for a quick Mexican fix, it's a good option.
