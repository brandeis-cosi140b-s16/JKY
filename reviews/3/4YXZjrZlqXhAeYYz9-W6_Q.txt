Overall not bad. You get A LOT of food for your money here, and that is always a perk. I had a chimichanga and it was pretty good. Wish it was filled with more stuff (the majority of it was the fried outside), but it still tasted good. Friendly staff. The salsas were probably my biggest critique. I thought they were all very very bland (flavorless) and not very spicy. It would have been nice if they had pico available too.
