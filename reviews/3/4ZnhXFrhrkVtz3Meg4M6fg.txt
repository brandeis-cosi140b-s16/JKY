This is not a bad place for lunch. I ordered a burrito in a bowl topped with chicken, cheese, salsa, onions, sour cream and parsley. It is very similar to Chipotle, however I still like Chipotle better. 

They have a couple windows seats that has a god street view, making it an ideal spot to people watch.
