This is likely one of the slowest Chipotle's ever. I come from a college community in Seattle where the line is extraordinarily long, however the employees at that location knock out the orders like dealing out cards in poker. They get me my good food fast.

The Fashion Show Mall location, however, literally takes forever. I don't know why. I think there's not enough hustle in people's step. Maybe they assume everyone's a tourist, so they take their time thinking the customer won't know better.

Sigh... I still come back though because the food is just too damn cheap and good.
