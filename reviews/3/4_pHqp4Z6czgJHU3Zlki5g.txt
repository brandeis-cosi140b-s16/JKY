They serve the simple "street" style tacos I like. I had one al pastor and one asada. Both tacos were tasty. The al pastor had a nice spice to it. I also had a green tamale that was really gross. All masa and barely any cheese or green chile they said was suppose to come in it. Can't seem to find a spot with good tamales around here. I also got a jamaica to drink and wished I had gotten the horchata that I initially wanted instead. It was watered down and sour without the sweet.  So basically... come here for the tacos... don't bother with anything else. 

*Note: I didn't receive this as I ordered take out, but there was a sign that said "free chips and salsa for dine in customers".
