The food here is far from authentic Mexican food, but is still tasty anyway.  The low marks are for bad service.  I've eaten at this location three times and two out of the three times receive rather poor service.

The first time I came here with my wife to eat dinner we were seated and then forgotten about.  We sat for about 20 minutes before I was able to flag someone down to get us some drinks and take our orders.  They usually have free chips and salsa, but we didn't get any until our dinner came, which kind of defeats the purpose.

As far as food goes, nothing I ate really stood out as wonderful.  They try to be too cool with their mango and other sweet-flavored salsas.  Maybe it's just not for me.
