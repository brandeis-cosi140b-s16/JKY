Taco Tuesday.
Fast becoming an institution in the landscape of Mexican food eateries. 
Only if you decide to come here, brace yourself. 

Filibertos has a ninety-nine cent taco that's enormous and, from outward appearances looks and smells delightful. 
Order two and a cup of water. The bill will come to just over two bucks. 

Now, take a bite out the the first taco and let the disbelief envelope you. How could anything that looks so good taste so bad?
Try the other. Yeah, no, it's crap too. 

Only one thing left to do.
Wrap them up and take them back to the office to feed the stray that's been threatening to disembowel you upon your arrival at the job trailer each morning.
Yes, I think you'll find, as I did, these tacos make a wonderful peace offering, allowing you ample time to open the gates and get safely inside the office before being brutalized. 

Anyway, the shell is cooked to perfection. I ate some of it along wit the lettuce and cheese. 
However, a weird thing happened while nibbling at it. 
When I picked up the taco to take a bite, in the typical taco-eating manner....listing to about 75 degrees, my lunch buddy interrupted my bite by droning on about something. 

Being the friend I am, I perched the taco close to my mouth and held it for a brief moment, all the while eye-signaling him to shut the fuck up so I could take a bite. 
He continued talking.
So now, pretending I was interested in what he was saying, I sat the taco back onto its plate but while doing so, I noticed a puddle of oil had managed to drain from the damned thing.
And it wasn't a small puddle. 
This was a three to four inch diameter puddle even BP execs would have admired.

So unless you find yourself in a tight spot with a threatening animal, or, you have a penchant for all things oily, there's no need to try the tacos here. 

Per my previous review, just stick with the bean burrito.
I think you have to work really hard to fuck-up beans.
