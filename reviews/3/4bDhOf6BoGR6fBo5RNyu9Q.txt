Got the two item combo plate. Picked two tamales as my choices. The tamales were almost all masa. The masa was good though. They were generous with the portion of beans, but stingy with the rice portion.

I might need to try a few more items before coming to a final ruling on this place, but for now, Roberto's blows this place out of the water.
