Tried this place based on reviews of fellow Yelpers and while the service is superior, the atmosphere is severely lacking (too cafeteria-like) and the food is good, but not exceptional. 

I tried the Cochinita (Sweet & Salty Pork) Torta, my first ever torta. It had a nice taste but the bread didn't seem that fresh to me. I was expecting more.
