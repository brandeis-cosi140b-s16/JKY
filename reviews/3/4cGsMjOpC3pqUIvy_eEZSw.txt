WHERE IS YOUR BARTENDER AT?! This is the second time that I've been here in the last month. Their karaoke DJ is hella bomb but their service leaves much to be desired. When my friend and I got there, the first thing that was on our mind, of course, was getting drinks. You're a bar on mill, of course that's what we want (you know your audience, right?) But, alas, no bartender in sight until I asked the security guy where he was at. It seemed that the bartender was some unkempt fellow, pudgy in the middle with a fauxhawk and some facial hair (good enough description?). He told me that he didn't have the ingredients for the few drinks that I requested, even seemed a bit confused as though he didn't know what I was even asking. No apple martini, no colorado bulldog. When I ordered a sex on beach (after our initial rum and coke, hard to mess up, yeah?), he still managed to make that wrong too. After a while, some older, probably more experienced lady came on shift(?) and made drinks better than this guy, who I might add, was also drinking from a plastic red cup and only helping customers when he was seemingly forced to...she did a good job and made drinks right. It's too bad that she wasn't there earlier, it would have made the entire experience a great deal better. This place would be miles and more above the top if they kept knowledgeable bartenders within their establishment. They are on Mill and thus should be up to par with at least mid-range cocktails. If only they had someone as talented as Mel (check the table-top graffiti on the table closest to the wall that faces the front, you know, that corner) then maybe they could have a super-awesome thing on their hands. Until then, it's up in the air. I don't see them as a bar that will last unless they are able to adapt to their surrounding and food offerings. 


ps. Big ups to John and the security guys for letting me use the restroom. You are very professional and should be around for a long while.
