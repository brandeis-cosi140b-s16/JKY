The prices are going through the roof and the choices are going down, not a great combination.
    My Barbocoa burrito was $7.70....and guacamole of course is still not included.
The next time they raise prices I will be heading for the hills. The meat was pretty good though and the burrito was still pretty big, but now it is getting big priced too. They also only offer one type of cheese now. 

    Ok, well to compensate for them raising prices, I now take a healthy handful of napkins and silverware home with me - it works out well for both parties.
