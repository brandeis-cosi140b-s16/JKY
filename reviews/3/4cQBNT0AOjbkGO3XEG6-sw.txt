Location is good and a welcome addition to the area.  Menu has the usual options and they seem able to accomodate special request fairly well if within reason.  Service really depends on your server and there have only been a couple familiar faces I've seen there since this location opened. 
Shared an entr√©e with my spouse after noshing on the chips and salsa.  Oof!  Didn't need half of that but it was tasting so good.
I liked the corn tortillas they used for the chips much better than the ones they use for their mini tacos.  Those things were so hard and thick.
Wish the server we had tonight had made the effort to clear dirty, empty dishes and things not being used from the table.  I felt as if he expected his buser to take care of those details.
It's just one of those things that figures in to the tip.
Overall it's okay here.  A bit o' the Mexican flavor, some ambience, a Margarita or two and it's probably most perfect for your our of town guests.
