food          3.5 to 4 *
service      3 *

While in Vegas, I got to go the many places and few made the list, some were bad, some good and some shouldn't be open if you asked me.

Dona Maria's has good food and bad service. we get there and waited for a few minutes to be seated. We sat in the back, close to the kitchen. It was a group of 6. some ordered shrimp soup, steak and shrimp, I got the tamal chile relleno combo. Almost everything was good, but what I got. I just decided that I should not get chiles rellenos at a restaurant because even if they are good they will never be as good as my family's recipe so, and also the tamal was ..... how can I put it? big, lots of corn masa, lots of dry chicken breast with almost no sauce at all. I was surprised because they do have tamal on the name so I guess not doing justice to it. every tamal is priced at over $4, really??? I could get 3 better bigger tamales for that $$ at my usual spot (lol not Vegas I guess)

The menu was extensive, unorganized and repetitive.

The service was kinda bad. Two people in the party ordered dished that came with tortillas, well only one of us got the tortillas really late in the dinner and they were cold.

The place is big colorful with a bar and decor that does not go with the rest of the place.

DMTR OK to good food, bad service avoid the tamales.
