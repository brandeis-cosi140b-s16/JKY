Time for an update..... the owner changed and so did their hours.. they seem to only be open for breakfast and lunch. This place had developed into our regular fish and chips place and burger joint... there is no more fish fry fridays when they aren't open friday nights... the burger was still good but some of the love is gone.. it just isn't quite the same. The limiting hours seem to be an impending omen of a sad future... hopefully things turn around and get back some of the love that went with the old ownership.
