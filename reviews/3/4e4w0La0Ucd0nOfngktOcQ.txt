Eh, it was alright. The lunch specials come with a huge amount of food- more than enough to warrant a siesta afterwards! I had the red chile burrito lunch ($7.99), which came enchilada-style, with rice and your choice of beans (Refried, charro, black).

We were promptly served chips and our waitress took our drink order quickly once we were seated. The chips were a huge portion and size, served with salsa and refried beans. The red chile was made with large chunks of beef. Although I appreciated that they used whole chunks, they were bordering on the side of being too large to eat with one bite. The whole meal itself wasn't too remarkable, but it had decent flavor and service was good as we made excellent time within our lunch break.
