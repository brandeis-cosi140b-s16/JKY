While I would prefer to go to Chipotle, those are all outside of the "Ballantyne bubble"... so when I am working and want to grab a quick burrito, I'll head over to the Qdoba at Stonecrest.  

This location is generally a lot busier than the Qdoba at the Arborteum, but the food quality is about the same. My favorite menu item here is the poblano pesto burrito w/chicken.  

I think the food here is better quality than Moe's at Ballantyne Village.
