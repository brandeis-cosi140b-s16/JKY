My workmates love this place - or at least we somehow keep going here. The food is tasty enough for what it is and I'm ok with the prices, but the service in the bar area is HORRIBLE. Hoping management reads yelp since the people at the bar are friendly but horribly inefficient and even though you've staffed sufficinently, it doesn't help if there are lots of customers and your team members are standing around chatting with each other, completely obivious to customers in this economy who want to spend money.
