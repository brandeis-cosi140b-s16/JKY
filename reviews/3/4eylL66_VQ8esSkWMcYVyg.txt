3 stars for the chips and salsa, oh and for the bites of the AZ burrito that my friend shared with me. I ordered the Mayan Torta as recommend by our waitress and I was so disappointed totally underwhelmed. The only thing overwhelming was the spices/marinade used on the chicken it was so over powering I couldn't taste anything else, not even the bacon! We also ordered the fresh guacamole which was really good, but not $10 good. I don't think I'll be trying this place again, too expensive and food just not worth the price it's like buying things name brand purely for the label even though the generic tastes just a good.
