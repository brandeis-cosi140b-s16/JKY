The fact that they have Negra Modelo on Tap is a good sign.The Atmosphere is phenomenal, and the house red salsa is probably the best in phoenix. The Salad that comes with the tacos is light and delightful. But the only thing worthy in the entire menu are the red pork tacos. the pickled red onion salsa that comes with the tacos is amazing but missing that habanero kick.. 
Order a Pacifico Michelada and you'll forget that you're in Phoenix.
