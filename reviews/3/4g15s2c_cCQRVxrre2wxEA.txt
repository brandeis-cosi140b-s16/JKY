When it comes to Mexican food, I rarely am wowed. Lafonda was more of the same: solid but not amazing.

I had a carnitas platter. The meat was bland, but I believe that was the intended style of the carnitas. The rice, beans and cheese were so-so. The tortillas were nothing special. 

Sometimes, a Mexican joint can have blah food but can win my heart with killer chips and salsa. Lafonda was just OK there, too.

However, I believe in the entire restaurant experience. And Lafonda is family owned, which counts for a lot. Seeing younger generations of workers who really care about the business and are working in T-shirts and shorts on a weekend, the way a weekend in Chandler should look,  means the world to me. They wanted to be there, and the service was genuinely friendly and speedy.

It's no Elmer's Tacos, but Lafonda has its charms.
