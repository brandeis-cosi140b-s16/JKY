My review has dropped a bit, but stands at a solid 3.5 star.  My main complaint about my recent experience is that the food was WAY OVERSALTED!  Like whoah!
But otherwise, it's still a nifty place. The service was excellent.  I still adore the upcycled aesthetic.  The owner even told me how to do the copper tables at home.  I REALLY hope they bring back the steak salad.
