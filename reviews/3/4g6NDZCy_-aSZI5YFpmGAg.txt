Chips are excellent!  Salsa is good and the hot salsa in the bottle is excellent. My wife ordered the fajita quesadilla and I got the beef Fajits. We were seated quickly and our waitress has been wonderful. Unfortunately the food is lacking greatly in seasoning. Great service great people just bad food.
