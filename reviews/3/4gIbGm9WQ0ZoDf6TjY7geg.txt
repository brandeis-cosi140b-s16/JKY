I had high expectations for this place, but for me it was just average. The concept is really cool, similar to a chipotle but with Hawaiian flavors.

Pros- the coconut bark is as awesome as everyone says. We got a 1/4 lb and I don't foresee it lasting the car ride home. Also, the salsas they have are pretty flavorful.

Cons- the chicken was waaay too salty, The service was friendly, but kind of awkward. Kind of like it was everyone's first week there.. The tacos came on flour tortillas that were waaay to big. 

Basically, I'm not to sure id come back but it was worth a try!
