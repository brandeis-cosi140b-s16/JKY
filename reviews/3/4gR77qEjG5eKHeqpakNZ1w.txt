Arrived early as we had a show to go to, wasn't very busy (it did pick by the time we left though). We were seated immediately, our waiter came right over and took our drink orders I had the house tequila, it was pretty  good, drank it slightly chilled, no training wheels. Wife had a mango margarita, it was delicious. The appetizer, chicken egg roll was not very good. Our entree's were just okay. I had fish tacos, they were fried I prefer grilled. My wife had vegetable enchiladas, she said they were "pretty good". Here's my big problem, the entire decor is Vince Neil / Mötley Crüe but the music was bland 80's crap. We were there about an hour, NO MOTLEY CRÜE SONGS! WTF? That's ridiculous. We would think twice about returning.
