I'd give this drive-thru place 2.5 stars if I could because it"s better than "Meh!" but not quite "A-OK." The generous filling of the overstuffed chicken and steak tacos was delicious, BUT the small soft tortillas were very flimsy and fell apart immediately. And their hot sauce was the least interesting I've ever tasted. There are a couple of picnic tables outside, but they looked kind of dirty. I wouldn't try to eat their tacos in your car. Way too messy, and they didn't even bother to throw plastic utensils in the bag.
