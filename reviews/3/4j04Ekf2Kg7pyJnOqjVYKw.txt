Good atmosphere but ordered the first  two drinks off the drink menu and was told they were out. The Corona Margarita was good and we ordered a few. Our meal came out and was not prepared the way we requested and was served with plastic silverware. Other tables had regular utensils and other employees were using real utensils as well. Was kind of a disappointment. Waitress also didn't know the hours of operation and suggested the wings as the best menu item as opposed to tacos, which seemed odd.  We made the most of the time we were there but I'm not sure that we would return again.
