Food was only ok here. Wasn't what I was used to like back home in California. A good thing about this place is that they give you good size portions for a good price. They have a good happy hour here as well for margaritas and beers. The place is comfortable with dinning availability upstairs and downstairs.  Again the food was quality was average. If you are looking for a place to satisfy your hunger then this is your place.
