Airport food prices for food that is just OK.  The taco salads are very large, and have a lot of meat in them (Choice of chicken or carnitas).  I had the salad with carnitas, which had a nice smokey flavor to the pulled pork.  I didn't see any vegetarian options on the menu, and the menu itself is very limited, consisting of items such as tacos, burritos, and taco salad.
