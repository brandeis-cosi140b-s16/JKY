I would love to give them the five stars, but experience speaking it wasn't that great. 

Service was good, the people there were so friendly and totally willing to help. I definitely did not take their five star away because of that. 

The reason why the fifth is missing is because...THEY WERE OUT OF EVERYTHING!!! it was a super sad day when we got there. They had nothing left. Good for them and business, but not good for me. I have been wanting to go to CF for a long time now and finally made it out.

They were out of tamales!! Out of all these different meats...I had no choice what to pick and was relegated to choosing empanadas that i really didn't care for (the filling wasn't the ones i wanted). They were okay, but only snack sized...that might be good in the case of my gut. 

Me and my group had the corn chowder...so many improvements could have been made in this.. I felt like this dish was a little half....you know what i mean... Contemplating it over I have to take another star out because the chowder was wiggidy wack... it was more of a soup than a chowder...

All in all, I want to go back so they can reclaim some stars from me, but i want to go back when they actually have stuff and aren't closing in an hour



Recommendation get there early or call in and see what they still have before showing up. If they are out of stuff it isn't worth your time..
