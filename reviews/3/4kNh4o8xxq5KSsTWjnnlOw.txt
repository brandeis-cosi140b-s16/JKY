The last visit left a dog food taste in my mouth and I wasn't eager to come back. We decided to give it another try. 

We got a shrimp bowl and a fish bowl. I'm happy that compared to Chipotle they have more meat, topping and sauce options as it made for a pretty decent bowl. We both liked the fish bowl better which neither of us thought we would (but ordered it because they ran out of shrimp to make two bowls). 

I'm open to going to this place again specially since there's healthier options. Seems like there is generally lesser sodium in Zabas food than Chipotle by the taste, but I could be wrong. I've googled around and most nutritional information on this place is incomplete or very general with just a calorie count.
