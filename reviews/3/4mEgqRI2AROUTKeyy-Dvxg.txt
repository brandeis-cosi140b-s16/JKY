I came here on Saturday night to celebrate a friend's birthday. These types of places are not usually my cup of tea, I prefer a cool lounge or bar for cocktails with friends.  Nonetheless, I figured their margaritas couldn't be too bad. 

We arrived around nine and already people were drunk, singing karaoke on stage and participating in games the staff were organizing. I've never been to a Señor Frogs in Mexico, but I imagine this is what their spring break must look like. They even had champagne showers...

We headed outside after a while and I must admit that it wasn't that bad. I used to love coming here when the place was Social House, that terrace is awesome! We ended up ordering some yards of margaritas (I know, how cliché) and enjoying the Sirens show up close. The drinks were expensive though. 

I guess I didn't have such a bad time since I left at two, which is super late for me.
