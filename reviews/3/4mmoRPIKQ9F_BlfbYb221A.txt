Just your average Mexican restaurant. Better than Las Margaritas but definitely not the best Mexican you've ever had. Cool for what it is, but not all that. However, I've been back a couple times as I have yet to find better bang for your buck Mexican here in Charlotte. You can fill up on a good meal here for cheaper than Chipotle. The salsa is really good. Service is always good too. And they have a free ice cream cone machine, that's a plus.
