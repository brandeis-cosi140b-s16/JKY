Kids menu: B, we didn't actually see the kids menu but the server said they could do just about any item on the menu in a kids size. So for that, they get a B!

Kids review: The beef and bean burrito had too many beans, not enough meat. We liked the rice and beans. And churros!

Parents review: We only ordered beverages on this visit Order the top shelf margarita, so smooth and not too sweet! They also have Dos Equis Amber on draft served in tall, icy mugs. The food looked fine but nothing to write home about.
