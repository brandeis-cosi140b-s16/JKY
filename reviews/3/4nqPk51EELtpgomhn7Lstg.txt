The atmosphere isn't very good. The restaurant is old and dirty looking, definitely needs some updates. That said, I've always found the food to be surprisingly good and very reasonably priced. If you're looking for a posh environment with flawless authentic Mexican food, skip this place. If you want good food, a big ass Margarita, don't want to spend a lot of money and aren't picky about your surroundings, then I would recommend checking it out.
