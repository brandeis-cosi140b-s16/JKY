Just to say that I have had "Del Taco", I made it a point to have lunch here.  I had the fish tacos, which were OK.  The fish was more like fish sticks you would make for your kids, and that put me off a little.  It tasted ok.  I washed that down with a diet soda and some of their soggy crinkle-cut fries.  Saving things slightly was I ordered a plain beef taco, and that was pretty good.  
The service was actually really good.  Definitely a step-up from some of the other fast food establishments.
Well, I guess I can say that I have had Del Taco now.
