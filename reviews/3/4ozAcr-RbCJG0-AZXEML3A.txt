After I vowed never go to Lindo Michoacan again, my GF's dad's birfday came up and I was screwed...D:

Given, this was a different location than the one I usually go to (DI and eastern,) I was hope full on this other location not sucking. And luckily it wasn't as bad. 


Let me get rid of the bad... The food still suxx... I ordered a burrito, yes it was huge. They need to put on the description that it is shredded beef. Me no like shredded beef. 

Now the good, the reason this gets 3 stars. 

What this place has always had is excellent service, not gonna lie, probably the best anywhere. My gf's dad has a mean old temper and is impatient. Every time it looked like he was about to blow up, the waiter took charge and explained the situation, calmed him down and made it look easy. 

This place seemed to accommodate my 2 year old very well! Best service for a 2 year old anywhere. Nice clean black high chair with cushion (Lexus of highchairs,) brought out a special sippy cup with coloring paper and crayons. AND she got her soup fast, so that she wouldn't get impatient while we ordered. Not too bad at all. 



Lindo, sorry but your food still super sux.
