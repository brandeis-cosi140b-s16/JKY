I've never been a huge fan of this place although I've been eating here for about a decade or so. Over the years, this place has been hit with multiple health code violations - make no mistake. It's an unclean place. Most of their ingredients come from huge cans or vats - they don't really "make" anything there as far as I know. It's all shitty crappy food. The shredded beef is dry and tough and looks like charred rat tails. I guess when it's the closest mexican food place still open after hours that isn't Taco Hell, it becomes the best option. 

It's edible and gets the job done, but it's not very good food. I'd never choose to eat there if any other halfway decent mexican food place was open at the time. This place wins by default only. Hell, I'd rather eat at Filibertos and they got busted for serving cat meat.

Another charming thing about Los Betos is that they make up the prices in their heads. You could order the same exact thing there every single night of the week and they would charge you seven different prices. It's bizarre, but amusing. Their food is really cheap anyway, so it's not like it matters.
