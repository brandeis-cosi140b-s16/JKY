I love the nachos florentine in this restaurant  it's really good. I was disappointed  last time I came though, they are advertising  breakfast so I came. I was the only one in the place. I ordered  their breakfast  burrito  and my only request was no salsa. My tummy was acting  up that morning so I specifically  did not want  anything  to irritate it. My order came and it looked  really good. I took a big bite and I almost  choked. They put salsa in the burrito. After  that I couldn't eat it anymore. I asked the server what happened? He was apologetic  but my breakfast was ruined now. They replaced with out the salsa but now  I'm  late and didn't the time to enjoy and eat it . I decided just to go and take it with me. When I got to work  it was already dry and couldn't  eat it. And for the rest of the day my tummy  was upset and I couldn't eat anything. It's the worse feeling.
