Been going here for years but I find myself enjoying the quality of food less and less. Went to the new location tonight and it is a beautiful restaurant. Here's my breakdown

Pros
Server was friendly and attentive 
Refills of salsa were consistent and before we had to ask
Large portions
Bar seating allows full menu Service
Fun, cheerful atmosphere

Cons
Chips are bland and flavorless
Food is drowning in cheese-so much so that it "Americanizes" the dish 
Flavors are bland and cheesy
Cheese Crisp is cheese melted on a tortilla. So many places crisp them and they are so much better
Spanish rice was gummy and flavorless
