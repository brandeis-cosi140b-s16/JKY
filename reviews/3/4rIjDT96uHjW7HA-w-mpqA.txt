The service was good but I got the 'pollo poblano' entree and it was so not appetizing. The rice and bean stuff was fine but ugh I am never getting that again. They gave us some chips and salsa. The salsa was too liquidy. It sort of seems like as thought they added much more water into it. The dessert thing that they just gave us was interesting. So technically got an appetizer an dessert for free and they give you more so that's nice
