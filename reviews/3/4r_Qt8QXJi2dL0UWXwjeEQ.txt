Azteca...sure....why not. I rolled in here on a Saturday afternoon while I was running some errands in the neighborhood. My craving for Mexican was taking over and Yelp led me here. 

Hubs and I were politely greeted and seated in a big 'ole comfy booth. The surroundings are reminiscent of a Chi-Chi's if you've ever had the unfortunate experience of visiting one. Mexican inspired and, well, Aztec-y. The chips were toasty and tasty but the salsa left me a bit sad. No chunks present - just watery blah. But no matter, the guacamole guy came rolling down the aisle and offered us some green magic. We asked for spicy guacamole and it was indeed full of heat...and flavor! My only gripe? For one avocado, the guac price was $7.95...that's steep IMO. 

Onto the entrees...I ordered the enchilada & tamale combo. This option came out on a massive, shallow plate. MASSIVE and covered in sauce and or cheese. Hmph. I *think* the enchilada flavors could have been nice but the cheese dumbed down most of it. The enchilada far superseded the tamale - which was super, duper bland and cakey. The refried beans and rice were standard and nothing to write home about. Meh.

While the service was friendly and efficient, the meal also ended on a sweet note with those crispy cinammon bites with a dab of whipped cream and strawberry sauce. Free little chips of wonder - I could have easily eaten five of them in a snap. Will I head back to Azteca? Perhaps, if I'm in the neighborhood and positively craving Mexican...but I'm not rushing back here anytime soon.
