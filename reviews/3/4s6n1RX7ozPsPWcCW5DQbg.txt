Went to lunch on a Friday afternoon here. Since I have been to Tacos El Gordo so many times I wanted to give these guys another try since the first time was the Taco Trek UYE months ago (Thanks Nelson Q!).

I was pretty hungry so I was thinking the standard Carne Asada Burrito would fill me up based on the tacos I got last time. If you  refer to my pic, the burrito was not all that big. In fact, if you don't tell them you want it with everything (which is cheese, guacamole, and sour cream for an extra 1.50), all that's in there is just the meat and beans. So for 5.75 you get a tiny burrito. Add the 1.50 just so you can a little more stuffing in it. I paid a total of 7.84 with tax. Now I don't know about you guys, but lots of other places would give you a huge burrito for that price. So yes, I was a bit disappointed.

While I was eating, I noticed a majority of the patrons were Caucasian. Weird. If you go to Tacos El Gordo, its mainly Mexicans. So what am I missing? Are you telling me that Los Tacos is more of an Americanized establishment? Don't get me wrong. To me there's nothing wrong with that. It just didn't look right. 

Some other things I noticed: They don't have a salsa bar. They do have salsa verde in squeeze bottles on just about every table. I guess you have to ask them for other sauces on the side if you don't like the green sauce which I thought is pretty good.

Next couple of visits I will try the Shrimp Ceviche Tostada because I saw somebody order it and scarf it down. I was so tempted to interrupt their first bite just so I can ask to take a picture of it. LOL.
