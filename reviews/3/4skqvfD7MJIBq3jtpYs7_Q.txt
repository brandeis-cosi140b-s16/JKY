Wow! This is a tough one...

This place smelled like shit.   No other way around it. Came in and all the tables where up and things were being cleaned. I wondered if maybe someone had an accident.

Still wanted a Arizona (California) Burrito so I hooked it up. There 2 red salsas are both kind of watery and to make it worse there was a fly constantly buzzin around my head. Still though.. I felt there should be. It was a great burrito. It was huge also. 

This place is kind of like the Mexicanization of a Americanization of a Taco Burrito place.  And I am happy with that..  The kind of place if I lived in the area I would probably come back to every week.

And they have Tamarindo Jarritos.. which i love!
