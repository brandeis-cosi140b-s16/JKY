Doug was our server and was fantastic!  Other than that...drinks were ok, tacos were small, yet tasty. We tried the short ribs, the bbq pork, steak, carnitas and shrimp tacos. The rice was awesome while the beans were mediocre....black and pinto. Happy hour was kinda lame. I wouldn't choose this place but wouldn't be opposed to going back.
