Mama Mi Casa! For one of the most visually stunning restaurants I can think of, the subpar service speaks volumes.
I've been here multiple times, and usually eat at the bar but have eaten in the dining room. The menu has a nice vairiety, and prices are reasonable. The chips and salsa is very good, and one of my faves at any Mexican restaurant. I recommend the steak & shrimp,the avocado fries and the desserts. 
Be prepared to wait, to get drinks, and usually to order.
