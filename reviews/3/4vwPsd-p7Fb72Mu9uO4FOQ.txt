I came here during lunch time for the first time where it's located at the epicenter. 

It has a nice atmosphere with the outside patio and TVs located everywhere throughout. The service started off good but went down here from there. I only ordered three tacos but it took nearly 20 min to receive my food. When I finally received my food, it wasn't as great as the pictures make them look. In my humble opinion, they were lacking in flavor. Overall, my experience here was just Ok.
