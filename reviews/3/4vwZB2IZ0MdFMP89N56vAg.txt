Usually the food is consistent but in the last two weeks I was given the wrong food and our two taco salads had very stale chewy shells with some brownish questionable lettuce on the bottom.  It is a salad after all so big green crunchy lettuce is important.
We also tried the newer margarita cupcake. They looked okay but we had to take them home so they probably would have looked okay had we eaten it there. The lime wedge on top was a cute touch but the frosting reminded me of whipped Crisco mixed with a little powdered sugar.
