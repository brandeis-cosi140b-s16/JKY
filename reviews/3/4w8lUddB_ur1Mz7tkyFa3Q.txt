I love chipotle but hate this location! The last 3 times I went something went wrong. First time my husband and I had burritos with cold meat!! Gross! Sure enough the manger tried the meat and it was cold. Second time I wanted steak but they were out so I had to wait 15 minutes until it was cooked. Finally last night I went hoping it would be ok. Wrong!! They were now out of white rice!! It will be awhile before I go back to this location!
