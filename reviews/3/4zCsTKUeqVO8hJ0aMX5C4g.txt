Carlsbad Tavern is a very nice find that is right next to where I live.  That will be great when I can drink it up and just walk home without having to worry about a DUI!  

I came here with my dad, so my entrees were strictly vegetarian.  I could smell the seafood and could tell the specialties here are more seafood oriented.  I will have to update this once I try something like a crab enchilada, but the smell was wonderful.  The flavors in my vegetarian burro and my dad's blue corn cheese enchiladas were amazing.  It wasn't so hot spicy, but there were a lot of amazing flavors.  If you get an item, I do highly recommend them to put easy on the cheese because I felt like half my plate had melted cheese.  I got a skinny margarita to go along with it.  

The one downside is that they don't offer complimentary chips and salsa.  We actually ordered some, and it came after our food.  I was a little bit disappointed by the cost of it and the late delivery, which is why I give it a 3-star.  This will probably change after another visit, but this is just my first impression.
