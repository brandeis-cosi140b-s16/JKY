fili b's is strictly a late night post booze place-i would never go here during daylight hours. 

that being said, it's actually pretty good and a heck of a lot better than your other 24 hour drive through options. not once have i gotten sick, had a stomachache, or had "use your imagination digestion issues" like other people on here have complained about. and since it's one second from my house i've eaten here more times than i can count. no issues ever. 

i usually get the chile relleno, arizona burrito, or the country burrito. all are huge and can be easily split with your closest drinking buddy. and it's only proper to douse all the food in tons of red sauce (i always ask for extra and they happily comply) and to get a large horchata to complete the meal!
