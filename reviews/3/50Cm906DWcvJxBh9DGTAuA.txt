The first time I ate here I hated it. The second time I loved it.

The jerk chicken rice and black beans is the best thing on the planet, but  the meat is notsogood here. The flavor is great, but the meat itself is so cafeteria quality cheap that it ruins it.

Great concept. Almost awesome. Get better product and you win.
