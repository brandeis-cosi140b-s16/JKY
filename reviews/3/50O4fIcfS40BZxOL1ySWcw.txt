Calling all spicy chili lovers!  This restaurant specializes in New Mexican fare (think red and green chili).  It's a true hole-in-the-wall, not fancy at all, laidback and casual eatery.  Their menu says they don't know how to make "mild" spice, and this is definitely true.  I'm usually a medium spice eater, but after munching on their chips and salsa, my mouth was burning and I was starting to sweat!  It was tasty, don't get me wrong.

I figured I couldn't endure much more heat, so I ordered their Carnitas plate (it was one of the few items on the menu without a SPICY indication).  It came with LOTS of meat, rice, brown beans, and a thick flour tortilla.  The dish was totally mild, not a bit of spice anywhere in it.  I added some spice by adding some salsa to it, and it ended up being balanced quite nicely.

So overall, it's typical Meixcan fare, with a New Mexico twist.  If you're into super duper spicy, you'll want to check this place out.

One tip - it's a little hard to find at night bc they don't have a light up sign.  The name of the restaurant is just painted in huge letters on the front of the building.
