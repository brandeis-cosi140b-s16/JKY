I went to Tacos Kissi because my boyfriend had gone and told me that they were pretty good. Plus, they had "Mexican sushi" and he wanted to try that. They had several different kinds of sushi (probably 10 different ones), but they all were fried and had cream cheese.  I don't remember which one we got, but I remember that it was kind of greasy and had too, too much cream cheese. I didn't like it and would not order the "Mexican sushi" again. I really have no idea what even made it Mexican.  No salsa. No jalapenos. Nothing Mexicany about it.
I also ordered a carne asada torta, which was pretty average, but still delicious.  I would definitely go back, but not for the sushi.
