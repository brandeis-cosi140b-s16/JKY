It's way better than Roberto's taco shop but that doesn't really justify the high price of a california burrito unless it's the size of my forearm (seriously you can get an el grande burrito at cotija's that's bigger than your forearm on bonita in chula vista for the same price).

I'd pick this place over Roberto's.
