I'm giving it a three because the second waiter was better than the first. Second time trying this restaurant.

Maybe because I'm pregnant but I'm not a fan of the food. I had the street tacos as an appetizer and the diablo pasta as the main dish. I split the tacos with my friends husband. They lacked flavor and the meat was cold. The diablo pasta with jerk chicken tasted horrible, made me nauseated, so I returned it. I put a little salt on the dish and it didn't help. Needless to say, I won't return.
