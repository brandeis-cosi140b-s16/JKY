When restaurants.com was having their 80% off sale and I was booking a 46 hour trip to Vegas for a friend's wedding, I grabbed a certificate for Las Palmas. Getting there was interesting... It wasn't horribly easy to spot from the road as it's in the inner circle of a shopping center. My husband and I visited on a Friday afternoon and the large restaurant had 5-6 tables of customers. We were greeted promptly by a friendly server and seated at a 4-top with arm-chairs that seemed too small for most of the customers and given chips and salsa. The menus had photos of the food which I've always been told is NOT a good sign, but I didn't find it to be so bad. I had a bean burrito and the husband had... shrimp fajitas (If memory serves). Nothing was very memorable but we enjoyed what we ate just fine... except the iced tea. It tasted like it had been sitting out for a week, but seeing someone else's review, maybe it was from a machine and that's why it was disgusting. Barf. 

I would LOVE to go back on a night when the mariachi band is there and give this place a more stellar review. I was eying the huge dance floor and stage the whole time we were there just envisioning the fun that could be had. Maybe next time we're in Vegas... although i don't see that happening anytime soon.
