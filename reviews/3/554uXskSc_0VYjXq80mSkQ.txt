This is one of the better Baja Fresh locations in Las Vegas. I frequently grab a bare burrito here after the movie. It's located in the food court in the Texas Station casino. There's lots of seating (but it's smack in the middle of the casino so you will smell smoke while you dine, yuck) and free soda refills. Their salsa bar is tasty too. It's your typical Baja Fresh food but I think the cooks here are better than at some of the other locations in town. Sometimes they run a coupon deal where you get a freebie or discount when you show your movie ticket stub from the adjacent Regal Cinemas so be sure to ask before you order.
