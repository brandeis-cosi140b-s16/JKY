I'll keep this short and sweet.  

The food is standard PennaMex.  Think Mad Mex, but not as good.  The chips have been stale two out of three times.  The chicken tacos were bland--cumin, cayenne, black pepper, cilantro...any or all would have been welcome.  The guac just made me sad--and tears of guac depression could have only improved things.

The draft beers are small and the "yinzerita" makes me want to punch someone.  The regular marg is all shades of awful--the mix is just bad and there's either too much or not enough salt.  The music selection can be fun.  The bros are always in high numbers here if you're looking for chest bumps and high fives.

Why did I give it three stars?  It's totally fine on a summer night with a few friends on the top floor either before 11pm or not on a weekend.  Or it's okay for sitting at the bar on the second floor and enjoying a whiskey--the top shelf liquor selection there is decent .  I've only had terrible and very slow service at top bar and at the tables on all floors, but I've found the security staff and second floor bartenders to be super nice.  It's a bro bar on the new Walnut Street, so take it as what it is.
