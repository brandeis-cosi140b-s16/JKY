Discovered this place by accident.  Like the other reviewers I love the architecture and decor. The glass flowers are reminiscent of Dale Chihuly glass work.  I wonder who did it?  Also this place is massive in size.  They could easily fit several large banquette parties in here at once. 

Now to the food.  The chip dip and salsa, served promptly are nice and pretty spicy. I loved it. I had the Tortilla soup which was very good and served with a fresh Flower Tortilla, the way I like it.  I also had a Green Corn Tamale A LACarte, because that is one of my staple foods and I could get that I thought was a good barometer on a place by ordering this.  Unfortunately it was served barely warm, nearly cold.  And it appeared to have Spinach in it?  I have never Green Chili Peppers served like that. 

My dining partners all ordered Burritos or Chimi's and the server recommended their blanco Sauce, which contained small pieces of jalepenos.  I tasted everyone else's Blanco Sauce and it was very good. 

The service at Eva's was very good. From the Hostess, to the server and the bus staff.  Very Good.  

Another thing that happened and I can understand that this is a family restaurant and they are trying to create a fun and lively atmosphere but I just cant stand places that have the entire staff come out and sing happy birthday to a customers, a-la Show style.   I just think it's cheap and corny.  But I also understand that many people like it and I am in the minority here. 

I will go to Eva's again if and when I am ever in Casa Grande and need a good meal.
