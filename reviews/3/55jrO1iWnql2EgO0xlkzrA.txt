We live nearby and have visited a few times. Every time we go, the dining room looks trashed. If they cannot keep the restaurant clean, then I would hate to inspect the kitchen. 

The food is somewhat tasty, but pricey. Too expensive for eating in the messy dining room. I don't mind paying for good food, but if I cannot enjoy it without worry over my health then it is definitely worth skipping this place by driving down Camelback Road toward the city center.
