OK so I end up here for lunch only because the place I wanted to go didn't open till 4pm.

It's really beautiful inside, there is alot of elements working, chain, leather, iron, wicker, wood, very upscale modern but comfortable too.

First off I notice that the menu is a bit different than the one shown 
on-line, specifically the description for the tortilla soup. Needless to say, I did not get it.

We asked a few question and come to find out that none of the entrees are served with rice and beans? WTF!! 
So you would have to spend $4 for a side of beans and $4 for a side of rice on top of your entree price which is anywhere from $14 and up.

I'm all about having a good meal at any cost but that seems absurd.

Chips and 3 salsas were served, they were all pretty good, nothing spectacular.(see pics)

I ordered the tostada with no meat and the Mr. ordered the fish tacos (see pics)

My tostada was really good, I dare say a 5 star tostada. I liked it alot. However  the menu said "chicken tostada $9"  and I was still charged $9 for NO MEAT..........that was pretty uncool.

The fish tacos looked pretty, he kept saying they were good, but his face did not tell me the same story and he does not know fish tacos like I do, I tasted the fish.....blech........soooo soooo fishy MY God! and no flavor either, just dredged in flour and flash fried.

3 solid stars, not bad ,not extraordinary, not worth rushing back to

To me the Tempe Market place along with this restaurant are very, very touristy. I've got better places to be Thank You Very Much!
