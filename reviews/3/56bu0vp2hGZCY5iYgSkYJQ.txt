Food: plenty options for all palates, many healthy choices, three vegetarian options which were very tasty (we tried them all), the food was served steaming hot (in every sense of the word steaming)

Price: somewhat expensive, a table of three paid over $50 plus tip for essentially fajitas with no appetizer or desert, typical for Shadyside though

Drinks: BYOB with cork fee

Atmosphere: we sat outside, the patio is very nice, nicely lit, plenty of space for each table, covered from above from rain

Service: not very friendly, and incredibly slow, we waited 40 minutes for our meals from the time we placed our order, our drinks were not refilled during that time or during dinner, waited forever for the check, and they were not that busy at the time

(+): great location, good food, nice atmosphere

(-): too expensive, slow service, not unfriendly but not cordial service

Would I go back again? Maybe
