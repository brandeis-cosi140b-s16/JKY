Abuelo's was pretty decent, it's definitely not my favorite restaurant but worth trying. I went here for my birthday dinner and they have really good happy hour specials every weekday, which is really cool! But the happy hour specials only apply if you sit in the bar area, luckily we grabbed a booth but I thought that was a little odd. I had 2 Margarita Mugs for 2.99 each! 

The service was excellent and the restaurant was clean. 

My fiance and I split the fajitas for two which has a good selection. We got to pick 4 fajita fillers (chicken, steak, Yucatan shrimp, and roasted veggies). You also get to pick 4 sides. The food was just OK. 

I do plan on returning to leave a better review.
