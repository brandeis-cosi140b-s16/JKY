The food is good. Plenty of choices to choose from. So far I've tried the sangria and the house strawberry margaritas. The drinks were not spectacular. The food was delicious. The service was lacking. I'm sure they were super busy for cinco de mayo. Still, it was pretty bad. We didn't get our waters refilled. My coworker wanted a chicken and cheese quesadilla, plain. She received two little flour tortillas folded over like tacos with cheese & chicken. They were sooooo tiny and charged a regular priced meal....
