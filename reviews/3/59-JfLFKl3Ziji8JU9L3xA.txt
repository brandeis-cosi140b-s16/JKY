The food here is good and the place is nice...not super clean but I didn't expect that clean of a place around lunch time...I got a burrito, chips and a drink a bit  pricey for just that.  The burrito was good nothing special about it...but what really stood out were their chips. Those are the best chips I have ever eaten, so good you don't even need salsa fit them.  If I were to go back it would be to get more chips.
