We've been here three times. 

The good, the wait staff has been really good except for the last time. She might have been having an off night so it's ok. Also, the drinks and bar tenders are really good. I can come to this restaurant and order something and it will come out the same every single time. We've almost come just to drink for this exact reason. If it wasn't such a long walk, I have no doubt we would.

The bad. The food here really isn't good compared to other Mexican restaurants, I've had three different meals worth of food and the only thing I even kind of liked was the pibil. The second time we were there the server said that the menu was in the process of being redesigned. 

Overall, this is a great watering hole and the food serviceable but nothing to write home about.
