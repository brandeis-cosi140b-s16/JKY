Stopped in for a quick bite today to recharge.  Got a basic beef and cheese burrito with salsa and sour creme along with some black beans.  I probably would pass on the black beans next time, but they were good, just not the right taste for my burrito.  

Given all the variety of how to make the burrito, really the end product is up to you!  

I would not be so crazy as to call this healthy food, but it sure beats a greasy burger.  (What doesn't?)

Anyways, worth a repeat.  The service was quick and alert.  The staff there was nice, and not zombified.  Well worth the visit!

Enjoy!
