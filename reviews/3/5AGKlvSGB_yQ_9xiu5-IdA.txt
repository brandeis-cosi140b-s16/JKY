Rubio's is right by my house and I was starving one day on my way home. I ran in just to get chips and salsa because I am a gluten free vegan (most of the time) and when I mentioned this to the manager he made up a meal for me so I could have a full lunch. Awesome customer service! My meal was delicious too!
