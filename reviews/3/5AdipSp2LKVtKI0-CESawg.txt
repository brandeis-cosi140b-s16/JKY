I went here with two co-workers for lunch.  We were under a time crunch and were worried when we saw all the cars in the parking lot.  We walked in and were seated immediately.  The server (unfortunately I did not get her name) quickly got our drinks and food orders.  Our food arrived very quickly, and we were finished in no time.  Our server even took our bills for us so we would not have to wait at the register with all the other people who were leaving.

As far as the food, I was pleased with mine.  I got the lunch special number 3 (enchilada and taco with beans and rice).  It was on par with what I expected.  One of my co-workers got a bean burrito.  She was pretty sure the sauce on the burrito was pizza sauce, and that seemed a little weird.

I will keep this in mind the next time I only have a few minutes for lunch.  I think we were in and out in about 30 minutes.
