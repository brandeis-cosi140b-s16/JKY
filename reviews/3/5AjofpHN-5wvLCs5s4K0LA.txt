I have eaten here on several occasions for lunch, and have really enjoyed my experience here.  They have a great menu with fair prices, and a good amount of food to fill just about anyone up!  Service here is always quick and friendly, and I usually enjoy my time here.  

The only downside, is that this place always seems to be insanely busy every time I go on lunch during the week.  I don't always have time to blow 20 minutes on my lunch to go here, but when I do, I always get really good food.  I've been getting the tacos here when I do eat at Baja, and thier pretty darn good.  They even have a salsa bar in the corner!  Minus the lunch time rush, this place is worth a stop in to eat at, any day of the week.  I will be back in the future for more!
