Second visit at Braddah's and I was not as impressed as the first time. We ordered the burrito and bowl. The 2 chili pepper (medium hot?) salsa was not spicy at all. Both orders just didn't have very much of a kick- sort of bland in flavor. Even the kahlua was a little bland. Boo. 
The coconut bark made up for the meal. Order that!
