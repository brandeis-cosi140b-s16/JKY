One star because Taco Bell serves generic and fairly bland food that makes my stomach hurt.  Add another 2 stars for this particular Taco Bell because it has fast and friendly customer service.  So thumbs up for this Taco Bell location and thumbs down for Taco Bell in general. 

Got dragged here by someone that wasn't willing to trust a local Vegas tacqueria.  She only wanted Taco Bell.  Meh.  Tried the nacho cheese taco they've been marketing.  It's bland and uninteresting.  Not sure how they managed to make nacho cheese Doritoes bland, but they did.  Eh.  I guess it could be worse.
