I thought canteen was going to be a little less filled with college kids during the day and gave it a try. Though the place wasn't busy, my server was missing for the entire meal. The food was actually pretty good though. I tried a couple different tacos and all were tasty, and happy hour there is cool, has half off a lot of good tequila. Overall, the Happy hour makes it worth going.
