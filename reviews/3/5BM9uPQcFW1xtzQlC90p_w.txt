You can tell Jose had a lot of fun creating the menu at China Poblano. I just wish I would have enjoyed more of the overall experience.

Don't get me wrong, the staff was great. We were promptly seated at 8 p.m. (we made a reservation and I suggest y'all do the same).

I liked the guacamole because it had the right amount of heat. My noodle bowl loaded with veggies was a great drinking base. The tacos were tasty (albeit tiny). The portions are small and the prices are high. Two people in our party felt ill after eating the shrimp. 

What I didn't plan for was the bench seating. I was wearing a very short dress plus high heels, as we were going straight to Marquee after dinner, and I had a very difficult time getting up from my seat without flashing the guys behind me.  And yeah, the skeezy old dudes at the table next to us were waiting to catch a glimpse. 

This place was a great way to pregame before heading into Marquee but it wasn't a whole lot of bang for the buck, plus that bench was really tough on my sequined-covered booty.
