My first experience with Carlito's and they were out of RICE.  Isn't rice a major staple for Mexican food??? I wasn't told until I had already ordered & was sitting at a table waiting for several minutes. It was still early in the day (lunchtime).  I felt like it was a little early to run out of rice - poor planning.  I had ordered a veggie burrito; so, the rice was a significant ingredient for me - very disappointing.  I decided to go ahead & see what it tasted like anyway.  I was encouraged by the flavor of the green chile and the red chile.  Thus, the higher rating.
