This place is sort of a dive bar meets a decent cantina. This place offers great values. The liquor and food is priced reasonably. The Mexican food was decent and better than I expected based on the d√©cor and menu display. 

The service was great but the waitresses were so attentive that it was almost a negative thing. Many patrons could view this as being pushy.
