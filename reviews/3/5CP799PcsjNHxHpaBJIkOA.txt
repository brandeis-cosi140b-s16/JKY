I was invited to a rehearsal dinner hosted here. We were sectioned off in our own area with a bar, tables, and patio facing the pretty backyards of many Old Town Scottsdale shops and restaurants. 

Best:
Chips and guac are addicting, salsa was OK too.
The venue has unique charm with some elegant features and a great view.
Very good avocado - I recommend that on any dish you order.

Ok: 
The soft tacos were pretty good but nothing amazing. It could be because of the catering heat lamps during the night, though I presumed they came out fresh only seconds before they hit my plate. The pollo (chicken) taco was my favorite if I had to choose - ropa vieja, queso fresco, crema, radish, tender and yum.
I'm not a huge margarita fan. I do like tequila, and theirs is strong and could get you buzzing quickly.

Not-so-Good:
The parking was trouble. I didn't know where to go and the valet's were in such a hurry the whole time (keep in mind: this restaurant is located inside the Saguaro Hotel). In the end things worked out ok, but not after much consternation.

Overall:
Fun restaurant that was a nice choice for our private gathering. I wouldn't go out of my way for the food. If you do happen upon the area, craving some chips, tacos and guac, I give Distrito a thumbs up to check out. 

I DO want to come back to experience the Taco Bar!
