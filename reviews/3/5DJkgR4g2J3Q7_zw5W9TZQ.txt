The verdict in this place...identity crisis? This place is not fusion. It truly does serve both Chinese and Mexican cuisines. The server deems it authentic, but with a culinary twist. So, if the Chinese dishes may be a favorite for you at your Chinese restaurant, then it may not be what you expect at China Poblano. Don't get me wrong, the food was good. But overpriced and super salty. The Ocean's Nest pan fried seafood noodle was almost $40. Way too salty. The Dian Dian Mian was good but salty again.
