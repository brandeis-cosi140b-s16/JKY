Come to pittsburgh for a two night stay for shopping and my parents refused to eat fast food for dinner and wanted Chinese food instead. So I choose this restaurant as it was the closest to the hotel with a good review. When I first walked in I was surprised it wasn't like a restaurant but a food courts style where you order and take the food home. 

I order 3 pint of shrimp fired rice in Chinese and it cost around $20. The owner absolutely refused to take the order to us in Chinese and force us to order in English. I wasn't angry but the order is still written in Chinese and the owner still yelled out the order in Chinese to the kitchen anyways so what was the problem for me ordering in Chinese? 

The food came quickly in less then 5 minutes and we took it back to our hotel. It was hard to eat it out of the oyster pail but the food tasted OK but they really over done it with the oil and salt. (We tasted that they put a LOT of MSG) We were so thirsty afterwards we had to chugged down almost a gallon of water. 

The next day, we went back and order the same thing but this time asking for less oil and salt. This time, it actually tasted way better then the first and we were not all thirsty afterwards. Mine recommendation, order it with less salt and oil.

Minus 1 star for food.
Minus .5 star for value. 
Minus .5 star for service.
