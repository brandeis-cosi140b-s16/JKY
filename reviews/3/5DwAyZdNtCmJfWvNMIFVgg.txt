This was the place that was open @ Sky Harbor when no other places were open.  On Terminal 3 near gate 17 (which was nice, my departure gate was 17).  Seats started to open up, and we were starving- I would have eaten scraps on the floor.

We got served fairly quickly, and were able to grabs a few pre-flight brews.  The food came out hot as well.  It didn't taste spectacular, but it was hot and filled us up.  I cannot complain there!

They close around Midnight, so keep that in mind if you have a red-eye flight.

The prices aren't too terrible either (no entree over $10 except special fajitas), and the waitress was pretty accomodating.

I could see this place easily getting slammed!
