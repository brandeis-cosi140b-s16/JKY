One thing I love about the corporate restaurant model is that service is often reliably better than the local places.  This is true at On the Border.  I love the good service, including the fake smiles, memorized greetings, and checking on my table a little too often.  Fine with me.

I usually opt for the make your own burrito and results are usually quite good, and the same goes for the veggie fajitas.  Whether the tortilla chips are made here or not, I like the thickness & crispness.
