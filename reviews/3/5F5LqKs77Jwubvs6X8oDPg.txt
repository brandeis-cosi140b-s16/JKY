The food gets 3 1/2 stars, the service gets 2, so I am going to give an overall 3 rating.  

I had not been to Aunt Chilada's in years and we randomly were thinking of places to eat in that area and thought why not?! I remembered the house made tortilla chips being the best ever (and they still are, and they still put regular ones underneath).  

We ordered our drinks right away (a 22 oz beer and a margarita).  It was at least 10 to 15 minutes before we got them.  One guy was actually getting up from his table and just getting their drinks from the bar (it was not very busy, it was about 2 in the afternoon, so the lunch rush was over). When the drinks came, the beer was only a 16 oz, but who cares at that point, we were just happy to have drinks.  

When we ordered lunch, I asked for a high chair for our son who was still in his stroller so he could eat as well.  They never brought the highchair and with the other things already done wrong, I just let it go, he was able to eat his quesadilla just fine (that they also charged us the full price for, not the children's - and again for $1 difference it wasn't worth the wait I knew we would have to mention it).

I ordered 2 stuffed poblano peppers.  I was served one. It was however, delicious and plenty big enough that I still brought some of it home.  

My boyfriend just ordered a carne asada burrito, which came out fine, it was nothing spectacular, but decent.  As mentioned, my poblano was very tasty and a good sized portion.  

We waited for the bill for quite some time as well.  

So overall, the food was exactly what I remembered, tasty and a good variety.  But the service was terribly slow.  We'll go back when we can just sit at the bar, it seemed a better spot to be and much faster.  I enjoy a lazy lunch at times, but the long waits and errors for a simple lunch for two was terrible.
