I have been to so many Mexican joints in Charlotte, its hard to keep track. I have been to Monterrey a few times and its a fairly decent place to get some enchiladas or munch on chips and salsa. It is definitely not one of my favorite Mexican places in Charlotte or even in the University area but if you're in the mood, give it a try. I would, however, recommend Zapata's as an alternate.
