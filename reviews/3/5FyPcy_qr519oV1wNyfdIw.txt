Went today for lunch. The place is clean, nice, service was good.

Food wise...I always order the same thing at Mexican resturants.   I've been eating mexican food in the valley for over 35 years, even back in old Glendale when Lilys existed.  That's how I gage the food and if I like it or not.  My standard order is cheese enchiladas, taco, rice and beans.   Sorry to report, but other than the salsa I was not impressed. 

I still think Ritos, Carolinas, Popos, Pedro's, La Perala certain Humberto's, have better rice and beans.

Not saying I'd never go back, but I'd probably just order a cheese crisp, or nachos.
