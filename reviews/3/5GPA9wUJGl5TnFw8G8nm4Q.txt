Fun spot, okay service, good salsa and guacamole and cool mist spray system that brings the temp down a bit.  The night we came by, there was a live band playing all the hits from "shut up and dance" to 90's hip hop.

Cool vibe, kinda loud (old man) but still an okay place to chill out and munch on some apps, drink cold beer and listen to live music.
