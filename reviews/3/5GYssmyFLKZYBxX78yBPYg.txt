Easy in, easy out. Taco Bell is probably one of the easiest to eat and drive. As long as you dig into the burrito just right, it's not going to spill all over you while you're piloting a two ton missile down the highway at 115 feet per second.

I pulled into this TB at 1AM and wasn't paying a whole lot of attention. There's apparently a script. She said "Can you confirm your order on the screen" and I just kept saying "No, that's my complete order" because I was busy checking in on Yelp and not paying attention. I'm sure that she was halfway to calling the cops and reporting a DUI as I drove off with my "fourth meal."
