This place is okay. Most of the food is very heavy, even the salads. If it's not salad it's very very cheesy, greasy, or loads of meat. I almost always order something from their little health section, where the sides are healthy vegetables and the portion is smaller. 
I get tired of this place because of the grease though. 
There's nothing to complain about with the service or the facility itself. Very easy to find. It stands out while you drive by on Providence Road because of the brightly lit letters of the restaurant.
