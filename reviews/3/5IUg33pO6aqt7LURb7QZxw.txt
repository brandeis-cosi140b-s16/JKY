Surprised: Clean, new, upscale-looking fish taco place in a run down area. Limited menu with a variety of tostadas, tacos, burritos, and some lobster options. Served a shiny silver cup of complimentary seafood soup, tasty!

Confused: Despite the name, menu has a few tostadas but only two tacos, neither of which are actually fish tacos. Both contain shrimp? At least you get to specify your preference of corn or flour tortillas.

Impressed: The octopus tostada is beautiful! Gorgeous shreds of bright purple cabbage, plentiful chopped octopus, bright green avocado slices, and a drizzle of mojo mayo! Taste was fresh, not too acidic, large portion for the price.

Disappointed: The tacos, both shrimp, were just okay. One had grilled peppers and onions, the other had black beans and rice. Shrimp itself was bland. Considering tacos are their namesake dish, they need more of them on the menu and better flavor. For starters, grill your shrimp.

Satisfied (with service): Minor issue with billing, charged $5.50 for a taco listed as $3.50 on the menu. Pointed it out to friendly male server, who apologized and refunded the difference cash promptly. Check your receipt to be on the safe side.
