We love Dick's Hideaway and have gone several times but have not ventured north to Rokerij. I have heard that they are comparably but just in a more romantic and cozy setting. So for our recent date night, we thought we'd drive pass Dick's and give Rokerij a try.

The menu is similar, actually maybe a little more extensive. They have a larger selection of entrees and fish specials of the day. They have a little more than half of what Dick's offer and then some. I had a really hard time deciding because they had so many specials. I opted for the fish trio so I can have a variety of flavors. The BF didn't venture far and went for the usual Carne Adovada. 

I felt all my fish with their accompanied sauces were very mild. I have had several fish dishes at Dick's and they all have been heavy seasoned and flavorful - exactly what you expect from a New Mexican restaurant. I didn't get that here. My BF's Carne Adovada was identical to Dick's so he enjoyed his meal.

I'm not sure if I would come back. I think I will stick to Dick's. It's a tiny bit closer, slightly lower cost but most importantly tastes better! I can only see myself picking Rokerij over Dick's if I'm looking for better ambiance.
