Roberto's, how can I describe you best? Oh I know...CRAZY GOOD DRUNK FOOD! 

After a long night out on the town, partying and drinking it up, head to Roberto's to fulfill your late night munchies. Can I recommend the carne asada nachos? Warm tortilla chips piled high with fresh carne asada meat, guacamole, sour cream and TONS of cheese. Aye papi! 

All-in-all: Good mexican food, fair prices, lots of bang for your buck, made to order, always fresh. Muy bueno ;)
