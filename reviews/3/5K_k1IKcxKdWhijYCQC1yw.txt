Habeneros is just like Chipotle and Qdoba. Seems that this concept is new to Madison based on the other reviews implying that this dining experience is a new one for them.  Coming from Denver where excellent Mexican food is common, this meal was good but not a stand-out.  Tasty overall.  Generous with the portion of meat and able to add unlimited toppings without any extra cost.  A good place for a quick lunch.
