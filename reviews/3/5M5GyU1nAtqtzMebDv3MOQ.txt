Came all the way down to this place today after seeing a ad posted on Facebook. Wanted the pork Barboca only to find out it's only served on the weekends. The girl posting the ad should have mentioned that. So we ended up ordering birria and a carnitas plate. My boyfriend said the birria was alright but didn't realize it was goat not beef.  Goat has a funny taste but he said it was alright. The carnitas plate was good nothing special. Drove 30 mins for the Barboca so that was a let down. Maybe we'll come back on a weekend
