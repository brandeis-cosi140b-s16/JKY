I've only dined at La Paz 3 times. The first time was when they were on South Blvd and I wasn't impressed so I never went back. Once they moved to the Met I figured I would give it another try. Again, I wasn't impressed with the food. The most recent time we decided to try again, we were wanting Mexican food and we happened to be at the Met shopping so we ate there out of convenience. We were greeted by the very friendly hostess and seated immediately. Good start. Our waiter came quickly and gave us chips and salsa and took our order. I ordered the spinach and goat cheese enchiladas. When we got our food, I took a bite and didn't taste any goat cheese so I looked inside and nothing. Ugh. Our waiter was busy taking orders from other tables so we flagged down another waiter and told him what the problem was. He explained that they weren't making the enchiladas with goat cheese any longer but they happened to have some in the kitchen so they would remake it for me. When it came out it was delicious. When our waiter checked on us he said he had no idea they changed the dish which I wasn't surprised about since I'm sure he would have told me that. When all was said and done we were very happy with our food and the service was spot on. Multiple people refilling drinks and checking on us. And the waiter who helped me even though we weren't his table was amazing. Our waiter even discounted our bill since my order was wrong. I wish I could give them 4 stars but with the menu not being correct and me getting something different than I ordered, combined with not being impressed the first 2 times I've been here, I couldn't do it. I hope they can impress me more if we decide to go again.
