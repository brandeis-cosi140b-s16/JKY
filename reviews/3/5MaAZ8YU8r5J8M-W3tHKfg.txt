Salsa's has been at this location for a long time.  I believe they just changed the name to Cabo's.  The remodeled and added a stage for live entertainment.  I have been there several times.  I have discovered that branching out from the standard taco/enchilada/burrito is the way to go here.  I really like the Chile a la Mexicana, and the Tacos al Carbon.  Their chips and salsa is ok I like a spicier salsa.  
Their service is good. They have a brunch on Sunday, I was not impressed with that. They have decent margaritas and cold beers.  I will go back, and do recommend it.
