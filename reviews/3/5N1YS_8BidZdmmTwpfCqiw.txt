OK, the big plus for Lafonda was their amazingly hot and fresh chips.  That's about where my gushing ends.  

Bland salsa is a crime, and Lafonda just got indicted and sentenced five to ten.  We asked our server for something a little spicier, and she delivered.  Unfortunately, while it was spicy, it just didn't have a great flavor.  Let's contrast Chevy's, which I think has a great chain-restaurant salsa.

My machaca con huevos was a little dry, but it was good.  My wife's beef taco and green chili burro was ok.  I think Kiarash Z says it best: solid but not amazing... there are just too many new places out there to try before I'll return for mediocre.
