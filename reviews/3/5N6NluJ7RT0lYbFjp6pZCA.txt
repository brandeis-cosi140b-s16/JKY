Four reasons I come here: it's downstairs from where I work, they have decent prices, the bartender makes a pretty good margarita and I like the patio.

Not a huge fan of their food and in the summertime when the windows are closed it kinda stinks when you first walk in, but overall it's a good place for drinks on a patio-type day on Mill.
