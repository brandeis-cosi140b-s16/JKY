After a day of snowboarding at Devil's Head Wisconsin, we stopped by Madison, WI to look for a place to eat, before heading back to Chicago.

My friend suggested La Bamba.

OMG order the Super Nachos the chips they use is so good.  It has a different taste and crunch.  Warning, you must have friends to help you eat this.  They give quite a lot.  

I also tried a soft shell taco.  The shell made everything taste so good.  I wish they had a place in the burbs.
