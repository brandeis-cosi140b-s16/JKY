This place is pretty much your average Mexican restaurant. Prices are reasonable, menu is typical, and food is pretty good.

We went here for lunch and I ordered the mole enchiladas. They were pretty good and the portion was huge. The chips and salsa on the table was just ok; the chips definitely outshined the salsa.

It was good for a quick lunch, but I wouldn't recommend going for a special event or a date.
