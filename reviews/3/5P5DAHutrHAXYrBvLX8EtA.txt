Pollo Loco is usually my go to lunch spot when I'm in a hurry and want something relatively healthy on the go. This was my first time at this particular location and they were packed at lunch. Given the long wait and large amount of volume they seem to serve here, I thought the food would be fresher. That's usually case when there is high turnover. My chicken was dry and you could tell it had been sitting there a while since it had been grilled. They forgot my salsas, so I had to eat them plain, which was even harder to tolerate since the chicken was so dry. 

Service was friendly and I'd probably stop by here again if I'm in the need of a quick lunch.
