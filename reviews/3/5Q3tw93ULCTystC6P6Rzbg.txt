Cantina Laredo Mexican Restaurant (3Stars) 
- 4 Stars for its good valued happy hour drinks & bar dishes and atteactive modern decor
- 2 Stars for poor bartender service!

It is a great addition to the charming Tivoli Village. It's a mid-upscale, Mexican restaurant with a plush, modern decor and very inviting, comfortable ambience. Its Happy Hour offer is excellent with good bar dishes and drinks and low prices. Service at the bar is quite SUBPAR, however.

My HH EXPERIENCE: 
- My first HH experience here was good enough that I'd go back there again and soon, and bring some friends along. 

Its entrance looks upscale and inviting, with the large open patio on the side, its lit firepit radiating warmth and charm. Inside the entrance is a nice waiting area. I was surprised to see a modern, mid-upscale decor - nothing resembles a traditional Mexican establishment! 
- It was only after I saw the HH menu and well after getting my free tortilla chips, when Cantina Laredo made me feel being in a Mexican restaurant. 
- I took a seat at the bar counter, which was about half-full around 6pm, and had to wait unusually long to get my 1st beer and chips! After one of the 2 barkeeps first greeted me, then they just seemed to ignore the customers.

The bar lounge is medium sized with an attractive bar counter and  several nice bar tables. Its happy hour (4-7; 9-closing M-F: Sat 11-5pm) offers a good selection of drinks ($2-5, plus daily drink specials), half-off bar dishes ($5-7), with free, warm tortilla chips!

I enjoyed my draft Dos XX ($3) and a delicious Margarita (Monday Special, $5, equivalent to two normal margaritas at $3each). For food, I had its popular Crab Cakes ($5.5) which came with 3 pieces - great price. However, the first cake I tasted was disappointing, a bit loose, runny, hardly had any crab meat, and was ONLY LUKE WARM (despite the warning from the server that the plate was super HOT!). After several attempts, I finally got the attention of the bartender, who called the manager. The manager was very friendly and offered to get me another order. I asked him to just have it warmed up, which he did. After the dish was warmed up, the crab cakes did taste much better; those remaining two did contain some crab meat! The mgr explained that the batch was probably not mixed well enough for more even distribution of ingredients? The gentleman sitting next to me was going to order the crab cakes but changed his mind after seeing my order.

Actually my main disappointment was its two bartenders' SUBPAR service that evening. They were NOT attentive, even the bar was not busy. They avoided eye contact with customers. The gentleman next to me and I were sitting at a great spot near the beer tabs and cash register, but we both still had great difficulty getting their attention even for our 1st drink, not to mention our subsquent orders...!

Note to Management:
- I understand that your nice restaurant is still brand new. I do hope your management would conduct more training to improve (1) the services at the bar counter, and (2) the consistency/quality of its dishes. PLEASE!

IN SHORT: 
- For its elgant, modern decor, nice ambience, and especially its good happy hour menu and low price, I like Cantina Laredo's HH, and will go back. Hopefully, its service at the bar will get better. When it does, I'll include it in my list of favorite bars.
