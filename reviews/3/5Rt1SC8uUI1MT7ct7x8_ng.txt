Chinese and Mexican anyone? Can't go wrong!

So why three stars you ask? 
1 - It's Jose Andre.. the food was good but it wasn't anything to write home about... ( do people even use that expression anymore?) Personally, I  thought the Tequila was much better than the food. I ordered some tacos - but I couldn't pick up the Chinese in them...
2. The ambiance is whack. The reason my girlfriends and I dined here was because it was right next to Marquee, which was where we intended on dancing off the calories we were going to mass - consume at Poblanos. The restaurant looks a bit cheap, like an upscale version of a Micki Dee's.... too much red and the layout of the restaurant was not appealing at all.
