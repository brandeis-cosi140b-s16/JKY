We bought a discounted thing at the half price ticket counter for Quesadilla.  We went in for a really late lunch and there were only a couple of other tables full.  I ordered a burrito and it had way too much pork filling.  I scooped most of it out so I could still eat the tortilla part.  The pork was fine but not delicious and I definitely didn't want to eat continuous forkfuls of it.  The rice and beans were good and the pico that came with the chips hit the spot.  We just ordered sodas since I am not much of a day drinker.  The bill came to around $30 even when our discount was applied.  Definitely not a cheap lunch but it was decent.
