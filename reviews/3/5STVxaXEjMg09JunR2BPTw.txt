Must. Love. Mole. Although the salsa bar was out of service the friday night we came the 3 kinds they provided with chips were all good one had a kick. We ordered tacos, empanadas, flautas & tostada all the items we ordered had mole on them which is an acquired taste. We wanted to try a variety of items so we could try different flavors but everything tasted the same. Which was just okay.
