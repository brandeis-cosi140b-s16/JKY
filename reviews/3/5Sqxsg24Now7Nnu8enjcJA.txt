Not a bad experience. Extremely friendly staff. But if you want to break it down Tiajuana Flats is a "Mexican" style restaurant from Orlando Florida that claims to be Tex Mex. 

If your from the west coast and know what Mexican food is you can stop reading now, this place isn't for you. If your from Texas and know what Tex Mex is you can stop reading now, this place isn't for you. 

Now if your from the east coast you might love this place. The portions are large. They have a good 20 items on the hot sauce bar (yet oddly no salsa, has Florida written all over it). Burritos, Tacos, Chimichangas, nachos, etc. The rice seemed to be pre-packaged not fresh.  The re-fried beans seemed to be out of a can but they were not spiced up.

All the flavors are good, tasty, just neither Mexican nor Tex Mex, but Florida Mex.
