There are many Roberto's in the valley, some better than others, some worse. But, in general the product is consistent and you're never too far away from one They provide good food at a reasonable price.

I used to go to this location before it was a Roberto's, it was a non-chain Mexican restaurant that had great chili rellenos, one of my favorites. I digress, back to the Roberto's Yelp.

I was working in the area and have been to this location several times, but had never Yelped them. I usually have the carne asada burrito, lunch special. For $7.35, you get a carne asada burrito, sides of rice and beans, with a drink. This is what I had today.

The burrito is filled with carne asada and avocado, very tasty, The sides of rice and beans, beans a little above average, rice average. Soda was the Pepsi genre.

I gave three stars, which is an average rating, which I consider them to be. But, I have Yelped many Mexican restaurants, as of late, many were so below average, I would seek out average. I like the food here, it tastes good, you get plenty, at a reasonable price, can't ask for much more than that. So if you're in the area, give them a try. If you're a Roberto's fan, this location is about average for them, I've been to better, been to worse, but in general the Roberto's are consistent, I recommend them.
