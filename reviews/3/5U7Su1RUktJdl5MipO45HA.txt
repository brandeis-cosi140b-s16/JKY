Food is ok. I always just get the Roberts tacos. Staff is friendly and the restaurant is clean. I think its a good lunch meeting place, clean tables no interruptions from servers, and not usually loud. They started offering daily specials and so that has been nice as before it was pretty expensive for average mexican food. My bro loves the place so we still go all the time. Its worth a visit, you may like it.
