My mom's friend saw this restaurant on "Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives" and suggested that she try the food.  It was only mid-afternoon but they had no carnitas!  Before receiving our food, I looked for a salsa bar but was disappointed that the tacos were already topped with salsa (different type for each taco).  I am particular about my toppings.  Sometimes I like to mix salsas together or add more heat.  I was hoping for more authentic Mexican tacos but I would consider them gourmet tacos.  I was full but not satisfied!
