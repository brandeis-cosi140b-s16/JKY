I got the bowl [which comes with guacamole, blak beans, rice, salsa, cilantro, chipotle crema] and for the meats I chose Barbacoa and carnitas. I wasn't expecting much for the quantity, the quality is average. Didn't have much meat in my bowl. If you're looking for airport food that'll satisfy your hunger for an hour or two, get what I got! Good for those who don't want to be on the plane with a full stomach. =]
