Came here for the 1st time, friend I went with to Vegas recommended we eat here. Food was pretty good, we did happy hour at the bar. 

Atmosphere - Casual and upbeat, friendly service at the bar 

House Margarita - Eh, was nothing to special about it, very plain 

Beef Flautas - DELICIOUS very crispy yet flaky. Had good taste to it but was missing the guacamole. 

Pink Tacos - Very good! I'm not a onion fan so I picked it out but overall very flavorful too 

I liked the food wayyyyyyy more then my drink, I shall be trying the location out here in Cali to see how their food is.
