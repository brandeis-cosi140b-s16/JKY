Well, it is what it is. A small mexican restruant with quick service and sub par food.  But today, I did have a little hidden treat not many people may know about.  Try the hot dogs....

So the menu is in Spanish, but I heard the hot dogs are good.  I order two and have a coke.  Price is great.  I go and sit down, and wait.... and wait.... and wait.  Finally I ask and oops, we forgot your order cause it was busy. OK, besides the 20 minute delay, nothing wrong with this place at all.  Very cozy actually.  And the hot dogs were solid! A little bigger than a regular dog, the jalepino relish was a surprisingly good topper. PLUS they serve Mexican coke in the bottles which for the unknowing means pure cane sugar.

The rest of the food I don't know about. I'll have to write an update on that.  But as far as the hot dogs go, A-Ok by me.
