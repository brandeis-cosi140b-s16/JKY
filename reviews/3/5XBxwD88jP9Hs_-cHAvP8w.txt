Experience:  I came with some friends to try out the fusion.   I have wanted to try this place for almost a year.  Maybe sometimes that wait sets your expectations to high. It was decent, but not as good as I tasted it in my mind. 

Food: they put chips and salsa on the table that were okay, but definitely not my go to Mexican choice. 
I ordered 3 tacos which had your choice of meat...I picked the Bulgogi (Beef), Daeji bulgogi (Pork) and Pork Belly.  All there were good, but not amazing. 
My friend ordered the Kimchi fried rice.  It was a HUGE portion.  It was pretty tasty.
Another friend ordered the bulgogi nachos that I tried, which were pretty disappointing. Even he was regretful at his order. 

Service:  the service was not too great.  I had to get up and find the waitress to get a beer. She was pretty slow to take our food order too.  It was a little busy, so that might have been the issue, but this is never an excuse as the management should staff better. 

Facility:  it's pretty small, but comfortable enough for this casual cuisine. 

Overall review:  it was ok.  I would probably come back with friends, but not at my suggestion.
