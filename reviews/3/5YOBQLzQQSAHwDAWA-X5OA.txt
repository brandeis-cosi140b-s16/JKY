I'm not sure I understand why Chipotle is all the rave. As far as I'm concerned, there are quite a few quick, cheap burrito places (try Phat Burrito on Camden, for instance) that are far superior to Chipotle, but what do I know? I guess people like the chain, the familiar, the boring, the reliable. And that's what Chipotles are. 

This Chipotle is no different: same menu, same basic layout. This isn't really a bad thing, i guess: it's super clean, super spacious, and pretty nice overall for a fast-food/chain type establishment. You can even eat your meal here and not feel gross/depressed. And the food's not that bad, although allegedly it's really unhealthy, so be aware of that. I enjoy their plain chicken burrito, though it's pretty unextraordinary. You know what you're gonna get, and it's pretty good. 

But you can do better. Trust me.
