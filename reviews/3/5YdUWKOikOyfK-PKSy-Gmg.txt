I debated between 2 and 3 stars and gave the 3, but this place is hovering between 2 and 3 for sure.

Green (tomatillo) salsa was "supposed" to be "hot" but did neither had a lot of kick nor a lot of flavor.  The red was better, had a little sweetness to it, but was not very spicy at all.  The chips were white corn and crispy and delivered warm, so kudos for that.

Where they fell down was service, and the massive amount of ice in my maggie, and the entree' being very bland.

She took forever to get my second basket of chips to me, and the drink order took a while also, even with only 2 other tables occupied.  

The maggie was fairly tasty, but delivered in a large glass filled mostly with ICE, unfortunately.  After a few decent-sized sips, the liquid was all gone and the ice was left lonely with me, wondering WTH happened to that drank???.....:(

The steak entree' had ONE redeeming value:  it had habanero wafers around the plate.  I finally had something with some HEAT on the table, YES !!!  But the steak was bland, and the sauce (cheesy, beany?) was mostly a gloppy, tasteless mess.

I think they can get better, and thus I'm leaving room for improvement.

P.S.  Being that they are on the SE corner of where the I-10 crosses Baseline, the only way to gain entrance into the parking lot is to be driving EAST on Baseline.  If you are coming from the east, headed west, you will have to make a u-turn somewhere past the freeway and head back down Baseline.
