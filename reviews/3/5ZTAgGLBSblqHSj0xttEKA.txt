Sometimes I just really want Mexican food, and this place does enough to satisfy that craving.  It's a little bit nicer than some of the other local Mexican places but still very casual.

It's a pretty standard setup for a Mexican Restaurant.  You sit down and get the chips and salsa.  I am not a huge fan of the salsa.  I prefer a thicker salsa with more interesting things going on in it, but the salsa here is pretty runny and ordinary.  There are lots of beverages so if you enjoy the mixed concoctions you will probably find something you enjoy. 

The food is pretty good.  I most recently got the tacos al carbon which was one of the best things I've ordered here.  It consisted of sliced steak inside of corn tortillas.  It came with the standard refried beans, rice, and lettuce/tomato/guac/sour cream situation.  Lots of food!

The service is okay but not exceptional.  Our waters stayed full and our beers kept coming, so I was satisfied.  You probably will be too if you give this place a shot.
