Been to Zaba's twice, and I like it. It's not great, but I do enjoy. I get the bowls and they look kinda small at first, but once you dig in, it's pretty big. You will definitely get full eating it. I couldn't even finish mine, both times.
It's a place where you pick the meat, and topping and they put them into bowls, or burritos. They charge extra for queso and guacamole I believe. They do serve beer which went excellent with my bowl. It's not quite fast food, but it's not like a formal restaurant. Very casual and chill.
I'll be back.
