Pretty good spot, atmosphere and decor are on point. Service was good. We got the queso fundido as an appetizer and it was delicious. I got the steak salad, my girlfriend got the nachos with al pastor pork. My steak was ordered med rare, came out med well + Nachos were pretty good though. Pretty inexpensive as well.

Food - 3

Probably rate a 3.5 if I could.
