This place is truly a dive restaurant. The machaca green chili burro enchilada style was just average. It's mostly a gravy sauce, with very little green chili. For the $6 it was not bad, but nothing I would come back for. The guy next to me had a red chili burro, and it looked decent, but again nothing special.
