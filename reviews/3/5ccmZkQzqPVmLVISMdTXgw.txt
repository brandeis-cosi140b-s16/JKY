Meeh what was I expecting.  
I ordered a taco salad with shredded beef.  It wasn't bad.  The tortilla shell was on the verge of being rancid or was it fried in old oil? The shredded lettuce wet and draining through the bottom of my tortilla bowl.  But the meat and guacamole and some of the lettuce were tasty and I was hungry.  I poured my little cup of salsa over it all and had me some lunch .  Honestly I would probably stop in again if I was in the mood for a bean & cheese burrito or a quesadilla.  Too hard to mess those up.
