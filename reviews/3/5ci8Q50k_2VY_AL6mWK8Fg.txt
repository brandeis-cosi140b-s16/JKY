I have been coming here since I was a kid. I hbe find memories of El Pollo Loco and family discussions around the dinner table. Flame grilled chicken and fresh tortillas always make for good eats. I have never been into a dirty Resteraunt and I have never had an order messed up. But I must say the drive thru at this location takes forever! Literally over 15 minutes every time I come. Even with only a few cars in front of me. I don't know what the hold up is all the time or if language barriers are an issue but El Pollo Loco needs to figure it out... At least at this location.
