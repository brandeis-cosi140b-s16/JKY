Being new to Phoenix, we heavily rely on fellow Yelpers reviews. I have to admit, I'm a bit puzzled with the 4 and 5 star reviews. Here is my take on Manuel's Mexican Restaurant:

Chips & salsa: the chips were crunchy and not at all greasy or salty. They were perfect. The salsa was more like pico de gallo. The waiter asked if we wanted the "hot" salsa. I use the term "hot" loosely, it was very mild. The consistency and color was more like a mariana sauce. It taste okay, but it was the weirdest salsa I've ever had. I realize not everyone can handle spicy stuff so I won't hold that against them.

Manuel's Taco Platter (me): Instead of going with the steak taco that came with the platter, I switched to a carnito (pulled pork) and chicken fajita. I thought it was strange that it was named the "Taco Platter" since a chicken fajita came with it. The pork taco was substantial. It came bare, nothing but meat, but the portion was huge! Pretty good too. The chicken was grilled along with the green peppers and onions. That too was pretty good. My platter came with a side of guac, green chile salsa, sour cream and refried beans. The beans were not that good.

Carne Asada (my hubby): The steak was dry, not like beef jerky dry, but dry nonetheless. His meal came with a side of pico de gallo and a bean soup. I wish the bean soup came with my taco platter because it was delicious. 

I would go back for that bean soup.
