I ate at this new Chipotle the Friday afternoon of January 8th.  When I left there was a line out the door all the way to the end of the strip shopping center.  There had to be at least 50 or 60 folks in line at 3:00 in the afternoon!  

Well It turns out I started eating a little too early.  At 3:00pm Chipotle's was giving out free T-Shirts and a free burrito!  I missed out!  

There are some good reasons to wait a while to eat at this Chipotle.  Mostly it is staff training.  I eat at Chipotle quite a bit.  This one was something of a disappointment.  I ordered a Carnitas Fajita for a change.  They were out of the Fajita veggies, then they were out of the delicious Carnitas.  When the food finally arrived they assembled the burrito and by the time I got to the table it was soggy and fell apart even though I was using the peel the foil method of eating the burrito.  

I have high hopes for this place and hope that by the time you read this the service and quality issues will be addressed.  It is a nice restaurant with plenty of seating inside and a nice patio.  Of course the place was clean because it is brand new and shiny!  

Now that I think about it the folks lined up will be good practice for when they get busy.  The free T-shirt and burrito will soften the blow if there are any mistakes on the orders.  I will certainly stop by and give it another try.
