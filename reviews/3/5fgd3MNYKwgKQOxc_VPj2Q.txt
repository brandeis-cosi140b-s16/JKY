Stopped in for a quick lunch and enjoyed a Carne asada burrito, just under $6.  Tasty and I noticed there was a fresh cilantro taste, much more so tht the standard f...berto's places.  Meat was a bit tougher than others but also there were fesh onions and spices too. I'd go again and they are amazingly fast at getting my order out
