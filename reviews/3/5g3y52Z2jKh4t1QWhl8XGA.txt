I was looking forward to trying this new restaurant not far from where I live, but left thinking this was the first and last visit. We went on a Sunday night, so it was not busy. Our food was all delivered at the wrong time: drinks took too long a time to come, as did appetizers, but then main course came right away. So we had main course and appetizer together. A mistake was made with one of my friends's order, so he had to wait at least ten minutes for his dish to be prepared all over again. Server didn't notice until we told her. Ditto for drinks: another of my friends got the wrong drink. What I liked: tequila selection, salsa, rice and beans with tacos. Rest of food was fine, but nothing special. Food was also over-salted. In short, some good aspects, but someone really needs to think about coordinating the overall dining experience. For 75 bucks for two people, I really expect better tasting food and better service.
