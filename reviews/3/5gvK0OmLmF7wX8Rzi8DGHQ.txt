This one is a solid two and a half But I clicked three. There are a few much more excellent authentic Mexican eateries here in Charlotte IMO. So after reading reviews here on yelp, this one was not a wow. Far from it. 

First off the place is dirty. EWWWW. 

The two times we went, there were other tables in there, so according to that and the other reviews here, fans do exist but don't count me in. 
I mean, it was not the worst but that's about all I can say. 

The prices are not that big but neither are the portions. 

The overall taste, was about three stars says A-OK. Price was on par with portion-minimal, so three stars. Decor, was about three stars only cause I like the colorful tables but the dirt and dust and cobwebs we observed knocked it down. Service was? Huh? Nothing memorable.
