After several friends had recommended eating here, I was excited to finally get the opportunity to do so. I thought I would try the enchiladas if they were served with the kind of sauce I like. I asked the waiter if the enchiladas were served with red chili or enchilada sauce because I don't really care for enchilada sauce. He didn't understand the question. He asked me to explain the difference which I did in several different ways because he was apparently a little dense. He finally understood when I explained that red chili has one ingredient, and enchilada sauce has more than one ingredient. I have never run across a server in a Mexican restaurant who didn't immediately know the difference between these two types of sauces. 

Having determined that they only had enchilada sauce, I decided to try the Daddy's Nachos. I ordered them with no beans. The waiter hadn't bothered to write down our order, so it was no surprise that the order wasn't correct. It was sent back to be done correctly which was apparently a no-no at this establishment. When I received it back, there was approximately half the beef and other toppings of the one first brought out. I decided just to go ahead and eat. It was rather bland, nothing great. If that was the only item ordered, I would have only given one star. 

My lunch companion ordered the Daddy's Chicken Burrito which was quite good. She shared it with me while waiting for my food. No one checked on us to even see if our drinks needed to be refilled. It's unlikely I would ever eat here again.
