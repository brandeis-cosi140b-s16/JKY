I've been to this Chipotle a decent amount of times, thanks to a $50 gift card from the relatives.  It's set in a very good location, so there are always people, and business is always booming (the help wanted sign has been on that window forever!).

Standard Chipotle fare is always delicious, but if you come during the peak hours, don't be surprised when your burrito/burrito bowl is less than you would usually get at other Chipotle restaurants.  Seating is also a slight issue, so take it to-go.
