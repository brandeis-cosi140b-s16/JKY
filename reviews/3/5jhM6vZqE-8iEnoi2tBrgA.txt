I had no idea that a second Steel Cactus had opened in Pittsburgh until a coworker of mine suggested meeting here with a group last Sunday evening.

I had no problem finding a parking spot on the street (at 5pm on a Sunday afternoon), but if you came at a busier time, you could also park at a public lot just a block away. Like all amp'd group restaurants, the new Steel Cactus is well decorated and has a trendy vibe while still keeping with a Mexican theme. I also enjoyed sitting with a view of Carson Street and people-watching from time to time throughout the meal.

Though this is a fun place to hang out, the food and drinks are just mediocre. I had a sangria (white peach, I believe?) that was tasty but was very sweet and tasted very light on the alcohol content. My margarita was also very sub-par, and one of my coworkers actually sent hers back to be remade. We split chips and three dips, which were very tasty. I do like Steel Cactus's style of queso - mild, smooth, white cheese - and also enjoyed trying a pineapple salsa. Finally, for my meal, I ordered the chicken fajitas, which were very light on the chicken and heavy on the saut√©ed/grilled onions and peppers.

Though a little slow, service was descent, especially considering that we were a confusing bunch. We anticipated more people than actually arrived.... Everyone arrived in 10 minute intervals over a half hour period of time.... We had a groupon.... We sent a drink back.... The groupon holder actually had to leave early, before we all paid our checks.... Even with all this randomness, our waiter did a good job keeping up.

Overall, this Steel Cactus would have a lot going for it if they improved their food and drink quality. I would really just plan on returning to order their chips with three dips and maybe a drink.
