I have yet to be wowed by this place. I think if the price point were lower than my review would be higher, but in my opinion a $20+ pizza should be worth that price and frankly, it's just not. The pizza is tasty, don't get me wrong, but I always feel as if I am paying for good marketing instead of good food.
