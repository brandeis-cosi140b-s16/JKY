I never thought I'd visit a place such as this without a brain full of alcohol, but  recently I discovered the steak and egg burrito here.  I put this little guy on my late night rotation (minus the cheese) and I wake up feeling ready to tackle the day (as opposed to the toilet).  It probably won't win any awards but it more than adequately serves its purpose. Cheap. Delicious. Man-food.
