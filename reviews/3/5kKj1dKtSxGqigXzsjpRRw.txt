I like what the Two Hippies brand is trying to do.  Bring a local chain of food at a great price point.  The problem is, they aren't killing it on the product.   If you want to have a dumpy location, with nowhere to sit, and a decent concept, the food better be damn good.

There is no place to sit inside, so I am not sure how this place will make it through the winter.

The food is ok.  Its not terrible, but it doesn't even compare to another mid-town taco shop (America's).  I'm not going to argue if I am taken here, but I will definitely suggest America's over this establishment in a heart beat, even though Two Hippies is closer to both work and home.
