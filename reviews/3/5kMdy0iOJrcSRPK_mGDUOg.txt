Wait, hold up 4 stars? I must have missed something. By the looks of the reviews perhaps I should've bought a Margarita. Cause while portions were more than enough to feed an army and service accommodating to our group I thought the food wasn't all that spectacular. I suppose it serves it's purpose as gringofied Mexican food. Made me miss my lengua and sesos though.
