So my friend decided to pick where we'd eat lunch since he was driving.  We ended up at Losbetos.  We went through the drive-thru which wasn't that long of a wait.  I ordered carne asada fries.  I totally forgot how big a full order was and didn't think about order a half order.  We of course took the food to go.  Once we got home, we grubbed.  The food wasn't cold, nor was it hot.  I guess it was somewhat warm.  In general, the food wasn't great, nor was it horrible.  My friend concurred.  As for the hot sauce, it sucked.  It wasn't even spicy at all.  Tasted like watered down tomato juice or something.  The place looked pretty authentic to me...what a shame.  Maybe ordering from here will taste better on another day.  That's what my friend said who's a regular.

They take credit card, even American Express.
