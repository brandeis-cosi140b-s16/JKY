3.5 stars. Like most Mexican places in town this restaurant is a bit overpriced. The food lacked flavor and the service was rude, and you know how much I hate rudeness from staff when I am eating out. If I don't know what "guaca" (guacamole) means don't blame me, I only grew up in Mexico, so what do I know?
I did enjoy the Southwest Limeade.
