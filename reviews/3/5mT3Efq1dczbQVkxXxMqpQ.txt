Plenty of eye candy here!  The HR person apparently uses that as a primary hiring criteria.  In fact, our young waiter was "so cute" that my wife wouldn't let me send my order back, even though two of the four plates come with something other than what we ordered.  My freind sent his back anyway.  If it wasn't for the cuteness factor, I'd have to give them two stars.  

We had margaritas and beer, and the beer was the only thing with any alchohol content.  Buyer beware.

The salsa was excellent, and the food was good, but there didn't seem to be anything authentic about it.
