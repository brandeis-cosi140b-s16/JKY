The food wasn't that great.  I ordered papas con carne, the pork was pretty dry.  I guess I didn't read the menu description because when I think of "papas" I think chunks of potatoes but Tia Rosa serves pureed potatoes.  The flour tortillas were the highlight of the meal, I asked if they made them but they buy them from a distributor.  I used the tortillas to scoop up the meat and topped it with the potato mixture to cure the dry meat.  It was definitely something I had never had before.

The margaritas were excellent and the bartender was awesome.
