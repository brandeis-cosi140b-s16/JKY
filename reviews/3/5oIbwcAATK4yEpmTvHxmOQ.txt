Came here for Restaurant week and it was busy. That's probably why the service was so so so slooow. It was painful. But the server was very nice. Food was just okay (mussels for appetizers, carne asada for entree, bread pudding for dessert). Carne asada was way too tough and not very flavorful. Bread pudding probably was the best part. Drinks were just okay- pina colada and paloma
