Good authentic Mexican food. Huge servings and good flavor. My only issue was the service. Our server was not very friendly and honestly seemed impatient with us when we placed our order. The hostess was nice when we walked in but just the server was not nice. 

I enjoyed my Posole and enchilada. Oh and the free chips and salsa were very good too. They also give you free bean dip. 

We did get a free picture with our meal. The girl was trying to sell us photos but when we opted out she gave us our free picture and also seemed annoyed. Oh well. 

For the food in itself I would probably go back but wish the service was better.
