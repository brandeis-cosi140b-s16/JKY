Atmosphere, loud and live. Four stars for food, service was mediocre and the cashier was inattentive. Somewhat confusing how to order from the menus. We still don't know how to order and staff was not very helpful. Salsa bar is good, and we ordered 4 different kinds of tacos and corn on the cob they were all good! Plenty of food for $24
