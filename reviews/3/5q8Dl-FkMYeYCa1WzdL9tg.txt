My go-to Gringo-Mex place on the way into work.

This stems from lazy, and nothing more. The places I'd prefer are either out of the way, take too long for spur-of-the-moment food, or are located in a manner making it inconvenient to get directly to work.

That said, it's easy to get in and out of when I am headed west on McDowell.
The prices are fair, the portions are large and the food is fresh. From time to time, it's even flavorful!

Would I rank this among the best Mexican food in town? Not a chance!

Is it clean and fast and completely serviceable to eat at my desk? You bet!
