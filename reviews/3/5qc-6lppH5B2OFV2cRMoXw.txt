I've never been to Surprise Arizona before so I had no idea where to go eat when we were out here for a Rangers spring training, so as always I relied on Yelp to help me and my co-workers find a spot! We were searching for Mexican food, so as soon as I found the reviews for Las Cazuelas, we immediately headed that way. 

It's located in a strip mall next to a gun store but don't let this deter you. Once we entered the place we saw that it was packed, which is a really good sign. It seems as if the locals as well as all of the out of towners frequent this place. The restaurant is divided into two sections so we took a seat in the rear in ne of the booths. I looked at the very large menu and ordered the vegetable fajitas. When I asked for no cheese or sour cream, they said it wouldn't be a problem at all. They brought out my plate of fajitas along with a side of cheese covered beans. The portions were huge and real good too. I hate the fact that they bring you a basket of only three tortillas, yet you have a whole plate full of food to fill them with! The grilled onions and peppers were good, the only problem that I had with it was that they included tomatoes as well. This kind of made the plate runny and soggy. I really wish that they would have given me a little more guacamole as well. But overall it was a good meal and I'm glad that we found this spot.

Great food, great service, what more can you ask for? I definitely recommend Las Cazuelas if you're in the Surprise area. Venture a couple of blocks off of Bell and the tourist area and try it out, you won't be upset that you did
