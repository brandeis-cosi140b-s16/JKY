After reading the reviews we were really excited to try this place out. 

The menu looked pretty tasty, and I got us a free queso for checking in. The queso was decent, nothing I would pay for so I am glad it was free. 

For dinner we had nachos, fajitas, and 2 tacos. The meat was tender but everything was kind of lack luster on the flavor. The service was not the greatest, our waitress was a little slower than we normally like, and it was not busy. 

Maybe we will be back, and if so hopefully it has more pizzazz next time.
