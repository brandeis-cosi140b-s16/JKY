Cuco's is a decent place.  The food is pretty consistently decent.  The service is decent and their drinks are decent.  I have had a lot of things on their menu and the food is far from authentic but it's decent.  They also have decent margaritas.  One thing that I'm not in love with at Cuco's is how overly salted everything is.  There is really not much to say outside of just noting that the place is decent. 

One thing that is kind of standout at the restaurant however is this dish that comes in a stone pig shaped pot.  It has chicken, chorizo, steak, and shrimp and is served with avocado slices and rice with beans.  It's pretty freaking good.  It's also pretty freaking salty but still really good.  It is enough for 2 people which should mean that the man and I split it.  But it doesn't.  He eats all he can and looks forward to taking the rest home for breakfast the next day.  He does let me have a few bites of it, only sometimes though!

If you want decent Mexican food and a decent atmosphere with decent service come to Cuco's you won't be disappointed.
