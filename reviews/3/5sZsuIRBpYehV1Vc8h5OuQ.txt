Not a bad place but not a great place either; i'll give it the benefit of the doubt as it IS new and may be going thru growing pains...in a nutshell:

decent portions but average food...GREAT chips/salsa/BAD margaritas ( tasted like they got the mix at Big Lots and used Aristocrat, no taste at all)...service decent but not great....bar area if it gets busy is REALLLLLYYY slow..interior is cool....

They're gonna have to step it up if they want to last there:...they're surrounded and attached to (COMMON HOUSE) places that are priced similiarly and have great service/atmosphere/food/drinks...plus if you're game theres plenty of AUTHENTIC places to get REAL mexican grub (tacqueria la unica is about 1/2 mile away)..hope they improve
