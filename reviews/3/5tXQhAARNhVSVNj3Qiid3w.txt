Havent been here for years. I had a restaurant.com coupon so went for lunch today. You cant use coupons on the specials must order of the main menu which is a bit of a rip in this case,

Greeted immediately great decor in this well established local restaurant. Salsas came in 3 carafes with the usual yellow corn chips. The hot actually had jalape√±os in it and was pretty good. Much better than usual and about the only thing not toned down for snow birds. 

The service was fast almost too fast. I ordered my usual beer this time a negra modelo one of my faves. It had a yuppie lime stuck on the neck and no glass was provided so i used the lime on the food.

I ordered the number 3 which is a red beef tamale , cheese enchilada and a bean tostada. Side on mine was just a few beans and lettuce.

Julie had the mini chimi with rice and beans. Each about 9 bucks.

My tamale was pretty good lots of beef and lots of sauce but it wasnt very spicy. The enchilda was like greasy cheese pizza on a flour tortilla. Bean tostada ok but pretty bland.

Julie commented the chicken chimi was bland also but salty.

A good lunch and will return for a special as prices are very good.

I considerer this an average experience. Sevice and decor are outstanding. Parking is tight and traffic at that spot us tricky especially when there is a train.
