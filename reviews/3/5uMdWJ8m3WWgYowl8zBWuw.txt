Love this place however I just bought dinner and a show. Just a word of advice, if you have an issue with another coworker, don't deal with it in front of the entire restaurant. Went in on June 2 at around 830 and witnessed this situation of distasteful tact. Love the food and the service towards the customers but wow.
