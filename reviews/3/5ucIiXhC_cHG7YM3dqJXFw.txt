First and foremost, the food and service is great. The chile verde is really tasty. Karina is a bomb waitress. Very nice and helpful

Unfortunately the atmosphere left something to be desired. They had a live band tonight and it was loud. Their fans might have been more annoying then them. They kept peeking on the PA and we could barely talk over dinner. I understand this is also a bar but the music should start later if your going to have it. 

5 stars for food and service.
1 star for super annoying band
