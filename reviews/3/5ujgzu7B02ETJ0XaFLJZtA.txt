Meh. That's my description based on my first visit. I have been wanting to try El Burro for quite a while since the place is literally just a few blocks away. I love LOVE Mexican food. Usually you can find me salivating over the menus of Casa Renya, El Campesino, Chipotle, etc. You get the point.  I finally tried it out this afternoon for lunch and decided on the Carnitas Burrito. My significant other ordered the chile relleno burrito. Upon holding the burrito, I was impressed - it felt like a significant portion. When I took it out of the foil it looked good, lightly grilled even, and smelled nice. Then I cut it in half, and rice spilled out everywhere. I looked - where's the meat? Upon further inspection and subsequent eating I found the meat, but not very much. And to boot - it tasted like it wasn't seasoned at all. Very bland. All that weight of the burrito? Pretty much all white rice with a couple of corn kernels and peas and TWO cilantro leaves.... And it all tasted like... well, nothing! I had to drown it in my hot sauce here at home.  At other establishments I can barely eat an entire burrito. Here, I ate the whole thing and was very disappointed, especially after reading all these rave reviews and the price point. Now, I did have a bite of my husband's Chile Relleno burrito, and it was more flavorful than mine, but of course a pepper like that is going to have more flavor than what I had. He said it was just ok, and that for the price he expected a bit more inside the burrito other than the mass quantity of rice. I don't see myself being a regular here. Too pricy for too much rice and very little flavor.
