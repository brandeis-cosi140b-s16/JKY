This is a pretty good Mexican restaurant located in your typical strip mall.  However, their menu is a bit more extensive and I found it hard to choose from the many options they presented..

First, the chips are good although not great.  They do serve it with a tasty bean dip and red salsa as well as a green salsa which I did not taste.

Previously, I ordered the taquitos which were fine.  This time, I ordered 4 Mexican style street tacos.  I ordered a carne asada, which was pretty good although a little boring.  The adobada and shredded beef were better and the shrimp taco was the tastiest.

Very reasonable prices although they do need to update their menu if the prices have increased, which is what I was told.

I do wish the space was a bit bigger as I have tried to eat here on previous occasion and there were no tables.
