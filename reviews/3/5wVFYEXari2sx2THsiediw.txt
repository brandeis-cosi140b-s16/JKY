Reading the other reviews I tend to side more with the one and two stars than the glowing five star reviews. I've eaten there 6-8 times and have seen both extremes. All things considered,  I think 2-1/2 stars is a fair rating. First impression is that the place isn't as clean as it could be. Chips are provided - a couple times they have been good but more often have an unpleasant sort of rancid taste. Food quality is okay, average, nothing noteworthy. Service has been like the chips, sometimes good other times terrible.
