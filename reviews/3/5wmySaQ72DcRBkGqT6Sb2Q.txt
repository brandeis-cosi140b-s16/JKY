First off, our server was a delightful young gal. Unfortunately, I don't remember her name and I don't have one of those nifty receipts that includes the servers name. I tip on service even if the food isn't the best, it's not the servers fault. Nothing worse than having a crappy server bring you nasty food. But not last night. Had a wonderful server bring us "okay" food.

My daughter loved their Ceviche Tostado but not the bread on the Torta. I had the #1, shredded beef taco, cheese enchilada with rice and beans and I'll just say that I have had better. It is a "mom &  pop" and I am always in favor of spending my dollars there.  BUT, both the big guys and the little guys are putting less meat in the tacos, less cheese in the enchilada and adding an extra buck to this and that, here and there. 

Now,with that said, I always try a place a second time. But it will be during Happy Hour for 2.00 bottled beer, Ceviche Tostado and a big Cheese Crisp. Their cheese crisp looked mighty tastey!
