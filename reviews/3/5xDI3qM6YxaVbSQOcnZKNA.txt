Mixed results when I come here.  Sometimes quick and friendly, other times you sit and wait really long times.  I've had pretty consistent food quality from this location though.  Prices seem to be rising to an unrealistic amount for a burrito though.  If they keep going up I don't think I'll be a customer any more.
