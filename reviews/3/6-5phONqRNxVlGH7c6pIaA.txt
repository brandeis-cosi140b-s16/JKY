Just had lunch here with my daughter. Complementary salsa and chips were interesting, 3 salsa choices, verde between a mild and smoky hot. the verde was almost hotter than the 'hot' so I liked them fine. Great tortilla soup with lots of shredded meat, cotija and a big slice of avocado. Nice meaty taste and a good size portion. Street tacos with signature marinated beef and nopales were superb. Only complaint was that they STILL seem to be getting the service down. Liked the decor a lot, but you have to get the napkins and silver down once the food arrives. And your sign about lunch specials? You should know what they are before you start your shift. Especially when the sign is wrong and there really aren't any specials! The actual service was fine. As this is a local establishment, I'm looking forward to returning. Maybe when there really are specials!
