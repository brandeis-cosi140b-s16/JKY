Whoa!  I'm kind of surprised this place has only 2 stars?  I went here for lunch.  I had a cold beer and two tacos - one chicken, one ground beef, both soft.  We also ordered chips and salsa.  The chips were fresh and the salsa came out hot - like heat hot.  I've never had salsa served this way and I thought it was good.  Both of my tacos were tasty and I liked the garlic sauce they added to the mix.  The only thing I would change is that the place could be a little more clean.  Also, I wish I would have ordered a Dos Equis because it came in a giant cold margarita type glass.  It made my beer seem sad.
