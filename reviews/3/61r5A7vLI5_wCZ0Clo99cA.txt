Ok so I have to be really honest. I came here expecting to have some awesome fish tacos, not amazing, just good. So the place is really clean and the employees are very friendly. The menu is not overwhelming, with enough options for anyone from any age. The salsa bar was fully stocked and very neat.... but here is what I did not like. There fish is chopped and battered, so its really hard to hold or to eat without looking a mess, especially if your like that me and tries every sauce they offered lol. The fish was everywhere except the tortilla. After i managed to get past that, the flavors were actually ok, but thats about it. The fish was not crispy in any form, it felt like steamed bread stuffed with fish! The texture of the fish was nothing of what a real fish taco is. That was such a negative for me! All around not as cracked up to be, rubios is still better for a fast food fish taco and cheaper
