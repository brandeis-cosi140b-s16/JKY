It's the same as any other El Pollo Loco I've been to anywhere.  The food is okay, and it's consistent.  I like that they play Spanish music here, and that most of the clientele speaks Spanish.  I'm trying to learn Spanish, but I'm not trying very hard.  Still, every time I come I end up with one more word or phrase in my vocabulary.
