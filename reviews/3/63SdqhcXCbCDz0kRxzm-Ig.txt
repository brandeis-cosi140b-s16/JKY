Ok I love that I can stumble in here at 3 am and get service that doesn't come with a drive through window. 

The decor is what you would expect a Mexican restaurant to be. The walls yellow, the wood tables and chairs and some little embellishments hanging on the wall that scream pancho via might have had some carne asada from here.  

The food is ok. I do love that they give you two salsas and bean dip for your chips!!! I eat like two servings of dip on my own. Bad side is after the bean dip and chips I'm too full for my food. The flautas are good. Deep fried flour tortillas filled with chicken. 

Corn allergy alert!!! They put corn in pretty much everything! So if you are allergic let them know. 

All in all I've had better but generally not at 3 am lol!
