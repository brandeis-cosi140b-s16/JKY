I'm updating my review b/c I recieved a message from the owner. (Good Customer Serv.)
its good to know owners care enough to reach out to patrons that use Yelp.
I have not been back however, the message that I got from the owner is well worth the additional star. Plus, I've been told what/how to make my next visit more "BANG" for my buck. 

thanks again
