Located inside the Tuscany Casino where we stayed while in Vegas for a convention.

Our party of ten came for dinner.  Plenty of seating for large groups.  Our server was very patient and didn't get frazzled when we all wanted to use our 2 for 1 dinner entree coupon.

Food was decent.  Prices decent.  Portion size decent.
