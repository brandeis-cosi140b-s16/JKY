A pretty decent place for a quick lunch during work hours. Their food is pretty consistent and their service is always top notch.
I've ordered their taco salad, beef tacos, fish tacos, and enchiladas. All pretty tasty and not too spicy. I love their chips and salsa. Since I work in the area, I will always be stopping by for a quick lunch grub.
