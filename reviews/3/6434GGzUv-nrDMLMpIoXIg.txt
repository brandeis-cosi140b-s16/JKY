3 1/2 STARS**** 

So my sister had informed me that this place had received pretty decent reviews on here and I thought I would try it out. So my overall consensus is that it's not as good as Azteca but its good!! 

We started out with the queso that came out so quickly and was very good! I had the the Arroz Con Camerones the shrimp had good flavor as did the guacamole it came with, it was just missing something. My boyfriend had the Ribeye which came with rice and beans and grilled onions and peppers with fried potatoes and he seemed to like it. 

Our server was very nice and quick!! The decor was typical for a Mexican restaurant. The location kinda sux being that far in the shopping center that many wouldn't know its there!
