While I think the cabeza here is on point, this visit some of the meats were a bit fatty and gristly compared to my last review. It was more noticeable in my MILs pastor torta and she's more of a "taster" taking small bites so she had to pick at hers. 

I still thought the flavor was good on their meats, but just a noticeable difference in quality with the pastor mostly. The lengua, cabeza ones I ordered were fine. Everything came out piping hot and fresh though. I noticed a few reviews that's touted this fatty gristle from the past so perhaps it's inconsistent with trimming.  This is just my second time so not exactly sure if there are more good days than bad. Pick out the bites you don't like? 

I noticed a ton of people on this day were ordering various soups. Caldo de res seemed the most popular so I might come back for that. I saw on the menu menudo, caldo camerones and birria as well. I went on a weekend and most places serve that stuff on a weekend only so I am not sure if this is a all week item as I didnt really pay the most attention to the wall menu closely.

It may be tacos el Compita but it seems that the Hispanic community seems to go caldo route. I'll come back and follow what everyone else is ordering next time.
