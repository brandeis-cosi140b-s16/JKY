...Looking to avoid the long wait that you can often find at this Chipolte.  I called myself being clever and attempted to utilize the online ordering tool they now have available for all Chipolte restaurants.  Let's just say, they still need to work some things out.  When I arrived to pick up my order it wasn't ready yet.  Also, I asked for peppers and onions and received none.  

Since then, I've decided to go inside and place my order in person.  If after taking one look at the line, I think I am gonna be there longer then 10min - I'm out.  Its that simple. 

Since the initial opening of this Chipole location, a lot of the buzz and hoopla surrounding this place has fizzled and you can normally get in and out in a pretty reasonable amount of time with a quality burrito.  The service is usually above par and the establishment itself is usually kept clean.
