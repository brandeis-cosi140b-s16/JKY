It's Roberto' Tacos... It's fast taco shop kinda food, and I go here all the time.

On a revolving depending on what kinda of mood I am in... I get these things; Chili rellano burrito, chicken tacos, tacos de lingua, breakfast burrito and carne asada fries.

It is moderately priced half way decent Mexican food.  Actually, I would rather eat here than most Mexican restaurants in town.  The food is about the same, it's beans and rice with something wrapped in a tortilla.  But here it is cheap.

I am a little skeptical of the self serve salsa bar. I mean have you ever noticed people - of all walks of life - clumsily ladling salsa into tiny little plastic cups.  It drips off their fingers, the ladle handle slips into the sauce, their jacket sleeves hovering over the salsa. Basically, with out sounding like a winy snob, the salsa thing is kinda gross.  I always eat it though.  My own weird theory is the hot salsa will kill any germs.  In other words germs cannot live in hot sauce.  Which, I am pretty sure is not true, but it helps.

Also, this place displays political signs, which has no place in a restaurant.  They charge fifty cents to use a card.
