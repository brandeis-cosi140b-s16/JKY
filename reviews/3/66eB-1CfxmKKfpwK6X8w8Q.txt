This place is pretty good for what it serves which is border-town Mexican fast-food (tacos, burritos, caramelos, etc).  

The pricing is really good and the portions for what I've ordered are also good, granted I have ordered 3 types of items from their menu (caramelos, Sonora Dogs, and tacos), so I can't speak for their other dishes (burritos, etc).

Their staff is always friendly and quick; the gal at the counter seems like she's the Manager and she speaks both fluent English and Spanish and interacts with everyone in a welcoming manner... she and her staff make it a pleasant experience.

My favorite thing to get here.. when I'm up for something naughty to eat.. is the carne asada cramelo, small.. it's perfectly sized and I really enjoy the combo of buttered tortilla with cheese and well-seasoned beef inside.

You might be asking - "so why only 3 stars?"  Well, considering that I only eat here when I'm partially inebriated or hung-over... or have a hankering for a greasy, fatty, low-quality food... well, that sums it up.  The meat quality is pretty low, especially their Sonora Dogs which tase basically like FUD brand weiners that are made with every decomposable body part of the pig and or other creature.  But it's cheap, so what do you expect.  I guess I justify eating meat here with "I don't come that often".
