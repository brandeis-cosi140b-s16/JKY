Do they still do the half-price late night menu here?  That used to be clutch.  Margaritas are solid and the food is good. They actually steam their burritos, so the tortilla is super-soft and warm.  Like the salsa here too.  

All the way down Atwood, this place caps off a string of good multicultural restaurants.  It's the most fun of them all.
