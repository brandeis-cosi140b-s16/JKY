I've only been to 1900 a couple times but was pleased each visit! They don't seem to be too terribly busy during lunch but the restaurant is very spacious. Our service was impeccable and the food was pretty tasty. I didn't notice anything too spectacular about this Mexican restaurant but I don't have any complaints either. The location is very close to uptown and I imagine stopping in for lunch would be quick.
