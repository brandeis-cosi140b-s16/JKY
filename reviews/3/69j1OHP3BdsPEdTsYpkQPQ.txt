I'm afraid to give this place 3 stars....only because people obviously hate this place.  I don't eat here much but it is what it is, fast food.  Which means you have to lower your standard.  If I was buying fried chicken at Claim Jumper I would be paying 3-4 times as much and getting service which cost money too.  I occasionally get a craving for original recipe KFC and this is the most NW KFC in my area.  I cant stand Taco Bell and do not understand with all the great fast food Mexican why anyone would go here for that.  I did try to go here once after 9pm and they stopped selling chicken and only served Taco Bell which sucks but I was not surprised, remember these people make minimum wage.  I have never had bad service here and its nothing special either, the inside is pretty clean and the chicken serves its purpose when I get a craving.
