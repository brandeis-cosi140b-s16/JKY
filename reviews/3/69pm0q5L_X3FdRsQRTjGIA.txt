Was going to do an afternoon study session at the Starbucks next door and stopped by this joint for lunch.  If you close your eyes and walk in the door, you couldn't tell if you're in a Zaba's, Chipotle, or Q'doba.  What the hell are these chains doing?

Back to the experience....I ordered a Steak Burrito w/Pinto Beans, Rice, Cheese, Guacamole, Sour Cream, Salsa, and Hot Sauce on a Whole Wheat Tortilla.  Of course the Guac was extra.  I also ordered a side of Chips & Queso Dip.....yeah, I was hungry.

They make it in front of you, so there's no wait.  Had a bottle of Water to wash it down.

The Burrito is so/so.....it ranks a distant 3rd behind Q'doba & Chipotle for me.  The Steak was a little tough and didn't have much flavor.  The Hot Sauce/Beans/Guac had all of the flavor.  The Whole Wheat Tortilla was tasty.....don't know if it was healthy, but I'm going to just tell myself to believe it was OK?

The Chips & Queso Dip were very good.....but I was gaining poundage with each bite.....started to regret ordering it.....tasted awesome, but felt guilty consuming extra calories.

Overall, it was OK.

Will I return?  Eh....maybe.
