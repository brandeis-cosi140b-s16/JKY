Filleberto's has been delivering mid-grade, greasy Mexican cuisine in the valley for years now. I remember many late night trips to consume a carne asada burrito with friends before heading home, and the quality of food really hasn't changed all that much. For decent pries you get huge portions of food. Their tortillas are made fresh and are actually very good. I tried the chorizo breakfast burrito for the 1st time; beyond it's massive size it was okay. The chorizo was a little over cooked and they seemed to have skimped on the egg (mostly potatoes and cheese). The drive-thru wait at this location was excruciatingly long for 8:30a on a Sunday morning, but whatever. I paid $12 for two breakfast burritos. Their red hot sauce it tasty, make sure to ask for some with your order- not really that hot at all.
