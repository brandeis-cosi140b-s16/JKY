I've been to this bar/restaurant many times and almost always have a good time. This time I went in for some lunch and a beer with some friends. It was New Years Day so there weren't many people there. The service was very good, and so were the prices, but the food wasn't very good at all. I had four of their $2 tacos and they were just too watery and didn't have much flavor. I'll go with something different next time.
