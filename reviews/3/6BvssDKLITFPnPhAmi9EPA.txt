Food ok - rice and beans bland and beans came cold (i like melted cheese). Chunky salsa was not spicy at all and tasted like it came straight from a jar. Taco meat was pretty good though (i recommend the pulled chicken). Cilantro, red onions and fresh pico de gallo would be great if offered in the salsa bar and also extra hot salsa would be nice for those who like heat. Good service.
