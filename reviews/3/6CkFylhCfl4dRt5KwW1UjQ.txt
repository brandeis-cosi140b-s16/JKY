Hmmmm...where to start... My fiancé and I saw "hecho en..." painted on the side of the building,  and had to try it. We thought we were going to have something close to authentic, and then we walked in. The valley girl who took our order was nice, but just, TOO much...you know what I'm saying? "Super," "cool," "awesome," or "fantastic" after ordering each piece of our meal was just TOO much. However, the employees were all nice and offered good customer service. It just felt like false advertising. 

The food... my burger was fantastic, with the exception that I received onions on it,  when I asked for no onions. But it was awesome. Even the pickles were legit, crunchy and crisp; not flaccid, tasteless nastiness. My fiancé had one of each type of taco. He grew up on the border, and has refined taco taste buds. LOL He rated it 2 stars. He said they are "bougie" tacos. He also said they may have been better if they were all around the same temperature. 

Doubt we'll return.
