The restaurant is good, very friendly and the prices are reasonable.
I sat on the outdoor patio and was put off by the lighting.
There were small useless lights on each table and one "parking lot" bulb lighting the entire patio.
With some subtle lighting this place would be great but I felt like I was in a parking lot - you could not turn towards the one light without getting a painful beam of light in your eyes.
