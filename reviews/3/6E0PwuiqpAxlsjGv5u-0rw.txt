Margaritas are awesome! :)  Nice and strong.

The place is kind of confusing on the atmosphere.  I can't tell if they are trying to be trendy, or be Mexican... or both. 

Food was ok.  I cannot have gluten anymore, so when I tried to get the corn tacos, the sauce they use has gluten in it. (fyi for fellow celiacs)  The server was helpful regarding this tho in checking with the kitchen.  The only thing I could have was a salad, so sadly, I can't rate the food.

Hubs had the street tacos... he only got 2 and didn't get any rice and beans with it, thinking that it would come with them automatically.  Nope... wrong.  This does NOT fill you up... and he was left hungry.  He said they were tasty, but wished it came with rice and beans or 3 tacos.

FYI... this place will hold funds on your card under a different name... this alarmed me until I realized it was the amount of the bill, less the tip that I added.  The final number was labeled under Ochos Locos.
