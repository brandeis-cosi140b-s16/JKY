We were pleasantly vacation drinking tequila using the 2 for 1 coupons handed out by people on the corner (also the same Yelp check in offer). Their well tequila wasn't swill. I'm not sure how often "the wheel of sin" is spun but it was on a good price of Modelo's. The bartender was nice and attentive which helped us stay for a couple of rounds.

Diablo's was a good starting off point for our evening out. It wasn't too crowded but fun for happy hour.
