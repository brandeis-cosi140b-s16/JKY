Food was okay but trying to get toppings in my order is like pulling teeth. They didn't want to put everything I wanted in the bowl. Since I'm vegan I need substantial amount of food so I can last until dinner from lunch. Also they need more workers to clean the tables. I had to clean a table so I can sit. Little messy for a restaurant.
