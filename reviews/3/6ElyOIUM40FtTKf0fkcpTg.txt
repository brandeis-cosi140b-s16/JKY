I used to eat here very regularly, and I really like the Chipotle concept.

I noticed the last few times when I ate at this location, it was very hit-or-miss with regards to presentation.  At times, the counter where the workers served the food just looked messy.  And sometimes the aprons would look messy.

I used to work in fast food and know what its all about.  I don't see any excuse for this.  I probably pay more attention than most people to this issue, so take it with a grain of salt.

That said - the vast majority of the people who work here are really good and friendly, and the food is very good, which is why I was a regular.

Now I tend to eat here a lot less often, simply because I feel it is a crap shoot as to whether the presentation will be OK or not.
