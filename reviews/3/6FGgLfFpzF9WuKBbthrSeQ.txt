I'm changing my mind and adding a star.  I came here for lunch and had the tostada bowl with shrimp. It was so delicious I went back the very next day and got another one. Take a big tortilla and fry it into a bowl (don't eat it). Fill it with fresh lettuce, cabbage,  lard free pinto beans, roasted corn blend, onions, cilantro, grilled shrimp and your favorite salsa and you have a fast, healthy and delicious lunch.
