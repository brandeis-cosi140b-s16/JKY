Atypical Mexican food, or perhaps Tex-Mex is more accurate.  Queso comes with thick chips deep fried that hold a LOT of oil.  Seems like a lot of stuff is oily/fried.  

I thought I was ordering a meatless entree with the cheese enchilada, but then the sauce seemed to have these stringy bits in it.  I asked if it was red sauce or whatever, and it was explained to me that it's basically like a brown beefy gravy.  Thanks, vegetarians love brown beefy gravy on their cheese enchiladas!  Plate was not hot either, and inside the enchilada the cheese (though not cold) was already starting to congeal and was more solid/chewy than it should have been (that's why Mexican places often heat the plates).  Refried beans had a nice whipped texture but were somewhat dry.

Prices more reasonable than the NORTH that used to be here, and weren't bad for what you get.  The "pure" Margarhita was authentic and tasty.

No draft beer.
