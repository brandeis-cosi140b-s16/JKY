Apparently El Valle is known less for their fare (general Americanized Mexican) than the fact that they distribute coupons - ours came from Time Warner, which I believe are offered in conjunction with the folks who put out the big book of coupons for various locations around the city.

Nonetheless, whatever gets people in the door, right?

As has been mentioned previously, the portions are large and the food isn't particularly remarkable, but it's not bad - especially if you do have one of the aforementioned coupons.  Unlike some places when you use the coupon, they are happy to have you as a customer, and don't fret and fume when you use it, which is a nice change from many places.

In my book, that means that service is good.  They also kept the chip baskets and drinks full throughout our visit - something that even places that don't offer coupons won't do.  Sure, it would be nice if the food was better - but it's not the worst in town by a long shot, and if you get a bargain in the process?  Not bad at all.
