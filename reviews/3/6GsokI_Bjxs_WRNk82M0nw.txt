I'll try and not be bias. I grew up and live in Texas which is as close to "real" Mexican food as you'll get. Any other states Mexican food is like a fancy Taco Bell(except this awesome place in Queens). It just doesn't compare. With that being said, I'd say I liked this place. Not loved. Liked. I was seated quickly and was immediately brought chips and salsa. After a few minutes, I met my server and he took my drink order. The menu was large. I wasn't too hungry but needed to eat to avoid a headache later. It was hard to pick since all the items sounded huge. Which is great seeing how good the prices were. I was honestly amazed at their queso. Any time I go to an out of state Mexican place, they either 1. Don't have queso and loom at you like you're crazy when you order it or 2. It's from a can or the same stuff they put on your nachos at ball games. But this stuff was great. I ordered the flauta plate. Like someone else said, it arrived in 5 minutes. Strange since this was a sit down place. I would expect flautas to take at least 15 minutes to arrive. So this makes me think they were made earlier and were kept in a batch under a heat lamp. Even the family of four next time got their food in less than 10 minutes. Hmmm. But regardless, they tasted good. I brought home half of them and the rest of my rice, beans and queso. And for $10 before tip, that's pretty good to have that much leftovers. I'm giving it a 3 just because it was better than I expected and it was quick. But the servers were emotionless and socialized a lot. They were nice but didn't really smile or ask anyone how their food was or check on them. It seemed like they didn't want to be there.
