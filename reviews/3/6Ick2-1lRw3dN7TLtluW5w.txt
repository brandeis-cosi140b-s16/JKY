Fellow Yelpian reviews finally got me to visit this place to try it out. I am going to keep this short and to the point.... the food was yummie.... the salsa choices were very good and I now love the strawberry salsa..... the price was fair.... the service was ok!!...  The only thing I did not like was the portions were a bit on the small side.... the pulled pork is yummie/messy.... the dogfish shark tacos were yummie.... the art was interesting... the place was clean....

Summary... I will visit it again but I did not think it was out of this world great..... but over-all a good exp....
