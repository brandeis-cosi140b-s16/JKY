We were here on a Thursday at 6 PM and we were one of two seated tables - the place is empty!  Happy hour runs 3-6 and the bar area was pretty full because of that.  There is a nice party room in the back for a smallish party which is kind of a nice feature.  Groupon brought me here or I would've never known this place existed!  There is some outdoor seating out front if you're looking for that.  Inside is pretty, modern and nicely decorated.  I could've sat for hours . . . maybe.

The menu is good size, lots of options -- lots to choose from, like many Mexican restaurants.  Chips and salsa here were yummy - no complaints there.  Average spicy, but that's ok as the kids were able to eat it comfortably. 

I ordered the carnitas burrito - it was good, it wasn't awesomely good, but it wasn't bad.  The rice and beans were microwave quality or canned quality, so I skipped anything more than a bite of those.  Hubby had the chicken & carne asada enchiladas and he too reported, "good, but not amazing".  

Service - this is my pet peeve, why are you in a service position if you are inconvenienced by people?  Service was slow and sporadic.
