Don Miguels is advertised as a beautiful and not so typical mexican restaurant. You are invited into the Margarita Bar for a drink you can take to your table ......
The reality is that Don Miguel's is a nice, and VERY typical Mexican restaurant that is done up to look like what people visiting Vegas from Eastern states would envision as "Mexican decor." 
The Margarita bar is nothing special, however, weekday afternoons you can get $1.00 frozen Margaritas in a variety of flavors in some swell little plastic cups. 
The bar also entices you with 1/2 off their appetizer menu.
The food is nice .... I don't know what else to say about it. 
It's just very average and very typical mexican fare.
I admit , I have not tried the Tequila Flan for desert so I may be missing a totally unique dish.
If you need food, and like Mexican, and don't feel like paying a lot of money, then Don Miguel's will meet your needs.

Then again, perhaps my judgement is clouded by the fact that when I enter ..... they seat me in one of the little two seater tables up front between the cash register and the swell Margarita bar. 
Thus, I have not had the opprtunity to savor the full ambience of the wall mural and mirrrors located in the rear of this nice, average establishment.
