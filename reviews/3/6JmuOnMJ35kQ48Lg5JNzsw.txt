I do not like Chronic Tacos but after the club at the Palms we decided to grab a bite to eat.  this place seemed like a good idea being drunk and all.  my boyfriend got a fat carne asada burrito. Not sure if it was because we were drunk, but this burrito was pretty bomb.  it was so delicious omg I wanted one to myself.  I would come here to eat this again.  food was good. service on the other hand not so much. the girls just didnt seem like they wanted to be there. other than that it was good.
