I don't know if Roberto's with their Carne Asada  fries have my taste buds held hostage or what! I tried Baja Taco's version of  Carne Asada fries and I just thought they were overly greasy. I think it is because they use a thicker  fry which absorbs more grease then a skinny fry would. When ever I took a bite it felt like a mouth full of grease. The prices are wonderful and they also send out mailers with coupons so this is great if you are on a budget!
