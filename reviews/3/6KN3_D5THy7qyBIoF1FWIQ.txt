ate here today. i ordered a super carne asada burrito w/ chips and salsa. the meat was too chewy BUT it had really good flavor. as usual, i wasn't into the refried beans at all but everything else in there was good. when my order came up i went to grab it and was confused when i saw chips on the plate with my burrito as well as a whole separate plate of chips. my guess is that chips come with the burrito, which is something i'm not used to outside of the bay area. so that definitely separates this place from the others in town. they also gave me an empty cup with my order of chips which was obviously for salsa but there are cups at the salsa bar so i don't know what the point of that was. i saw it when i walked up and thought "oh they must give you a special salsa you can't get at the salsa bar when you order chips and salsa" but the cup was empty. (i don't actually care about the chips and salsa confusion, that shit was delicious and the more chips the merrier. i'm just bored and felt like boring you with my chips and salsa thoughts) also, i dug the flat screens playing a dvd of people making chile rellenos. made me want one.
