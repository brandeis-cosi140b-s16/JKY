My son talked me into visiting Roberto's Taco Shop for some Carne Asada Fries. I have to admit, I was impressed with this location in comparison to some others I have seen in town. The restaurant was clean and had a wide selection of seating. The fresh veggies bar had an enormously generous portion of cut carrots, cucumbers, onions, and sauces from mild to hot. 

My son enjoyed his meal, and I really enjoyed my marinated carrots and horchata! If you haven't tried a horchata, it is a refreshing rice based Mexican drink made with milk, sugar, cinnamon, and vanilla that is served over ice. This is a must try item!
