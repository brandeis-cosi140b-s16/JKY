Azteca has some great breakfast burritos, too bad they don't open till after I have to be at my desk in the morning.  My coworkers love this place, I think it's so-so. Their carne asada is small, not very flavorful and the meat is boiled not grilled. The place is super busy and small so if you sit in at lunch it's a circus. For carne asada that's much better hit another joint.
