Was in Scottsdale on business and this was recommended as a good spot to bring our group from the office. We sat outside and it was really nice, the atmosphere was comfy and the music wasn't blasting so you could actually hear the people at your table.

Everyone in our party seemed happy with their meals. The guacamole was terrific and we all enjoyed our drinks (I had the white sangria which was pretty good). The food however was a little uneven. I had the crab enchiladas which were tasty but the sauce was so spicey it could have been any kind of meat in there. My friend has a chicken mole dish and she said the mole sauce was absolutely perfect. Someone had the shrimp cocktail which came in a gigantic glass, which was kind of funny (he said it was alright but didn't eat much of it). 

I liked it enough to give it another shot next time I'm there.
