We moved here from out west where the Mexican food is difficult to measure up to...we've been to every Mexican restaurant here that we've heard about and have yet to find one we absolutely adore.  Most of them I would rate at a 1.5 or 2 so Loco Lime is an improvement to be sure with a 3 star rating.

The chips and salsa were good but could have a bit more flavor and heat.  I did like that the chips were warm when the arrived at our table.

I had the fish tacos. The sauce could have been more flavorful but I was glad to find a decent fish taco since I've not found any that are super yet here in the area.  The sauce was different than I had expected but still good.

My husband had the beef and chicken enchiladas and he thought they were delicious and flavorful.

The service was wonderful and I really love the high backed booths.  They give a cozy and private feel which I really enjoy.  We don't drink so I don't have a review of the margaritas.

Although Loco Lime doesn't measure up to my bias memory of my favorite Mexican restaurants out west...when we want Mexican food in Charlotte we think of Loco Lime.
