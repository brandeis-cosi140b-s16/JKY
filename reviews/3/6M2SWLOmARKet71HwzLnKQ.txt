Close walk if you're staying at The Boulders Resort! 

I got the salmon tostadas (slightly fishy) and my lunch date got the beef enchiladas. For the convenience, it was a decent place to dine al fresco. Our host/the owner(?) was super friendly.  

Much like Dan G's review-- Spotted Donkey offers the usual Mex-American fare. Our food was predictable but dependable.
