I gave it 3 stars because I usually just get the breakfast burritos here. They are enormous! I've also had the tortas, and they are rather good. The staff is cool as hell, and they are open 24 hrs! PLUS: GRRRREAT salsa bar inside! DRIVE THRU!

Local is hard to find from the road and parking can be a drag, specially with the D'lish crowd next door. Still, if you got the late-night munchies and little cash, make your way over.
