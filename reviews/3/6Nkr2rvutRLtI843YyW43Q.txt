Run-of-the-mill Chipotle. This location is nothing special. Very small. The only comment I really have is that I felt like I was being rushed out. I was one of like, 4 customers in the restaurant when I was ordering. But I felt like I was being pushed along as if there was a crowed behind me. I order fast since I get the same thing every time, so the fact that they were going too fast for me speaks volumes..
