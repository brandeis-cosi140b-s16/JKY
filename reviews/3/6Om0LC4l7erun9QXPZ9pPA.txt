FYI, El Gran Taquito is nothing more than your typical little hole-in-the-wall place to grab a burrito or taco plate.  In this context, I give it three stars, given the fact that you will often find the same family members working every day to hand-pull the meats and prep the rest of their ingredients to ensure great quality.  It's good food.

Just don't expect anything else, and I guarantee that you will be impressed.  The "crap-aberto" places don't come close in quality, but El Gran Taquito will satisfy the same craving.  So give it a shot next time you want great beans and carne asada but don't require table service or entertainment.
