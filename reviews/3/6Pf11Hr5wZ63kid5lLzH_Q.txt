Came to eat here for the first time looking for some good mexican food. I arrived today (Saturday) at around 1:30pm, the place was packed and there were a LOT of children. After being told to sit at "one of those booths over there" I seated myself, then noticed an entire spilled plate of food sitting there on the floor below an occupied child seat, about three feet away from me. Now, to be fair it's not fair to review Don Jose on the basis of the disturbing customers, and it wouldn't be right if the owner declined service because kids. But then again, is there a reason there are so many kids here? 

I looked around at the build and decor of the place. Feels like northern Mexico. Not rustic, but cheap and simple, and yet comfortable. A bright colored rug / blanket hangs on the wall, drowning out notice of any other wall decor that might have been there.

The food arrived. I ordered a rather complete sampler. Everything was delicious. I washed it down with an over-sized Coke using a way too short straw I kept having to dig back out and hold. Finally, after asking for a check, I had to use their ATM (a $2.50 charge) to pay in cash and walk back to the table to leave some change as a tip. $20 after ATM fees and tip for just my meal. But I was very full of delicious food.

I might be back, probably will, but I'm not a fan yet because of the noisy and messy dining experience other customers gave me and because of cash only payments.
