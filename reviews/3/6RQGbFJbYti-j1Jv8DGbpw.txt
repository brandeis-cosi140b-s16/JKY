If you looking for a great taco or burrito this is the place the food is good an the price is cheap, i always order the tripas tacos thats tripe yes i know but i like funky foods an they don't over cook or fry the hell out of it they sear it to perfection there meat to corn tortilla ratio is real good meat jus hangin out of the taco. This place is kinda sketchy an watch out for the drunks and the gangsters who frequent this venue
