This was the second location I visited, I was rounding up a day of moving so it was my first meal and it was pretty good. I got the shredded beef burrito and it was so juicy that the fluids fell through my tortilla, all allll over me but I didn't even care lol I was just hungry. The first time I tried Robertos, I went to the location on Gibson road and it was a late night munchies trip so I suppose the situations were different but it was okay both times. I hear this location is the best in town though! I just appreciated the drive through because I did not have the strength in me nor was I in the mood to eat inside or pick up.
