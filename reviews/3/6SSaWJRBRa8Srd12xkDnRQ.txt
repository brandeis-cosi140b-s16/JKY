It's mid-priced Mexican cuisine on the fast.  Think of it as the next step up from Taco Bell, but a step down from Pedro's or Chi-Chi's.  

Not everything on the menu is a winner, but the pulled pork quesadillas are outstanding and the Mexican gumbo is pretty solid, especially on a really cold day.  

I rarely understand the people behind the counter on the first try.  Usually, they have to ask their question two or three times.  I love our Mexican brethren, but they're not too fluent on zee Engrish...

Don't think this place is the be-all, end-all, but it's okay.
