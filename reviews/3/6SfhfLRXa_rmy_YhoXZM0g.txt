This is was eh, ok. Not eh, I've had better, and not A-OK. It was eh, shoulder shrug.

Came here for dinner with some awesome peeps, Anthony (always fabulous), Cathy and Mark. The company was great. We always have a fun time. 

The service was good, above average. However, $15.95 for beef, chicken or pork fajitas seems high to me. ($1 extra for shrimp). For a combo it's $25.95 (again a buck more for shrimp). The side of guac and sour cream wasn't enough (I mean is there ever enough sour cream? Me thinks not). The fajita's tasted OK. But, for a place that specializes in them, I thought they'd have more wow. They serve horchada which I love. And even that didnt impress me. It tasted weak and strong on cinnamon. 
They do serve complimentary chips, salsa and beans. I happened to like the beans, but the salsa wasn't good. I wouldn't say it's expensive necessarily, but it's certainly not cheap food. I wont say I'll never come back, but it's not a place I'll be back any time soon.
