We just visited last night with the whole family, that means, with our 3 kids, and surprisingly it was almost empty when we got there. We've been to the other location many times, the one in Sunnyslope, and it is always crowded there, so here we were greeted with the openness of the place, we liked that.
   People started coming in, at the end of our meal it was almost full, but you could still walk between the rows of tables and chairs, no problem. The down side is, that maybe because it's not so busy as the other location, ingredients are being made way ahead and don't taste as fresh, like the corn tortillas for the quesadillas, or the "chicharrón prensado", they tasted dryer then expected. Nevertheless, it good, not great, but good all around.
We ordered from the "Aguas Frescas" section, those are always super-good, when the fruit they use are ripe. I had the Cremosa de Fresa, hubby ordered a cremosa de Piña, my son ordered the Agua de Mango, and the younger ordered sodas.
On our food order we had a Quesadilla de Chicharrón Prensado al estilo Rey (huge serving of corn quesadilla with Chicharrón, covered with creme, cilantro and onions), Pambazo de Chicharrón Prensado (Telera bread filled with the chicharrón and cheese, and then the whole torta is covered with their red sauce, it's messy to eat, but taste so good!), Large carne asada quesadilla, with a side of pico de gallo, avocado and beans, and finally, a Milanesa de Pollo (Chicken Milanese), this one with a side of rice and beans.
It was a lot of food, but we tried our best to polish the plates!
We recommend it, even if it wasn't exactly how we are used to, maybe it was just a fluke, it was a slow day for them. I would go back just for the drinks!!
