Were it not for my insatiable craving for carne asada fries, I would have never ventured over to this "local" side of Sahara Avenue.  This Roberto's is located right next door to PT's Pub, and I mean RIGHT NEXT DOOR.  Like, they share the same door and same wall.  So, as you're sitting in the tiny restaurant of Roberto's, enjoying your food, you'll definitely feel the bass of hip hop music bumping next door.  Or, if you're lucky enough, you'll be able to listen to every word of a horrible rendition of Babyface's "Everytime I Close My Eyes" during karaoke nights.

So, how were the carne asada fries, you ask?  For $7.10, I thought they were on the pricey side.  They weren't as good as you'll find in San Diego, but good enough to whet my palate until I visit SD again.  The SO had them for the very first time and was intrigued with the whole french fries thing.  I didn't care too much for the huge dollops of sour cream and I thought the fries could have been served hotter.

What was annoying about the service was that the guys behind the counter were working at the pace of snails.  And while people were waiting in line to order, the cashier was just chatting on his cell phone.  How rude!
