Been eating here for 3 years, only order the Steak Bowl, recently the Quality of the steak has become tougher, and I have noticed I constantly have to repeat myself or the orders are totally wrong. If the person filling your order is new the order is going to be screwed up, watch while it's being made or you may get home and find its not your order.
