Breakfast menu is fairly good. That Ham burrito is something else. The combo menu is a pretty standard affair and just about anyone who likes Mexican food will find something to enjoy. 

My only complaint comes from the fact this place never opens on time. Despite the widow and the Yelp info saying 6 am. The staff always shows up late. 

So if your looking for that breakfast burrito show up at 6:30 instead.
