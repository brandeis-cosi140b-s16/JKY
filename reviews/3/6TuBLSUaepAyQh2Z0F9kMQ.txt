Exactly what I expected, wanted, and got!!  Came for a breakfast burrito and ordered a ham egg cheese and potato burro. It was cooked to order and I have no complaints with the food. The service was friendly and timely and the facility was clean. I wish there was a possibility of 3.5 stars because that's what this place deserves. I will be back for sure. I love breakfast burritos and I was very happy with this one. The red sauce was the perfect blend of flavor and heat to pair with my burro.
