Pretty much like the Old Town location, this NoSco Salty is crap food-wise.  Same menu, same sub-par eats.  Chips and salsa are about the only thing I can stomach here, but the drinks and happy hour are what people come for anyway.  

Right off the 101 and Raintree, this North Scottsdale location is perfect for pre-partying before Maloney's on Shea or Sand Bar.  

Dress is casual on any day and prices are reasonable always.
