I accidentally found Torta Rica when I ventured away from the hospital where my best friend was in labor and hitting hour 22. Forget the upcoming birth of my nephew... I was hungry. I didn't have to drive very far to see the nice building that housed Torta Rica. I had remembered Ayesha's review and decided to pull over, and give them a try. I am so glad that I did! 

When I entered the restaurant, it was very nicely decorated and it was clean. I guess I was expecting a hole in the wall setting, so I was pleasantly  surprised at what I saw. 

I ordered La Torta Rica which comes stuffed with Carne Asada, bacon, grilled onions and chiles. It also comes with Mexican cheese (think fresh mozzarella), lettuce, tomato, jalapeno, and avocado! As you can probably imagine, the torta was HUGE. The bread it came on was soft and stood up well to all the juices that were mingling around inside.The torta was delicioso!  The carne was well seasoned and you could taste that it had been grilled. I topped the torta with guacamole salsa. It was spicy but not too hot. I was a very happy girl after eating the GIANT torta.
 
I didn't know the torta was going to be so huge so I made it a meal for 1.99 extra. That meant it came with rice, beans and tortilla chips. My advice, skip it. The rice and beans were not good. They were nothing amazing, don't even bother. The star is the torta and I promise you won't be hungry after you eat one.

It is a little pricy but it honestly is a big sandwich that you're eating with quality ingredients inside. I hope to return to Torta Rica sometime soon to sample more of their specialties!
