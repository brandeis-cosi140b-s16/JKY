Only a two hour happy hour here, but this HH packs some BS Happy Hour pricing.  You have four freshly made margarita's for 5 bucks each and a bunch of varied foods from $3 and you are also offered some free and very crisp chips and some solid salsa. We tried the quesadilla, which is half a normal quesadilla and is mostly half price, so how does that get us a happy hour deal? Give me the full quesadilla at half price. Mostly a similar situation with the nachos at HH, which come in a tiny bowl (sans meat) for $3 as well. You are just getting a tiny portion of stuff for less money - it has nothing to do with Happy Hour. Better off grabbing a few drinks and the free chips to beat the system and isn't that what it's all about anyways?
