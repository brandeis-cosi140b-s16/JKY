Nothing much to say about Qdoba except reasonable price food, nothing WoW about the food except it ok, decent portion, and if looking for something quick on the go. It decent option. It located right next to my normal gym 24hours so if starving after workout one of my go spots. I normally get the bowl because less of mess then burrito style. Maybe all the same but feel like getting more food in the bowl. Not much of fan comes to brown rice but they do have that option. I usually get the chicken feel cooking on point sometimes dried out since cut small diced and keep warm. Really when you put the salsa, beans, and guacamole all good. The guacamole fan of! It taste fresh and made daily. Overall not authentic Mexican but in the end food that would come back for quick, simple, filling, and hits the spot.

The service never had bad one. The staff has always been friendly and  great experience. I like the soda fountain. It one of self service but catch is get choose from six different coca cola flavors and lot more choices. The only downfall is since only one machine depending on the business might have to wait. The interior is pleasant, clean, and relaxing vibe.
