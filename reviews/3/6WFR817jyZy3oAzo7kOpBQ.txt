Closest Chipotle to my new house. Too bad my first visit did not leave me with a great first impression.

Place was not too busy on a Sunday afternoon when my husband and I entered. It's smaller than some Chipotle's I've been in.

Ordered typically - a burrito, this time I went for steak, my husband got a chicken burrito. When the girl went to wrap our burritos, both of them broke in the middle, which was weird, because I've never seen that happen to my burrito before at any other Chipotle. My husband on the other hand - he gets his stuffed so much they usually have to double-wrap, so I wasn't surprised.

Sit down with our burritos to discover - the tortillas were not properly steamed. Mine was quite dry and crunchy on the ends. Either they are using tortillas past their prime - or they are not steaming them enough. 

Usually I love Chipotle, they are typically on their A-Game. Not this time around.
