We live in Phoenix. Finding a good, quick Mexican food place should be easy. I wish I could say this was my new go-to Mexican food joint since it is right up the road from me. We went here Saturday evening around 6:30 and we were the only ones in the place. I ordered the chicken enchiladas, which were mediocre.  I am not a huge fan of dark meat with half the fat still hanging on, and unfortunately that's what was packed into my enchiladas.  I tried my husband's carne asade burrito, and it was tasty, although took a long time to chew. The prices were great, and we ordered chips which were hot from the greaser and absolutely delicious. The chips were probably the best I've ever had, and certainly the best part of my meal.
