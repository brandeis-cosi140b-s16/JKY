i was working in the area and it was lunch time. Actually, I was going to Carl's Jr for a quick burger and I noticed this place in the corner of the parking lot as I drove in. so decided to give it a try and give me something to Yelp about.

Kind of a cafeteria style ordering system, you order the food and progress in line where you can watch it prepared and answer any questions they have or ask for anything you want.

It's the typical southwestern type food. They have a fairly good selection, I decided on the Chile Roast Beef (seasoned shredded beef) tacos, black beans and rice. It was good, certainly better than the burger I was going to get.

Would not drive very far to specifically go there, but if I'm in the area I would eat there again (I want to try the burrito, it was huge).

There is certainly no shortage of places to eat at this intersection (Ft Apache & Sahara), but if you're in a southwest mood, give it a try.
