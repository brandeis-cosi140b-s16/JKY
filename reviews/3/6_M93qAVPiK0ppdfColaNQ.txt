I don't typically care for 'berto's-type Mexican restaurants.

But some days, I get up and don't feel like cooking breakfast, or I'm out of eggs or whatever. 

I can rely on Federico's to serve up a good version my favorite breakfast burrito: potato and egg, AKA, the "country".

Believe it or not, it's easy to screw up something so simple. But Federico's gets it right -- fluffy eggs, browned but not greasy potatoes -- all good.
