The dining room is open!!! After what seemed like months of remodeling, the dining room is now open for business again. 

Don't expect a radical change. It's the same size. Some new flooring. Some new furniture. Some extra wall sockets. But a significant improvement given how tired this Taco Bell location had become. The change in the exterior is also a noticeable upgrade. And I suspect the added square footage behind the counter is a boost for employee morale. Also improved restrooms.

Just think, this Taco Bell was narrowly saved, thanks to some legal wrangling, from being converted into a Fry's Grocery Gas Station! Phew!!! Now it's all new and shiny! Well, mostly new and shiny.

A well below average Taco Bell before the remodel, this location is now quite nice. Still, the Taco Bell at nearby Tatum & Bell remains nicer. Perhaps if they offered valet parking like the neighboring Fry's Marketplace...
