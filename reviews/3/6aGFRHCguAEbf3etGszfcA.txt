Scott D. has this place pretty much spot on.  We usually order the Gringo dinner (I think that is what its called) which is burger and fries with 3 tacos.  It's around $6 and its all pretty decent.  Its cheap and quick, basically.  Similar to Tacos Mexico (which is just down the street), if you live in the area its a good place to go but I wouldn't go out of my way to get here.  We would usually hit it up on our way back from the Palms.

Don't expect much more than typical mexican food with some american stuff thrown in and you'll be happy you came.
