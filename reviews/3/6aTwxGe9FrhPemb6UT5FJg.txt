Ajo Al's offers relatively expedient service (90% of the time at least) with slightly above average mexican cuisine. The food is more of a Gringo style mexican cuisine not the Sonoran style "border slop" that my wife prefers but it is reliably good. The staff is friendly, the environment is tastefully well decorated, and the service is good 90% of the time.
