I was really excited to see that Wahoo's was finally coming to Henderson.  Besides PT's, it is the only cool bar and restaurant close enough without going all the way into Vegas.  We walk though the doors and overhear and Taking Back Sunday playing on the radio.  That made me super excited.  The decor is cool with a skate/surf socal vibe.  The line was out the door which I expected from a newly opened business.  We decided to sit  in the bar area to avoid the line, but no one was paying attention and we didn't get any type of recognition for about 15 minutes.  Not even a glass of water or a, "We'll be right with you".  Finally, a server noticed us and took our orders.  We got our food and it was delicious, but the wait was pretty disheartening.  With more time, though, I think they'll work out the kinks.
