A visit to Tortilla Flat isn't complete without a stop in the Superstition Restaurant & Saloon.  This is a great tourist stop that wont disappoint.  The d√©cor is unique but great for the family and photos.  The menu is filled with those western basics, the one must have is their BBQ pork shank covered in Prickle Pear cactus sauce.  AWESOME!  I also had a bread bowl of their chili and had a nice steady sweat afterwards, the beer is served cold and in a mason jar.  If you get their at the right time you can see live music or the gunfight in town.
