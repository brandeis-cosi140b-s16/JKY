The chicken is delicious! I'm a huge fan of their mac&cheese too. I've only been to this location once, it was a Tuesday night around 6:30. It wasn't really busy, but the tables seemed dirty (the floor under the table was awful). We had ordered one of the family meals and asked for a couple water glasses. They said they were out and grudgingly gave us one soda cup for three people. That's a little ridiculous. It's not our fault they were out of water glasses, there's no need to be all grumpy about giving us cups. We really did only want water. That's a minor issue, I know, but it was frustrating to need to share one cup between three people. We can't drink soda right now, so we weren't going to buy a soda cup just to get some water. 

Apart from the stupid cup issue and the slightly dirty appearance, it was fine. The chicken is always amazing.
