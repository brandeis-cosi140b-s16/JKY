This place is hit or miss.  That goes for the whole experience from service to food to price.  

I feel like the folks here can be on the rude side, but no matter how rude, the do get the order right.  I've ordered cheese enchilada's here before that the cheese wasn't even melted.  I can make that for $.50 cents.. and put it in the microwave and get a better outcome.  And.. to top it off, a couple taco's and some horchata will run you almost 10 bucks.. Ouch.

On the positive side, the horchata is yummy and you can't really go wrong with steak taco's on soft corn tortilla's.  Order this and you are safe.
