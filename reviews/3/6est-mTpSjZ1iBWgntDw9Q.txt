A place that serves chips, salsa and queso in my work 'hood? Yes please!

Picante is a nice addition to the city's west side. It's your typical taco/burrito grab-and-go Mexican eatery. (think Chipotle) Pick your protein, toppings and whatever vessel you choose to hold it all together and stuff your face. I usually go with the burrito bowl. It's a lot of food.. and you don't have to battle with an overstuffed, crumbling tortilla.

Personally, I'm a fan of the vegetarian, but the pulled pork is also pretty tasty. They do charge extra for quac on the proteins. Picante also offers brown rice in addition to the white and three types of tortillas.

Bonus: Right now Picante is offering a special on WBTV's Deal zone. $5 for $10 worth of food. The deal is offered for the next 11 days and you can buy multiple vouchers. Here's a link: http://www.wbtvdeals.com/d/picante-mexican-grill-deal-30

I used one yesterday and it covered a veggie burrito bowl, drink and chips/salsa. Nice little meal for $5.

Friendly staff, plenty of parking available and outdoor seating. A quick, convenient lunch/dinner option if you work or live in this area.
