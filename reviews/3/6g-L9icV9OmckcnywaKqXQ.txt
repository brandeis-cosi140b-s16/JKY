This is a 3.5 star review.  Why can't we give half stars, Yelp??!?!?!?!

We had lunch at Nacho Daddy on a Monday.  It was a little busier than I thought it would be, but we got right in.  Our server immediately took our drink order and we got some chips with queso and salsa.  The "medium" salsa had almost no heat, I guess the mild is just ketchup.  Next time, we will get hot.  It mixed really well with the queso, which needed more peppers/onions.  I highly recommend mixing the salsa into the queso, they went well together.  You have to pay either $1 or $2 for salsa with the queso, which was annoying, but we would get it again.  Like I said, we would just go with the hotter version.

To eat, I had the lunch special, which is your choice of 2 tacos or enchiladas with rice and beans.  I think it was $8.29, I know it was less than $9.  It was a lot of food.  The mahi mahi taco was HUGE, but the fish was not seasoned.  It had nice grill marks on it, but lacked flavor.  Again, I found myself wanting more heat.  It's size and the number of ingredients made it difficult to eat.  The mango salsa was good, but not great.  The pork enchilada was tender and moist.  I would get the enchilada again.

The wife had a ground beef chimichanga, which was HUGE.  Even with me having a couple of bites, we brought home more than half.  It has a lot of sour cream and guac on top.  It has rice and beans inside, which was okay, but I would have preferred the interior be mixed more.  Some bites were all rice or all meat.  The ones with everything were great.  

We brought this home and cooked it the next day for lunch in our toaster oven.  I think it's the first time we have had fried food leftovers that got BETTER the second day.  I don't know why, but this thing was fantastic the next day, it improved like chili or a stew would.  I think next time we eat here we will get a chimichanga to go and split it the next day for dinner.
