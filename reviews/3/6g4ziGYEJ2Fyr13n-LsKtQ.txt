Better for take-out than lingering for atmosphere. My friend of nearly 40 years came to town from Philly, seeking "Mexican" like we enjoyed in Colorado as college students. Thanks to Yelp, I found El Herradero - not far from my home in Anthem. The kitchen is fantastic with great dishes and no 'attitude'. Superb value.  3 stars for the food. The dining area is so-so.
