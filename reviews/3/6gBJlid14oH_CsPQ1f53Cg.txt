This place is hit or miss.

Our first experience here was a delight, and every time since we've liked it less and less.

The last time we were here we ordered some Nachos... except what we got was a giant sloppy plate of disgustingness.

If you find yourself in this restaurant, try the Camarones ala Diablo- a delicious SPICY shrimp dish.  It's actually worth the incredible heartburn that you will be experiencing for the next 6 hours.
