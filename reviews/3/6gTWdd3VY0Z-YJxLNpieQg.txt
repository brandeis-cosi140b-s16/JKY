Just to be clear, this would have been a 5-star rating if based only on the food and not the restaurant itself. I think it's important to make that differentiation because Habaneros food is excellent! I would highly recommend their tacos or burritos. 

That being said, I would encourage you to get your food TO GO! This place is disgusting inside. After Rocky Rococos closed, they made an attempt to "revitalize" the space by adding more color. Unfortunately the paint that was added to the walls was also added to the floor. In addition to the paint, the floors are filthy. Saw dust from construction (months ago). Dirt and Grime from where booths use to be. Holes in several walls and temporary electrical (extension chords) taped to the ceiling to run lights, etc. 

It is clear that management rushed opening this location. They brought their excellent food, but fell way short in providing a nice place to eat it. I've been here several times and there doesn't seem to be any interest in changing the ambiance any time soon.
