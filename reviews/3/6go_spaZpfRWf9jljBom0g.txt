I will try this place again. It was good, the ambiance was nice--though my feet didn't touch the ground on the chairs because I am such a shorty. I had the tres moles, which were good but not distinct enough. The street corn was good, but come on guys, give some free salsa, what is this? We had the cactus salad which was a nice tangy addition but can't be eaten on it's own because it's too acidic. My biggest "complaint" if you could call it that was just that the menu wasn't customizable enough. What if I want one cheese enchilada one pork and one chicken? That should be allowed. Same with the tres moles...this would be a great place for sharing, if only I was with a meat eater
