Solid little restaurant for a quick pick me up.  I do not understand the baby tacos that i have been experiencing at a lot of these types of restaurant.  They are literally the size of a dollar and cost 2. The price for what you get IS NOT WORTH IT. I think I said this about another taco place that I experienced.   The taste is great but just not into food that does not feel me up or is not bigger than the palm of my hand.
