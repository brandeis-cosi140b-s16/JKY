Pros: There's never a wait for a table; and, the chips and salsa are always fresh. Also, the wait staff and management are always incredibly friendly.

Cons: The service can be slow; and, I've had issues getting exactly what I ordered. I've both received simply the wrong food or the dish I wanted wasn't available.

Overall, Patron is a solidly average Mexican joint. I would rather spend a little less and grab lunch instead but the occasional Friday night family dinner is okay by me.
