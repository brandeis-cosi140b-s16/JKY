I think that this place could have real potential. They serve you free all you can eat chips and dip. Our chips were still warm from being cook and the salsa had a great kick to it. I ordered the enchilada Mexican i believe that had 2 cheese, 2 chicken, and 2 beef enchiladas along with sour cream, guacamole, lettuce, rice, and beans. Everything tasted delicious! I had to share of course because it was a ton of food. The service was a little on the slow side. The whole feel of the place was a little bland, but  the food made up for it.
