Stopped in recently with a friend to have dinner after work. I was excited to try a family owned mom and pop type shop for some Mexican grub. I felt that it was just ok. I ended up getting the carne asada sopes which were a pretty good size. I ordered two and had my friend help me finish the second. You do get chips and salsa brought out to the table, but there is a charge for refills. WHO charges (especially a Mexican restaurant) for refills on chips and salsa???????? The soda drink that you order is brought out in a can, do there are no free refills on that either -- so don't come here thirsty!!! It was fun to try a new place, but I probably won't return.
