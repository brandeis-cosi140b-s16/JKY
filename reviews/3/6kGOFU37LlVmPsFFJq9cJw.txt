Great service, ok food, average chips and salsa. 

FOOD 
The chips and salsa are very average. Large tortilla chips and a pretty mild salsa with huge tomatoes in it. 
I've had tacos, enchiladas, burritos and cheese quesos here. As pointed out in a previous review, the food here is very Americanized Mexican food. Everything is pretty bland and mild for Mexi-food. Bean and rice are your stereotypical refried bean and orange Mexi rice. The cheeses are a little greasy. 

SERVICE 
Our waitress was fantastic. She gets 5 stars. We had plenty of chips and salsa, and our drinks were never empty. She was friendly but not overly pushy. 

AMBIANCE 
If you're looking for quiet and romantic, don't come here. The restaurant is very open and the acoustics are awful. The decor is simple with Mexican flare, but not terribly gaudy. 

OVERALL
Great place for a quick downtown lunch if you don't mind Americanized Mexi-food that could be cheaper.
