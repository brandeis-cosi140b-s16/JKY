I have to admit by the time we walked in the door I was hungrier then any gal should be. 
It was dark inside and a little bar-ish for my first thing in the morning tastes, and that music not entirely to my liking.
My lovely friend wanted to bring me here and as deserted as it was it was nice to have a table by the fireplace.
Our waiter was charming and the food more then made up for everything.
We both went with Mexican meatloaf and eggs. Have you ever? Never would think of having that combo for breakfast. It came with beans and crispy hash browns. I liked the beans but the hashbrowns were ok.
My friend chose the same item as I did and she chose the hot sauce mixed in with her meatloaf and eggs along with a Bloody Mary. Both were on the spicy side but she was happy. I had to have mine without any sauce and it was flavorful and good without needing the kick from me.
This place is Also attached to a Richardsons  which is another place to eat with a lovely patio in between. 
The coffee was good as well and it was worth the drive. Would probably have preferred it more for a dinner place but still good at breakfast/brunch.
