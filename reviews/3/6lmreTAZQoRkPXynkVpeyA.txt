It is all about the patio here and such nice place to eat outside.  Best thing we had was the carne asada folded cheese crisp.  Very yummy.  Next best dinner was the chimi.  Everything else we tried like taco, tostado and enchilada was very plain.  Prices are high but we coupon from Restaurant dot com.  Otherwise, it would be too much for me to eat here.  I have one coupon left so I will be back for the cheese and maybe try some polo asada next time.
