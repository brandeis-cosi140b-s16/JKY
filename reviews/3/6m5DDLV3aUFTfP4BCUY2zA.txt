Pretty much like every other restaurant in the chain. If you like one, you will like them all. Having always lived in areas with much better burrito restaurants (Freebirds in TX and CA, Boca Grande in Seattle), I only hit Chipotle if I am on the road or in a hurry.

The carnitas burrito is OK, too much rice and I don't like the fact that guacamole is extra at this price point. Also it would be nice if they just tossed in chips too. I don't get the review that stated generous portions. I assume the tortilla size  is standard, and it is definitely smaller than most burrito places I have gone too.
