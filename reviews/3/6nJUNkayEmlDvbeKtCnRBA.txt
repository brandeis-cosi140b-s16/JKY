My fianc√© and I came here within the first week that it opened, so this review should be taken with a grain of salt. The decor was amazing and the drink options were pretty unique, so that was pretty cool! The line to order food was pretty disorganized, but it was within their first week so you can't fault them. Food was pretty average, chipotle has more flavoring for sure. Restaursnt was generally clean minus the employee who pushed the trash down into the trash can with her foot, which was pretty gross. Prices were comparable to similar restaurants. Overall wasn't mind blowing but wasn't terrible, worth a try if you like those type of restaurants for sure!
