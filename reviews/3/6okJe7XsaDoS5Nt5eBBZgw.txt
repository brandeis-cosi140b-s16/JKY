Tacos were good, but dining experience was awkward and uncomfortable.  I arrived in Phoenix mid afternoon and was looking for a late lunch. Saw the great reviews and it was close to my hotel, so I drove there to give it a try. I was the only one there. Staff were organizing for the dinner crowd no doubt.  The staff were very friendly.  I ordered a smoked marlin and grilled shrimp taco.  When my order arrived I ate the marlin taco first, which was very good, but could have used less cheese.  When I went to eat the shrimp taco, I noticed it was not shrimp so I flagged the waitress down to let her know the order was wrong. She went away then came back saying that since the taco was already cooked I could not send it back.  I told her I had ordered and wanted a grilled fish taco and she went away, later coming back with a shrimp taco and the fish taco in a box.  When I got the bill three tacos were on it and I had to Flagg her down again to ask for the fish taco I did not order to be removed. The whole situation just was uncomfortable to me. If I lived locally I would give them another chance.  Just could have been such a better experience.
