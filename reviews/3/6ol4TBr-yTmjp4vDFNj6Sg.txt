Clean little taco shop normal selection of stuff.

Going with fish taco lunch special.  I have had a hard time finding a really good fish taco in Vegas.  So after trying the fish tacos I'm still searching.  However the rice actually had some flavor and the beans tasted like they were made in house.  The service was better than I need for a taco shop.  I will give them another shot because I liked their rice and beans.
