Cool little build-out and decor. Tried 6 different tacos, chips & salsa (no drinks) which came out to $23. Tacos were good but not great and really small. Literally 3 regular bites. 

We were very excited to try this spot out as we'd been to his old place and this one is walking distance to our house. However, considering the price I just can't justify making it a regular stop of refer to a friend. Arrived excited, left wanting more and to pay less... :(
