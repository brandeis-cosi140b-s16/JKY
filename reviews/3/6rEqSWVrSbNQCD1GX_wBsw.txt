I always get stoked to see late-night Mexican food that isn't Filiberto's. It's good enough, portions are big, but there's nothing it does particularly well. Tacos are meh. Burritos are so-so. Carne asada fries don't need to have a tub of sour cream. And food eeds spice of some sort, not just salt and 5 little cups of salsa! At least it's clean, and the guac is legit. 

It's far from the most delicious spot in the area, but at 3am it can be trusted. Isn't that what's really important?
