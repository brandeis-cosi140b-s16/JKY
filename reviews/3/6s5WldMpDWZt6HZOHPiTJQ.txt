The reviews are pretty spot on regarding food.  Its NOT authentic Mexican food, but I didn't think it was that bad like some people describe.   WAAAY better than El Torito!  I've been here several times during my residence in Phoenix and one thing has me coming back - COCONUT MARGARITAS! They are the best Margaritas I've had!  Toasted conconuts grace the rim of the glass and at least in my experience, they were very generous with the alcohol ( doubt its top quality, but you can ask for the good stuff).

I usually get the enchiladas and I've never had dry chicken, but that's my luck I guess.   Its got some interesting decor, but I wouldn't call it a cheap place to go.  Try the Sopapillas with honey, they are darn tasty!
