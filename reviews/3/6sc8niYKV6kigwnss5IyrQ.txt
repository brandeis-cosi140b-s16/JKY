Gosh, I love Mexican. Fish tacos are quite possibly my favorite food of life so when I saw grilled fish tacos on Gonzalez y Gonzalez's menu, I had no doubt that's what I was going to order. We popped in before heading to the Jimmy Buffett concert at the MGM so we were on a margarita-drinking roll when we stopped by. The food was good, but it was pretty standard Mexican (not that that's a bad thing); not particularly creative but nevertheless a good, decently-priced fish taco with good service. Since we were heading to the concert, we opted for their oversized margarita (the 48oz. behemoth) for the road. For $20, it's hard to beat considering we were paying $8-10 a pop for margaritas elsewhere. All around, good Mexican and perfect for a casual bite.
