Obviously Salsaritas is a chain but I love this location because everyone is so friendly!!  There is almost always a door-greeter person at lunch that helps keep the dining area clean and pokey-eaters alert.  This is great for group breakfasts and great lunches too!  

It is the one place most of my team likes and we always leave super happy and full!  The best seat at lunch is at the counter to people watch.  Skip the boring chicken (it is much better at Chipotle anyways) and get the el pastor, you wont regret it!  :-D
