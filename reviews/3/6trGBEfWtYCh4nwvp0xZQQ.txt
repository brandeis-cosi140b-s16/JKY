When you first enter the restaurant it puts you in the mind of Roberto's, the food is pretty similar to Roberto's as well. The restaurant was clean and the staff was friendly. They have the station to add to your food with the sauces and peppers, our food was fast and fresh and it was delish. I got my go to meal carne asada chimmie and the husband ventured from the norm and tried their taco salad with carne asada. His food was well prepared and the portions were big, he said he liked that the shell was not overly greasy like other places he tried. My chimmi was cooked to perfection with the perfect balance of meat cheese beans ect. We will visit this place again!!
