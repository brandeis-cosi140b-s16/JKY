I had to stop by this place before a show and honestly, it wasn't worth it esp. considering the distance between the strip and this place. I ordered for a take out and they were so rude about it. I wanted deep fried ice cream because it is the most delicious dessert, and it sucked. Hands down, the ice cream sucked. And the ice cream cost $6. So sad...
