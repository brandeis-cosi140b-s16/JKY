No, I can't say that I'll be back here. In all honesty, the service was great but I was not impressed by the food. Perhaps it was the way I was spoiled with coastal Mexican food from Guerrero that makes me stick my nose up at green chile and lime chicken.

The bad:
- Well, the music is awful. No, I don't want to hear alt-rock from 1999. I'm as bi-cultural as they come what with La Sonora Dinamita sitting right next to Led Zeppelin on my shelf. I don't go to Mexican restaurants to listen to angsty teenage rock., though. 

- The tortillas were slightly better than Carolina's (which if anyone in Phoenix really knew what a tortilla was, it's not a massive crepe thin pancake) but they aren't great. I'll cut some slack on this.

- The chicken was dry. I went and had the lime chicken. It was tasty, yes, but it was dryer than a Mitchum covered armpit. There was no falling off the bone moment for me here.

- The arroz might as well be coming from my sister-in-law who cannot cook rice for the life of her. 

The good:
-They have bottled soda from Mexico. No, they don't have Yoli, but that's ok because their horchata is pretty good.

- Close to light rail

- The prices aren't as expensive as they could be. 

- I'll give them props on the beans. At least they aren't the same ol' refried beans everyone else gives out. 

I may go back if someone else buys and I get something different. Maybe for breakfast? 

Oh, and the recycling bins are pointless. They all say recycling but people don't separate and it all ends up in the same pile. 

Everyone else might like this place but for those of us from Southern Mexico, we might be waiting awhile for above average food.
