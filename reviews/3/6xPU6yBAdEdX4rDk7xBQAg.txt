Tried espos again when we were on a rush and needed a bite on the run. It was affordable and fine for take out. I tried the chicken flautas this time and for under $4 it hit the spot and I was happy. 

With adjusted expectations now, I think I would return to Espos when I need something affordable and quick. Definitely a good alternative to any generic chain or fast food place.
