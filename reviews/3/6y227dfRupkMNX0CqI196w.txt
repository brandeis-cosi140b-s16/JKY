Any variation of the California burrito or nachos is a solid meal, and a large one. Service is friendly, and dining room is huge with several screens broadcasting futbol at any given time. 

Breakfast burritos are limited to bacon or ham, which originally pushed me to try their California burrito on my first visit: it's traditional to get it with asada (and the texture contrast is signature to this dish), but the lengua here is good and flavorful, and I sometimes get that instead.

The nachos will run you $8+/order, but is large enough for two full-grown men to share while watching a game. They'll insist on separate orders but each will have a sad, unfinished heap they can't manage to finish at the end.

Low prices, good quality. Don't forget to get salsa with your takeout orders- it's not automatically put in the bag for you!
