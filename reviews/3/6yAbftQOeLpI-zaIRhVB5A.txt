I'm surprised I had never eaten at El Pollo Loco.  But Jeff Lewis seems pretty fond of it, either that or El Pollo Loco pays him extreme amounts of money to eat it on the show.  And I LOVE that show, so I thought I might love El Pollo Loco, too.

I went with the twice grilled chicken burrito, not sure if the twice grilled part referred to grilling the chicken twice or grilling the chicken once and then grilling the burrito.  It was the latter.  Anywho, filled with chicken breast, pico, sour cream, guac, and a little cheese, it was quite tasty, and probably pretty healthy wouldn't you think?  I like that you get a little bag of tortilla chips with your order.  Also sampled the black beans, but they were a barbeque bean, not my thing.

It was fun to see strawberry soda on the fountain, too, which I had to have, much to my husband's horror.  This from the man who drinks orange soda routinely.  

The restaurant was reasonably clean, but my shoes stuck to the floor, perhaps from someone else's sickeningly sweet strawberry soda.  It was a nice change to have your order brought to the table.  I hate the lingering at the counter you get at most fast food restaurants.

Too bad my somewhat healthy burrito had 796 calories, and 39g of fat.  While I might return to El Pollo Loco if convenient, I wouldn't go out of my way for that kind of nutrition.  I would opt for a (insert name)berto burrito instead.

And BTW, you can catch the new season of Flipping Out Tuesdays on Bravo.  Now that's useful information!
