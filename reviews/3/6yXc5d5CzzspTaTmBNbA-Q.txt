Pleasant spot for a margarita-filled lunch or dinner. 3.5 stars

Highlights:
- Margaritas: I loved the fruity grand canyon one (lime, prickly pear, etc.) and the hub got an adult version of a milkshake canister with his 2-limit margarita (got 4 glasses out of that thing!)
- Outside/inside seating: outside was nice on a patio especially at night overlooking some blue lit up trees and misters for the heat, but inside was a nice A/C haven for the height of the sunny day.
- Chips: combo of sweet wontony, yellow corn, orange spiced, and blue corn as well as sweet potato chips. It's rare to find such variety.
- Salsa: great roasted flavor
- Pork: carnitas was a large portion of meat--quite juicy and tasty
- Menu: pure mex and southwestern mex as well as pastas and salads
- Dessert: creative presentation with white chocolate pecans enveloped in a tamale wrapper. Complementary item which was a nice touch.
- Staff: super duper friendly which I appreciated

Lowlights:
- Crabcake: too dense cornmealy for me--couldn't taste much flavor or crab
- Fish: didn't taste too fresh and advertised that veggies would be in the mix, but only limited slivers to were found.

Decent spot. I'd come again for chips and margaritas.
