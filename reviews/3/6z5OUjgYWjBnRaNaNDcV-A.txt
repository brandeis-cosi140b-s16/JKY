I am SO HAPPY this place is open 24 hours!
Because even though the food is not great, it is F'N AMAZING at 2 in the morning when you are coming home from parting with friends!

Or even better, have some lunch while you are having your car washed!
Easy In-and-Out location, with a few tables out front. 

Check out the specials board, there are a lot of great deals. But honestly, everything is pretty cheap! And the service is ALWAYS cheerful! The guys behind the counter are so great! And imagine what kind of drunk nonsense that have to put up with!...and yet, still smiling!
