The complimentary chips and salsa were great.  Especially the bean dip that came with it.  We sat at the bar area during the "re-opening" week for dinner.  I ordered a couple drinks which were ok and had the combo with tacos, Chile relleno and a chicken enchilada.  The food was on par with what you would get at an Acapulco restaurant. Nothing to write home about. Service was good. Bartender seemed like he was learning the ropes still but always made sure our drinks were full.

I would go back just to chill at the bar and watch sports on the nice flat screens they have and have a couple beers and chips and salsa.
