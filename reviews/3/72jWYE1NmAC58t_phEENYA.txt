We tried Si Senor in our recent visit to Arizona, and overall, we liked it.  First, they brought out chips (1st basket is free) for appetizers with four things to dip them into, two chile sauces, beans, and a sour cream based one.  They were all yummy!  I ordered the Si Senor Combo plate which came with an enchilada, a chile relleno, a taco, and a tamale, all smothered under their green chile sauce.  I subbed the tamale for taco, and they were very accommodating.  The dish, overall, was good.  I would've liked the taco to be carne asada instead of ground beef, but it was still okay.  And for desert, our meal included sopapillas which was tasty.  Will probably try Si Senor again when we are back in AZ.

Overall, good food, okay service, okay prices.
