The food was good, but really not what I had been looking for.  I wanted a nice sit down place with a frozen marg. and that is not what this place is.  This place has good food, served in disposable aluminum take out containers.  Again, the food was good, but greasy.  My party sat themselves and you go up to the counter to order and pick up your food.  The woman at the counter was helpful.  As a pescatarian, I can't say there were many options that satisfied my criteria.  This was a good place, in my opinion to get take out mexican, but a bit too much like burger king or McDonalds for a dine in place.   Plastic silverware, served to you on a cafeteria tray, etc. Also, no booze.  Sad Panda.  That said, there was a massive rush of people coming in around 630pm on Sunday.  Maybe the meat versions of their dishes are really good, but I wouldn't know.  It got a bit loud from the noise of the dinner crowd.
