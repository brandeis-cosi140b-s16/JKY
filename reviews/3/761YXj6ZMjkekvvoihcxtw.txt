Plus: open 24 hours

Plus: they gave me these cheese covered tortilla chips which I downed like a fat kid needing a hit of cake.

Plus: their guacamole was pretty delicious.  It wasn't very thick or anything, but still was loaded with taste.

Minus: the burrito was just ok.  I've had better, I've had worse, it was just ok.  It felt really greasy.  I got the carne asade burrito and ate about 1/3rd of it and just wasn't feeling it anymore.  Like my body suddenly was like, Hey you, you're eating this burrito and you still don't think it tastes good anymore so why don't you stop?

Minus:  the tortilla chips they gave me without cheese were really stale and hard to swallow. 

So, three plus's and two minus's = 3 stars!  Yay math.
