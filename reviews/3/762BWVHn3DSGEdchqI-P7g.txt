While I am ecstatic that we have another restaurant out here in the sticks of San Tan Valley, I wasn't wowed with Moreno's first impression. 
I've heard that the owners of Morenos are somehow related to the owners of Gecko Grill (Mesa & QC), and share each others' menus. This was confirmed on Moreno's menu, listing "cravings" recipes from Gecko.
We placed a to-go order and was quoted a 15-20 min wait. I showed up about 30 minutes later, and to their credit, the place was hoppin', even for a Sunday night. I waited almost 20 minutes while the frantic cashier found everyone's orders and rang them up. One girl insisted on folding napkins around silverware right at the front counter, instead of in the back or at a table, and that made everything super crowded. 
Some of the people in my family loved their food, but mine for one was subpar. I ordered the chicken chimichanga, because I LOVE the spicy cream cheese sauce. The sauce I got was completely contrived, contained no cream cheese, and tasted like waxy sliced pepperjack. Bleck!
The tortillas were tough, but the rice was TO DIE FOR (Light, fluffy, perfectly seasoned). 
When I showed my wife the receipt, she calculated that we were overcharged by about $10, which the manager on duty said would be credited to our next order. 
While we will definitely go back (due in part to lack of options), it'll be hard to forget the first time...
