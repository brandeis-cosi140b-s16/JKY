I've gotta go with A-OK on this one. Not quite ready to commit to being "a fan," yet. 

To me, being "a fan" would mean I would be willing to drive from North Central Phoenix all the way downtown, devil-may-care style on a work day, to wait in line and put up with the slamming of the metal door every time a customer's lunch order was fulfilled. (That's not a complaint, mind you. It was cool. All part of the charm.)

You see, dinner is not an option. They're only open until 4. 

That said, I obeyed Robert M.'s instructions and ordered a green chile burrito, enchilada style with a side of beans. The beans were runny but good for dipping my bites of burrito. The sauce that made it  "enchilada style" had a good heat. 

I was pleased. It was "A-OK." I'd go back. Just probably not devil-may-care on a work day.
