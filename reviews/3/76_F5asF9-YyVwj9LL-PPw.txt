Out of all the Qdoba locations I've tried in Madison, this is the best one. Food is served fast, efficiently and correctly. They love recently changed their menu and guacamole is FREE! Can you believe that?! 

Location is good and the view is even better since it sits in a hill overlooking the busy street. Friendly staff here as well. Good Qdoba.
