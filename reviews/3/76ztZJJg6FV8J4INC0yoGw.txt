Chipotle is a fresh alternative to your typical fast food food. The quality of the food is better, as it is evident In the taste IMO . I ordered a chicken bowl with double chicken . The bowl is 6.50 extra chicken is 2.00 . Other meat choices are barbacoa which basically a shredded beef in some kind of sauce . Carnitas , and steak .

I had  chicken , brown rice, pinto beans, vegetables which are saut√©ed onions and green peppers, corn , cheese and lettuce in my bowl . Everything is prepared fresh and it's a great alternative to other fast food chains if your looking to trim some calories . 

I  recommend chipotle they have a great concept , and the employes always seem friendly .
