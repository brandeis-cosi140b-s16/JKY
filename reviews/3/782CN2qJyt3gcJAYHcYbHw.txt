I don't know what's wrong with me but I truly just have not found a Mexican restaurant in Charlotte that wows me. Maybe I'm not that big of a fan of it and just never realized that. I mean I thought I really liked it. Don Pedro's did nothing to make me stand up and say wow.

The biggest plus for them was they had decent prices and the ambiance inside reminded me of Cancun.  Our waiter definitely didn't want to be there much less waiting on us at lunch. He kind of had an attitude the whole time, but the manager who checked in on us was very  nice and he was working hard so kudos to him!!

On to the food... we started with some salsa and queso, and the queso was the runniest cheese I have ever eaten. I've made better queso at home and I'm still trying to perfect that recipe into something I love. Honestly every other place I've gotten queso it starts to thicken up over time as cheese does when it gets cooler. Not this stuff, this stuff just would run off your chip like it was water almost. Just wasn't good at all. The salsa was decent standard fare but it lacked any kind of heat.  I ordered the chicken carnitas and to be honest the chicken and the sauce/veggies it was with was pretty good. The best thing I had here honestly and so for that they get 3 stars.  The rice was dry and the beans tasted like they came from a can, but the flour tortillas were warm and not bad even though I highly doubted they were hand made or anything.  

Is this a place I will visit again?? Well it will never be my suggestion, nor will I remember this place to revisit however if my co-worker suggested it again then I wouldn't say no.  So it's just okay in my book.
