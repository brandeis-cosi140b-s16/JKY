I want to preface this review by saying that I have not tried any of the dishes on Z Tejas' menu. This location was the second stop on our Friday-night drink/appetizer tour of Mill Avenue restaurants, and we decided just to focus on their margaritas, ordering chips and salsa just to have something to munch on. We sat in the bar area at one of the high banquettes. It took a few minutes for a server to come by and greet us, but to be fair, it was busy, and once she did come by, she was really friendly and attentive. 

My sister and I ordered the famous Chambord Margaritas, and my husband got the house margarita. The margaritas came *really* quickly (a huge plus in my book), were well-priced (no more than $7 for any of them) and they were really good! The base margarita flavor was not overly sweet and you could definitely taste the tequila, and the Chambord in ours added a nice sweetness without being overpowering. My only gripe is that the Chambord ones didn't come with a salted rim; I like to at least be asked if I like salt on my margaritas. We also had to ask to have them on the rocks (I also like to be asked if I want my margaritas frozen or on the rocks). Those little complaints aside, we were really happy with the drinks. The chips and salsa were a little pricey ($4.49) and the salsa trio it came with wasn't particularly memorable, but they were a nice complement to the drinks. 

From my brief glance at the menu, the food looks pretty standard and Americanized, but given how good our drinks and the service were, I'd be willing to go back and give Z Tejas another try for a meal.
