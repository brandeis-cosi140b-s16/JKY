The food here is very good, hence the three stars. However that is only part of any dining experience. The service is pretty bad. My wife and I were the only ones in line and it took us 8 minutes to get through. The guy behind the counter kept talking to a guy who had already completed his order. BTW, we have had slow experience at multiple locations. You guys should take a trip over to Chiplote's and learn how to run an efficient line.
