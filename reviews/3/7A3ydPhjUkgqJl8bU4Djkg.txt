They start with complementary chips and salsa which include two excellent salsas and bean dip. I tried the "Mexican flag" for lunch, a combination of three enchiladas for just $7. Excellent value! This is a big restaurant, perfect for large groups.  Unfortunately it took my server about 15 minutes to greet me and get me a soda.
