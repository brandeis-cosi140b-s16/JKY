Eating at Border Grill while in Las Vegas seems to be a choice centered more around necessity than the desire to eat there. Oh, Stripsteak is full up for the night? You mean I can't get a table at Fleur de Lys? Well I don't want to eat at the buffet again...screw it, let's go to Border Grill. 

It is not that the food is bad, or the decor lacking, it's just well, ordinary. The prices are Vegas prices...no not $5.99 prime rib Vegas prices... more like $23 fish tacos Vegas prices. Not exactly the best value for a quick and casual sit down dining experience. 

We decided to come here because well, we had reservations at Aureole that we missed because I unfortunately had to keep working about 2 hours past the time I was set to take a dinner break. So what was a 2.5 hour dinner break turned into about 40 minutes to eat something fast. Since this location is close to the convention center at Mandalay Bay, and they have an area in the bar where you can eat quickly, we settled on this.

The food was good, but not great. Thankfully the server was attentive and when we told her we were in a bit of a hurry, she was certain to speed things up for us. Overall, our dining experience was not disappointing but it would certainly not be my first choice for a nice sit down dinner at the Mandalay Bay hotel.
