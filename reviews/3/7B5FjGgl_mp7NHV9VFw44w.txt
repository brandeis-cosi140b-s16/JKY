For what this place tries to do, it does it pretty well.  A laid back, beachy, surfer, baja style bar with broiled/grilled foods with cheap beer.

I find that on days when I am working on a big project around the house, getting all hot and dirty, I seem to gravitate here (maybe two or three times per year).   The food is average, but messy and filling so it makes up for the quality.     The beer is cheap and cold.  I saw that during happy hour they had $8 pitchers of domestic beers.

So when you are dirty and tired this place is fine for a quick meal and a few cold beers.
