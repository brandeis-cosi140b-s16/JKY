Decent food, big portions.  Their specialty seems to be chimichangas based on the large selection of them on the menu to choose from.  They also have a great enchilada style chicken burrito that is very large, with your choice of red or green sauce.  I had mine with red sauce, which had a nice slightly smokey, deep flavor.
