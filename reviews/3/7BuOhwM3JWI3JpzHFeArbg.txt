Place is nice and the staff was pretty friendly. Their food is just ok. There are several different Mexican food places around here which are a lot better. I was pressed for time and this place is right across from where I work. I got their carne asada tacos. Nothing special. I would come here again if I were pressed for time again, but other than that, I will go elsewhere.
