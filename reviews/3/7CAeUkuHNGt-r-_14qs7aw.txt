I've been to The Mission three times now. The first time was for lunch with my coworkers. Half the table got the Tecate Skirt Steak tacos for $10. I guess we didn't realize they were street tacos and so, so, so tiny my manager even took a picture to send to a friend as a joke. The taste was fine, but I wish the waitress had warned us the portion size was so small. 

I went back for brunch on a Sunday and had a much better experience. I had the Chorizo Scramble, which includes chipotle grits. I am in love with chipotle grits. They were incredibly creamy and flavorful. The portion size was very reasonable. There was a lot more food for $9 than the skirt steak tacos. I've been back for brunch and I really love it. 

They have a great front patio as well as a back patio. During the winter months it's great to sit outdoors. Next time I go I'll have to sit inside and see what the vibe is like in there. The abuelita hot chocolate with dulce de leche whipped cream is also a winner.
