As I've mentioned in other reviews, I try to avoid chains and most especially fast food in favor of locally owned, mom & pop types of establishments for a number of reasons: I like to support the local economy, the small business person, and I have noticed that you usually get more "heart and soul" put into your meal from the local proprietor. But Qdoba was the order of the day today and I must say that it wasn't half bad.

I got the burrito bowl which is essentially all the stuff you'd find in a burrito without the tortilla. You get your choice of white or brown rice, black or pinto beans, grilled chicken, ground beef, pulled pork, grilled steak, or shredded beef covered in a sauce, veggies, salsa and cheese. The layout is a bit cramped and the service is assembly line / cafeteria style as you individualize your meal and then pay at the end. The total bill is a little over $8.00; a little more if you get a drink.  I found the servers behind the line to employ brevity in a courteous way while trying to keep people moving through the line.  It's a pretty good system.

My burrito bowl tasted better than I expected. It was warm, flavorfully spicy and everything tasted fresh and good without that "fast food" quality. Qdoba is not a bad option if you're hankering for some Mexican zing but in a rush.
