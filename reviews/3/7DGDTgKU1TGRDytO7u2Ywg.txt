Service was great tonight.  First time eating in the bar area - as the main dinning room was full of young families.  It had been some time since my past visits which I usually got tacos or enchiladas.  The time between my visits was simply because for me the food was too bland.  I wanted to give it a try again with a recommendation from the server.  I got the green chili tamale... unfortunately very bland as well.  Not sure how it's possible to remove flavor from a tamale but they do it somehow.  I like the place ok, just not my type of mexican.
