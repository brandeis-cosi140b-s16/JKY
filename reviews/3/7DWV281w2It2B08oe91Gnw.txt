I found Steel Cactus on Southside to be average. I've never been to the one in Shadyside although I've always wanted to while waltzing down Walnut Street whenever i used to live in N. Oakland.

The good.. my Yinzerita honestly tasted fabulous! I'm not sure how much alcohol was in the original margarita because I wasn't really buzzed for having a beer mixed in a margarita but on a positive note, it tasted great. The rooftop bar is also really cool so check it out before the snow comes!! The service was also good. Bobby accidentally spilled my cup of water which went all over the table and floor. Our server as well as one of the food runners rushed over to help us.. well basically they cleaned and mopped all up while we sat there embarrassed.

The average... the food! I'm not saying the food is terrible by any means. I ordered the chicken enchiladas and Bob ordered the steak- I know, you're not supposed to order the same thing while going out but it stuck out to both of us. You get 3 (small) enchiladas as well as rice and black beans. My chicken enchiladas were average but Bobby's steak ones were really tasty. The thing is.. they servings just arent big. While heading home, we chatted that while it tasted ok, it felt as if it was an appetizer. Most places you are so full that you take some home but this isn't the case. We were finished and barely full... Idk I guess you have to go and see for yourself. Next time, we will order an appetizer before our meals. 

Since we live so close, we will most likely try it again and i'll update.
