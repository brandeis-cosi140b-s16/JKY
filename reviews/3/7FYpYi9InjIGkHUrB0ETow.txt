Wow - I am super sleepy! That is a frequent occurrence when I eat at a Filly B's. It must be the magical combination of tortilla, meat and grease or perhaps a secret ingredient that makes me feel this way - but within 20 minutes I am ready for a nap. It is a struggle when I go for lunch, but just write the day off if I get a breakfast burrito in the morning!

This location is new, replacing Moe's a few months ago. The store is clean and the staff friendly. The food arrives quickly. I think it is a good portion for the price. I get a number 2 (taco & burrito combo) and I have never been able to finish it. The chips and salsa are free (I go with the tomatillo) and drink refills are free.  The rating would be a little higher perhaps, if not for the 60 cent surcharge for using your debit card.

If you are having trouble sleeping, come get a burrito here - it isn't just me. I have taken live sample surveys of people I know and they all are sleepy after eating Filbertos. Sweet dreams!
