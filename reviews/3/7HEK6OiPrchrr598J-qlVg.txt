Good is same as you would expect...time it takes to GET in your hands is far longer than expected....10 min for a guy to make 2 tacos and a combo burrito. Clearly they need staffing assistance...I was the only customer inside and there were 5 cars waiting in drive thru. Again. Good food. Orders are correct 9/10 times.
