Freshly prepared food? Can't be!  I usually never complain that my food comes out too quick, but everything thing we ordered came out 5 minutes from when we ordered it.... Which means it was basically reheated. Mine definitely tasted that way.   

Let's start off with the chips and salsa... just okay, the seasoning on the chips was pretty tasty, the hot salsa had good flavor and the mild salsa was flavorless.  We started off with the guacamole, nothing special... probably "Wholly" doctored up with some onions.  

To drink, I had their "Perfect Rita" it was good, but $7 Happy hour price... nothing I couldn't have somewhere else for less than 5 bucks.  
For dinner, I ordered the cheese enchiladas.  I wanted the veggie enchiladas but when I asked what veggies where in it the server told me "probably the same as the fajitas, peppers and onions".  That didn't sound too exciting so I just went with cheese. The sauce was watered down and definitively from a can...Yuck!  I scrapped it off, mixed up the hot salsa and sour cream and made my own sauce, so it was at least edible.  I don't think it was heated up enough either, because my cheese was rubbery.   To top it off my Bf ordered a carne platter and the veggies were not peppers and onions, they were zucchini, squash and carrots... exactly what I would have wanted in my enchiladas!  

Overall, my BF won't let me give it two stars.  He enjoyed his food, mine was okay, we had good service and the atmosphere was inviting.  Although,  I highly doubt we'll be back.
