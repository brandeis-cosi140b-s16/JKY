I don't like going to chain "Mexican" restaurants like this.  I don't think they are all that good and all serve the same crap.  The only reason I was here was because I was going bowling across the street.  It was about 9pm on a Saturday night and the place was pretty dead.

I enjoyed the chips and the spicy bean dip stuff they give you to munch on.  The fajita platter I split with my wife was also pretty good.  The steak was excellent and the chicken and shrimp were good as well.  You can't really screw up fajitas (I hope), but it was all a pretty standard meal for this type of place (Garcia's, Macyo's, etc.).

The service was also very good.  Our waiter was fast and friendly and my diet coke was never empty.
