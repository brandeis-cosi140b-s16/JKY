If you want a healthier, fresh choice for Mexican cuisine, stop on by.  This place is a fast food restaurant that runs their counter like a Subway.  They have the meats and veggies, among other toppings right there for you to see while they build you your choice of meal.  From crunchy tacos to fajitas, they have a short menu with 3 choices of meats to try.  

I personally don't like their food much, but my husband raves about it.  Because I prefer shredded chicken over chunked chopped chicken in my tacos and I don't like their seasoning or salsa too much, I give it an A-OK rating.

Don't get me wrong--it's a nice place to get some quick, fresh mexican food, but it isn't my first choice.
