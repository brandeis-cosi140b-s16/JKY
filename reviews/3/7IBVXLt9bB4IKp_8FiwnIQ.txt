1st time to the Container Park, which is so cool, and my husband and I stopped into Pinches Tacos for some "Real Mexican food, made by real Mexicans" as they state on the outside of their shop.  Customer service was ok, the cashier seemed a bit rushed and frustrated.  For 2 beers, 2 chicken taquitos (plain) and 4 carne asada street tacos it was $40.  I literally had to stop at Robertos on my way home because I was starving.  The food itself was ok, nothing to write home about. Sure wasn't worth the price. I'll definitely return to the container park but I'll make sure to stop and eat somewhere else first!
