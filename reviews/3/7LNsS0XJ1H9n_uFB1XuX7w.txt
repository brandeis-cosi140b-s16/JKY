What you need to know: 

-This place has a very vibrant, modern, and colorful ambiance. The space is open, bright, and playful. There are interesting decorations and paintings that I enjoyed looking at. 
-The service is quick and kind.
-The food is "okay". We ordered the guacamole, tacos, nachos, and sponge cake dessert--none of these entrees would bring us back. We got a pitcher of original margaritas that were extremely watered down. Although the food and drink didn't taste amazing, I have to say that the presentation was very appealing and pretty. 
-We came because of a Groupon offer, which was a good deal. 

In the future, I would come back for a small bite and to enjoy the beautiful space.
