After some thought about trying a Different Mexican seafood place and being recommended by a friend to try El Dorado. I decided to stop by on a weekday. The place looks clean, the parking lot is very small and the service was okay. I was greeted with some type of fish tostada (courtesy). I ordered the shrimp tostada, in real life it looks a lot smaller that the picture in the menu. Then I tried the pulpos in salsa Nayarit, I wasn't impressed by its flavor and presentation.  I might give it another try in the future. Overall it didn't live to my first visit expectations...
