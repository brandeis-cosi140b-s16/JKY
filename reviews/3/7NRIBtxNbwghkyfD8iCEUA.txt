Love the bar but not the food!

We end up here fairly often and we're always in the bar.  They have good prices on drinks, the full menu of food and there are plenty of TVs with many different sporting events to choose from.  The bar staff is always good at changing the channels for us too.

I've eaten in the restaurant once and I found the meals to be lame.  Greasy, bland and sub-par for the Phoenix market.  I do order food in the bar sometimes but I have to be very selective, sticking to grilled items like the grilled fish tacos, which are OK.  I'll eat my share of chips & salsa in the bar too.  They're nothing special but not gross at all.

Last thing is about Karaoke... STOP IT!   It drives us out every time we're there and Karaoke starts.  Way too loud for people who shouldn't get handed a mic.
