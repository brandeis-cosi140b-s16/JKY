I'm closer to the one near the Steel Plaza, but I normally walk the extra block & head here. Even though the layout is literally smushed, i kinda feel as if there is a little more seating here and that the line goes faster. I also prefer this location's Queso compared to the other location. 

I'll show my cheap side & mention that I only stop in on Taco Tuesdays and $5 burrito Fridays. Honestly, I thought I was crazy until I read Lucretiz's review- I'm like 90% sure my taco & burritos get downsized because of my size. I watch them make these full, plump tacos & burritos then when it's my turn it's like next to nothing! So thanks Lucretiz's for letting me see that I'm not truly crazy! 

NOTE: they recently added those cool Coca-Cola machines.. so if Orange Coke is your cup of tea, stop in! Also, as of February they added 2 new quesos! Queso Diablo (jalapenos & chipotle) and Queso Verde (cilantro & lime juice) Both are made from their 3-cheese queso
