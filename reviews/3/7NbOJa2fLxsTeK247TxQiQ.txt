meh, you were so, mission...ary
common place, and just barely
better than, the rest of them
mediocre joints we've been 
to, in town, believed the hype
supposed to be, a special night
but alas, just missionary
mundane, married sex, like many
other spots, folks yelp about
jump up and down, scream and shout
'think i died, and went to heaven'
'scale, one to ten?, I'd give eleven'
'stars? they're aren't enough to give'
sorry folks, and please forgive
me, but we were not impressed
overly, as we ingest
ed, selections, good enough
adequate, up to snuff
status quo, should have been wary
of the love, like sex that married
people have, flat on their back
a kiss a peck, some this and that
then do the do, for five to ten
roll over and, remember when
the sex was hot, shit, off the charts
candles lit, there in the dark
couldn't get enough of it
and now they sit and dream and wish
it wasn't just the missionary
through the motions, not contrary
to the norm, no shades of gray
spank and pinch, whips and chains
candle wax, clamps and toys
blindfold, handcuffs, add a boy
or a girl, mix it up
s&m, a little rough
er, like it used to be
that would be five stars to me
but instead, we say ho-hum
apps? ok, steak? overdone
carter, chefin', sweet decor
service good, tequila poured
into our margs, yep we enjoyed
but the food, is where the void
was felt, meh...not that great
didn't love the hanger steak
mahi taco's? we've had betta
guacamole, pork prochetta 
both alright, food, just  sufficed
but we expected more that night
a little more bang for the buck
instead of just your average f**k
value? a bit pricey, yes
but happy to pay, for the best
just can't say that it was great
will say we enjoyed our wait
er, smart n funny, did his best
took some money, off our check
props for this, but can't say that
we will ever, venture back
just can't do it, missionary
...maybe someday, when we're married.
