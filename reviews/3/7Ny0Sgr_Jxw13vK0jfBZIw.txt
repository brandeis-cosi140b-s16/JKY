In a pinch, we swung into El Pollo Loco for a quick bite last night. The restaurant was very clean and the menu was easy to navigate. I settled on the Citrus Mango Tostada salad. 

The plate consisted of a fried taco shell salad bowl ( which was absolutely delicious), lettuce, tomoato, sour cream, rice, beans, mango salsa, a citrus vinegarette and 1/4 avocado. My meal was fresh and delicous - I really couldn't stop eating it. It was light and didn't leave me feeling like I just consumed heavy Mexican food. 

I was pleasantly surprised, and we'll be back :)
