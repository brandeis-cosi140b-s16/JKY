Everything had a middle of the road franchise restaurant feel to it; not great but passable.

I would not rock this pink taco... well not again.

I think that 3 stars is generous. The tacos were ok nothing great. I am from california and we have some killer mexican food. The theme "pink taco" was entertaining but that was really not that entertaining. The wait staff was rude and not very attentive.
