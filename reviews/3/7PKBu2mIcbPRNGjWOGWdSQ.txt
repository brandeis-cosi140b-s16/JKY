Food is still decent, but it's still TOO NOISY.  There were only 8 people in the place last time I went, but it would have been quieter sitting at the tables outside right there on Maryland Parkway.  It only took 5 of the customers to make all that noise, and they weren't being loud and boisterous--just talking at normal conversational level.  Something about the way this place was built just amplifies the sound to deafening.
