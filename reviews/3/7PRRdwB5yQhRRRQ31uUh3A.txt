We went with a large group of people.  I called ahead and they had a table set up for us - service is very, very good.  We were promptly served our drinks, along with chips and salsa.  I liked the chips and salsa a lot.  I ordered a chile relleno and enchilada plate.  It was enough to feed at least two people.  The chile relleno was kind of weird ... like chile strips and cheese mixed together and fried up in a batter - it was OK but way too much cheese for me.  Same with the enchiladas - great sauce and tortillas, but very heavy on the cheese.  Next time I will order the enchiladas and ask for onion and light on the cheese.
