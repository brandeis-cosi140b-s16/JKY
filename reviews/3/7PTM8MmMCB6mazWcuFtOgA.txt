I agree with the 'Village Inn" of Mexican food statement. I've been to the Northern location three times since being in Phoenix. Nico practically grew up here: him and his family have been coming for years and he even worked here in high school. I get the whole nostalgic thing. 

I've had the taco salad (unseasoned ground beef, yuck), chicken and cheese enchilada (decent, but nothing too fabulous) and the cheese crisp (very good, but could use some mexi seasoning). Chips and salsa are so-so, but again nothing to rave about. Margaritas are also just okay. 

What makes the place charming is the service. Nico knows them all and we get top notch service every time. The decor doesn't scream Mexico and I like that. 

I know we will continue to visit Los Compadres, especially when Nico's mom is in town, I will just keep trying new dishes until I find my favorite.

I will also try the 7th Ave location as it seems to get better reviews.
