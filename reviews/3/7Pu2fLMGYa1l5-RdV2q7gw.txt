I classify this type of Mexican spots by my level of soberness or drunkness however you rather call it my party people. Laurita is on the "damn im drunk and need food asap" category.. Not as low as robertos " FOOD NOW cause regardless im gonna vomit it" category but down there. And its not a bad thing trust me ..its just not the food for me.

Their portions are big and generous but not high on quality. But we both know that this place is not aiming for 5 stars..The "damn im drunk and need to eat asap" crowd usually shows up late and they love it. But for me, that rather enjoy a little more quality ..its just ok

The flavor is decent. Its not bad at all , but sometimes its greasy and just kinda have that industrially line cooked kinda flavor but for the price you cant complain. It is a good choice when either your liver is crying for food or when your pocket is thin.

The location is very centric and clean. Food comes fast and their menu is extensive giving you almost innumerable amounts of combos!. To top this their prices are great . Inexpensive and a lot of food is what some people look for and at Lauritas you can find it.
