In an effort to try new places near the office, we gave this place a shot.  The inside is much like a Chipotle in ordering style, menu etc.  The concept is interesting (burgers, hot dogs, burritos), but I was in the mood for a burger.  I had the Bueno style with pepper jack cheese.  It had fresh guacamole on top, and the pepper jacks cheese gave it just enough spice.  The fries and drink were not included in the $6 it cost for the burger, a little pricey.  The service was alright, thought instead of bringing out our meals by number they just walked over and asked what we ordered.  I think this ended up in a couple mix ups with another table's order, but we got it worked out. 

All in all an ok place, maybe I'll give it a try again for a hot dog or burrito...

PS: Yes, you will smell like a campfire the rest of the day after eating here.
