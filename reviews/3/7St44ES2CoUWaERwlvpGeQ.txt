The only reason why I give this place 3 stars is b/c of the horrible customer service once I walked in. The hostess looked so miserable like she didn't want to be there.  I walked in and said, "Hi, how are you?" I asked her if they sold chicken tacos and she just shook her head yeah. She takes me all the way around the world for a table (that was dirty for one) and sat the menu down, walked off and didn't say enjoy your meal or anything. I started to leave, but the waiter was so nice and apologized for the greeting from hostess. Went back down to the bar area and the same waiter took care of my order and my drink. Apparently she needs to go to customer service school of some sort with the rudeness. At the end of the night, I did end up enjoying myself, especially with the $2 Taco Tuesdays and .99 margaritas.
