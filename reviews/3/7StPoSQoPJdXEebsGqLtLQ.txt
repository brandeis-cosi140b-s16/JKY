First off, I'm picky when it comes to Mexican, since I'm a vegetarian and only order bean and cheese burritos.  I've been here several times with various friends, and all have agreed it's good.  Not great, but good.  

Me, I love that they serve black beans in their burritos rather than the fatty (and sometimes meaty) refried beans, so that's a big plus for me.  And the atmosphere on the patio is beautiful and original.  Margarita's were so-so too....I guess I prefer Z'Teja's, but I like 'em strong!  

There can be a pretty long wait on the weekend, so get there early or be ready to grab a drink at the bar.
