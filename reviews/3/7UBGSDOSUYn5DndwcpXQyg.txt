First time I got tacos from here and they were absolutely amazing I had gotten them on a Tuesday and I was craving more the entire week!! So I finally got a chance to go back and I got the chicken tacos to go and was so excited when I got home to dig in well the chicken on my tacos were raw and to me were very plane i was extremely disappointed so I took them back and they apologized and replace them which was great and the right thing to do and they were great! I went back a few weeks later and got chicken and steak tacos once again I found myself excited to dig in and experience the food as I had my first time but I did not once again the chicken was raw in the middle and to me the steak had this teriyaki flavor. So I have not been back since then.
