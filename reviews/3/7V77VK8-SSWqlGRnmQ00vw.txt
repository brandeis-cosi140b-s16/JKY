I thought it was just ok. I expected it to be more like Gordos and I liked the 3 taco combo idea. The meat was a bit dry and tough to eat though so it was a bit of a disappointment. I ordered the carne, pastor and pollo in my combo with rice only. I did like the chicken which was moist but other than that it was just ok. We had ordered to go on a Saturday for lunch and there was no one there. I'm not sure that's a good sign. In fact they brought my food out 5 minutes later and so I left. Only to realize that I only had the burrito that my husband ordered and not my tacos...why they didn't tell me who knows?! So I had to drive back to get my tacos which were on the way to being soggy. 

My husband wasn't impressed with his burrito that was 10 bucks either. He complained there wasn't enough meat for the cost. Overall I thought it was decent but it's definitely not my favorite place to get some tacos!
