Despite the promises of tasty Mexican food, this place seemed sooooo mediocre to me! The people are friendly, and the food is cheap, but I'd be willing to pay a bit more for one thing that really lacked in my experience - FLAVOR!

I had the #8 - Taco, chili relleno, rice and beans. It all came out quickly since I had the entire place to myself. However, nothing had a lot of flavor. Every piece of my meal seemed fairly bland. Towards the end it picked up a bit, warranting a bump up to 3 stars, but I just can't go above that.
