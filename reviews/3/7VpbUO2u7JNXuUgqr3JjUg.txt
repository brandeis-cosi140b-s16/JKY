First time stop for us.  

yes, it is a step above a taco bell or other fast food Mexican food joint. 

No, it is not fine dining.  

The food was OK, the table delivery of the items is nice.  we assumed this means the food was made fresh for us and there might have been some attention to quality product.

The food was tasting, the missus had the shrimp tacos and I ahd a combination plate of shrimp burrito and fish tacos.  I am not a huge fan of rice and beans in my burrito and so was a bit disappointed by the quantity of the rice and beans in burrito, but that was my fault.

The amount of chips served with the combo platter was a bit slim, but they offered a side dish of chips on the menu.

The salsa bar was a nice, if not small, touch.

We may go again if the urge for fish tacos strikes us.
