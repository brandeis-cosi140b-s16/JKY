Food-court Mexican stall with a massive menu, including tacos, burritos, tortas, mulitas, sopes, nachos, and more, with a variety of meats. The only thing missing is carne guisada! Also note that they don't have elote here.

Staff is polite and efficient, wait time is never too long, owner is friendly and is also affiliated with 702 Wing Spot in the same building. You are able to order online or call in your order. The ambiance of the dining court is a little lacking, so takeout is the way to go IMO. Don't know about delivery options.

Machacada burrito is mostly meat (not necessarily a bad thing), instead of eggs (which is what I'm usually craving, actually).  California burrito doesn't have a ridiculous up charge as at other places. All burritos packed to bursting and weighing in at practically a pound, served with both red and green salsa.

I'm unclear on the difference between sopes and gorditas, but the fact that they're even offered here is awesome- get the lengua one, or spring for shrimp for a couple bucks more.
