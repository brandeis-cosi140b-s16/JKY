SUPER cheap drinks (well, compared to what I am used to in Chicago anyways) & they make 'em strong! 

Thankfully, the patio in the back was open. It was super cute, quiet-ish, & overall really chill. I cannot imagine going here during winter though because they have virtually no indoor space, so it must get uncomfortably packed. Also inside the music is disproportionately loud in relation to the size of the space.
