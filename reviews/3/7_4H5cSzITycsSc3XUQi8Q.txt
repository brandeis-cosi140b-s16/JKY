I was in need of a quick lunch so I was like what the hell.

They had a special for Tacos de Lengua.  I personally have never had Lengua, but I figured other people eat it must be okay.  I just had to get over the fact that it is tongue.

Anyways - the tongue tacos were muy bueno.  I am now a fan of tacos de lengua.  

This place is pretty much a Roberto's - maybe a little cheaper.  Over all - the place was not the cleanest place.  It was a little suspect even.

It's fast and it's cheap.  the food was decent.  I would say - stop by in a pinch, but I wouldn't go out of the way to eat here.
