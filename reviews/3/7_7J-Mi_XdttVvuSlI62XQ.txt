It's chipotle... The only thing to say. Today if the cashier would stay put, it would move a lot faster. Apparently the manager had her covering several things. Requested the veggie bowl, got bowl with no meat. And extra rice I didn't ask for.... Regardless, it was still good. Would've preferred more lettuce.

7/1/15 Went at 11am, waited for 10mins and they had no lettuce for the salad!!! She apologized and offered to put shredded, so I didn't miss out. The tofu, saritas?? Don't remember, but were okay. Not much spices added. Looked like chili scrambled eggs with no taste. LoL
