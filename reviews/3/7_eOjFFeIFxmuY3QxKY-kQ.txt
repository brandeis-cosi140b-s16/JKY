Every time I visit Vegas, my first stop after my friend picks me up from the airport is Tacos El Gordo, my gold standard for authentic Mexican excellence. The next day I was still looking for a fix of tongue, and decided to give Asada's a shot. While it wasn't bad, it simply didn't hold a candle to Tacos El Gordo. 

I stopped in mid-afternoon to a mostly empty restaurant. I decided to go for a burrito with lengua. The burrito was a bit sloppy - it was rolled a bit loose and the lengua was on the bland side. The hot sauce on the table was really good and helped add some much needed flavor to the burrito.

The location itself is a classic "hole in the wall" joint - but those places usually make the best Mexican food. If I were on Fremont St. and had a huge craving for Mexican, I'd give them another try, but there's MUCH better Mexican food to be had in Las Vegas.
