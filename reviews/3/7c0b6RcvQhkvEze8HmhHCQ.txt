I always opt for the Taco Bell breakfast menu items if I'm feelin' fast food in the morning. As I'm checking in at this location I speak with a gentleman that has a standing bicycle outside. I asked him if it's on a bike rack, indeed it's not. So I tick the Yelp question "no bicycle rack" and he continues to explain that he's had several expensive bicycles stolen in as many months?! Unbelievably, a kid enters the west entrance only to make his way exiting the north entrance and stops at the mans bicycle?! After closer inspection he decided the bike isn't worth the grand heist and moves on. On this visit, which was done in they forgot an item on my order. Also, if your an adult an you order the orange juice, expect to be disappointed as to the size :-/
