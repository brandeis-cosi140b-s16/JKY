The first thing I should talk about is the service. The waitress was nice, but the service was a little slow, especially considering that the restaurant was, maybe, a little over half full when I came in. The chips were fine, not great, but ok, and the regular salsa was average. I asked for a spicier salsa, and that was much better. For dinner, I chose two items from the mix and match section: a chicken enchilada and a green chile corn tamale, with a side of rice and beans. The chicken enchilada and rice were really enjoyable, more flavorful than most Mexican food restaurants I've been to. The tamale was not dry, but was a little bit sweeter than I thought it would be, but that is to be expected, because of the corn. The beans, however, seemed to have been sitting out for a while and heated up in a microwave, because the edges were dry. The flavor was fine, but I wish it had been a little more fresh. Overall, the flavor was between a three and a four, but the slow service knocked it down to a three.
