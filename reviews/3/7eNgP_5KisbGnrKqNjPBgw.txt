I'm not quite sure what to make of Anita's. 

My co-workers and I stopped in for lunch not really sure what to expect. It's a good thing we got there early and scored one of the tables because this place is tiny! It's definitely to cater to the "take out" crowd. 

The menu isn't extensive but they offer all the classics, tacos, enchiladas, burritos, and chip and salsa with each entr√©e. I ordered the Speedy Gonzales. It's a taco with your choice of chicken or beef, a cheese enchilada and your choice of rice or beans.
 
The food was okay. It wasn't outstanding but I didn't expect for it to be the best ever but it was fast, quick and hot....that sounds unintentionally dirty. Ha.

 If you're in rush and want something cheap I'd recommend this place but make sure to check their hours! I think they are only open for the lunch bunch!
