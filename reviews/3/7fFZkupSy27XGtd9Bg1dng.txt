Keep in mind their sign actually reads Taqueria Express.

This is a tiny little taco stand carved out of Fruteria El Pueblo just west of Woodlands on Albemarle. Orders are placed at a window overlooking a stuffed, hot kitchen. Food is quick and simple. Menu's surprisingly large - lots of tacos, quesadillas, burritos - didn't seen any Salva-or-Ecuadorian influences on there. Language could be an issue if you no tengo un pequeno espanol.

I have a thing for tortas, so that's what I got - and it was good. A little pricey (6.50 for huevos y queso) but easily one of the better ones I've had in CLT. Soft, sweet teleras, Monterey-Jacky cheese, shredded lettuce, some jalapenos. A mess to eat, but whatevs.

This isn't the "IT" torta, but it's totally worth a stop.
