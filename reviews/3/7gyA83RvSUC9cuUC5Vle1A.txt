Nice place to eat at the mall that doesnt feel like a "mall restaurant". Interesting selection of cheap tacos (BBQ pork, shrimp, steak, fish, vegan choices like portabello). Street tacos are only $2.50, but they're small -- you'll down them in a couple bites. Comfy seats to watch a game or hang out - nice vibe and decent service.
