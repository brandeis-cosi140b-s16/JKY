Tonight was my first time eating at this location of Serrano's, even though I have been to another location once. This place is pretty average mexican food, nothing mind blowing. What I like about it is that they give you free bean dip and they use fairly high quality ingredients. I got a shredded chicken burrito fundido.... now, usually shredded chicken is not too good at these kinds of place, but this one was very good. They seasoned it and everything... not just bland shredded chicken. So that was pleasant. The BF and I also shared a very good margarita cupcake :-) My only complaint is that this place is a little expensive for what you get. So I would come back when I'm in the mood for solid mexican food.
