When I first tried this place I probably would have given it a five star review. But I have been there several times since and now I'm a little less woohoo about this place. I love their quesadillas, they are huge and really fried :) I always have issues with the meat there. It's really grizzly.

 The last time I was there I took my grandparents and parents there. I got the hashbrown burrito, which is typically delicious. This time, I'm not sure what meat substance was in my burrito but it way way too chewy to be bacon. The staff was also cranky to my grandparents because they were confused at ordering. BUT the green salsa is super yummy!
