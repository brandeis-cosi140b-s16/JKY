A couple of years back my family used to go to this place all the time for a quick bite. It was delicioso - back then.
Now I feel as though they KNOW they are making a crapload of money (from word-of-mouth) and the quality and tastiness of their food is lacking severely. Don't get me wrong, it's still good... just not as good as it used to be (or as it could be!). 
It's a really fun place to go drink some beers, have some carne asada and listen to Juan Luis Garcia :)
