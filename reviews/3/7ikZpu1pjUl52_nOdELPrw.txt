I've been here before but I'm inclined to write this review as I'm eating. 

So I usually just get a steak keiki bowl but I totally spaced out and got half chicken half steak... The chicken tastes like chicken dipped in salt. It's so salty that I just stopped eating it altogether. The steak was better but I think the chicken just ruined it for me. The corn was also kinda burnt. 

I came in and the girl working didn't even notice that I was there. I had to get her attention multiple times. When I finally got her attention, she looked annoyed that I was there. 

I gave it 3 stars because the other times I've been, I don't remember it being this bad. Hopefully it was just this one time.
