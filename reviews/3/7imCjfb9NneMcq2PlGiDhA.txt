Great food and drinks, but the bathrooms were disgusting dirty.  Service is very very slow. Changed servers twice during our visit. Neither better than the last. We order a queso dip that never showed. One of our groups mimosa set at the bar while we watched for 15 mins. Love all the tv's. Serves has just gone downhill in the few years we've been coming.
