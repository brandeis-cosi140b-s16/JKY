A Hispanic coworker recommendation to our informal lunch group, saying the chicken soup competes with her mother's and their specialty, the Guadalajara sandwich, is as good as it gets.  My peers gave rave reviews, so promptly myself and another who missed out on the event did a followup here.

Situated inside a mini Hispanic indoor mall, you had your choice to also purchase a pinata, vitamins or random swap meet type clothing.  But we stayed true to course and went direct for tortas along w/ locals slowly filling up the seating area.  Between the Cubana torta and the Guadalajara (pork in bread roll doused in spicy sauce), I'd go w/ the dry tortas as the latter was a bit of a soggy mess.  For the latter, the pork was very tender but obviously was cooked separate from the sauce (which is evident if you order it w/ the non spicy red sauce w/ the spicy given to you on the side).  The tortas are generous, wrapped in paper and already sliced into two portions!  Next time I'd order one of the soups and a torta for sharing.  Eyeballing the locals, honestly they were ordering a variety of other items outside of the speciality.

The cashier lady was very friendly and made a point to stop by and check on us gringos.  A+ service, and they take credit cards.  BTW, around 11:40am, a ton of high school kids start rolling in... so eat before then!
