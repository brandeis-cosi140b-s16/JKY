I am encouraged seeing the owner is reading and responding to user comments.

My experience the second week of its reopening was disappointing and I had made my mind up not to back.  But I came across these recent posts where the owner is engaged and for that will give the restaurant another go.

Not to mess up the ratings but be truthful, I would have rated a 2 before but will rate 3 now until I go back and try again.....

I want this place to be successful, especially since I live nearby....
