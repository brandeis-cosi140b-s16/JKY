We go here all the time, love the food. Last night, we waited over 30 minutes for a table. There were over 10 empty tables but supposedly you did not have enough servers. Really, you have good business, buck up and hire more staff. The table we ended up sitting at had been empty and cleaned for 25 minutes.
