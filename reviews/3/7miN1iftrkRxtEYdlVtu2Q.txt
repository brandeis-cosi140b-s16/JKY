Food was good, service was terrible. We ate at 5pm because we had show tickets, the place was empty save for maybe 2 other tables of small parties. I requested a booth and they sat us in the bar which was very noisy, when there were plenty of booths empty in the restaurant (and sat empty the entire time we dined). 

Our server was very absent minded, she didn't really seem to be actually paying attention when we ordered, looking around the restaurant. Out of 2 entrees and 2 drinks the only thing that came correctly was one drink. Wrong dressing on the salad, wrong sides with the other entree, and my margarita had salt even though she asked twice and I said no salt. Server never came back around until we were done, and waiting, and getting irritated. Waited forever for the check, then she didn't include a room charge slip so we had to wait some more. Barely made our show when we should have had plenty of time. 

The food was fine, nothing spectacular. The prices were not bad for Vegas, drinks were on the pricy side though. Probably won't be back next time, we'll explore other options for Mexican food.
