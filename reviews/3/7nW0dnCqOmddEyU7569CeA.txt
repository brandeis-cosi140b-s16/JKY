I felt the food was good but I didn't like the service and the constant sweeping near our table. The service wasn't good at all. Waitress was rushed and I felt like I was bothering her for asking for napkins which we didn't have. 

I will continue to order" to go" so I can relax in my home without the hustle and bustle atmosphere and lack luster service.
