I had not expected anything fabulous.  It is what it is.  Cheap, not steller, food.  But quick and kinda cool that you can choose whatever you like and then YOU don't have to go back for more, your wait person will do it for you.  You just ttell them what you want and they will get it.  So if all you like here are tacos....just gorge yourself on tacos!  It's really not a bad  deal and if you have a family with teenagers who want to eat everything in site...well, here is the place for you!  The place was clean although I did not use the restroom so I can't comment on that.  

I spoke with the manager as we were leaving and he was very personable and seemed open to constructive critisism.  Apparently he just took over.  So, if you go knowing this is not going to be the best mexican food in town, then it's fine.  Not a bad value.  

Thanks Panchos.
