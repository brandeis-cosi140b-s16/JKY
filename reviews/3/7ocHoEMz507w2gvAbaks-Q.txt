With a 5 star review on yelp, I thought it must be real good seafood... Eh.

I was looking for something comparable to las Islitas with out the high price tag and, playa popped up. Small yet clean little place. Very attentive server and prompt. I got the shrimp a la diabla, shrimp mojo de ajo, ostiones preparados, langostina, and shrimp al vapor..(I came with a party of 4).

Shrimp a la diabla (spicy shrimp)- spicy but bleh flavor, garlicky rice was ok, lettuce on the side was just a waste of lettuce, but I really enjoyed the beans bc it had pieces of chicharron.. Atleast I hope that's what it was.
Mojo de ajo shrimp (garlic butter shrimp) tasted more of onions than garlic. Definitely not memorable. 
Shrimp al vapor (steamed shrimp) was nicely seasoned but was almost too sweet for my taste, due to all the bell peppers. 
Langostinas (langoustines)- nice spicy sauce, but only came with 3 langoustines. There was hardly any meat in them which made that dish disappointing. 
Ostiones preparados (prepared oysters with a shrimp salad on top)-were ok, but you can tell the oysters weren't fresh. I'm used to the ones sold at "las Islitas" so I might've had my hopes too high. The shrimp salad needed more lemon and some salt and maybe a nice sauce to top it off. 

All in all, the place was nice and clean and service was friendly and prompt. Food was ok, but not worth the 5 yelp stars in my opinion. The prices are fair, but I think this would be my first and last visit since it didn't wow me. I think I'll stick with las Islitas whenever I'm in the mood for oysters and shrimp.
