Absolutely love the very laid back chilled environment that Urban Taco has. Great ambiance in the place. Was greeted at the door right away and told we can sit anywhere. I had the chopped chicken salad with cilantro dressing. Also had the Queso Fundido to start with. Both items were tasty and fresh. I thought the customer service was decent. Cup was empty for a while before anyone noticed and server didn't check on us as much as I would have liked. Other than that this place is a must try.
