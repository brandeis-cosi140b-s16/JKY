This is a great little place for simple burritos and tacos.  Not very expensive, and great taste for a bargain.

I ordered the carne asada burrito, wet, smothered in sauce, with rice and beans.  Very big, and really good, but a little too much sauce.  

I've tried their nachos too, and that's a bargain for about $6, loaded all the way, plenty of chips, cheese, cream and even guacamole, it must be a couple pounds when they finish putting everything on it.  

Must try, great, inexpensive decent food.
