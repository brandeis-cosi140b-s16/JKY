We have been eating here for the last year and it has become our fast food Mexican restaurant of choice and there are plenty of others such places to pick from. They are fast, with good prices and a friendly staff.  

I just had a shredded beef taco and it tasted great with very little grease, my wife claims they have the best torta around and their carne asada burritos are real ok.

For quick Mexican food it's a ok place to eat at.
