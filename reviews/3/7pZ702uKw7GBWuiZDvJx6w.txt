Not too bad. I was gifted a night out from a friend who raved about the food here. We brought extra money since we planned on having a few drinks (we can walk there), but didn't need it. $40 fed us both, with appetizers, dinner, drinks, and dessert. The only complaint I have is that I was really looking forward to a "Pickled Cucumber Salad," since pickles are just pickled cucumbers, I was excited to see what this creation was. It's just cucumbers with some vinegar drizzled across the top- not very creative. Also, after we cashed out, our waitress never came back. I think they have a weird wait staff situation going on, because they all seem pretty flighty, running around all nilly-willy and bothering other tables. Maybe it was just busy, but I prefer to have less people interrupting my first night out since having a baby... just sayin'. I expected the pretentious hipster vibe, but I think they did a nice job with this place, it's more eclectic than that. There's a very peaceful feeling under the trees and in the open air that get's lost when the chatter of nearby tables becomes yelling to hear over the music. So, if you're like me, go on an off night and sit on the patio, look into the trees, and have a relaxing frothy beverage. It's an A-OK place to be, and sometimes that's exactly what you need.
