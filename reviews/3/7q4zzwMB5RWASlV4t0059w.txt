This my first review, but have eaten here before. Stay away from the nachos, all they do is melt cheddar cheese over chips so, when the chips and cheese get hard they get stuck together and cheese is soon oily. The Chicken Chimichanga is very good. yummy with sour cream of course. 
Going to try there tacos today, not your typical taco bell. Made with real tortilla.
