To sum it up, just another generic xxxxBertos you insert the prefix.

The menu is what you would expect from a this type of place, burritos, combo plates, enchiladas, tacos. Prices are on par too, but they lack the free chips some places do have.

The one slightly unique thing here is the vintage arrcade games they had in back. Including Mortal Kombat 2 and the simpsons.
