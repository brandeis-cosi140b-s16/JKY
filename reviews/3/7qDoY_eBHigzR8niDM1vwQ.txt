A good, solid Mexican restaurant.  I ordered the halibut fillet dinner on a Sunday night.  The chips were a wee-bit stale and the salsa and bean dip was ok.  The only Mexican beer on tap (Dos Equis amber) was gone already :(  and it took a while for the waitress to get me a bottle of it.  I had asked for water with lime...but the lime came with the beer instead.  It took a while for dinner to be served too.  The place was not overly busy.  The Mexican vegetable mix was chopped mash overcooked.  Not an impressive meal.  The manager was good, stopping by each table to see if everything was ok.  I might return...maybe.
