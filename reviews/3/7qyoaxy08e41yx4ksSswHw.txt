Great little Mexican food fix.  I liked the spicy salsa that was brought out before the dish was served.  Nothing amazing, but for the typical southwestern US Mexican food menu, the quality was good.

Would definitely get more stars if the chips were oven baked and the quacamole was more chunky style, instead of thin and creamy.  Some people like that I guess.

They advertise pozole and menudo every Sabado y Domingo!  I may have to venture back for a little pozole and hopefully update my review!
