Great breakfast burrito!  I've never been to Gil's, but the restaurant had a booth at Old Town Farmer's Market in Scottsdale today.  I had a bacon and egg breakfast burrito.  Good tortilla stuffed with bacon and eggs, of course, as well as potato, cheese, and green chiles.  The burritos were made ahead, but wrapped in foil and kept warm.  Tasted like it had just been made.

I would definitely try the restaurant if I happened to be in that part of town.
