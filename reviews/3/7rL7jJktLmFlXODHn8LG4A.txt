I really love the view at this place. A very nice, upscale restaurant. I've been here twice. The first time I really liked it, but the second time I went on a Friday night and it was pretty loud. A really nice Mariachi band played during our whole dinner and it was quite loud. I was taking my teenage niece out to eat so that we could connect and catch up. It's already hard enough to compete with her phone and her being a teenager. I had a hard time hearing her or talking over the music. Not sure if this is a just a weekend thing or what. The music is good, but it's just a little loud for my preference. My niece thought the fajita burito was really good. I ordered the carna asada tacos (subbing one with beef shoulder) and it was ok. I've had better. Dinner for two was about $35. I will probably try this place again, but I'd avoid weekends.
