Fast food Mexican chicken dishes.  The only thing that I do not like it the burritos that have beans and rice with very little meat in them. 
If I wanted a bean burrito, a rice burrito, or a bean a rice burrito I would ask for one.  When I order a carne asda or chicken burrito that is what I expect to bite into.
