I really really wanted to love this place, instead I just have a moderate crush on it.  Great patio since it's away from the traffic of Indian School.  But that's the only thing great I found.

We had dinner on Saturday night, yet there was no hostess in sight to seat us.  The time it took for someone to come bordered on unacceptable.  It was odd since there were very few other diners there at the time.  The gal that seated us was our server.  While she was polite and friendly, I would say we had only average service.  It wasn't terrible, but could have been so much better.  There was another party on the patio, and they seemed to get great service from a different server.

We started with the warm brie on artisan bread with a balsamic reduction.  It took what seemed like an eternity to arrive, and yet, it wasn't warm-more like room temperature.  It was enjoyable, but nothing special.  I've made a better brie appetizer at home and a chef, I am not.

For my entree, I had the chicken oaxaca.  The chicken was stuffed with oaxaca cheese and roasted poblanos.  The filling had a little bite to it with the chiles and was actually very good.  The chicken breast was fried which added a nice crispiness to the dish.  It was served over a corn chowder.  The chowder was very bland in my opinion.  It had the right ingredients to be delicious, but it fell short.

I also tried a margarita made with a pomegranate liquor.  It was enjoyable and packed a punch.  I also tasted my hubby's southwest margarita which had virtually no flavor.  He switched to beer after that.

So while I wasn't overly impressed, I did think it was worth another try sometime.  They have a great appetizer menu and I would definitely come back to give it a try for happy hour on the patio or lunch.
