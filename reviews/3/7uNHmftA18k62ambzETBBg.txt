Filly-B's. 

I'm not entirely sure where to start. Filly-B's is open 24 hours a day so that should really tell you where the majority of their profit margin comes from.

I'm not saying it's bad by any stretch of the imagination. Speaking as a guy who can and has frequently crossed the border for lunch and lunch alone, Filly-B's is possibly the most authentic Mexican you can get this far from the border without risking some form of stomach problems that somehow seems to be characteristic of authentic food of any kind. 

Filly-B's bathrooms are of questionable cleanliness and the decor is reminiscent of a time when yellow and brown were the shizzle-nit (yes, I did just say that) but that doesn't change the fact that it is dang good food for when you've been out at a... juice bar.......... 

I would steer clear of their Carne Asada Fries as the number of calories in that dish alone is sure to make an obese person weep, but I urge you to be fearless. Try anything and everything. And for God's sake, if you don't already know, don't ask what menudo is made of.
