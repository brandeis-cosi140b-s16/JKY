This La salsa is located inside of the Planet Hollywood

I've only been here once @ lunch time, i got the Grande Burrito w/ carnitas, with rice and black beans. it tasted fine, tho i was just going for a quick lunch and i wasn't expecting fireworks. 

My boyfriend got a combination plate of some sort, he however was less impressed. 

They charge separately for chips and salsa ($2.50) (not uncommon of the strip) and the Salas's weak and bland in flavor.

I'd like to try one of their margaritas by the yard. org fruit 18.95/ top shelf 24.95 and 1.95 for an extra shot.
