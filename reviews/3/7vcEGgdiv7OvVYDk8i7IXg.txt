So I am eating my words from my review in 2010.  The dust bunnies on the ceiling are still there - I looked (minus a star).  We ordered the cheese crisp to start and it was really good.  The tortilla crust wasn't soggy at all and it did not swim in oil.  Both salsas went well with it.  I ordered the fish tacos.  The fish was not rubbery and had plenty of fresh flavor.  The plate also came with a lemon wedge and a lime wedge.  Perfect meal.  Also liked the Spanish rice much better than the fideo.  

The rest of the table ordered the quesadilla sampler and a bean burro.  Both looked pretty good, but I was too busy enjoying my tacos.
