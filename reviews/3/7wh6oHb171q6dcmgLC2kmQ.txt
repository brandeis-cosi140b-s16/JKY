Let me just get this out of the way. I grew up in Madison and for years this was my favorite Mexican place. I thought it was the best possible place...anywhere. Then I moved to Phoenix and had real Mexican food and now....

I wanted to review this place because it's not as bad as some of the other reviewers are making it sound. Their salsa and chips are fresh and some of the best around. They serve you fresh warm tortillas with your meal that go well with anything. Some of the pre-meal quesadillas are fantastic. My favorite dish here is the Bean Burrito with red sauce. The way the beans and cheese are melted together just makes it so craveable. 

Still, a lot of this food is simply not authentic, and more than a few are on the heavy side. You will walk away feeling full and likely be on the toilet for a little while the next day. There is no way around this.

The simple truth is that there is no superb mexican food here in Madison, and Pedro's fits right in to this muddy amalgam of mediocrity. Some things it does well though, and the cheap drinks on a Thursday night usually make for a good atmosphere.
