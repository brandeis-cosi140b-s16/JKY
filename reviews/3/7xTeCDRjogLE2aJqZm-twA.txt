I'm excited to say that I have finally made it to MMT.  After all these years hearing Yelpers discuss the original Taco shop and then the 2 that followed after Tacos Atoyac closed.  I was excited when I was driving past looking for a place to eat in CenPHo.

I'm not sure what's all the hype?  I tried 4 of the tacos.  Of the 4, considering my affinity for bacon, I figured I would love the bacon taco the most.  I mean... what can't be good about a bacon taco?  Well... if you overcook the bacon, that could ruin it.  Unfortunately, the bacon taco was a no-go for me.  the other tacos were not even memorable.  I was sad that I didn't leave this place with the same warm fuzzy feeling of my Yelp buddies.

I may go back and give them another shot, but it will be awhile.  This place is worth a try. There are plenty of Taco Shops to check out around town that I have not been to yet.
