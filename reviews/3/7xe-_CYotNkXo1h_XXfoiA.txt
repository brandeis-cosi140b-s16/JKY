Came here after a long night and was super hungry lol so we ordered everything! The Yelp check in sucks by the way! We checked in for our free coronita (you have to order like $12 worth of items to receive the mini beer) BUT it's not good for weekend or holidays? Wth is that? Lol total joke and I was upset with that, I mean cmon it's Vegas and most ppl go out to eat on weekends so why even have it if it's practically not available? The drink you see pictured was just okay, it looked way better than it tasted for $15 it just didn't cut it. I forgot what it was called but it was the more expensive of the michelada drinks with the seafood stuff all around it. I mean the actual drink portion was pretty good but the seafood that came with it, shrimp, fish and oyster tasted very fishy like they were a little old. I wasn't impressed. I ordered 2 tostadas de camarron and  they were pretty good & they're really big so one is plenty! My honey ordered the cocktail and  aguachiles, it was all just ehhh ok. Again all the seafood just didn't taste fresh like I was craving. We ordered a side of fries and beans (for dipping lol don't judge) and to be honest THAT was the best part of our meal. Not worth the $60 we paid but hey maybe we just ordered the wrong thing. The other tables' orders looked amazing so definitely try the grilled section cause that looked delicious. I'll be back to try the other stuff but just maybe shy away from these items. The place is cute and clean and the service is great! Will try again.
