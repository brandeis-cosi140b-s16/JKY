I am not a die-hard Espo's fan, there for my review is unbiased. Tonight I tried their chicken enchiladas plate with green sauce. the sauce was delicious and had a kick to it. But there didnt seem to be enough chicken in the enchilada. As others have said, the chicken is cubed not shredded. 
I also had a churro, this one had too much cinnamon and hardly any sugar. Blehh. Rubios serves better churros.
