Went to Ajo Al's because my parents love the place (they eat anything). We walked in and waited for someone to seat us and waited and waited and waited. A full 5 minutes later, no lie - it was 5 minutes, someone did finally come to us to ask if we were helped. We got to our table, we received 2 bowls of chips, all chips were tiny tiny, ya know the chips at the bottom of the bag. Looked like they didn't want to cook fresh chips so they served the crumbs that they had. Nevertheless, chips are chips so we still ate them. I ordered the cheese conqueso dip and when the server delivered it was very thin, almost a liquid consistency. I didn't want to say anything but my mom did and the waiter brought us shredded cheese that we added to the conqueso and made it right, ourselves (aren't we paying someone to do this for us?)

Anyway, besides everything that happened BEFORE getting our lunch, lunch was fabulous. Like always, their food is great. Maybe an off night? 

I would have rated it more but they need to work on a few things!

#1 customer service! especially in a society that is going through a recession.
