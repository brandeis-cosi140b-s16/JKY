I liked the feel of the restaurant and the menu items are great
I just didn't enjoy the "loudness" of the establishment as well as the long wait for our food...

Our server was fun and nice and she kept apologizing for how long our food was taking... I didn't mind because I had a house margarita in hand... If I didn't have that, this would be another story...

I ordered tacos, the something chicken tacos, I don't remember the name...
The sides were rice and beans...
The dish itself was very good 
However the ambience and "wait" time just didn't do it for me here...

Perhaps another try in the future...
