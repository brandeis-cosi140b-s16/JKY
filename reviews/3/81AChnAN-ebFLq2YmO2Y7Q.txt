I've definitely had better.  The food was good, but nothing I'd go back for.  I enjoyed the food at the little hole-in-the-wall across the street (Taqueria Los Angeles)  far more.  There was no comparison.  

I ordered a couple machaca soft tacos and a chimichanga.  They were busy, but not overwhelmed.  It took 25 minutes to get my food.  People were getting a bit testy and a couple made a scene about the slow service. 

I think the tortillas would have been good, but the tacos were so wet, I couldn't pick them up without them falling apart.  The machaca was bland until I doused them with salsa... that I had to ask for.   

The chimichanga was good... loaded with the machaca beef.  It was still a bit bland though, but salsa helped.

I don't know if I'll go back.
