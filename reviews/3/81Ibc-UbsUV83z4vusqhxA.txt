I go here often for just one thing---The Menudo!  It is a Mexican version of Vietnamese Fau(sp?) Soup.  I get all the fixin's with it: red pepper flakes, oregano, lemon wedges, chopped onions, and cilantro!  

Mixed all together and spoon away!  They ask you if you want corn or four tortillas...I get the corn, which adds more flavor to the experience, then a bland flour tortilla will.  Menudo at this restaurant, is served all through the week, though typically at other Mexican food restaurants, it is served primarily on Saturday and Sunday...Not sure why?
The seating can hold large parties of up to thirty or more or a comfy couple....The setting is strangely old, and on Sundays there is a Mariachi band that comes around and woos you to another time and space in Mexicana Latin Style and flair!
Parking is a pain, so be ready to walk a distance from the parking garage.  Service is so-so....You have to sometimes hunt down the waiter for coke refills....
