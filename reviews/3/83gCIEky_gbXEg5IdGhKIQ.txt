I used to eat at El Molino a lot when I was younger. Since moving back to AZ (about 2 1/2 yrs ago) I hadn't been back until recently. Honestly, it wasn't AS good as I remembered, but was still very good. 

I got a carne asada burrito. I don't know why, but I thought this place used to put a lot of stuff on there burritos (at least cheese), but all it was, was meat, onion & guacamole. Of course, there was salsa on the side (the salsa here it good! both the mild & spicy!). It was good, but the meat was a little dry (they certainly weren't stingy with it, though). Also, the burrito was huge!

My mom got a cheese crisp, which was also huge. She said it was good.

For the price (and the fact that the food is pretty tasty), I'd come back. However, I was expecting to fall back in love with the place after such a long hiatus & sadly that wasn't the case.
