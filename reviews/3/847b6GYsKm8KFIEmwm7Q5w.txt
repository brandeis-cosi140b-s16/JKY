I'm kind of middle-of-the-road about this place.  Undoubtedly, the location is very nice, especially on the outdoor patio as you are right by the pool...  But i would say that the food and the service weren't worth the price you pay for it all.  I ordered the Huevos Rancheros and the guacamole, and I just didn't think that they were the best I ever tasted.  They were good, don't get me wrong, just not the best.  The drink orders were slow that day too, because (as the waitress explained) the bartender had a lot of orders to get out to the pool.
