Came here on a Sunday after a long weekend in Vegas, im sure we all know how we feel on those Sundays after these "type" of "long" weekend in Vegas haha.

I needed something oily greasy and Mexican to eat haha so this was the right place. 

The Horchata was not only refreshing and delicious but above average. I understand that the way Horchata is liked can be totally subjective so just as an FYI i love mine extra gritty however not to sweet. (sounds like my last relationship)

The rolled tacos were also very yummy. Burrito was a plus too!
