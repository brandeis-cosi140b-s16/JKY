The food is great! Really tasty and well priced! I was a little upset because the server seemed overwhelmed, stressed, and in a hurry. The server stuck out his tongue and said gross after I made my order. I think that is just plain rude. I hope that they can hire more people to help out because the service was pretty poor. I think this place has potential, but need some more training for the crew. 

Not sure this is a place I would recommend to my friends and family.
