Short: Good, but can be better. 

Long: Went here for lunch. Ordered three beef tacos. They're the typical three inch tacos with meat, salsa and sauce on top--at $1.25 each, it's quite the average deal. While everything was good, my main problem is that nothing blew me away and makes me beg to go back there. There taco trucks that are a lot better in the area, like 702Tacos down the road that blow me away. 

Go here if you want to eat good tacos inside and with a salsa bar. Otherwise, visit a taco truck--there's several in the area.
