Came here around midnight on a weeknight after a couple drinks at a bar.

Seems mostly like a drunk food joint though it was pretty empty.

Interior was clean and there was a TV showing ESPN.  Service was very friendly and decently speedy.

Sheh-meh-neh Burrito was good, especially the sweet potato filling.
High roller burrito was OK... a bit bland.

Tortilla chips and salsa were bland and limp.

Tortilla wraps for the burritos were pretty unremarkable, too.

Overall an OK place for late night food.
