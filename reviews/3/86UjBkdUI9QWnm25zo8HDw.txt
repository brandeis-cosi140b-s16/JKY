My wife and I have been back a few times, for both lunch and dinner, and the food quality has fallen off a bit.  The tortilla shells did not seem to be fresh this time with the tacos.  I guess the light red aztec design around the outside edge that transferred from the bag to the tortilla was a major hint!  Also, the rice was dry.  My wife's taco salad wasn't at all what it was in the past.  Very little lettuce and at least an inch of re-fried beans in the bottom.  She said she regretted ordering it this time.

We have had the same waitress several times since the opening and you still have to give her numbers, not names, when you order.  She is nice enough, but after all these months she should know the short menu and what is in the dishes.  

I want to like this place more so I can finally have nearby good Mexican food...but it needs a lot of work to rise above average.  BTW, I agree with Mark.  The outdoors area can be awesome if they would just put a little work into it.
