I wavered on two or three stars, finally going with that third star due to the carnitas tacos with the green sauce. Other than that we were not that impressed. The nachos were just stale chips with melted cheese and taste straight from the microwave. The Carne asada that was on the bowl meal was really tough and flavorless. Was anticipating more, bummer cause I really wanted to love this place!! I must add that the staff in this place is great!!
