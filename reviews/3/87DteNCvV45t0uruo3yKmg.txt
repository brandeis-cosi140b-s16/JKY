I've stumbled (literally) into this place a couple times when on Mill avenue. Its like a smaller version of San Felipe's Cantina. They have basic drinks (beer, alcohol), and pretty decent tacos. I find it pretty funny that the tacos actually cost more than the alcohol. It's a place located in the midst of the ASU vicinity, therefore very casual, cheap, and a place to people watch while watching some sports. 

You'd be surprised how much fun this place is on a Sunday night. They clear tables out, bring in the DJ that mixes awesome music, and screw on a dance pole for the ladies to practice their moves. When you have nothing going on Sunday, come to Chronic for some music, tacos, beer, and watch girls try to shake their tail-fetha on the pole. (Not saying that I haven't done that once or twice *wink*)
