I have to say I am torn between 3 and 4 stars, but am going with the 3 since everything was okay, except the fresh chips and salsa, they were great! Served upon arrival and were hot, seasoned well & I love the salsa. I joined a friend and she ordered the Shrimp Salad. She enjoyed, nut thought it was pretty simple, lettuce, shrimp, and a few pieces of avocado and mango. I chose the choose two items and got the chicken quesadilla & the beef taco. The quesadilla was good, but the ground beef was ugh! I will not order that again. The rice & beans were good! 
After seeing the photos on Yelp, I should have tried the crab nachos, those look good. Maybe I'll give them another lunch try.
