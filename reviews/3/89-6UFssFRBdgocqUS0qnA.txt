Ya ready for the review? O right so here it goooooesss:

Pink taco at the Hard rock hotel casino.

This place is okay.  As in A-OK.  it aint nothing special.  I mean overall i give it an average review.

I kinda put this type of establishment in the bucket of restaurants located in hotels.  Usually they are average tasting food to me.  But what do you really expect from a restaurant that serves mexican food in a hotel/casino.  Not much.

The food I ordered.  Shrimp tacos, Ceviche, and Guac.  They were good.  Not the best.  Definitely had better mexican before.  

I've scanned some of the more highly rated reviews by other yelpers for pink tacos and have to wonder if they've ever had really good mexican food before.  Some of the reviewers are blown away by the awesome guacamole and tacos.   Great for them if they've experienced some of the best mexican here but I don't think they know.   They just don't know.  its' all good.

You should give it a shot if you've never been though.  You' can't beat it down unless you give it a taste here.   We were seated outside facing rehab so that was the only highlight of our meal here.  Foodwise, a-okay.  Bla bla blah no more review here, just typing nonsense for the final sentence if you are reading still you can stop now. bye.
