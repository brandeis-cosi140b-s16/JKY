The service is very friendly.  I ordered a chicken flautas, chicken taco hard shell and cheese enchiladas.   The taco is American style, lettuce cheese and tomato.  I prefer a good street taco instead.  The chicken was a red baby food mush that tasted more like BBQ chicken and it was microwaved.  The cheese enchilada is also microwaved.   The flautas tasted freezer burned and was topped with cheese only so I ordered a side of guacamole which seemed homemade.    I added salt to everything but that may have just been my preference.   The price was cheap, but not a place I would visit again, there are too many other great Mexican restaurants in the valley.
