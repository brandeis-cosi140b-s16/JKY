I had a Groupon and we were staying at the Flamingo so we decided to check it out. We ate lunch there on our last day before catching our shuttle for the airport. We were seated right away. Service though was slooooooooow. We both ordered the shrimp burrito, it was good. We enjoyed our food but I would not of paid full price (had a groupon). I would only eat there again if it were out of desperation. Everything at the Flamingo is overpriced and gross.
