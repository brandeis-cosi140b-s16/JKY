Carlitos burritos has a neighborhood taco shack feel to it.  You order at the counter and service is friendly.  They serve homemade tamales, and serve the traditional fare - burritos, tacos, quesadillas - all with the typical options of pork, ground beef, steak, chicken, or veggies. 

Portions are beyond generous and the prices are good, real good.  A couple can stuff themselves for around $10.  However, while portions were huge, flavor was not.  We found both our meals "good enough" but relatively bland.  I tried the chicken tamales, smothered in green sauce.  I found the sauce a bit goopy, and generally lacking in taste (something no chile verde sauce should have a problem with in the southwest where we have easy access to freshly roasted chiles).  The sauce had heat, but lacked any flavor complexities beyond that.  The tamales were fine - but again, not mind blowing, a bit lacking on the flavor.  We also ordered nachos and a burrito.  The nacho portion was HUGE!  If you're with a group of friends and want an appetizer doused in cheese, and sour cream (which definitely has it's place in the diet every now and then) this is the place to go.  However, besides the entire brick of cheese melted on top, other flavors were lacking - the beans were sparse, and we just felt a bit overdone by the time the dish was halfway consumed. 

However, the bright spot was $1 pints of MGD!  Can't beat that price! 

In summary, Carlitos is a nice little neighborhood joint that would be a great place to meet friends for some beer, cheesy chips, and some cheap Mexican food.  However, we were generally underwhelmed by the (lack of) flavors in our meals.  This was our first trip there, so I'd be willing to give it another go (the cheap beer will bring me back).
