Very difficult decision here. Let's start with the beginning. I read on yelp how great the food was so we decided to check it out. After sitting down everything seemed to be what you would expect from a normal dining experience. First came the chips and salsa which were above average. The salsa was actually very very good. Unfortunately for us we had finished the entire basket of chips and salsa before we got our drinks and this sadly became a recurring theme. I watched 3 staff servers sit at the bar checking their cell phones as our margaritas slowly melted away on the bar top. The telephone would continuously ring as the hostess failed to answer. Other staff filled empty tables with napkins and silverware. While this was fairly entertaining I could only think of taking a few gulps of cold water to soothe my burning mouth from the aforementioned salsa. Finally we asked our server for our drinks. By this time our food had already been served. Unsurprisingly this was the saving grace because the food was genuinely tremendous. Nothing out of a freezer or microwave. Everything was prepared fresh and was very obvious whoever was in the kitchen had some serious skills. Honestly if it wasn't for the awful service I would give this place 5 stars. If you're in the neighborhood stop in and give it a try but wouldn't waste time driving across town.
