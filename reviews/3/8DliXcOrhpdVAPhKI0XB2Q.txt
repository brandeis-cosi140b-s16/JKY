Wow what a difference. Cashier was super fucking rude. Food was very good but not excellent. Cashier cheerily told me Dan was no longer involved, guess that was the biker looking white guy. So after ordering, mid-sentence, cashier orders me to go sit down and wait for my order. Super rude, and why? She thinks I'm hitting on her because I'm polite and chatty. Hate to break it to you, but the sexy Latinas are the ones that don't look like mole people who got creative with their eyebrows. I drove all the way from Surprise for worse food than before and major attitude from a mole lady. Won't happen again.
