A year since my first review.  Time to review again!

Over the past year we've been here a few times.  We've tried most of their offerings by now.  Stick with the burro.  The tostada didn't have much meat, and neither did the tacos.  The enchiladas were really just smaller burros (especially if you get the burro "enchilada style").  I don't know why they bother with the other options.  Just get the burro and be happy.  Their best is probably the chile beef (shredded) with red sauce.  At Chipotle I prefer the carnitas, but here it's the chile beef.

The burro is very good.  As good as Chipotle or Qdoba or any of those.  The staff is generally friendly and helpful, the drinks are sorta unique (in addition to the soda fountain they have horchata and some "-ades" like mango lemonade).  I like the diner's/stamp card (after 10 entrees you get one free).

A solid three stars here.
