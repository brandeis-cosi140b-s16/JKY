Secreto is a place that could seriously be worth 5 stars. It's got a lot of style and the staff was friendly. Yes, the food is similar to Richardson's. But is it as good? No, unfortunately it's not perfected like Richardson's is.

I went into Secreto and was very impressed with the layout of the restaurant. It's classy, plain and simple. The lights are low, the seating is comfy, but the music didn't match the mood at all. It was fun, but kind of all over the place. The appetizers were awesome. The garlic and chili plate was outstanding, and definitely the way to go if you love garlic lingering around in your mouth. I also got to try the adovada (smoky, spicy and delicious), pork-filled relleno (also smoky, spicy and delicious with great texture), and the smothered burrito. 

Now, the smothered burrito is what I personally ordered and it's what brought this review down. The flavors were just as good as the other dishes that were covered in red and green sauce, but unfortunately there was a pile of unmelted and cold cheese it the burrito. Yes, my first bite felt cold. I read that in another review, but thought nothing of it. It had to be a fluke, right? Well, people can make mistakes multiple times, but I hope this isn't one of those mistakes that more people with have to experience. Hopefully the owners of Secreto read this and get on their chef's case. 

I will most definitely return to Secreto when I'm craving something close to Richardson's and I'm in the East Valley. It has a lot of potential, and once all of the kinks are worked out, it will be a crowd pleaser.
