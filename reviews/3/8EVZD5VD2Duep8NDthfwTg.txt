Great hang out place. There's a reason this place is always packed to the gills during mealtimes and weekends. Their food is good, their service is excellent, and it's just got an overall great vibe.

I recommend the queso dip if you want your willpower tested. I'm not usually a fan of queso dips (*gluuurg* calories), but there was something about this one that just.... crack, it had to have been crack. It was crack queso dip.

Cabo Fish Taco serves various forms of crack, skillfully folded into their food. My dining companion was quite taken with the honey wasabi sauce. It went into the Mahi Mahi fish taco she thoroughly enjoyed, and it went into the side of rice. She considered briefly drizzling it into her margarita before she finally resigned to just putting a small lid on the container (thoughtfully provided by our excellent server) and slipping it into her purse. 

I had the lemon-grilled shrimp on a corn tortilla (because flour is the devil, or at least my devil), and some sort of chickpea, tomato, and black bean concoction on the side. While the shrimp was tasty and the overall taco was a good blend, he white cilantro sauce (sour cream, yogurt, and cilantro) could *really* have used more, you know, cilantro.. or crack. I'd take crack. I could be biased because I'm a cilantro fiend. Hey, they're good for your kidneys. The salad-ish thing on the side could  have used a lot of something, anything. It was really tasteless. I really like all three of those ingredients normally, but put them together with nothing delicious (or crack-like) to, you know, rule them, find them, and in the darkness bind them... er what? It was just lackluster. 

Have I mentioned service was excellent? We came in on New Year's Day and was there ever a day where water was more needed? My glass was always refilled promptly, even as I was sucking down glass #3 or 5 or something.

Definitely worth your while. I'll be back some day, Fish Taco.
