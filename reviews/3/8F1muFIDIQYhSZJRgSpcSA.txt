ok, so my review is a bit mixed. I went there for a (very) late breakfast.  You know the after- hangover very much needed michelada and shrimp cocktail and it was great! Very tasty and lots of shrimp!
As far as the location...ya, it sucks. Kinda ghetto, kinda scary.  Attempted to go one night and none of the people I was with wanted to bother  getting outta the car because the scene seemed like on of those cheap mexican movies my dad watches! Beer bellied older men.  Well, maybe they were just having a wedding or quinceanera that night...IDK
