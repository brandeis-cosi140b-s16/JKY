Cabo is predictable. Good quality Mexican food prepared promptly, without fuss. The tableside guacamole is memorable and the all you can eat tacos special is a very good deal. Service could be a bit better, our server was bussing tables, and cleaning as well as serving food and earned a good tip as we were impressed at how well he kept things running. I don't blame the server I blame management for not staffing appropriately. We ordered ice tea to drink which was kinda ho-hum and they didn't have sugar to sweeten it. It's just one of those things. In short...it's casino food but at Station Casinos flagship property. It's missing the seriously good salsa bar that the Cabo at Sunset Station has...but overall you won't go wrong eating here.
