We decided to head over to the trendy new Pink Taco in Scottsdale to check it out this weekend.  I must admit that the decor is pretty creative and tacky but in a good way...i think.  It is definitely visually stimulating.  The salsas, especially the green salsa, were good.  However, they try to make a chip different and it did not work.  The chips are very thick and almost taste burnt.  Why change a good staple?  Just to be trendy and different, I suppose.  That works sometimes but not here.  The food is alright, but nothing special.  I preferred the enchiladas over the burrito, and the chicken over the carnitas.  The key to this restaurant is atmosphere and good drinks.  I don't think they hook you by serving stellar food.  So, enjoy a prickley pear margarita and you should be on your way to having a good time.
