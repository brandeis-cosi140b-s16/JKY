This review has been edited since I originally mistook VIVA Michoacan for LINDO Michoacan.

Granted I have not been to VIVA for some time I distinctly recall the food being of good portion and tasty.  Slower but passable service times. All staff were polite and helpful.

Decent margaritas.

I do recall the roaming musicians to be a bit loud and forward in their approach but entertaining...as long as they keep some distance. Seems they are really "hovering" for tips which is a turn off.

Gave 3 stars to be fair to the quality of food at the time.

Given it's out of the way location you aren't likely to run into the typical dinner "mob" at more prominently located establishments.

Speed up service a bunch, restrain the musicians a bit and more "stars" will appear.
