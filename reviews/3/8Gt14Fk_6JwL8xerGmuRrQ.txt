Oh Espee, you have gotten way too expensive.  A three item combo is, get this, SIXTEEN DOLLARS!   I can go to a beautiful restaurant like Agave and not pay this price for a taco meal.  And it really seems like the tamales at Espees have gotten smaller.  And the salsa bar is completely disgusting now - what happened to the pico de gallo? 

They still have a pretty good happy hour with 2 for 1 margaritas and half price nachos - but I had to knock down my four star review to a three because of the ridiculous prices and shrinking portions.  Why do order at the counter restaurants try to charge the same prices as a sit down restaurant?
