Monterrey is close to UNC Charlotte and as such there is usually a college crowd when you go there. 

They have a large deck/patio area that is covered. It also has fans built into the covering for those hot summer days. Great place to go if you want to sit outside while you sip on your margarita and snack on chips and salsa. They also have speakers that play music outside which is nice. 

The cheese dip here is good, but it's a little bit runnier than other places that I have gone. I prefer it to be a little bit thicker so that it really sticks to the chip. 

I have gotten a few different entrees here. All of them are good. It's your basic Mexican restaurant. It's nothing special or extraordinarily culinary. Food always comes out quick. The portions are big and the prices are pretty cheap. They also have lunch specials.
