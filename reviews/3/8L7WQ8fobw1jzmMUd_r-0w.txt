This place has an odd crowd. I've enjoyed their salads and chips and salsa, but haven't had much else. Their drinks are reasonable and the place is pretty nice inside. They improved the outside as well. So what's the problem? The music, man... if it's not your thing, you won't like it. The place is a little too country for me. I feel like someone's gonna bust out line dancing at any moment. They'll occasionally do a karaoke night with a live band as backup which can be kinda fun if you like that sort of thing.

Flicka's gets kinda busy at times and other times it's empty when it should be packed. It's strange. Considering the location, the crowd should be a lot more fun than it is Since it's next to Babe's, there's often dancers there grabbing a meal - aside from that though, the place is a little too country and I'm a little too rock and roll. It's a decent joint, but not my cup o tea. Worth checking out, but it's not on my list of places I want to go.
