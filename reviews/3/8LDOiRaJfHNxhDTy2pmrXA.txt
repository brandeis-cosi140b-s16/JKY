We have loved this restaurant since the beginning, but now...Waiting 10 minutes for water, and another 10 minutes to order drinks and food is unacceptable, especially when there are empty tables and staff hanging around talking. Love the food and enjoy taking out of town guests on flamenco night, but if we can't count on good service, not sure we will go back. Please work on improving speed of service!
