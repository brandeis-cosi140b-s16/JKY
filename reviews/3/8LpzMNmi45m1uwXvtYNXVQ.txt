I give .3 stars because, in the past I would give maybe 1. The chips are better than they were in the past, the food is actually a little better.  I get the red chili bean mixed enchilada style...I love it... Shredded beef tacos are good... Tostadas are small and not that great.  Rice is ok.

Service: avoid the back room where the bar is.. Horrible service there, you will wait forever.
The front may seem empty, but the service is pretty quick... They don't check on ya much to see how things are or if you need a refill.. But, at least you get your food on time.
