For the ambiance and hip factor, SumoMaya is 5 stars (trendy, fashionable dressers, good looking lively crowd), but the 2 food dishes I ordered were absolutely terrible. The service by the bartenders was friendly and quick and overall I had a fun experience hanging out here. But the ahi tuna tacos and sushi roll I ordered were just plain mediocre at best and the food taste was underwhelming.
