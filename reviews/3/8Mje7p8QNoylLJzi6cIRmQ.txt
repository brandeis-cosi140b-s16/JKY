Not the most authentic or delicious mexican joint in town, I've had tastier food at those drive-thru Mexican places but Someburros has a couple perks. 
1.  They sell margaritas
2. They have a drive-thru pickup window for phone orders
3. Good deals on groupon now, and prices are already  fairly low

Tip, try the pollo fundido- it's like a chimichange, and best thing I've tried here so far.
