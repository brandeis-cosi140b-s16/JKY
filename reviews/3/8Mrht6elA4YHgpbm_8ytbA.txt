We decided to place a take out order for two.   Considering it was Cinco DE mayo,  the wait was expected.   I picked up my order and noticed they provided a very small amount of salsa.   I politely asked for more and they said it would be an additional charge.   I asked if it was an additional charge while dining in,  she stated no.   

I do not understand why I must pay extra for additional salsa with take out while dining in is free.   Take out is cheaper for the restaurant,  less wait help,  opens up a table for another guest,  and no clean up.   

My first thought was leaving one star,  but the food was good, the wait was acceptable.   Therefore,  I gave three stars.
