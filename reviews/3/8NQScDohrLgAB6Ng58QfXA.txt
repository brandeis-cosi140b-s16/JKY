Aya & Peilas is new in the sense that they have re-opened since 1988.  It is on the corner of 17th Ave and Van Buren, just west of the the Circle K.

A stack of menus were hand delivered by the family who owns Aya & Peilas to my office building just down the street and we went and tried it out.  We did take out, but they do phone orders and dine in.  There are about 2 booths and 2 tables in there, it's small and warm but very clean.

There were state employees inside ordering lunch to go just like we were.  A & P has some good deals on the lunch combos.  They are only $4.95.  I got the taco, enchilada and tostada.  Not bad, pretty good and for less than $5, can't beat it!  It is a glorified 'ertos type restaurant.  The family owners and employees seem very nice.  

Other workies got some lunch too and they were happy with it.  It's nice to have a new spot to grab some grub while at work!

Oh and they have navajo tacos and Indian fry bread on the menu---- YUMMMM!
