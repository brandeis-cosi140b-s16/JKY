I ate at this Rubios today, and I can't say that I really liked it.  The food didn't really do much for me.  I ordered an enchilada, and honestly, I could have probably made it better myself.  It tasted hot saucy.  Somewhere in there was chicken, and my serving was rather small for my taste.  I like big fat enchiladas.  (insert bad joke here, I know.)  No small enchilada for this girl.

Anyways, Rubios really doesn't cut it for me. I felt like it was bland food.
