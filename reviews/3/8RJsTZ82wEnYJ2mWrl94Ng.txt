Typical Mexican fast food chain...similar to but seemingly more flavorful than it's Robertos cousin.

This is the kind of food that tastes 100x better late at night or inebriated lol.

We ordered the Carne Asada Tostada ($3.80). Good flavor...HUGE portion lol.

Al Pastor Torta ($5.15). Surprisingly good considering it's not rotisserie style pastor. A bit on the dry end though, but the seasoning was tasty.

Chorizo Breakfast Burrito ($3.80). Chorizo didn't seem fresh and had an odd taste. Filled to the brim with scrambled egg and potato.

Solid late night choice for greasy drunk food :P
