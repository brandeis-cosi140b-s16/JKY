I called about 5 minutes before we arrived to see how long of a wait they had. She said there was no wait (on a Friday night? Cool). So we get there, we're the only ones in the entrance and she says it would be 30 minutes. I was not happy about this, so I told her I JUST called and she said, "Oh... wait, we do have a table actually." Hmm... that was rude. 

The salsas were delicious; some of the best I've had -- chips were nothing special. I got the chicken quesadilla and it came out cold and soggy, and my husband got crawfish and spinach enchiladas, which he loved. I think the kitchen prepared my quesadilla ahead of time because it was under the "Appetizers" category and so it sat under the heat lamp until my husband's was done. It was cold and wet and very bland. I would not get this again. My husbands crawfish enchiladas were $14 and a very, very small portion. Two thin, under-stuffed echiladas with over-cooked rice and black beans. But he enjoyed the flavor so that was good.

I would definitely give it another shot and sample their tequilas/margaritas and chow down that delicious black bean salsa and tomatillo-pineapple salsa; it's about time a restaurant isn't scared to offer some spiciness in their salsa (currently pregnant so I couldn't try the alcohol). I like the atmosphere; it's just what Gilbert/Mesa needs. It's hip and young, with cool decor.
