Here's what worked:
* Wait staff was super-attentive and friendly, even though the place was PACKED by 6:30 pm
* Food. We'd order all these things again: guacamole and chips, salad with beet and jicama (great dressing!), veggie tostados, the daily special: pork tenderloin with mole and mashed potatoes, and flourless chocolate cake.

The decor and layout are a little weird, but if you love mole (I do) and are on the West side of Madison, go for it!

Last thing: we went with a Groupon, and you know some restaurateurs can be jerks about that (even though THEY are the ones who agreed to do a Groupon). But the staff and owner were GREAT about having us and our Groupon. That's another bonus IMHO: they're happy to see and serve you, no matter how you got there.
