As a hungry paddler fresh off of a full day of racing and heading blindly into another, I was ready to eat just about anything as long as it was fast.

The wait at another restaurant was excruciatingly unbearable so me and a few guys drove off to this restaurant one of us randomly looked up.

The restaurant was deceptively large considering the additional dining room adjacent to the kitchen/cashier. Now,  we didn't know anything about portions but I figured I couldn't go wrong with a chicken burrito. There were actually quite a few options for chicken burritos with different fixings but the lady at the register was very helpful when I was making the big decision. 

I ordered a standard chicken burrito and wasn't disappointed with the portion at all. It wasn't excruciatingly large, but it was filling all the same. I got through 1/4 of the burrito and noticed that something was off. The burrito was really salty. It was something I could only attribute to the lack of fresh salsa, but I'm sure there's more to the mystery.

The food was good, but the saltiness was just a little too overwhelming so I don't think I'll be calling this place one of my favorites.
