Another Chipotle.  They're popping up all over the place.  A huge burrito chain.  I really do try to avoid chains most of the time, but sometimes it's difficult.  Seems just about everyone who makes burritos is a chain.

Chipotle is reliably good.  Hard to say if it's better than places like Cafe Rio or Qdoba.  They're all pretty good.  In this case Chipotle was running a special (get a free burrito).  And the burrito was good.

Not much more to say.  Can't say it's extraordinary, but it's good, the burritos are pretty large and the prices are reasonable.
