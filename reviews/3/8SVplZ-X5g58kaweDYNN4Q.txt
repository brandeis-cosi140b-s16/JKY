My husband and I have gone to this place a couple of times. The place itself looks great and is clean, the menu is really nice and the food looks fantastic. However, I'm giving it three stars because there is a serious lack of flavor in the tacos and the sides! They really need to be more generous with the spices or at least salt. I'm wondering if it's somekind of a healthy food thing since they have a lot of vegetarian options? Too bad because the food is bland.
