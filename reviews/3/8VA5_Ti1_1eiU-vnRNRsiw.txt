I love a hole in the wall so I'm good with the atmosphere. Slow service, great tacos carne asada El pastor. Chile rellenos was middle of the road. Cleanliness was average at best. Not baja style. Someone else said it was L.A. style. Maybe it's a four star place if L.A. is the standard. I wouldn't know, I'm a gringa from Vegas.
