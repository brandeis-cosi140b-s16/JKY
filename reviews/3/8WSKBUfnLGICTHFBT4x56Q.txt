Cheese Fundu - AMAZING!! I had a steak sandwich and it didnt wow me. Cheese Fundu- AMAZING!!! Because of this dish alone I would go back. The King Colada was also great..However, when you're thinking about where to go eat...this place a "Cheat Day" place. Unless of course you are working on a muffin top, then hell you should eat here everyday. Im just saying.. healthy.. this place is not!
