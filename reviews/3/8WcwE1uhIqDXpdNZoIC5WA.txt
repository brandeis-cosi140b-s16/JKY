The new place is nice and new.  Parking is a problem  unless you get there early.  Tha salsa was not spicy. Chips were marginal , a little on the cold side . I had green chili burro and  a taco . Green chili was salty. And the meat overcooked.  Taco had too much cheese . Combinations  were a little pricy. RICE was firm. Service was a little  slow . For the neighborhood  I prefer Los compadres
