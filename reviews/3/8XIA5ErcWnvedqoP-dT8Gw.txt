Food portions were on the smaller side.  Fajitas were good but could have used more meat. Salsa was good flavor but could have used more heat.  Enchilada sauce was on the Smokey side and did not care for flavor.  Enchilada was really small.  Rice was lacking in flavor. Would go back but not too soon.
