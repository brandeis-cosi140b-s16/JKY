It would rate 5 stars except for the damn lighting.   Please change pink neon out.   We love it but can not dine there as the lighting is ghastly.   We hit it every couple years instead of a couple of times a month.   Went back and the lighting is still painful.   Beyond painful.   

On this last visit my wife had the veggie fajitas and the had the bad lighting enchiladas.   Food was very tasty.   Service great.
