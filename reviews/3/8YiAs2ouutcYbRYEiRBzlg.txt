1st visit for sit down, normally get to go. Service was ehh. You order at countet self serve drink and food is brought to you.  I have always had the Mexican hot dog. Best in the area. Bacon wrapped dog ketchup, mayo, mustard. Toasted bun and onions on top. Did try the cheese crisp for the $5 not worth it! Will continue to get the dog not sure about much else.
