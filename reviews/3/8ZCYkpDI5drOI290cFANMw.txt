Rudy's has great customer services. It's a little, almost authentic, shop. They are a mexican family that obviously serves to the liking of those who frequent. The salsa is lacking texture, flavor, and peppers. The tortilla was tasty, the meat and beans however, lacked flavor. The meat in the tacos was great quality, but again, not authentic street tacos. It is reasonably priced. I eat a lot and being mexican, I've eaten mexican all over the U.S. and Mexico, but by LA standards, rudy's is ok.
