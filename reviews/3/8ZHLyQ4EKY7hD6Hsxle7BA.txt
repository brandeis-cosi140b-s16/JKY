Tried this place again last night.  Food is still fantastic.  Service is still really bad - tons of personal conversations among workers, and worker tried to take my order when there were still several people in front of her.  I'm not going to shout my order at you; wait until I get there.   Cashier was irritated that I didn't know what kind of sauce husband had on his food.  Really?  If that info is important to have, perhaps someone should be punching in an order at the front of the line?  I told several staff that our food was 'to go'. A worker put a lid on one item and walked off.  Cashier was holding the bag and kept staring at me so after waaay too long I said, 'that's OK, I got this' and took a lid from the stack and put it on the container myself.  Like I said, the food is fantastic but the experience and service are anything but.
