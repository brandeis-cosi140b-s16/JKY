Walking in you feel the upbeat and friendly atmosphere in the very festively decorated restaurant. Had a groupon which they happily accepted and told us about the history of the family-owned restaurant since it was out first time there. We started with guac and the complimentary salsa and beans, which I thought were a little bland. We each got a sampler plate and here is where I think they nailed it. I had a steak taco on a homemade corn tortilla and it was downright delicious. The tamale was also homemade and not your store bought style tamale. The corn wrapping was thick and granular (the way I like it) and the filling an awesome shredded spice pork. Definitely going to go again an try some more items. Will keep you posted!
