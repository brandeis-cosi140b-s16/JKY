We have heard great things from friends so we decided to give it a try. The Margaritas were just the right strength. 

The food was good. I had the grilled chicken salad burrito. 

I would love to rate this higher but the restaurant was fairly empty and yet the dining room was not bussed. The salsa bar was closed.
