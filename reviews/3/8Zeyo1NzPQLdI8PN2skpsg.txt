Really 2 and 1/2 stars but I'm rounding it up to 3 because it's a spacious, bright and clean restaurant in a nice area, the salsa bar is a nice touch, and the food portions are relatively generous. The food I had, though, was far from memorable. I ordered the carne asada platter; the meat was dry and tasteless, as was the rice; and the guacamole side was watery. Definitely room for improvement here.
