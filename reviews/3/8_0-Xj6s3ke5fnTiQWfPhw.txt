Went back again today. Sonoran hot dogs were still good, but not up to Tucson standards. Torta, not so good. Tacos, decent, but nothing special. Our initial order was wrong. Our second order was also wrong. Still worth the trip since it is one of the only places in the Valley doing Sonoran hot dogs, but there are many places better for Sonoran Mexican food overall. Oh, the fried ice cream was excellent. Large portions for a good price.
