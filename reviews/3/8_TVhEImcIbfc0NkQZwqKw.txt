I do like my Mad Mex, however predictable and non-authentic it may be.  The portion sizes are mammoth and I come away with a satisfied sense of regret.  Their beer menu is happily extensive.  Charging me $9 for chips and salsa is a bit of crime, wouldn't ya say though!?!  I mean, c'mon!  Our service has most times been lacking--a bit rushed and on the inattentive side.  Also, why do you require your wait staff to not servestraws/ lemons/etc unless asked by cusotmers---weirdness-cut out these odd cost-cutting, anti-service friendly measures please.
