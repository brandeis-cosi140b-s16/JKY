Came through for a salad and a couple of burritos.. One car ahead and we sat for almost 20 min before they got there food.. Cant say they ordered alot only saw 2 bags being passed to them.. 
The salad was good but, the shell it was in was not.. It tasted like it was fried in Old cooking oul!! Yuck!! Needless to say was already home eating it and was to tired to take it back so it sucked!!
We may go back and try it again maybe it was an off day
