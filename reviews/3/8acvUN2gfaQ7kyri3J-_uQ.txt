I went for a work meeting yesterday. I was happy to find more customers here than my last visit (I think I've been here 5 times in the last 3 months). I was pleased as usual, and had the guacamole for the first time. I really enjoyed it. They must use a bit more lemon juice than I am used to, because it had a nice tangy flavor to it. 
I have reached a point where the owner now knows my dish, and while in a group of 6 where only 2 other had been here before, he didn't even need to ask me what I wanted. 
I really appreciate how quick you get your food, and the low-key atmosphere. For the same price (or even a bit less) than you would spend at Cafe Rio or Chipotle you can get more food, without the wait and good chips and salsa to go with it!
