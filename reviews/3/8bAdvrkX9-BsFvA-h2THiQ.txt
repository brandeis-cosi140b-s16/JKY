Alright alright - who's this hater giving Tacos El Gordo 3 stars? I mean, it averages 4.5 stars over 1100 reviews - so who's this guy giving it 3?

Yes - it is a cheap eat in Vegas.
Yes - there are great tacos here.
Yes - there is quite an assortment of meats here.
Yes - they're pretty quick
Yes - everyone and their moms eat here because of everything that everybody raves about.

But.. I just didn't think it was THAT great. My wife loved it - in fact, we ate here twice during the 2-day stay we had in Vegas. I guess I've just been spoiled with the availability of great tacos at a cheaper price in LA, that I didn't see what the hoopla of Tacos El Gordo is/was.

It's a solid option, especially if you're up drinking, partying, clubbing, or doing whatever else Vegas has to offer, and it's late, and you want something to eat. They're great at what they do, I just didn't think it was as amazing as it was overhyped to be.

I got the buche, the cabeza, and the lengua tacos. Each taco had a lot of meat. The lady had an asada vampiro. She was satisfied with her choice. 

She did make the remark that everything about Tacos el Gordo was legitimately Mexican i.e. the layout, staff, products, and even the patrons [all walks of life] - just that the price wasn't quite Mexican, meaning, you're paying more for the same product. I guess the price was the biggest turn off for me, since there are $1 taco places near my childhood home that offer the same quality goodness that is a taco.

Was it good? Yes. Great? Mmmmm.....
