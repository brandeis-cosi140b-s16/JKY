Went back last night for pre-Valentine's Day dinner.  Totally different looking inside, still very simple, not fakey Mexican decor!  Had a tasty Patron margarita. Chips were crispy & salsa tasted fresh, not as "hot" as I like it but my husband was happy he could still feel his tastebuds - Ha!

We enjoyed our entrees. Service was good, attentive but not overly so.  Made me a fresh cup of coffee to go with the flan and it was good quality.  Lower priced menu was a nice surprise, will definitely go back and take the Family.  Eat Local, Drink Local.
