What a cool place! Loved the outdoor patio around the duckpond. We sat inside for some AC as today was a little toasty. I got a corona light and my husband and friend were giving thumbs up about the margaritas. Their chips and salsa actually comes with three salsas: mild, med, and hot. All three were pretty tasty! 
We ordered the green chile tamales and the fish tacos which came with rice and black beans. The tamales were great-two to an order and big! The fish tacos were not the best I've ever had-but not bad either. Pretty standard fare. Although the sauce on top was pretty good. 
Service was prompt, although I don't think our waiter smiled once. I did like the layout of the place though. Even though we sat inside we were right by a large glass wall overlooking the duck pond.
