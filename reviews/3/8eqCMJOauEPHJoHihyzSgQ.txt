As you walk in immediately your mouth begins to salivate due the extraordinary aromas in the air from authentic Mexican food. Can there be any other place in suburban Green Valley that serves better Mexican food than this? Other than the food de mis primos there definitely has not been a place to match Vivas quality.  The food is absolutely delicious from enchiladas, to asadas, to burrito to fajitas, to pescados and everything in between. The alcoholic beverages are on point too especially the the preparada and the diverse flavors of margaritas. Overall the quality of customer service is good. The anticipation of the wait staff is comendable, before you are able to eat the last chip in your basket the waiter has already given you a new one with a new beans and salsa as well. The only thing I have to say I was dissapointed in was the fact that I told the hostess it was my girlfriends birthday. The hostess  had assured me that they were able to surprise her. It was probably my mistake for telling the hostess and not my waiter. The check came I paid the bill and there was no surprise. I thought for sure viva michoacan would have lived up to their word on this request but, unfortunately they failed me on this.
