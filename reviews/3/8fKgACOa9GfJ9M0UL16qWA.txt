I fiiiinally made it into Cafe Rio tonight. 

TLDR: Costa Vida is better.

I will say that they had a better drink selection and definitely deserve extra points for having crushed ice, but while the food was very similar to CV, it just didn't hit the spot for me like Costa does. 

The assembly line flow was a little rough, especially when it seemed as though they had more people back there working. At one point the employees started throwing tortilla dough at each other, glad mine was already on my plate.

Would I eat here again, yes - but not if it was between the two.
