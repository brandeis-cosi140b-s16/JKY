Joined a happy hour party here. This place was not my scene. I liked the feel of the restaurant with the big open walls to the outside. It's probably a better place for drinking then food. Had some seriously bad chicken, rubbery. Service replaced it quickly. My peeve is they bring these baby sized cups of chips out and your constantly having to ask for more chips which takes forever. It's not a total loss as a place to go. Drinks and appetizers are a great deal. Food wise there are other excellent Mexican restaurants in the valley better than this place. Still if your with friends and looking for a chill spot it's great for that. Brett Russo
