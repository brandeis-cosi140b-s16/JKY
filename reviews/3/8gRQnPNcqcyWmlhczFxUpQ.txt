I had a layover in PHX and this was near both of my gates.  It was late (9pm) so the menu was limited to only certain items, but the full bar was still available.  I had red sangria, but only one glass as it was way to sweet - ick!  Cheese quesadilla had like 4 cheeses and oozed . . . I got chicken and it was shredded.  Not much more in there.  The service was nothing special.  I wish I had gotten more guacamole than just on the side.  I also wish they had queso, but they didn't even if the menu wasn't limited.  They also have a to-go.  Enjoy!
