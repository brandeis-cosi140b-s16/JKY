Rio Rico is kind of a glorified taco stand. And I usually LOVE taco stands. Only Rico's has the prices of a fancy-smancy sit down restaurant. In Scottsdale. They had a cute patio but it smelled like the car exhast from the nearby AmPm. Our carne asada tacos were pretty tasty, but nothing to brag about. I'll stick to Guedo's or Elmer's.
