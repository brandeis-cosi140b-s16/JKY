I've been back 4 times since my initial visit, but today's lunch merits a star reduction, due to the underwhelming special tostada today, which was probably 50% imitation crab meat, instead of the promised variety on their special tostada.  The San Diego tostada was still delicious, but I will begrudge them the krab I reluctantly consumed.
