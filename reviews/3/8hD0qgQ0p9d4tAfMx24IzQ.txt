My roommate LOVES the shredded beef baja enchilada with extra baja sauce. The food wasn't bad, but it didn't exactly wow me either.

What did stand out was that the waiter refilled our waters regularly (which Ryan really appreciates). He also refilled our chips right before we even finished! Granted, it was slow in the restaurant, but I heard that the service was rather poor... so it was nice to see that today was an exception for us.
