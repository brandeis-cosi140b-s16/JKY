Yeah, there's a bunch of other Mexican restaurants in Vegas.  But this one is just convenient being inside Miracle Mile at Planet Hollywood.

Came in and there wasn't a line.  Got a steak bowl, guac on the side and some chips.  A bit pricey, but that's Chipotle everywhere.  Their prices are increasing.  Price you pay for farm-fresh food or whatever Chipotle buys without the extra bad stuff.

Really small dining area inside, but there are tables outside.  It's a great little meal if you're in a rush and get some food down before you do Vegas things like drink.
