Pretty good Mexican cuisine. I'm from San Antonio, so I have a peculiar taste for Tex-Mex food. Living in Madison, there really isn't much that stands out as fantastic but this place had its pros...

1.) steak milanesa was yummy
2.) staff was super sweet
3.) food was quick n hot
4.) margaritas were good and 2 for 1
5.) beans weren't from a can
6.) salsa was unique w/ a hint of cilantro
7.) rice was okay
8.) chicken enchiladas were good
9.) nice tables n chairs
10.) kid friendly

I would go back no question. :)
