Haha. Diego. Unfortunately this review may be based on the hype it got before we actually went to eat here... but it was seriously just OK for me. Im not huge on mexican food but it was better than usual for me (although thats not saying much).  The service was SLLLOOOWWW. We ordered guac and the guy came after an hour. The sangria was actually really good. I got Fish tacos which were really good... but then again after waiting for what seemed like at least 1.5 hrs for food anything in my face would have gotten devoured.  Might have been a bad night... so i'll give them some leeway and give em 3 stars... but it was a 2 star dinner.
