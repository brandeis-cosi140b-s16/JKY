i checked in here and it kept popping up on my yelp. i was like "I NEVER WENT THERE! HOW DARE YELP TELL ME OTHERWISE! YOU DON'T KNOW ME!" 

well, i went through some of the pictures and now i remember. i did pick up a to-go order. i had the green chile beef.

very different from other green chile i've had but it was good. obviously it was unmemorable or i have early stages of dementia. either or.
