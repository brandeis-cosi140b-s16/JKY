Pretty decent food considering good Mexican food in Madison is lacking. I would say the West side version has better food than the downtown restaurant.  The food is a little expensive, but again probably the best Mexican food you can find in downtown Madison.  The tortas, tostadas, and tacos are good. Sometimes the staff is a little crabby.
