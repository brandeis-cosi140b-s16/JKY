This is a good stop for travelers to grab cheap food and enjoy some drinks.  

They start off with a nice helping of chips and salsa.  The chips were an assortment of corn, fried dough like, and whole grain chips.  The salsa was nice and spicy, a great start.  We also ordered guacamole which was creamy and oniony.   

We came at the time the servers switched off and areas, so we had 3 different servers, but after we had our final server, he was courteous and took care of us.

I had the desert fire pasta which was a big helping of spicy, cheesy penne pasta with shrimp.  It was really salty but still thought it was still good overall.

My co-worker had the fish tacos which was a nice large platter with black beans.  The sangria was delicious and you could have a choice of white or red.
