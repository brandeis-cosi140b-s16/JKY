Stopped in for a little snack at about 3pm on Valentines Day...since my sister and I were each cooking dinner we knew this wouldn't ruin our "non-romantic" family meals. There was one other other couple in the enitre restaurant. My sister had obviously been there before since she grabbed menus and sat us in the bar right next to the roaring firplace. I was puzzled as it was a beautiful 60 something degree sunny afternoon. The waitress was very pleasant and chatty. She helped us decide what protein we wanted on our Mexican pizza appy. The chicken was a winner and it was great. The appy arrived super fast and HOT. My sister who isn't in the service industry touched the incredibly hot plate and burned her hand. In most other restaurants I have been warned that the plate is super hot. Being in the service industry that is a no brainer for me, however I can see why a consistent warning should be required for those that simply don't think about it. The chips and salsa were excellent. I enjoyed the hot sauce as well as the mild. The waitress brought us 2 mild and a hot to start. My sister asked for a second and  then a third (mild sauce). It never crossed the waitress' mind to ask if she wanted more chips with the mini  salsa buckets, (must have been weird to only me). We had iced teas for beverages which was definitely fresh brewed, sooo nice not to have cloudy.half.day.old tea. The environment was clean, the lone waitress was professional and did an average job with the exception of a chip refill/hot plate warning. Maybe it isn't their policy..not sure as this was my first visit. I will try it again and see how a dinner service runs.
