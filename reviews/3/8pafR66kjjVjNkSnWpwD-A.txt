Perfectly OK, no better.  Outdoor seating is a nice option when the weather's nice, but even with open tables we had to wait to be seated outside (there was no wait for indoor seats). They then seated a group who came in after us first.

You can order their menu items a la carte if you want to mix and match or don't want the sides.  I was disappointed that the only seafood options were fish and shrimp tacos. Would really have liked shrimp fajitas or enchiladas.  Although the slaw on the shrimp tacos is good, there's far too much of it and not enough shrimp.  The cheese enchiladas with red chile were far too salty, drowning out all other flavors.

Chips are great.
