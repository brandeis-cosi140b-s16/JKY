Decent enough El Cheapo Mex.. we grab dinner from time to time and its not great by any stretch of the imagination however in a pinch it'll do. The carne asada burrito is pretty good.. decent meat quality with good salty meaty flavor and plenty of pico de gallo.. good times! 

This has to be one of the lamest Yelps Ive written to date.. gawd, I'm so uninspired these days! I need some hot sauce splashed in my eye to make me hot and spicy again!
