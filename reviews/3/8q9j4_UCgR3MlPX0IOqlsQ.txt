Always saw signs for this restaurant, and decided to give it a try.  I will say that La Hacienda is a little hard to find, as it is apart of a mall. I thought the food was pretty good.  They had the best salsa of any Mexican place I've ever eaten at.  However, I think it was a little pricey.  I'm not sure if it's because they are hidden and they don't get much traffic so have to make up for it?  The service was friendly and prompt...I wish there was more restaurants like this in the South Hills.  I would go back.
