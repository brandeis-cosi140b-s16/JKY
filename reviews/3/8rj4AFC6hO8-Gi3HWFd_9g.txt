I visited Las Palmas on a Thursday night specifically to attend the free salsa dance lessons and after party.  This place is enormous and somewhat outdated in decor, but could possibly be a good place to host a reception or party for a big crowd because of its size, stage and dance floor.

Since we arrived early, we decided to order drinks and appetizers.  The nachos were satisfying, $8 for any meat choice - we had carne asada and it was very tasty and a large portion. We also had a shrimp ceviche cocktail - it had tons of shrimp and fresh avocado slices, and the tomato juice/sauce was so good that I would have drunk it down if no one was looking!  

Around 7:30pm the dance lesson began.  There were probably 80-100 people there, and it was a good friendly crowd.   The dance floor is so large that there was no problem for everyone to fit.  Throughout the evening, the DJ organized some dance games and contests, and I noticed that it was easy for people who arrived alone to join in and even be asked to dance in partner songs.  The music was heavy on the salsa, with a little merengue, bachata and cumbia.  It's also notable that this venue is totally smoke-free.  

I can imagine that this place would be a little dead during the day - even with the 100 people there when I visited, there were *tons* of open tables left.  It's just that big.  So my suggestion is to give it a try on a dance evening when the vibe will be more energetic, and you'll have a free show or a chance to get down if that's your thing.
