Met up with some people for happy hour and had an OK time. 

First the Good: Their happy hour is 7 days a week! And the usual free chips and salsa! The decor is appropriate and they have TVs for watching sports. 

The Bad: its kinda just the same greasy Mexican food that everyone else offers. And even though they were showing sports, they had a Hockey game on the speakers, the game ended and they still kept the sound on, so we heard the boring after show and then they let it run for some fixing up cars show that almost put me to sleep. And last, the service was very polite but not very attentive, we found ourselves asking for things like water multiple times. And we had an exact party of 6 so they added a gratuity and never told us about it, we are pretty good tippers but it's kinda irritating when you try to slip another one in. 

Overall I would only go back if I were meeting up with someone there, I have a Valle Luna even closer to me and its the same place pretty much so, I have that to look forward to.
