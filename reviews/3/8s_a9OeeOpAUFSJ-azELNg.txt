The food and drinks were good and the space is awesome. We had carne Asada tacos (good but expensive for what you get), nachos (delicious!), flautas, flan (I liked but my friends said it tasted too much like coffee), and churros. The restaurant is very open, great local art and spacious. There was also a good band there.

Unfortunately the service put a damper on our visit. The hostess and servers were rude and abrasive. The hostess slammed our menus down, rolled her eyes at us, and said she couldn't seat us without consulting with her manager. I asked the hostess for her name so I could speak with the manager--she yelled her name at me (Sydney) and a server came by to give me a death glare and a sarcastic comment to stick up for his friend. After I walked away I saw them gesturing towards me and obviously gossiping about me. It was very uncomfortable, very unprofessional, incredibly rude. Other servers rolled their eyes at us and took a long time to get us items we needed. I seriously felt like I was inconveniencing them each time I asked for something. 

The manager came by and was apologetic, gracious, and polite. He offered us dessert and took some items off our tab. I was impressed with his approach however his staff needs to get it together. I don't think I'll be back unless someone else really wants to go. There are too many good places with nice service!
