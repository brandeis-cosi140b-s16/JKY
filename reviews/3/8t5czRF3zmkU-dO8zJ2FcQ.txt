Based on recommendations from friends I decided to try Tony's Cafe for lunch today. The service was great and the staff was very pleasant. I ordered the Carne Asada plate and was disappointed with the steak. The flavor was great but the meat seemed overcooked. It was tough and difficult to cut especially across the grain even with a steak knife.
