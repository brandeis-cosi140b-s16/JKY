3 Stars is about right on the money for Rubio's.  Used to be better in my opinion when Fish Taco Tuesday was only $1 per taco.  I could feed my family like kings!  Now that they are $1.50 each we haven't been back really since.  Economy = SUCKS.

Whenever we end up at Red Rock Casino for date night the wifey and I often end up with a snack or a meal here.  It's probably one of the cheaper places in their food court to get a bite.  As much as I love Capriotti's and some Panda Express, sometimes a guy needs to watch his waistline.  Rubio's fits the bill nicely.  Get a healthy meal with some grilled fish, chicken, or steak, colorful veggies, and a wicked salsa bar.

The wifey likes her fish tacos, but sometimes will opt for the Pacific Mahi Mahi Burrito.  Mild fish, grilled with seasonings or blackened with spices, wrapped in a whole grain tortilla with fire-roasted corn, guacamole, Mexican rice, cilantro, onion, red and green cabbage, and creamy chipotle sauce.  Actually pretty good eats, very flavorful and definitely health-conscious.

I stick with the Burrito Especial with either steak or chicken.  Marinated meat, grilled, wrapped with guacamole, salsa fresca, sour cream, black beans, Mexican rice, and creamy chipotle sauce.  I usually add lettuce to mine and opt for a whole grain tortilla.  Not authentic Mexican, I know, but darn tasty!  

Each burrito or meal plate usually comes with a side of tortilla chips, perfect for taking advantage of Rubio's salsa bar!  Their signature salsas are all stellar.  I always take more than the usual amount of little plastic containers!  They usually have four salsas on the bar:

-Mild
-Tomatillo
-Roasted Chipotle
-Picante

Sometimes I guess depending on season one of the salsas will change.  Once they had a mango salsa, and another time they had a pineapple salsa.  My faves to go with are the tomatillo, and the roasted chipotle.  Complements any of their dishes great.  Also on the salsa bar is cilantro/onion mix, pickled jalapenos, limes, and lemons.  If you're a cheapie, just get yourself a serving of beans and rice, and top it off with everything from the salsa bar!  I've seen it done, and NO, it wasn't me.

Beware though, since this Rubio's is in a casino food court, prices can be a tad bit higher than one in your local neighborhood.  But it's still not too bad.  Our burritos came up to around $8-$9 each with chips and salsa bar included.  Not bad for a date night.

Get in, watch a movie, eat, then go ahead and lose the rest of your money to bingo or video poker!  I prefer CRAPS.
