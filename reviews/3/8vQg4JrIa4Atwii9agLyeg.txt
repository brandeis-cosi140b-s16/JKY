If I didn't have some specific dishes I wanted, I would give this place 4 stars.  The positives are that the place is authentic and the people are very friendly.  The tortillas are wonderful in the extreme.  What I didn't like is that they have no chips.  Who goes to a Mexican restaurant knowing there are no chips?  I would have brought my own.  Second is that they had no enchilada.

The asada was very tasty and the rice and beans were perfectly good but not memorable.  Still this place is much better than a standard Mexican chain.
