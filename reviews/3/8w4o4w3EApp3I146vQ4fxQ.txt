We came here based on the yelp reviews. The restaurant was clean, and the staff were very nice. There was nothing really remarkable one way or the other regarding the restaurant decor and set up. 

We ordered a cheese steak, cheese dog, and fries. The fries appeared to be frys brand crinkle cut frozen fries or something similar.  The dog had nacho cheese on it which was fine, but the dog itself had an odd flavor.  As for the steak and cheese there was not anything special about it. Based on the reviews I expected it would be great. Coming from back east and hearing that the cheeses steaks were similar I was excited.... unfortunately they don't hold a candle to the cheese steaks back east.... Overall the food did the job of ending our hunger, however I would not say we really felt satisfied. It was not bad, not good, just ok.

Some of the reviews mentioned the place is under new management so perhaps the food is not the same food as when the positive reviews came in? Either way I do not see us returning.  What a disappointment.
