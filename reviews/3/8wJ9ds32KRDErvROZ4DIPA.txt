The good part of the dining experience was the food.  It had a great flavor and there was plenty of it for the price. The bad part of the experience was the parking lot, the reservation that was made that they couldn't find (they were still able to accommodate us, but it was a little annoying)m the length of time to get our food and our server. She appeared at the table to take our order then we didn't see her again until the food arrived. Once it arrived, we didn't see her again until she brought the check. We could have dehydrated by the time she came back to refill our water glasses. 

The part that truly annoyed me was the tip was already on the bill when it was presented to us. The menu indicates it will be added for a party of eight, but we were a party of six. I assume that is the only way she would have gotten a decent tip because I certainly wouldn't have left her 20%. I doubt we will be back.
