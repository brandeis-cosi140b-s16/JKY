We ate here about 1 pm on Sunday, 7.27.14.
The food was good - I had the Quesarita... the queso was a bit cold but it was otherwise good.  The young guy who took our order had a great attitude and suggested menu items.  The guy who took our money (looked to be a manager because of shirt) had zero personality - not friendly.  The dining room was busy and pretty dirty.  There were splashes of drink or something on the wall/pictures beside of the booth we ate in; I will go back, but probably for take out.
