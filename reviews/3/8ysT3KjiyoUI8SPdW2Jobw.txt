We're being generous in giving 3 stars. The food quality relative to the prices would merit a 1.5 or 2, but we give extra for the friendly service. We recall dining here before and liking it a lot more before but we can't remember why. If your desperate for taco truck style you're in luck. However, just like there are differences between most trucks and GOOD trucks, this falls into the very average crowd.
