I didn't have a life changing experience like most people claim with my burro (rice, bean, & cheese) but I appreciate the fact that the hot carrots I ordered were actually hot and not watered down. I also ordered an horchata and the cashier handed me an empty cup and apparently I had to fill up my own ice then hand it back to her so she can fill it up? Thought that was a little weird.
