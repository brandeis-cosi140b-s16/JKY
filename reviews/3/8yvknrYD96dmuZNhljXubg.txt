Normally I would give any chipotle 4 to 5 stars, but today this location gets 3. They had 2 guys (who were new) working the front and they seemed lost and none of veteran staff were helping them out. Normally you are greeted when you get to the front, but not a word from anyone. Just awkward eye contact for 5 minutes. I actually witnessed one of the guys roll his very first burrito because he's so new. Would have been nice if somebody with experience was overseeing and correcting small mishaps instead of me helping them out with scoop sizes and what not. The new guys did pretty good just SUPER slow.
