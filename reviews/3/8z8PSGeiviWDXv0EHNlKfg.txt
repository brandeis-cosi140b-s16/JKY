OK...so I am waiting for Yelp to get into the half a star system so things aren't so cut in dry, I gave this place a 3 but it probably is more like  a two and a half star joint..

OK so my first day in Phoenix this was the first place I had ever eaten, a friend of mine took me there and afterword asked me how I liked my grilled cat;) in any event then this place was a dump, and I might of thought that he was serious about the fried cat in my burritos, now since that time this place has come quite a ways but not quite that far. 

As far as the drive thru goes it is super fast, and going inside is not suggested, it is a bit dirty and even when it looks clean you still have the feeling like your in a scene from Joe's apartment and the roaches are hiding around every corner and under every napkin holder waiting to jump up and start water skiing across your salsa dish. The food ranges on decent, I always end up with the carne asada burrito or super nachos which is enough for two people to say the least. 

 But I have had some bad experiences their two, where the burritos feel like they were dipped in beef water not good...or the nachos are so greasy that they eat through the Styrofoam container they are served in. 

The staff is friendly for the most part, and this place is ALWAYS open! 

This is my late night nothing else is open except jack in the crack I am hungry but not that hungry place to eat.

 I would have to say stay away from any place that has the word berto's in it which I think is Mexican for fireass, but in general this location is good enough for me to yelp about it, I would say yelp it at your own risk, but for after hour drunk food it will suffice.
