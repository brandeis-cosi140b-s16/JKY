The first thing to know is that parking here is a nightmare (as I stated in my check-in). I have an affinity for this type of food, so no matter how terrible the service is, I'll always be back.

This particular day I felt especially rushed. It's not like there were tons of people behind me, and even if there were, I can't understand or decide what I want on my burrito with the intense stare-down from behind the counter. You have to know what you like at this place, pretty much all over, in order to be a "good" customer to them.

I like Chipotle as a "fast food" place because of its commitment to the environment--love that they don't use antibiotics on their chickens. Using organic ingredients when they can, it's nice to know at the very least what kind of food you're putting in your mouth if not where it comes from. 

Even though this isn't the best Chipotle I have ever visited, it's close by and a good fix for the Mexican grill craving!
