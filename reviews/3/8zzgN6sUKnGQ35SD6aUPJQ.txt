Is the food good? No. Is the service good? Actually, yes. On Monday night my 3 friends and I had several margaritas (because they're 1/2 off!!) and dinner there. The bartender was very nice and the drink was appropriately strong, and the table waiter was also very pleasant to 4 of us. The place was not that happening on this particular night  - I think it's partly because of the holiday emptiness the college town experiences + ultra cold night - so no body was kicking us out of the door in hurry. We stayed and chatted long after taking care of the bills, and they didn't seem to care. 

Has the food been authentic or anything close to that, the dining experience would have been a bit more pleasurable on palate, but over all, not too much to complain about.
