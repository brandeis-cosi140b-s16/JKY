I wanted to love you but we will just be friends. It's not you...it's me....well kind of.

Others have commented on location....honestly the best food I have ever had is typically in the worst area or primitive location in the world. I expected a place like this who only serves breakfast and lunch that breakfast should be ...well ....on point. 

Everything was going great....until I saw the country gravy was NOT homemade....cardinal sin. What true American diner prides itself in instant gravy?  My little ones waffle was beautiful. Omelets were a little overdone but acceptable.  

Crumbs in the booth, dirty windows. Servers were attentive.
