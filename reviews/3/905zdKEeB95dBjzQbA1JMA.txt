I think the food is very tasty and the restaurant is very unique.  The influence of the Chipotle chain is obvious.  I liked my meal, but I probably won't come back because it is too expensive for what you get.  There's just not enough filling in the enchiladas, or it needs to come with a side of rice and beans included.  I had no problem with service and parking.  If it weren't for the price and/or portion size, this would definitely be my new favorite restaurant!
