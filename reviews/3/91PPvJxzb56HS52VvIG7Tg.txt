Had been wanting to try this place for a while since I was told the new owners were from New Mexico and looking to bring back the Quality of the food. 
Was seated very quickly by a very nice cute hostess. Soon our server was over to explain about the Chips n Salsa bar plus take drink orders. They bring you a round of chips n salsa but you are welcome to self serve at the chips bar as much as you like and with a few other salsa, i personally liked the style of chips and salsas were ok. 
For dinner I ordered the 4 Taco Combo w/ corn tortillas, gf ordered stuffed sopapillas which she said were all ok. 
My taco combo was relatively good and tasty, i was not a fan of the beef version though, it just tasted too much seasoning or something, but the Steak, Chicken, and the cheese tacos were on! Rice was ok. 
I also ordered the Steak nachos as appetizers and overall they were ok, lacked a little in the cheese, lettuce/tomato toppings as well as short on sour cream but the steak was good and proportioned well. 
Drink were there margaritas which were great and well recommended in any of there choices. 
Did not order desert as they bring you warm Sopapillas and honey which are amazing in itself! Completely stuffed after this. 
Overall our service was great and was well checked on in a decently busy restaurant. The manager also stopped by table to check on anything, nice. 
I would certainly go back for drinks and chips n salsa and one more try on a different entree which may change my 3 Stars. Until then... 3 it is
