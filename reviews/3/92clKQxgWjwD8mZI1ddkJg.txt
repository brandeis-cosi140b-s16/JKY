The food is great....The service is horrible lately.  I miss the old staff. My order was so messed up today,  I just walked out and went across the street to Taco Bell. 

I have been there so much,  I earned a free meal,  I left it all at the counter,  based on the customer service.  I will get my free meal and never patronize them again.
