We arrived at 11am to an empty restaurant, not a good sign. We ordered tacos, 4 different kinds to get a good feel for the food here. While deliciously seasoned, the two tiny tacos were hardly worth $9 a plate. 

As a side note, the carne asana meat was very fatty, not trimmed well at all. I can't stand big chunks of meat fat in my food so I left most of the meat on my plate.

Meanwhile the waiter brought me the wrong beer. I didn't notice until he left, so I sipped on it for a while. By the time I was offered a replacement beer, I was 3/4 of the way through the beer and finished with the tacos.  I'm not a 2 beer at lunch sort of girl so I declined a second one. I wasn't comped for the mistake at all, just got a 'sorry' from the waiter.

Overall, once is enough. Won't be back to this restaurant.
