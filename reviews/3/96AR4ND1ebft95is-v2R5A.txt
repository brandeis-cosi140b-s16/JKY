Cheap beer great chicken and pork. They have a great $2 menu that is avalible all week including weekends. The pork here is great and so is the chicken. I would not go with the steak. Free chips and salsa, you cant beat that and you get your own so no waiting for the busy waitress to get them for you. Great margaritas and the beer is cheap. This is a great place to go and get a good for the money meal and a drink. Try the Baja Sticks!
