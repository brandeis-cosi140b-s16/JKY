Well if you check and read my last review, I gave Dons a 5 star rating, but now I have to edit that.  Just to refresh I have been eating there since it opened.  Of course it was closed 3 years and I was glad it reopened.  Now to be honest there are other things to be considered when you choose to spend your money so Ill get right to the heart of why Im pissed off.  I put up with the lousy decor and an occassional spring in my ass and that they have not changed anything in 30+ years,, But that was all cool cause the prices were good and so was the food, but in 9 months they have raised their price 20 percent, why?  Those booths tables and everything in there has not changed in at least 25 years.  You see they think they have got the market cornered, so plain and simple its GREED.  Part of the alure of Dons was the good deal!  Who do the think they are,  Macayos,  Manuels, Ajo Als,  These are nice place with ambiance.  Dons is a dump, (have you gone to the restroom, it smells in there cause they have done nothing in years).  The new owners just are charging what the market will bear and if your all cool with that good for you, but I'm (at my age) tired of bending over and grabbing the ankles and Those new owners can Kiss my rosy backside.  Thanks for reading and for the few real people that get where I'm comin from I appreciat the hell out of you.  And thats  "THE TRUTH FROM THE TRUTH"  CIAU
