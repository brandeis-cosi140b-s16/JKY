Did not expect it to be a fast food restaurant but it is.  Their fish tacos are spicy and pretty good.  Their regular tacos are good and made with homemade tortillas.  The salsa bar has a good verity and a lot of didn't spice.  The quesadillas are enough to feed you entire family!  It comes in a freaking pizza box.  lol
